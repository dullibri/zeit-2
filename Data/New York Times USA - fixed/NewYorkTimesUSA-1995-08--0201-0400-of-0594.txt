HEADLINE: Semiconductor Order Index Hit a High in July

BYLINE: By LAWRENCE M. FISHER 

DATELINE: SAN FRANCISCO, Aug. 10

 BODY:
The semiconductor industry displayed unexpected strength today, as its leading indicator reached an all-time high in July, driven primarily by a big increase in orders.
The Semiconductor Industry Association, a trade group based in San Jose, Calif., reported a book-to-bill ratio of 1.22, setting a new record and exceeding the 1.20 mark set in May. 
 The book-to-bill ratio compares orders with shipments: a number above one indicates positive growth, and a ratio of 1.22 indicates that for every $100 of chips shipped during the month, $122 of chips were ordered.
The closely watched book-to-bill ratio was reported after the stock market closed, but it exceeded Wall Street's consensus estimate of 1.17.
Some analysts predicted that this new sign of strength was likely to send technology stocks even higher. Others cautioned, however, that the rising orders behind July's book-to-bill ratio probably reflected the fact that many computer manufacturers were increasing their chip inventories ahead of the Aug. 24 introduction of the Microsoft Corporation's Windows 95 operating system.
"I think there's a lot of double-ordering going on," said Michael Murphy, editor of The California Technology Stock Letter. "People don't want to get caught short in case Windows 95 prompts a huge demand" for computers.
"People are willing to carry a lot more inventory on their shelves and place orders out a lot further," he added, noting that the book-to-bill ratio did not indicate when semiconductor orders would be shipped.
But Rajiv Chaudhri, an analyst with Goldman, Sachs & Company, said the July book-to-bill ratio included orders that were too far in advance to reflect the introduction of Windows 95.
"I think Windows 95, if anything, would cause people to delay their purchasing decisions," he said. "In the near term, the impact of Windows 95 would probably be negative. But, coming out when it does, Windows 95 really does set us up for a very strong fourth quarter." The industry fundamentals remain strong."
Chip orders rose to $4.46 billion in July, up 3 percent from $4.33 billion in June, and up 52.7 percent from $2.92 billion in July 1994. July shipments also reached a new high, at $3.67 billion, although this was only a four-tenths of 1 percent increase from $3.66 billion in June. July 1995 shipments were up 35.8 percent from $2.70 billion in July 1994.

Chip Maker Expands Plant

 
 SANTA CLARA, Calif. Aug. 10 (Bloomberg Business News) -- The National Semiconductor Corporation said today that it would spend $300 million to expand its Arlington, Tex., manufacturing plant, to keep up with the demand for its products. The chip maker said the expansion would create 400 jobs. The plant employs 1,150 people. Applications for the integrated circuits produced in Arlington include personal computers and telephones, as well as computer networking and telecommunications equipment. The Arlington plant also has a customer support center and a telecommunications center.

HEADLINE: Little Inflation Seen as Producer Prices Are Flat

BYLINE: By KEITH BRADSHER 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Aug. 10

 BODY:
Inflation was virtually imperceptible again at the producer level in July, and new claims for unemployment benefits stayed fairly low last week, the Labor Department announced today.
The reports provided further evidence that the Federal Reserve was meeting its goal of restraining price increases without setting off a recession. 
 Most prices charged by factories, farmers and other producers for finished goods were little changed last month, while falling prices for gasoline and home heating oil offset rising prices for food.
"Inflation has been tamed and the economy, which stagnated in the second quarter, is picking up in the second half," said Rosanne M. Cahn, chief economist for stocks at CS First Boston.
The Producer Price Index for finished goods was unchanged in July and rose only two-tenths of 1 percent when food and energy prices were excluded, the Labor Department said. The index fell by a tenth of a percentage point in June and was unchanged in May.
The slower pace of price increases is already making a difference for businesses across the country. For example, the Dalzell Corporation, which produces handmade glass candleholders, stemware and plates in New Martinsville, W. Va., has benefited from fairly stable prices this summer for sand, an important raw material for glass.
But with relatively little inflation, companies have also found it difficult in recent months to pass along price increases for other materials, like cardboard for shipping boxes. "We've had to, on a competitive basis, either hold prices or discount prices to some customers," said Kenneth B. Dalzell, the company's president.
For Alan Greenspan, the Federal Reserve chairman, the latest inflation figures could indicate new latitude to reduce short-term interest rates. But Wall Street analysts are skeptical that the central bank's officials will do so at their next meeting, on Aug. 22.
"They have conditions right the way they want them, so why should they change anything?" asked Eugene J. Sherman, director of research at M. A. Schapiro & Company, a New York brokerage firm.
Consumer prices could still bounce up a little because of wholesale price increases earlier this year; the Labor Department is scheduled to announce on Friday morning how much these prices rose in July. But Government and private economists were particularly encouraged by the index for raw materials, like grain and iron ore, which fell by eight-tenths of 1 percent in July. The index for goods used in intermediate stages of industrial processes, like flour and steel, was also unchanged last month.
"Inflation at the crude and intermediate level has abated in the last three months, which bodes well for overall inflation for the rest of the year," said Martin N. Baily, a member of President Clinton's Council of Economic Advisers.
Higher prices for raw materials and intermediate goods can lead eventually to higher consumer prices, particularly if other business costs, like wages and salaries for employees, also rise. But over the last year, businesses have been unusually successful in restraining the growth in employee compensation to less than the increase in workers' output, helping businesses to hold down the prices they charge to consumers.
For example, Griffith Rubber Mills Inc., a producer of truck windshield gaskets and other products, reduced the size of its administrative staff as prices rose until recently for ethylene, a natural gas product that is a key raw material for synthetic rubber. With customers refusing to pay higher prices, Griffith Rubber Mills also tried to cut costs by changing production schedules to match daylight hours.
"You don't have to have the lights on as much," said Scot H. Laney, the president of the company, which is based in Portland, Ore. But business conditions are improving, he added, because ethylene prices have leveled off in the last three months.
Gasoline prices fell 10.1 percent in July while home-heating-oil prices dropped 2.2 percent. But fresh fruit prices rose 3.8 percent, processed chicken prices climbed 4 percent and fish and shellfish prices increased 2.9 percent.
The Labor Department's index for consumer goods other than food and energy crept up two-tenths of 1 percent for a second consecutive month, led by price increases for soap, books and newspapers.
Capital equipment prices were up just one-tenth of 1 percent in July, as falling prices for light trucks and paper-industry machinery nearly balanced price increases for heavy trucks, agricultural and oilfield machinery, civilian aircraft and machine tools.
In another report, the Labor Department said initial claims for unemployment compensation rose 14,000 last week, to a seasonally adjusted 335,000.
The increase was the first in three weeks, but new jobless claims remained relatively low compared with levels reached in early July. Indeed, the four-week moving average for jobless claims, considered a more accurate gauge of the job market, fell last week to 361,000, the lowest level since May 6.
Last week, the Labor Department reported that the unemployment rate rose in July to 5.7 percent, from 5.6.
Still, economists seem confident that the economy will continue to grow with minimal inflation. A monthly survey of 52 blue-chip corporate and academic economists, released today by Eggert Economic Enterprises Inc. in Sedona, Ariz., showed that the consensus forecast for growth in the third quarter of this year had edged up to 2.1 percent from a 2.0 percent forecast in a July survey, while the consensus forecast for fourth-quarter growth was 2.7 percent, up from 2.6 percent in July.
The consensus for consumer price inflation this year was unchanged at 3.1 percent.

HEADLINE: The Latest Big Boom: Citizenship

BYLINE: By SETH MYDANS 

DATELINE: LOS ANGELES, Aug. 10

 BODY:
Doing their part in the greatest rush for citizenship in the nation's history, student volunteers are setting out almost every weekend in the Hispanic neighborhoods of this city to fingerprint their immigrant elders, take photographs of them and guide them carefully through Form N-400, Application for Naturalization.
The forms, once completed, become part of a surge of citizenship applications that have poured into the Immigration and Naturalization Service in the last year or so, many from people who lived in the United States for years or even decades before giving citizenship much thought. 
 "We are seeing record numbers of naturalization applications," said Virginia Kice, a spokeswoman for the immigration service in California. "April was the peak, with 2,200 a day in Los Angeles, and the numbers are still high."
Records are being set all over the country, said an I.N.S. spokesman in Washington, Rudolph Brewington. In the nine months through June, nearly 715,000 people applied for citizenship, a 78 percent increase over the corresponding period a year earlier. Mr. Brewington said Congress had approved the hiring of 1,000 new I.N.S. employees to help process the applications.
Several factors are feeding the surge, according to immigration officials and immigrant rights groups alike.
One is sheer numbers: Nearly three million undocumented aliens who were granted amnesty and legal residence under the 1986 immigration reform law are now becoming eligible to proceed with applications for citizenship.
Another is fear: Anti-immigration sentiment, as demonstrated by Proposition 187 in California and Federal legislative proposals, threatens to deprive noncitizens of education, all but emergency health care and other services.
Further, the Mexican Government is preparing to adopt a constitutional amendment that would remove both economic and emotional obstacles to a change in citizenship among Mexicans, by far the majority of California's immigrant population.
The proposed amendment, which is expected to gain legislative approval next month and ratification by the states within a year or so, would change the law to allow Mexicans to retain their property rights, as well as a nonvoting cultural Mexican "nationality," while taking foreign citizenship.
"It is important that they understand that they are becoming citizens of this country but that they keep their cultural Mexican roots," said Jose Angel Pescador, Mexico's consul general in Los Angeles. "People were afraid of being ashamed in Mexico because they changed their nationality. Now they will not change their nationality."
Indeed, among people at a "citizenship fair" at Belmont High School in downtown Los Angeles last weekend, the cultural issue seemed to weigh much heavier than the matter of property rights.
"There's always been rumors in the immigrant community that when you become a United States citizen, people will ask you to spit on the Mexican flag or step on the flag," said Arturo Vargas, executive director of the fair's sponsor, the National Association of Latino Elected and Appointed Officials. "These were rumors that people actually believed."
For whatever reasons, Mexicans have traditionally been among the slowest immigrant groups to apply for citizenship. An immigration service study in 1992 showed that just 17 percent of Mexicans who entered the country legally in 1977 had sought to become citizens since, compared with 63 percent of immigrants from the Soviet Union, the group with the highest figure.
Now the amnesty program, anti-immigration sentiment and the Mexican Government's assurances have contributed to a shift in attitudes in the city's vast Mexican community, several Hispanic leaders agreed.
"There's even peer pressure," Mr. Vargas said. " 'Why, you haven't become a citizen yet? What's your problem? What are you waiting for?' This is something I've never seen before, and I grew up in L.A. You'll be talking politics, and someone will say, 'I can't vote,' and it's like, 'What?' "
Antonia Hernandez, president of the Mexican-American Legal Defense and Educational Fund, said political and economic changes both here and in Mexico seemed to have contributed to a social awakening among Mexican immigrants.
"People who have been here 20 years will tell you, 'I'm becoming a citizen,' " she said. " 'I want to vote. I want to vote against Pete Wilson. I want to be heard.' "
Among many immigrants, Governor Wilson is the personification of Proposition 187 and of what they see as a political trend in which immigrants are blamed for the state's problems.
But beyond that, Ms. Hernandez said, a Hispanic voting bloc is harder to define. Republicans claim it, arguing that Hispanic people have strong family values consistent with Republican principles. But the Hispanic vote has traditionally been largely Democratic, a result, Ms. Hernandez said, of a prevailing sentiment that government should be actively involved in promoting the common good.
At the citizenship fair at Belmont High School last weekend, Manuel Jasso, now a 37-year-old telecommunications engineer, said he first came to the United States from Mexico as an illegal worker in 1982 and had not considered citizenship till now.
But so long away from a native land changes a person, Mr. Jasso said. "When you go back, you feel lonely, you feel like a stranger," he said. "You go back to a street that was a two-way street, and suddenly it's one-way. And you realize, 'I don't belong here.' "
Dora Monzon, 40, who sews jumpsuits for race-car drivers for a living, first came here, illegally, in 1969. She obtained legal residency five years ago under the amnesty program. She has not visited Mexico since 1976.
"In my heart, I am Mexican," she said. "I come from there. But my children are here, and for that I have to be an American citizen."
Paula Gomez, an American-born high school student who was helping Ms. Monzon with her application, is a daughter of Mexican immigrants, both of whom, like many Mexicans here, continue to resist citizenship.
"I see myself as more modern-thinking than my parents," Miss Gomez said. "Like, my father is very macho and I am extremely feminist, and I don't put up with his macho stuff.
"When he says these things, I just let loose on him. 'You're a girl, and you're supposed to stay at home and make dinner,' and I'm like, 'Oh, dad, I'm going to college and be a lawyer and be a prosecutor like Marcia Clark, only more professional and not so emotional.' "

Good News for The City

BYLINE: By BOB HERBERT 

 BODY:
New York is a tough town to live in. I've often gone in search of a legal parking space late at night and ended up so far from my apartment I had to take a subway or a taxi home.
The weather is wicked. There are only about a dozen really beautiful days each year. 
 The noise is ceaseless. Jackhammers. Sirens. Screaming neighbors. Traffic. Sporadic gunfire.
Crossing a street can resemble Russian roulette. Buses, trucks, bicyclists, Rollerbladers -- all coming at you.
You get used to it. It's not as bad as combat.
The flip side is that when good things happen in New York, the tendency is to savor them a bit more than is usual. A man sneezed in a bodega the other day, and when a stranger said, "God bless you," a huge smile creased the face of the surprised sneezer and he couldn't stop saying thank you.
Like almost everything else, a simple kindness plays bigger in New York.
Right now there is quite a bit to savor in the city; some very good things are happening. So good, in fact, that the skeptics -- traumatized by decades of bad news -- are looking warily about for hidden explanations that might turn the good news upside down.
Let's start with crime. It appears to be plummeting. Compared with the first six months of last year, homicides are down by a third. If the trend continues through December, New York will record the fewest homicides in 25 years.
There are a lot of New Yorkers currently walking around who, if the old trends had held, would have been dispatched to their reward by now. You may know some of them. You may be one of them.
In 1990 there were 2,245 homicides in New York, a record. (The total included 87 people who were killed in an arson fire at the Happy Land club in the Bronx.) In the first six months of this year, there were fewer than 600 homicides. By the end of the year, the Police Department expects to record the lowest number of homicides since 1970, when John Lindsay was Mayor, Nelson Rockefeller was Governor and 1,117 people were killed in New York City.
All other serious crimes have declined sharply as well, with the exception of forcible rape, which is down only slightly from last year.
The blessing of a substantially reduced crime rate is due in large part to the hiring of 7,000 additional police officers since 1990 -- a legacy of the Dinkins administration -- and the much more aggressive and sophisticated approach to policing that has been put in place by Mayor Rudolph Giuliani and Police Commissioner William Bratton.
The potential political payoff is huge. If the crime numbers continue their precipitous fall, no one will be able to beat Mr. Giuliani when he comes up for re-election in 1997.
The other good news for New York City has to do with the academic performance of the public schools. Math and reading scores are up in every district and Schools Chancellor Ramon Cortines is likely to reveal soon that there has been an encouraging response to his imposition of more stringent science and math requirements in the high schools.
It is very difficult to overstate the benefits to a big city of reduced crime and improved public school performance. If the improvements in New York are sustained, they will dramatically enhance the social and economic life of the city. A very tough town will become a lot more attractive and somewhat easier to deal with.
The irony for New Yorkers is that the two men most responsible for the improvements -- Mr. Cortines and Mr. Bratton -- have both had troubled relations with Mr. Giuliani. Mr. Cortines, belittled and repeatedly assailed by the Mayor, has already announced he is leaving as chancellor. Mr. Bratton, a very proud man who was forced by Mr. Giuliani to adopt a much lower public profile, insists that everything is fine now. Nevertheless, it is widely believed that he will depart as Police Commissioner sooner rather than later.
Mr. Cortines and Mr. Bratton are both popular. What happens if they move on and their replacements are unable to build upon, or even maintain, their successes? The disappointment will be palpable. The impact on the city could be tragic. And questions will be raised that Mayor Giuliani may have a tough time answering.

HEADLINE: On My Mind;
What Is China Up To?

BYLINE: By A. M. ROSENTHAL 

 BODY:
The United States is conspiring to undermine China politically, economically and militarily. It plots to tear Taiwan from China, to stunt Chinese military growth and economic power, and leads a world campaign to punish Beijing for human rights violations.
These accusations are made constantly now by China's Communist rulers. From their mouths to God's ear. But all this is not only untrue but the deliberate reversal of reality. 
 Economically, U.S. policy enriches Beijing. Militarily, it strengthens China's army and national police apparatus. It is also excellent for Chinese family values. From the family chief to the youngest grandson, elite Chinese Communist families swagger with riches from exports to the U.S. of businesses controlled by the party or the army.
The Clinton Administration did cross Beijing, once. Under Congressional pressure, it allowed Taiwan's President to attend an alumni meeting in the U.S. Ever since, exhausted by its spasm of imposed courage, the Administration chants obediently that it will never question that Taiwan must remain part of China.
And China and the U.S. both know that since Mr. Clinton reneged on his promise to use tariff pressure to persuade Beijing to improve human rights a mite, the U.S. cannot do more than look wan when the subject comes up.
But Americans in officialdom, academia, journalism and business, knowing how the U.S. plumps up China, pay humble attention to Beijing's propaganda about The American Threat. China's "conspiracy" blackmail is already paying off in American timidity.
Beijing is echoing the anti-U.S. propaganda campaigns other dictatorships found ominously useful. Hitler screamed about the American danger; so did Saddam Hussein and the ayatollahs. To listen to the Japanese in the late 30's, the U.S. was about to sneak-bomb the Japanese Navy. Stalin put two prices on friendship with America: Siberia, or death.
But at least then there were Americans in public life who understood that the anti-American drives were often the prelude to something extremely unpleasant, a signal of aggression in preparation. They tried to warn other Americans what the charges concealed -- or revealed.
Those Chinese who risk their lives struggling against the Beijing despotism know the reason that the fear-America line is being concocted.
The Politburo and Army want to make sure right now that when Deng Xiaoping dies, the people of China do not believe, act or speak under any illusion that the new government will move into an era of freedom.
And in Beijing, as in other dictatorships, the rash of leaks and threats about how Americans plot to destroy the homeland is not meant simply to be heard abroad. It is meant to be interpreted in China that unapproved association with Americans today can once again be paid for tomorrow with prison or death.
The line about a U.S. military danger to China is particularly important. When dictatorships continuously warn their countrymen about a challenge to sovereignty -- like supporting Taiwanese or Tibetan freedom -- that's when to start worrying that they are cooking up a military or political offensive themselves.
Yet generally the American printed and diplomatic reaction to the Chinese charges is not that they amount to dangerous, pre-emptive fear-mongering but that top Chinese officialdom really deeply worries about an American conspiracy. The lesson preached then is that Washington should pay even more attention to Beijing's sensitivities.
Chinese leaders would be idiots to believe their own charges. China's gulag wardens are thick in the head -- their jobs demand it. But Politburo leaders are as intelligent as Western leaders, at least.
Beijing knows better. While the U.S. tries desperately to create "constructive engagement" with them, the Communists break agreements to halt slave-labor exports and stop missile sales. While the U.S. gives the Communists maximum economic advantage, they arrest more dissidents. With clear intent and exquisite aim Beijing keeps spitting in Washington's humble eye. Then it demands apologies.
The real question facing Americans is not what we should do to placate the Chinese Communists further. It is: What are these boys up to now?

HEADLINE: Join the Women in Beijing

 BODY:
Early next month as many as 50,000 people from around the world will go to Beijing to attend the United Nations' Fourth World Conference on Women and a parallel gathering of grass-roots women's organizations. The two meetings will discuss subjects like women's access to health care and education, their role in economic development and politics and problems such as family violence and abuse of human rights.
These issues matter deeply to Americans, and many have been special concerns of the Clinton Administration. The United States should be a conspicuous participant at the Beijing conference, with the First Lady, Hillary Rodham Clinton, leading the official delegation. 
 China's leaders, fearing free discussion of their own repressive policies, have done everything they can to damage the conference's credibility and divert attention from its women's rights agenda. Betraying its host-country responsibilities, China has arbitrarily excluded participants from Taiwan and Tibet, restricted press coverage and exiled the grass-roots meeting to a remote site more than 30 miles from the main conference. It has also placed obstacles like complex special visa requirements in the path of third-world women of limited means who have been saving up for months to attend the meeting.
A number of these issues remain under negotiation, but few now expect China to live up to its pledges of a conference open to all legitimate participants. This week Beijing began using the conference as a pretext for a new roundup of dissenting intellectuals and activists.
It is tempting to consider boycotting the conference to protest China's behavior, its forced abortion and sterilization policies and its detention of an American citizen and human rights activist, Harry Wu.
But United States participation in the world women's conference is not a favor to China. It is a show of respect and support for the efforts of women in this country and around the world. On almost all the issues scheduled for discussion, Washington figures to be a powerful ally of those favoring women's political, economic and human rights. If the official American delegation stayed home, the cause of women's freedom would be weakened, not strengthened.
The same reasoning argues for sending the most high-powered delegation possible. Mrs. Clinton is an especially articulate advocate on these issues. Her presence would enhance the visibility and authority of the American delegation. It could also help thwart Chinese attempts to restrict press coverage and exclude unwelcome voices.
Obviously, the White House cannot agree to any conditions on her attendance that would undermine larger United States policies toward China. She should not, for example, hold meetings with top Chinese leaders while Harry Wu remains in jail. But Washington's differences with Beijing should not be taken out on the women from around the world who have invested their hopes in this important international conference. Nor should they be a reason for abandoning China's more than 500 million women.
It would only hand a quiet victory to China's repressors for the strongest advocates of women's liberty to stay away from Beijing. The United States should be there in force and in full voice.

HEADLINE: CURRENCY MARKETS;
Dollar Rises to Recent Highs Against the Mark and the Yen

BYLINE: By Bloomberg Business News 

 BODY:
The dollar rose to a two-month high against the German mark and to a five-month high against the Japanese yen yesterday, bolstered by expectations of a cut next month in German interest rates and a successful United States Treasury auction.
"Sentiment is bullish for the dollar," said Belal Khan, chief customer dealer at Bank of Tokyo in New York. 
 But the rally in the dollar was surprising, given that the German central bank left key interest rates unchanged at a policy meeting yesterday. And while the Treasury's auction of $11.5 billion of 30-year bonds went well yesterday, buying by Japanese investors did not live up to the market's expectations, analysts said.
Still, the dollar rose as high as 1.4240 marks, its highest level since June 2, when it touched 1.4242 marks, before settling at 1.4192 marks in late New York trading, up from 1.4063 on Wednesday. The dollar also reached 92.94 yen, its highest level since March 7, when it rose to 93.03. It settled yesterday at 92.63 yen, up from 91.63 on Wednesday.
The American currency's recent strength against the mark derives from expectations that the Bundesbank will soon cut interest rates. Lower German rates would hurt the mark by making investments denominated in it less attractive.
While the Bundesbank took no action to cut its discount and Lombard rates yesterday, traders and analysts said the German economy was slowing fast enough to push the central bank to lower its discount rate soon.
"People are looking for a discount-rate cut in September," said David Gilmore, a partner at Foreign Exchange Analytics, a consulting firm. The Bundesbank last cut the discount rate, the floor for German money market rates, on March 30 by half a percentage point, to 4 percent.
The dollar was also helped yesterday by the results of the United States Treasury's third and final auction of $42.5 billion in securities. While Japanese interest was not as keen as had been hoped yesterday, strong demand for American assets typically indicates that more foreign investors will need to buy dollars to participate.
Traders have been bullish on the dollar against the yen since Tokyo announced a program last week to encourage Japanese to invest abroad. "There is a widespread belief that the dollar has bottomed," said Betsy Reetz, manager of institutional currency sales at National Westminster Bank in New York.

HEADLINE: AT THE MET AND THE MODERN WITH: Richard Serra;
One Provocateur Inspired by Another

SERIES: A periodic series of talks with artists about art in New York City museums.

BYLINE: By MICHAEL KIMMELMAN 

 BODY:
THE sculptor Richard Serra, intense and determined, as always, is moving headlong through the Metropolitan Museum of Art. He wants to see Jackson Pollock's big drip painting of 1950, "Autumn Rhythm," and then more Pollocks at the Museum of Modern Art. He doesn't plan to be distracted. "When I come here," he says, "I look at one thing, and then leave."
Navigating the dense crowds in the Met ("a big unwieldy ship," he calls it), Mr. Serra, who is 55, remembers bringing his students from the School of Visual Arts here in the late 60's and early 70's: "We would decide, arbitrarily, to see Room 34, or whatever. We would walk around it for five or six minutes, take a vote about which work in it we liked the best, then stand in front of the work and clap. The exercise forced the students to visit rooms they probably would never have gone to otherwise. At the same time, the clapping broke the sanctity of the museum, which I think was good, and it returned students to the joy of looking and making distinctions." 
 Since Mr. Serra came onto the scene in those years, with works made of torn and bent rubber, and with lead that he splashed, rolled or propped up in big sheets one against another, he has emerged as a major artist, probably the most original and significant sculptor of his generation, certainly the most provocative. Many Americans know him for "Tilted Arc," the 120-foot-long, 12-foot-high slab of curved steel installed in 1981 at Federal Plaza in lower Manhattan, which caused a furious debate about public sculpture; the debate continued to rage even after the work was removed in 1989, over widespread objections by artists and many others, and to Mr. Serra's profound regret.
Opponents of "Tilted Arc" attacked it as aggressive, austere and obdurate, qualities some commentators likened to Mr. Serra's personality. But the criticisms of the sculpture were as skewed as the criticisms of Mr. Serra. He is fiercely intelligent, opinionated and articulate, and in conversation may talk straight over you to make his point. At the same time, he enjoys debate and can be solicitous and warm. The pleasure he takes in looking at art is palpable, contagious. And he's not unbending.
For example, arriving at the room in the 20th-century galleries with "Autumn Rhythm," he permits himself to be distracted by another, earlier Pollock nearby, "Pasiphae," of 1943. It is a dense abstraction of a recumbent figure flanked, or guarded, by standing figures.
"It's watered-down Picasso," Mr. Serra decides. "The issue at the time was: How do we Americans break with European tradition and get away from post-Cubism? And this painting falls back on the usual set-up for a traditional painting. Its brutishness doesn't sustain it. It's clumsily drawn. It's neither fish nor fowl: a mishmash of bad figuration coupled with an abstract surface patterning that Pollock half-digested from Picasso's 'Girl Before a Mirror.' " He is referring to the 1932 Picasso in the Modern's collection, with its mirrored image of a woman set against a brilliant patterned backdrop.
Mr. Serra turns from "Pasiphae" to "Autumn Rhythm." "Here the notion of patterning is gone," he says. "Pollock has rid himself of figuration, meaning lines that enclose or contain or describe shapes. He put his canvases on the floor, came at them from all sides, throwing and pouring paint, hitting the canvas with sticks, letting gravity take over the splatters. His renunciation of the brush means you can't apply the standard criteria. We evaluate artists by how much they are able to rid themselves of convention, to change history. I don't know of anyone since Pollock who has altered the form or the language of painting as much as he did. And that was, what, almost half a century ago?"
Mr. Serra goes on: "He had to have remarkable faith that the process would lead to fully realized statements. After all, he didn't know where he would end up when he started. With a painting like 'Pasiphae,' it's obvious that there was an original intention. But with 'Autumn Rhythm,' Pollock allowed the form to emerge out of the materials and out of the process. For me, as a student, this idea of allowing the form to emerge out of the process was incredibly important."
 
In Paris With Philip Glass
 Mr. Serra was born in San Francisco in 1939. He studied English at the University of California at Berkeley and at Santa Barbara, while working in steel mills to earn a living, then went east to study painting at Yale. There, he came into contact with New York School painters like Philip Guston and younger artists like Frank Stella, and helped edit Josef Albers's famous book "The Interaction of Color." He got his degree in 1964 and spent the next year in Paris, where he met the composer Philip Glass. Mr. Serra drew during the day and at night went with Mr. Glass to La Coupole just to watch his hero, the sculptor Alberto Giacometti, eat dinner. Mr. Serra moved to New York in 1966.
"I remember when I first came here," he says, "there was a warehouse emptying out some rubber and I asked if I could cart away as much of it as I could carry. I got Phil Glass and a couple of other people to help, and we moved the rubber to my loft. I cut it and bent it and punched holes through it. I tied it together and made pieces that hung along the wall. And when I was done, I realized the works were clearly related to Pollock's 'Mural' in Iowa." Mr. Serra's rubber works were his "Belts" of 1966-67, now owned by the Guggenheim Museum. The painting by Pollock, belonging to the University of Iowa, was done in 1943 for Peggy Guggenheim. It is an abstraction whose sequence of twisting, interlaced shapes, figures perhaps, indeed remind you of the "Belts," once Mr. Serra mentions it.
He elaborates: "Pollock made something never seen before that we now know of as a Pollock painting, an interlacing, tumbleweed creation that exists in a space unlike any other. Maybe if you enlarged a fragment of a Monet you might have something like it. But not quite."
Tumbleweeds bring to mind Cy Twombly's paintings of the early 1970's that look like blackboards scrawled with Palmer Method ovals, or with tumbleweeds. "But Twombly had a very definite notion of reproducing handwriting," Mr. Serra says. "If Pollock is handwriting, it's handwriting like I've never seen before. The Twomblys I find interesting are the ones in which he tackles a giant canvas with a hard pencil and crayon, in which, like Pollock, he goes for a heroic statement, but with little ideograms. I find the vulnerability of Twombly's heroicism compelling."
An abstraction nearby by Bradley Walker Tomlin, Pollock's near-contemporary, suddenly catches Mr. Serra's eye. Pollock's drips and splatters weave across "Autumn Rhythm," while Tomlin's patterned daubs blanket his canvas. "It's like going from the art museum to the Kmart when you move from the Pollock to the Tomlin," Mr. Serra says. "The pattern in the Tomlin is so flatfooted and sterile. It's decorative. Decorativeness is a tradition in American painting, and it has produced mediocre art and also great art. Joseph Cornell used a certain decoration to pull off his fantasies. Jasper Johns's terrific Flag paintings are, in some ways, decorative. Decoration means pattern, geometry and repetition as the content of a work. Pollock's intention wasn't to decorate, to pattern, to use a repetitive model."
 
Pollock as Organic
 Mr. Serra is gathering a crowd as he speaks. He talks energetically, the sentences tumbling out, and he moves restlessly up to and back from "Autumn Rhythm," like someone trying to choose the right seat in a movie theater. He points out the cadences of the work's looping lines, puzzles over which parts Pollock may have painted first, which parts last, and marvels at the oddness of the palette. It is, in fact, a little like Mr. Serra's own, in that it is often made from industrial materials (in Pollock's case, house paints) that have a raw beauty, unconventional, even unintended. Mr. Serra notices, as well, some curious circular patches that look like the dried, wrinkled remnants of pigment from the bottom of paint cans, stuck to the canvas by Pollock to create effects different from the drips and splatters.
"I don't think it's wrong to talk about the organic quality of Pollock's line, with its swirls and rope-laden spatters," Mr. Serra says. "It points to a likeness to nature without being depictive or illustrative of nature. It seems to me to be soaked, just as nature is soaked. It has a wetness and it's formed the way nature is formed, not analytically like a Cubist picture or a Mondrian, but organically."
The analogy with nature, or landscape, harks back to traditional views of the drip paintings from the 1950's, as does, in general, Mr. Serra's heroic image of Pollock. Mr. Serra has a reputation for embracing radical politics, but he has always separated his political beliefs from his artistic ones. At one point he says: "What Pollock was confronting was the orthodoxy of a kind of regionalism, meaning the work of artists like his teacher Thomas Hart Benton. And in some sense, multiculturalism, while not being exactly regionalism, seems to me to suffer from the same provincial attitude that regionalism did."
At another point he says: "Gender analysis knocks all the notions traditionally associated with Pollock. There may be a lot of reasons to crucify bombastic, overblown art. But Pollock is not bombastic or overblown. And when critics today use words like male and heroic as kneejerk putdowns," Mr. Serra continues, sounding as if he just might be thinking of his own critics as well as Pollock's, "that doesn't seem to me to have anything to do with really seeing and analyzing his work. If I sound elitist, it's O.K. by me. Some things are better than others. Picasso is better than Dubuffet; Pollock is better than Tomlin. We know that."
Mr. Serra is finished with "Autumn Rhythm." He notices a pair of Barnett Newmans, and is immediately distracted again. Pollock's technique of painting on the floor helped pave the way for Mr. Serra's early floor pieces. Newman's big paintings of blocks of color divided by lines, or "zips," did the same for Mr. Serra's later steel sculptures and recent paint-stick drawings, which involve large slabs or blocks that divide and reorganize the spaces they're in. Like the Newmans, they invite a viewer to walk around or across them, to experience them not in a single glance but over time, physically. "My own work is more related to Newman than to Pollock," he acknowledges, "although I have much more admiration for Pollock because I admire what I lack."
"Concord," of 1949, is a greenish picture by Newman with a loosely painted, dusky stripe down the center that Mr. Serra considers too "theatrical." He prefers "Shimmer Bright," of 1968, a hard-edged painting of adjacent blocks of flat color.
"It's about dividing and placing spaces next to one another, not about illusionism. I like Newman's paintings when they're even larger than this. They're great when you have to walk by them and immerse yourself in the divisions of their spaces. Then time becomes a factor: the physical time it takes you to see it and walk across it. That's why you get nothing from photographic reproductions of Newmans. They're reduced to decorations."
 
Matisse the Sculptor
 Mr. Serra is ready to move on to the Museum of Modern Art. It turns out that he hasn't seen the room of Pollocks installed there several years ago. When he arrives, he makes a few detours first. He enthuses over a Bonnard. A Giacometti leaves him, for once, speechless. He declares Matisse's sculpture "La Serpentine," of 1909, "one of the very best works of the 20th century."
"Can you give me another example of figurative sculpture that has followed it in terms of suggesting open vertical volume?" he asks. "It's a kind of work I know I could never do."
Then he becomes startled by the German painter Gerhard Richter's cycle of blurry black-and-white images from the late 1980's, 15 paintings based on the deaths of members of the West German Red Army Faction, the so-called Baader-Meinhof gang, in Stammheim prison in 1977. "I don't think there's an American painter alive who could tackle this subject matter, and get this much feeling into it in this dispassionate way," Mr. Serra says.
He compares one Richter of a dead gang member to Goya, then late Rembrandt: "At the end, Rembrandt painted himself as meat. It was about him confronting his own mortality, and the paintings became smelly and foul and really great. These paintings aren't like late Rembrandts, exactly, but they're disturbing in a way the Rembrandts are. There's a despair in them. And both the Richters and the late Rembrandts are about people recognizing their own solitude through the paintings, which is what we respond to in them."
Mr. Serra arrives at the room of Pollocks. It faces Newman's "Vir Heroicus Sublimis," of 1950-51, and the juxtaposition delights him. "Vir Heroicus Sublimis" is an immense horizontal red field interrupted at irregular intervals by bands of white, orange and ochre. "They're not really bands," Mr. Serra says. "The white line cleaves the field, it cuts the space, it doesn't wrap around it like a band. The ocher, or maybe it's raw canvas, seems to weight the painting toward one side. Without having any descriptive correlative, you see how Newman gives you this physical sense of time and space and location."
 
A Return to Figuration
 He scans the Pollocks next. "Echo (No. 25, 1951)" is an image of black enamel on canvas in which Pollock verges on reintroducing figures after having eliminated figures in his early drip paintings. "Clement Greenberg said Pollock was finished because he returned to the figure," says Mr. Serra, referring to the influential critic. "But I don't buy it. In terms of sheer drawing, this picture is great. Pollock has learned to use the drip and the stick and to make a kind of drawing that is his alone, unlike what he was doing in that early work." Mr. Serra means "Pasiphae." "If he wants to turn his drawing now into a head or a limb, I'm not going to quibble with him."
He becomes riveted by the big central picture in the room, "One (No. 31, 1950)." " 'Autumn Rhythm' is not one of the dense Pollock drip paintings," Mr. Serra says, by way of comparison. "It's less soul-searching, more open, freer and more confident than a work like this. But 'One' is a much better painting, no doubt about it, because it's more about struggle and much denser." Mr. Serra walks up to the canvas. "Something about this painting, looking at it from here, makes me sick." He laughs. "I mean it in a good way."
He then steps back until the work comes into focus. He notices the rhythm of the spun-sugar lines, the way the mass of them begins to separate itself into discrete parts, with the whites becoming openings, or recessions, and the blacks seeming to push forward. Mr. Serra is excited by the playfulness and sense of movement in the work.
It brings to his mind a show of children's art he recently visited: "What I saw there and what you see here is what you seldom see in American painting: an exuberance in the act of making, in the sheer pleasure of playing with materials. No matter how aggressive you think Pollock is, no matter how much you think his work repudiates what came before it, you can't help but sense this joy in his work."

HEADLINE: The 'In' Iraqi Who Counted Himself Out

BYLINE: By ERIC SCHMITT 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Aug. 11

 BODY:
By the time he was 30, Hussein Kamel had risen from a lowly bodyguard with a grade-school education to become the mastermind behind the development of advanced chemical weapons and the long-range missiles Iraq launched in its eight-year war against Iran in the 1980's.
Today, a decade later, Lieutenant General Kamel, with his knowledge of Iraq's clandestine weapons program, could become more valuable to the West than to the Baghdad Government. 
 The general, now thought to be about 40, is one of two sons-in-law of Saddam Hussein who defected to Jordan this week with their wives and families. He oversaw Iraq's buildup of missiles, chemical and biological weapons, and a nuclear research program. American analysts also credit his managerial wizardry for organizing much of the reconstruction of Iraq after the Persian Gulf war, in particular the rebuilding of bridges and of oil and telecommunications installations.
General Kamel was considered a pragmatist in the Iraqi hierarchy and had urged Mr. Hussein to comply with United Nations resolutions in order to have international sanctions against Iraq lifted.
It now appears that General Kamel fled Iraq largely because of a feud with Mr. Hussein's eldest son, Uday, over the issue of the resolutions.
"If this guy is willing to talk to us, and is on the up and up," it will be easy to determine whether he is telling the whole story, said a United Nations official involved in dismantling the Iraqi arsenal that General Kamel assembled.
But that is a very big if. General Kamel stayed alive by following the tenets of Iraqi politics: absolute loyalty to family and ruthlessness. He is likely to treat the Western intelligence analysts he is meeting in Amman very carefully.
"He's a talented thug with a knack for organization who was born in the right place," said a Defense Department official.
That right place was Tikrit, a city 100 miles north of Baghdad that is home to Saddam Hussein's ruling inner circle. Indeed, General Kamel is Mr. Hussein's cousin.
The rise of General Kamel began with the Iran-Iraq war, when President Hussein put him in charge of his personal security. Five years later, he married Mr. Hussein's daughter Raghad. He was soon promoted to lieutenant colonel and put in charge of intelligence operations.
General Kamel's talents are not as a brilliant technician or courageous warrior, but as a gifted manager who gets things done.
During the war with Iran, he strengthened Iraq's special forces and elite Republican Guard.
He used Iraq's intelligence agents abroad to arrange to buy crucial components and materials for the country's nuclear, chemical, biological and missile programs.
"As Hussein Kamel got progressively more prominent, he was given authority to harness Iraq's industrial and scientific community," said Ken Katzman, a Persian Gulf specialist at the Congressional Research Service and a former Central Intelligence Agency analyst.
The success of Iraq's weapons programs, including developing ways to transform Soviet-made Scud missiles into deadly if not always accurate long-range weapons, buoyed the General's ambitions.
"He was nothing more than a security guard," said Phoebe Marr, a Middle East specialist at the National Defense University. "Having said that, however, this guy is practically an organizational genius."
By 1990, as tensions with Kuwait increased, he was whispering in President Hussein's ear that no nation in the gulf could stop Iraq. "He was building up Saddam Hussein's ego, telling Saddam how powerful Iraq had become," Mr. Katzman said.
General Kamel was named Defense Minister in April 1991, two months after Iraq's defeat in the Persian Gulf war. He crushed the postwar rebellions by Kurdish and Shiite minorities, but senior generals grumbled about his lack of military experience. Seven months later, he was dismissed.
While he waited for the political winds to blow his way again, he served as an adviser on rebuilding the country. At the same time he survived a medical scare: a brain tumor. He was operated on in Amman and the tumor proved benign.
This June, General Kamel's fortunes and power seemed fully resurrected when he was named Minister of Industry and head of the Military Industries Commission. At this point he changed course and recommended reconciliation with the Kurds.
But the old feud with Uday Hussein was rekindled. They vied for control over the lucrative ministries that oversaw Iraq's rebuilding and, ultimately, for the ear of Mr. Hussein, especially on the important issue of how to get international economic sanctions lifted.
"Hussein Kamel is a pragmatist," Mr. Katzman said. "He sees Uday as a know-nothing brat."
General Kamel was ousted from his high-level positions before he left the country this week, which is thought, along with the feud, to be a major factor in his defection.

DATELINE: RALEIGH, N.C., Aug. 11

 BODY:
"The man's off his rocker," Claude B. French said of President Clinton, and that was one of the milder reactions today among the tobacco farmers who serve on the board of a cooperative representing 180,000 growers in five Southern states.
Tobacco farmers have long been accustomed to attacks on smoking from health groups and Government agencies. But Mr. Clinton's proposed regulations to reduce teen-age smoking, announced on Thursday, provoked an unusual level of anger as the board met here at the Flue-Cured Cooperative Stabilization Corporation offices, where visitors are greeted by a sign: "Thank You for Smoking." 
 Characterizing the plans as illegal, hypocritical, unnecessary and economically harmful to tobacco farmers, the directors voted at their regular monthly meeting, 11 to 0, to join the nation's five largest tobacco companies in a lawsuit filed on Thursday that challenges the Food and Drug Administration's authority to regulate the sale, distribution and promotion of cigarettes.
The regulations proposed by Mr. Clinton, based on the F.D.A.'s finding that nicotine is an addictive drug and thus subject to the agency's control, would prohibit cigarette sales to anyone under 18, eliminate the sale of cigarettes through vending machines and place new restrictions on cigarette advertising.
"The farmers are really down in the mouth about this," said Mr. French, who farms 800 acres in Reidsville, N.C. "It's very discouraging to us. This has been our livelihood through generations of hand-me-down farms."
All the directors are farmers, representing growers in Virginia, North Carolina, South Carolina, Georgia and Florida who produce flue-cured tobacco, curing their leaves by regulating heat and humidity in closed barns. Burley, the other major tobacco type produced in the United States, by about 160,000 growers, is cured by air flowing through open barns. Flue-cured tobacco constitutes up to 60 percent of the tobacco used in cigarettes, about twice as much as burley.
In 1993, the latest year for which statistics are available, 50 million Americans, about a fifth of the population, smoked 485 billion cigarettes, generating $50 billion for cigarette manufacturers and $14 billion in Federal, state and local taxes. Leaf sales generated about $3 billion for farmers -- about $3,782 an acre, according to the Agriculture Department, compared with $352 for cotton, $208 for soybeans and $176 for wheat.
Many of the directors here argued that Mr. Clinton's proposals were just another example of government intrusion into people's lives -- and an illegal one at that, inasmuch as the power to regulate commerce is given by the Constitution to Congress. The F.D.A.'s position is that nicotine, a chemical that occurs naturally in tobacco, falls within a wide group of addictive substances that the Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act already gives the agency the authority to control.
Stressing their belief that most tobacco growers oppose teen-age smoking, some board members said state laws already barring the sale of cigarettes to minors made Mr. Clinton's plan redundant.
Beyond that, they insisted that the Government should play no role in a teen-ager's deciding whether to smoke. Andrew Q. Shepherd, a farmer from Blackstone, Va., said any teen-ager who wanted to smoke would smoke, regulations notwithstanding.
His 16-year-old son smokes filter-tipped Camels, he said.
"We are all against smoking by teen-agers," said Mr. Shepherd, a smoker who described himself as "an eighth or ninth generation" tobacco farmer with no other source of income. "Churches discourage kids from smoking. Schools discourage them. With all that community involvement, if parents, peers and community institutions cannot convince kids not to smoke, you're not going to solve anything with unnecessary intrusion into private lives."
As for his son, he said, "I would prefer that he not smoke."
Albert M. Johnson of Galivants Ferry, S.C., said that preaching the ills of smoking to teen-agers, let alone regulating them, was no less daunting than other challenges parents typically face.
"To teen-agers, a no-no is a temptation," Mr. Johnson said. "Smoking is something parents have to discuss with their kids, like speeding, wearing seat belts and using drugs. But it should come from parents, not the Government."
James C. Pate of Rowland, N.C., added: "The American public doesn't like to be told what it's got to do. A lot of people tell me they smoke only because people tell them they can't."
Some directors said they viewed Mr. Clinton's proposals as part of a larger campaign to increase Government restrictions on the tobacco industry, and several criticized the Administration for emphasizing to teen-agers the adverse effects of smoking rather than of alcohol and drugs.
"Tobacco has been in this country 200 years, but they've never talked about it until now," said B. Frank Strickland of Lakeland, Ga. "I don't know why. But I do know tobacco does not do what alcohol and dope do to people. Yet they jump on tobacco. Why don't they jump on the dope crowd?"
Board members also said Mr. Clinton's plan would damage him politically, almost certainly costing him any chance to win North Carolina in next year's Presidential election. Among tobacco-growing states, only Kentucky and Tennessee were carried in 1992 by Mr. Clinton, who lost North Carolina to President George Bush by 20,000 votes.
"As poor as his rating is in the South, he couldn't stoop no lower," said Kenneth Dasher of Live Oak, Fla. "Maybe he figured he had nothing to lose and this would take the heat off some of his other problems -- you know, spreading the misery."
Mr. Johnson, the director who represents all of South Carolina, a state Mr. Clinton lost by almost 100,000 votes in 1992, said he was "amazed and devastated" by the President's proposals for the economic loss they would pose to tobacco farmers.
"But I guess it never ceases to amaze me what the Clinton Administration does, trying to regulate," he said. "You hear a lot of talk about a two-party system; if Clinton keeps on going, it's going to be a one-party system. He has totally destroyed the Democratic Party in our area."
Asked if he is a Democrat, Mr. Johnson sighed deeply.
"I wanted to be," he said.

Bond Prices Slump As Economy Picks Up
Treasury securities fell in price as new Government reports indicated that the economy was somewhat stronger than thought. Market participants said the reports did not bode well for another interest rate cut. The new 30-year bond lost more than a full percentage point in price, bringing the yield to 6.970 percent, up from 6.906 percent on Thursday. The market ignored the dollar's new strength, and focused on a big supply of bonds that dragged prices lower. [36.]
Stocks were rocked by the bond market selloff, which undercut favorable economic reports. The Dow industrials fell 25.36 points, to 4,618.30 -- that was 65.16 points for the week -- but the S.& P. 500-stock index fell less sharply, and technology stocks rose. [37.]
 
Corn and wheat prices rose on expectations that foreign buyers would snap up larger American corps. [32.]
 
A Partner for Westinghouse?
Harcourt General held talks with Westinghouse about joining its $5.4 billion bid to buy CBS, several people familiar with the discussions said. Harcourt General, parent of the retailer Neiman-Marcus, did not proceed very far in the talks, but the fact talks were held indicates that Westinghouse would consider a partner. Harcourt weighed an approach to CBS last year, various people said, but is unlikely to join in this time, partly because of the deal's high price. [35.]
 
City May Privatize Jails
New York City asked for proposals to privatize all or part of the city's jails. When it is clear how much interest private companies show, the city will decide how to proceed. The city spends almost $750 million a year to run the jail system. [1.]
 
Tobacco Farmers Fight Back
Tobacco farmers denounced President Clinton's call for regulations to reduce teen-age smoking. A cooperative in North Carolina representing 180,000 growers in five states joined the nation's five largest tobacco companies in suing to block the plan, that would give the F.D.A. the authority to regulate the sale, distribution and promotion of cigarettes. Farmers said that state laws already barred the sale of cigarettes to minors, and that the Government should not influence a teenager's decision on whether to smoke. The regulations proposed by Mr. Clinton were based on the F.D.A.'s finding that nicotine is an addictive drug and thus subject to the agency's control. [1.]
 
Morgan Stanley Jumps Into China
Morgan Stanley began China's first international investment bank with a Chinese company and other partners from Hong Kong and Singapore. The investment is expected to give Morgan Stanley an advantage over its competitors in winning deals involving project financing, direct investment and equity and bond offerings at a time when China needs to finance enormous infrastructure projects. The new firm has a capitalization of $100 million and is headquartered in Beijing. Ten Morgan executives will be based there, giving Morgan the largest presence in Beijing of any American investment bank. [34.]
 
A Capitalist Farm Thrives in Vietnam
A capitalist showcase is blossoming on a farm in Vietnam. A Dutch farmer recruited by a British entrepreneur is cultivating 75 acres of vegetables and flowers in the highland area. Vegetables are being shipped out almost daily, mostly for export to upscale restaurants in Hong Kong, Taiwan, Singapore and Japan. The company is the first wholly foreign-owned agricultural and horticultural investment in Vietnam. One attraction is that costs are lower than elsewhere in Asia. The farm is headed toward its first year of profit. [34.]
 
S.E.C. Internet Service May End
A service offering free Internet access to S.E.C. filings will be discontinued on Oct. 1. Executives said they hoped the Federal Government would take over the service, known as Edgar. [35.]
 
In Recycling, New York City Pays
While suburban areas around New York make money by selling recycled metal, glass and plastic -- Oyster Bay, L.I., gets $25 a ton and Mercer County, N.J. $9.50 a ton -- New York City pays recycling operators $40 to $50 a ton to take away such material. City sanitation officials call it "a fair deal." [23.]

HEADLINE: In Store Fight, Mayor Got Tough

BYLINE: By BRETT PULLEY 

 BODY:
After months of pondering whether to support a hotly contested proposal to build a large Pathmark supermarket in East Harlem, Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani's aides called the project's developers to a meeting last week and issued an ultimatum:
 Accept the Mayor's terms for closing the deal -- or take the blame for the project's failure. The Mayor's people gave the developers just three hours to decide. 
 "I told them we would do it that day, or there would be no deal," said Clay B. Lifflander, president of the city's Economic Development Commission.
 Suddenly, the deal was done. Later that day, Mr. Giuliani announced that the city would serve as an equity partner for the project until a Hispanic community development group could be found to join in the project with the developers: the East Harlem Abyssinian Triangle Corporation, which includes the Abyssinian Development Corporation and the Community Association of East Harlem Triangle.
 By demanding an immediate decision, the developers say, the Mayor created a tense and angry day for them -- but a perfect situation for him. If the developers agreed to the plan, Hispanic leaders who had lobbied against the project would feel satisfied that the Mayor had addressed their concerns. But if the developers rejected the Mayor's terms, he could blame them for killing the project.
 "It was a win-win situation for the city," said Peter L. Borges, president of the Retail Initiative, a fledgling investment partnership that is an investor in the East Harlem project. Mr. Borges said he had nonetheless been "happy that we were finally in a session where something was going to get done."
 Now another Pathmark deal with similar problems has landed squarely in the Mayor's lap, and his handling of the East Harlem Pathmark controversy might give some indication of how he will approach this one.
 As part of the Harlem deal, Mr. Giuliani struck down a plan for Pathmark to establish a $125,000 fund to assist Hispanic-owned businesses in East Harlem. That proposal had been an attempt to assuage opposing sentiments in the community.
 A similar proposal is part of the negotiations for a large Pathmark store in Springfield Gardens, Queens. Under pressure from Councilwoman Juanita E. Watkins, the company has agreed to set up a $400,000 fund for local merchants if it is allowed to build the store.
 Last Wednesday, the City Planning Commission denounced that idea, and the Mayor appeared prepared to veto the zoning changes needed for the Queens store unless the fund idea was eliminated. But to get the deal Mr. Giuliani wants this time, he will have to handle the City Council, not a small group of community leaders. A strong-arm ultimatum is unlikely to be so effective.
 In the East Harlem agreement, the Mayor's demand for an immediate decision led to a day of angry negotiations. The developers complained that Mr. Giuliani would not give them time to talk to advisers. As a result, the project was nearly killed in the hours before the Mayor's announcement.
 "There was the feeling that this was unreasonable," said Paul S. Grogan, president of Local Initiatives Support Corporation, a Ford Foundation offshoot that assists community development groups.
 The plan to build the East Harlem store, 53,000 square feet at 125th Street and Lexington Avenue, became a political hot potato for Mr. Giuliani early this year when Hispanic business owners began lobbying against the supermarket, saying it would hurt smaller grocery stores and bodegas. Although the project typifies the public and private partnerships that Mr. Giuliani has promoted, the threat that the issue might cost him support among Hispanic constituents caused him to procrastinate on taking a stand until the final moments with the developers early last week.
 Defending the city's negotiating strategy, Mr. Lifflander said later that the Mayor had believed it would be necessary to force an immediate decision to avoid more controversy.
 But for Karen A. Phillips, the Abyssinian Development Corporation's project director, it turned into a difficult day, people who were there said. Ms. Phillips found herself faced with negotiating significant changes in the project's financial structure without being able to confer with her counterpart at the East Harlem Triangle organization. She consulted with the Rev. Calvin O. Butts 3d instead, in more than a dozen phone calls. As pastor of the Abyssinian Baptist Church in Harlem, Mr. Butts also has authority over the church's community development arm.
 While Mr. Lifflander conferred with City Hall by phone, Ms. Phillips and Mr. Butts appealed for more time. First, they asked that they be allowed to return the next morning with an answer. The Mayor's office refused. Next they asked if they could have until 6 P.M. that day. Again, they were turned down. Finally, city officials gave the developers two additional hours, moving the deadline to 4 P.M.
 At one point during the talks, Ms. Phillips grabbed her belongings and started to leave, people who were at the meeting said. But Mr. Grogan, afraid the Mayor would stick to his threat to kill the deal if a decision was not made that day, persuaded Ms. Phillips to return. "She was practically held hostage," one person who attended the meeting said. Ms. Phillips declined to comment.
 "Nobody deserves to be treated the way we were treated," said Mr. Butts, who leads one of Harlem's largest and best-known congregations. "It was insensitive, cruel, mean-spirited and small. But we stayed focused because our aim was to get it done."
 The two crucial issues of the Mayor's proposal that had to be worked out were how the revenue from the project would be shared with the new development partner and how control would be divided. Under the city's plan, the East Harlem Abyssinian consortium would hold 51 percent of the equity, the new partner would hold 49 percent and the profits would be shared on that basis.
 Although the developers agreed to split the equity, they countered with a plan to insure that control of the project would remain with them. The two sides agreed that when the city finds a Hispanic community development group to take over the city's share of the deal, East Harlem Abyssinian's investors will have the right to approve that selection.
 The city will sell the land to the developers at its appraised value of $1.5 million and will also provide a 1-percent mortgage for the property. The developers will also get a market-rate loan for $8 million from Chemical Bank to build the store.
 Under the terms of a 25-year lease, Pathmark will pay the developers about $1 million a year to rent the store. After the developers make their debt payments and pay other costs, about $50,000 will be left for the community development groups to split.
 Mr. Lifflander, who represented the Mayor in the talks, insisted that the tough stance with the community developers had been necessary. "It proved to be correct because the deal got done," he said.
 But Mr. Butts called the city's approach "highhanded" and said he believed that the Mayor had been disrespectful of the developers.
 "We have been open and gracious with Mayor Giuliani," he said. "And now this is like, 'Slap, take this.' So I will take it because it's still a good deal. It's just sad we had to do it this way."

HEADLINE: Consumer Prices Rise Only 0.2%; Sales Off a Bit

BYLINE: By KEITH BRADSHER 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Aug. 11

 BODY:
Consumer prices rose in July, but gently, while retail sales were scarcely changed, the Government announced today.
 But the Commerce Department also revised upward its estimates for sales in May and June, and the revised figures suggested that the economy entered late summer in slightly better condition than some traders had previously suspected. 
 As measured by consumer prices, which rose two-tenths of 1 percent last month, inflation appeared under control. Retail sales fell one-tenth of 1 percent in July, suggesting weakness, but combined with the upward revisions for May and June, the figures provided an unclear picture of the economy's health.
 Still, there was concern on Wall Street that renewed economic growth might eventually lead to slightly higher inflation. Both bond and stock prices fell, and long-term interest rates jumped, although many Wall Street analysts attributed that more to large supplies of bonds sold by the Treasury this week than to the economic reports.
 Economists said that the bond market's response was excessive and that inflation was likely to continue to subside in the coming months. "That's what I call the exquisite sensitivity of the bond market to anything that suggests the economy might grow faster than trend," said Allen Sinai, the chief economist at Lehman Brothers. "I think it's an overreaction."
 Mr. Sinai and other analysts continued to predict that the central bank's top officials were not likely to reduce interest rates at their next policy meeting on Aug. 22, saying the Fed would choose instead to wait until the following meeting on Sept. 26.
 "We think the Fed is on hold -- they have to be very happy," said Mark P. Vitner, a vice president and economist at the First Union Corporation, a bank holding company in Charlotte, N.C. "We've got moderate growth and low inflation."
 The Labor Department, in announcing the two-tenths of 1 percent rise in the Consumer Price Index with seasonal adjustments this morning, said that excluding seasonal adjustments, the index was unchanged. The seasonally adjusted gain compared with one-tenth of 1 percent in June and three-tenths of 1 percent in May.
 Rising food prices offset falling energy prices in July, particularly for gasoline, so consumer prices excluding food and energy -- the so-called core rate of inflation -- was also up two-tenths of 1 percent, the department said.
 Retail sales edged down by one-tenth of 1 percent last month, the Commerce Department announced this morning.
 The July sales figure "is telling us the economy is in a sluggish period that has been going on for a few months now," said Robert D. Barr, the deputy chief economist at the United States Chamber of Commerce. "It does not suggest we're headed for a recession or anything like that, so there's reason to believe the worst is behind us."
 The July figure for retail sales is an advance estimate, and is potentially subject to such large revisions that economists at the Federal Reserve and elsewhere regard it with caution.
 The Commerce Department revised upward its estimate of the June increase in retail sales to eight-tenths of 1 percent from seven-tenths of 1 percent, and pushed up the May figure to 1.1 percent from nine-tenths of 1 percent. Excluding automobile sales, the increases were slightly larger.
 But Darwin L. Beck, an economist and Fed watcher at the First Boston Corporation, was skeptical that the revisions signified a stronger economy. "I didn't see anything in the numbers that would suggest anything other than what we've been seeing, which is an economy moving forward but not at a rapid pace," he said.
 Businesses across the country have been noting the willingness of consumers to shop elsewhere when confronted with higher prices. At the two toy stores of the Alphabet Soup Corporation in Des Moines, for example, sales have leveled off this summer after strong growth early in the year, and Chris T. Wass, the owner and president, said that he was reluctant to raise prices.
"My sense is the consumer is price-sensitive right now, and we're not likely to be aggressive in marking things right now," Mr. Wass said. At the same time, he added, "I don't see anything real dangerous ahead in our business in the near term."
 Consumer prices in the transportation sector fell four-tenths of 1 percent in July, pulled down by a 2.1 percent drop in gasoline prices. The pace of medical care inflation gained last month, as prices rose by four-tenths of 1 percent, compared with three-tenths of 1 percent in every previous month this year.
 Food prices were held down by a drop of three-tenths of 1 percent in fresh fruit and vegetable prices. By contrast, prices for dairy products climbed six-tenths of 1 percent.

HEADLINE: Poll Shows Disenchantment With Politicians and Politics

BYLINE: By R. W. APPLE Jr. 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Aug. 11

 BODY:
Profoundly disenchanted by politics and politicians, Americans are simultaneously attracted to and leery of the idea of a third party, according to a new New York Times/CBS News Poll.
The poll, which was completed on the eve of this weekend's gathering in Dallas of supporters of Ross Perot's independent political movement, United We Stand America, suggested that Gen. Colin L. Powell would run more strongly than other potential third-party nominees against President Clinton and Senator Bob Dole, the Republican front-runner. In a trial race, the three finished in a virtual dead heat. 
 Although 55 percent said the country needed a new party, 61 percent said a President who was neither a Republican nor a Democrat would have trouble dealing with Congress. And when asked what a third party should stand for, people offered few policy specifics. The most frequent answer was that it should represent the people.
When it comes to the nation's most important problems, the Times/CBS News survey indicated, Americans are just as dissatisfied with the work the Republicans are doing this year on Capitol Hill, where they won control in last fall's elections, as they are with the performance of Mr. Clinton. In each case, only 26 percent said the officeholders involved were doing a good job.
Even in more general terms, neither Mr. Clinton nor his Republican tormentors have been able to win the approval of a majority. What the Congressional Republicans have done since taking power has been good for the country in the view of 48 percent and bad in the view of 33 percent. Similarly, 45 percent approve of the way the President is handling his job over all, while 43 percent disapprove.
The frustrations run deep, perhaps deeper than at any other time in modern American history. These were among the major findings in the poll, which was based on telephone interviews with 1,478 adults nationwide from Aug. 5 to 9:
*Fifty-nine percent said there was not a single elected official today whom they admired. Of the 36 percent who could think of one, Mr. Clinton was named by 6 percent, Mr. Dole by 5 percent and Speaker Newt Gingrich by 4 percent.
*Seventy-nine percent, the highest figure in several decades, said the Government was pretty much run by a few big interests looking out for themselves.
*Seventy-nine percent said they trusted the Federal Government to do the right thing only some of the time.
*And 58 percent said that people like themselves had little to say about what the Government did.
The new poll, which has a margin of sampling error of plus or minus three percentage points, showed the Republicans holding several tactical advantages with the formal opening of the 1996 Presidential campaign, in the Iowa caucuses and the New Hampshire primary, only six months away.
Perhaps most significantly, voters see the Republicans as more likely to reduce the Federal deficit, insure the country's prosperity, limit crime and reform the welfare system.
Welfare has been a traditional concern of Democrats, and they have traditionally been more trusted as its stewards, but in a poll a year ago the two parties tied on the issue and now the Republicans have pulled ahead, 50 percent to 33 percent. Welfare reform is currently one of the most hotly debated subjects in the Senate, and it may well emerge as a major campaign issue next year.
Although the Democrats retained an advantage on only one issue, it is a vital one: Medicare. Many more people (46 percent to 32 percent) saw the Democrats as likely to make the right decisions in the heated debate on how to control rapidly rising costs in health care for the elderly.
The two parties finished roughly even on concern for the needs and problems of ordinary people -- a strong showing for the Republicans on long-established Democratic turf.
The political punch packed by Medicare and Social Security (and a potential peril for Republican budget-cutters) is suggested by another set of results. By 60 percent to 36 percent, voters would balance the budget even if that meant their taxes would not be cut. But faced with a choice, they would prefer by 4 to 1 to continue with imbalanced budgets rather than change Medicare. In the case of Social Security, the ratio is almost 3 to 1.
Still, the Republicans at this stage have a more favorable image as a party, with 54 percent of respondents approving and 37 percent disapproving, compared with a roughly even split for the Democrats, 47 percent positive and 45 percent negative.
A trial heat between a generic "Republican candidate" and Mr. Clinton gave the Republican 28 percent and the President 22 percent, with 45 percent undecided. Especially at this very early stage, such questions can be only broadly indicative, but the results certainly suggest Democratic problems.
With Mr. Dole as the Republican candidate, the poll showed 48 percent for the Senator and 42 percent for the President.
But the practical effect of adding General Powell, Mr. Perot or Patrick J. Buchanan as a third-party candidate was to siphon off more Republican than Democratic voters from the major-party candidates, allowing Mr. Clinton to pull even with Mr. Dole in a series of trial heats. Only if Jesse Jackson was substituted did the pattern shift. He pulled many Democratic votes away from Mr. Clinton, allowing Mr. Dole to win the hypothetical race easily.
The Clinton camp, which has similar poll figures, hopes the President's stand on affirmative action and other recent moves have placated Mr. Jackson enough to keep him on the sidelines, but that is not yet clear.
Mr. Dole continues to spread-eagle the Republican field, pulling 48 percent compared with 10 percent for his nearest rival, Mr. Buchanan. But Mr. Buchanan has scored significant gains since February, when he had the backing of only 3 percent, largely at the expense of his conservative rival, Senator Phil Gramm of Texas, who has dropped to 7 percent from 15 percent. Gov. Pete Wilson of California, a late entrant, has moved up to 6 percent from 3 percent.
General Powell, who begins a highly publicized book tour next month, has promised to make a decision in the fall about whether to seek the Presidency and whether, if he decides to run, to do so as a Republican or an independent. Of the four widely discussed potential third-party nominees, only he approaches a third of the vote, with 27 percent; Mr. Perot pulls 23 percent, Mr. Jackson 11 percent and Mr. Buchanan 8 percent in three-way trial heats against Mr. Clinton and Mr. Dole.
In a two-way race, running as a Republican, General Powell bettered Mr. Clinton by 10 points, 47 percent to 37 percent. But many experts consider it unlikely that the general, a moderate on many social issues, could win the Republican nomination.
Although (or perhaps because) most people are still unclear about his views, the general, who retired in October 1993, draws raves from a large segment of the American public, with 41 percent holding a favorable opinion and only 5 percent an unfavorable one.
As for Mr. Perot, he remains a polarizing figure. Although 28 percent of those polled expressed a favorable opinion of him, 36 percent expressed an unfavorable view. By a margin of about 2 to 1, those familiar with his organization, United We Stand America, opposed its establishment as a third party. But Mr. Perot himself won high marks as a gadfly, with 71 percent agreeing that he had good ideas about government and 52 percent saying he had helped focus the political debate.
Others with strong negatives were Mr. Jackson (29 percent favorable, 35 unfavorable), Mr. Buchanan (11 percent favorable, 28 percent unfavorable, and unpopular among members of both parties) and Mr. Gingrich (19 percent favorable, 35 unfavorable, but liked among Republicans, 37 percent to 21 percent).
President Clinton has retained a relatively strong base among Democrats (they favor his renomination, 63 percent to 30 percent), but he has failed to reap an important benefit of incumbency that he might have expected: political credit for a healthy economy. Only 41 percent of the public think he is handling the economy well, only 14 percent credit him with having reduced the budget deficit and only 14 percent say the economy is improving, as against 27 percent who say it is getting worse.
 
 
How the Poll Was Conducted
 The latest New York Times/CBS News Poll is based on telephone interviews conducted Aug. 5 to 9 with 1,478 adults throughout the United States.
The sample of telephone exchanges called was randomly selected by a computer from a complete list of active residential exchanges in the country. The list of more than 36,000 residential exchanges is maintained by Marketing Systems Group of Philadelphia.
Within each exchange, random digits were added to form a complete telephone number, thus permitting access to both listed and unlisted numbers. Within each household, one adult was designated by a random procedure to be the respondent for the survey.
The results have been weighted to take account of household size and number of telephone lines into the residence and to adjust for variations in the sample relating to geographic region, race, sex, age and education.

GIULIANI STUDIES PRIVATIZING JAILS
The Giuliani administration has begun soliciting proposals to privatize part or all of New York City's jails. Under the initiative, a nonbinding "request for expressions of interest" was mailed to more than 200 companies that have sprung up across the nation as private operators of jails. [Page 1.]
 
As America's prison population doubled in the last decade, the private, for-profit prison business exploded along with it. But questions and criticism continue to plague the $250-million-a-year industry. [24.]
 
NEW YORK CITY
 
PATHMARK, NEXT CHAPTER
Soon after his administration reached agreement with developers to build a large Pathmark supermarket in East Harlem, another Pathmark deal with similar problems has landed squarely in Mayor Giuliani's lap, and his handling of the earlier controversy may give some indication of how he intends to approach this one. [25.]
 
POLICE SET UP ANTI-GRIDLOCK DIVISION
The Police Department has formed a new traffic division to develop and carry out a plan to better manage gridlock in midtown Manhattan and rush-hour tie-ups on highways around New York City. The police said the division will step up enforcement of double-parking rules and increase ticketing of cabdrivers who clog traffic while picking up fares and drivers who block intersections. [25.]
 
A CAR-PARTS AD STIRS IRE IN THE BRONX
A magazine advertisement that trades on the Bronx's reputation as a center of the car-stripping industry has raised the patriotic ire of Borough President Fernando Ferrer and other officials. [25.]

A LIFETIME BUILDING BOATS
Since Earl Brockway was 14 and his father told him it was time to learn the family trade, he has spent most of his days in his backyard in Old Saybrook, Conn., building wooden skiffs. In fact, Mr. Brockway, 74, says he's never done much of anything else. Over the last 60 years, he estimates, he has built more than 5,000 boats. [26.]
 
MEDICAL REFERRAL BILLS DRAW VETOES
Governor Pataki has vetoed two bills that would have prevented doctors from making referrals to radiation or physical therapy clinics in which they, or their families, have a financial interest. [26.]
 
NOW, GREENPORT WILL ABOLISH ITS COURT
Nine months after voting to disband their nine-member police force, residents of Greenport, L.I., have taken another step to reduce the size and cost of government: they decided on Tuesday to abolish their town's court and unseat a part-time village justice whose term does not expire for two years. [26.]
 
INMATE IS MISTAKENLY FREED AFTER MIX-UP
Lamont White is back in the Albany County jail after an unexpected day of freedom, and perhaps he is wondering what to call himself next. Mr. White was captured without incident on an Albany street a day after he was let out of jail by mistake because, among the 825 or so inmates, there was another with the first name Lamont. [26.]

HEADLINE: After Months of Punishment, the Dollar Is Behaving Better

BYLINE: By KENNETH N. GILPIN 

 BODY:
After enduring months of abuse, the dollar has begun to strengthen in value on foreign exchange markets in the last few weeks, and many traders and analysts say it may continue to rise.
 At the same time, these experts concede that the dollar had become so cheap in comparison with currencies like the Japanese yen and the German mark that some sort of bounce was almost inevitable. Indeed, yesterday it surged to a five-month high against the yen and a two-and-a-half-month high against the mark. 
 "The dollar feels like it is in an uptrend," said Richard E. Witten, a partner at Goldman, Sachs & Company. "There is a feeling in the market that it is time for the dollar to cycle back up."
 But even if the dollar does improve further, these experts added, it remains a fundamentally weak currency. The problems that led to its steady decline over the last decade remain unsolved.
 "Given the size of our merchandise-trade and current-account deficits and the Federal budget deficit, the dollar still has some problems," said Neal M. Soss, a principal at Soss & Cotton Enterprises, an economic consulting firm in New York. "We are a nation that perpetually spends more than it saves, and that is a macroeconomic problem."
 At the moment, currency traders and speculators seem to have concluded that the dollar has been punished enough for those sins for the time being, and that further appreciation is possible.
 If they are correct, it would become marginally less expensive to take a European vacation. Also at the margin, it will make imports a bit cheaper, although analysts said the price effects of a change in currency values could take a year or two to show up. And it would be likely to put a crimp in the profits of companies that do large amounts of business abroad. Here too, though, experts say it is difficult, if not impossible, to say how much they really would be hurt.
 Over the last few days, currency traders have shrugged off the decision by Germany's powerful central bank, the Bundesbank, not to cut official interest rates, as well as two tame reports on inflation in the United States. Those reports will not encourage the Fed to raise interest rates, and may give policy makers the latitude to lower them.
 "American companies do lose some competitiveness," when the dollar appreciates, said Abby Joseph Cohen, co-chairwoman of the investment policy committee at Goldman, Sachs.
 But "much of what we export is not that sensitive to currency changes," she added. "We are talking about a nick, rather than a dramatic impact on earnings."
 Participants in the foreign exchange market have been feeling better about the dollar since late June, when the United States and Japan reached an 11th-hour compromise on automobile trade.
 However imperfect, that deal removed the fear that a potentially crippling trade war might break out between the countries.
 But it has been only in the last week, in the wake of Japanese announcements and actions that appear intended to knock down the value of the yen, that the dollar's move has gathered momentum.
 The dollar continued to rise yesterday, surging two pfennigs against the German mark, settling at 1.4396 marks in New York trading, its highest level in two and a half months. Against the Japanese yen, the dollar jumped 1.27 yen, to 93.90 yen, the highest level in five months. That is well above the dollar's low of 79.75 yen on April 19.
 Even with the recent rise, "on a year-over-year basis, we are still very much lower," said Ron Leven, a currency strategist at J. P. Morgan & Company. This time last year, the dollar was worth 103 yen and 1.60 marks, Mr. Leven noted.
 In large measure, the recent move has been in response to last week's decision by Japan's Ministry of Finance to entice Japanese financial institutions to invest abroad, a measure that it hopes will not only weaken the yen but also help to ease the serious crisis that has enveloped its financial system.
 In addition, on several occasions recently the Bank of Japan has intervened in foreign exchange markets to buy dollars and sell yen, actions that have been supported by the Federal Reserve Board.
 "The end of the auto problem was the beginning" of the dollar's climb, said Richard E. Witten, a partner at Goldman, Sachs & Company. "But the Japanese Government really started the ball rolling with the changes in investment rules."
 Japan's need to address its dollar problems has been the predominant theme in currency markets in recent weeks, but that has not been the only factor that has contributed to the dollar's improvement.
 Over the last few weeks, economic data have shown that activity in the third quarter appears to be picking up; as recently as late June, it was widely assumed that the United States was moving into a period of much slower growth, and perhaps a recession.
 Also, conditions in Mexico are improving, perhaps more rapidly than anyone had dared hope. The dollar was pounded last winter in the wake of the Clinton Administration's multibillion-dollar rescue package.
 "Mexico no longer looks so bad," said David Buchen, a managing director in charge of North American foreign exchange trading for Citibank. "Maybe we are not throwing good money after bad. Maybe it will work."
 So far, currency traders said Tokyo's new investment initiative had yet to generate big Japanese purchases of dollars, let alone of American stocks or bonds. For the moment, the prospect of such buying getting under way has been enough to satisfy participants in the foreign exchange market.
 Indeed, the sentiment has turned to such an extent that this week the dollar was able to withstand a series of events that in the recent past would probably have sent it reeling.
 "Something fundamental is going on," Mr. Buchen said. "I think that after sitting in a state of denial, or stoicism, for almost a year, the Japanese recognize that the dollar is a problem."
 Mr. Buchen and others said they were not surprised that Japanese investors were not significant purchasers of American Treasury securities at this week's quarterly refunding auctions. But in the next breath they said they expected to see purchases of dollar-denominated assets by Japanese and other foreign investors pick up over the next six months or so.

HEADLINE: Bond Selloff Hurts Stocks, With the Dow Off 25.36

BYLINE: By LEONARD SLOANE 

 BODY:
The stock market was rocked by a selloff in the bond market yesterday and fell despite two generally favorable economic reports.
 The Government reported that the Consumer Price Index rose only two-tenths of 1 percent last month, while retail sales slipped one-tenth of 1 percent. Both reports were viewed, at least initially, as indications of subdued inflation. 
 But bond prices still declined, weighed down by the large supply of new Treasury securities and lingering concerns about future inflationary pressures. The new 30-year Treasury bond dropped 13/32 and its yield jumped to 6.97 percent -- its highest point in three months -- from an average of 6.906 percent at Thursday's auction.
 Stocks followed bonds downward as money managers lightened their portfolios, although there were still pockets of strength on a sluggish summer trading day.
 "The market has gone up quite substantially and there has been no trigger to take it down until recently," said Rao Chalasani, chief investment strategist of Kemper Securities in Chicago. "The trigger yesterday was the sloppiness in the bond market."
 The Dow Jones industrial average, which was weaker than the other major averages, fell 25.36 points to close at 4,618.30. The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index lost 2.34 points, to 555.11. But a rally in technology stocks helped the Nasdaq composite index gain 3.50 points, to 1,004.11.
 Declining stocks outnumbered advancing issues on the New York Stock Exchange, 1,359 to 840. But trading was thin, with Big Board volume sliding to 265.9 million shares, from 306.7 million shares on Thursday and far below the three-month average of 347 million shares.
 Oil stocks fell, as analysts voiced concern over weak crude oil and natural-gas prices. Exxon dropped 5/8, to 69 3/8, and Chevron was down 5/16 , to 48 7/8.
 Drug issues were also lower, apparently because of worries that a stronger dollar would narrow foreign profits for multinational pharmaceutical companies. Eli Lilly closed at 75 7/8, down 1/8; Merck was at 50 1/8, down 3/8; Johnson & Johnson was at 68 5/8, down 1 1/4, and Pfizer closed at 49, down 1 1/8.
 New Federal proposals to declare nicotine an addictive drug pushed down the prices of tobacco stocks. Philip Morris fell 1 1/2, to 72, while RJR Nabisco was down 3/4, to 27 1/8, and the American depository receipts of B.A.T. Industries were off 3/8, to 16.
 Semiconductor issues, however, traded higher, after a report that the ratio of new orders to shipments was substantially above Wall Street estimates. Intel advanced 1 7/8, to 66 1/8; Micron Technology was up 7/8, to 62 7/8, and Texas Instruments rose 2, to 149 1/2. Advanced Micro Devices climbed 1/2, to 33 1/2, and Motorola rose 1 3/8, to 76 3/4.
 Some computer software makers also rose, with Microsoft jumping 2 3/8, to 96 1/2, and Borland picking up 3/8, to 11 5/8.
 Elco Industries surged 11 1/2, to 30 3/4, a day after Illinois Tool Works made a hostile bid at 27.
 But America Online declined 2 7/8, to 62 3/8, after the company warned analysts against overestimating its profits. And Midisoft slumped 1 7/8, to 5 1/4, a day after reporting a second-quarter loss.

HEADLINE: U.S. Bond Prices Fall On New Data

BYLINE: By ROBERT HURTADO 

 BODY:
Against a backdrop of supply concern, prices of Treasury securities turned sour yesterday after reports on consumer prices and retail sales failed to provide enough evidence of a slowing in economic growth and inflation.
 Market participants feared the reports did not bode well for another interest rate cut; rather, the Fed could put any cut on hold as long as there is a chance that the economy could pick up steam and raise inflation pressures. 
 The new 30-year bond dropped 1 3/32 of a percentage point, to a price of 98 25/32 ; its yield, which moves in the opposite direction from its price, rose to 6.970 percent, from the average yield at auction on Thursday of 6.906 percent. That means that for every $1,000 of bonds held, holders lost about $11. Shorter-maturity bill rates and yields on intermediate issues also felt the pressure of supply. Some market watchers speculated that Wall Street wound up holding a lot of the new 3-year and 10-year notes auctioned this week. It was likely then that dealers were discounting them to move them out.
 Elsewhere, the July Consumer Price Index and its core figure each rose two-tenths of 1 percent, as expected.
 Retail sales unexpectedly fell one-tenth of 1 percent, but not counting auto sales rose a less-than-expected four-tenths of 1 percent, the Commerce Department reported. Traders said market forecasts had called for a two-tenths of 1 percent gain in the overall data and a five-tenths of 1 percent nonauto rise. But Ken McCarthy, founder of Economic Intelligence, a market research firm, said consumer spending was not so weak as the retail sales decline suggested, and the pace of spending during the second half of the year would remain solid.
 With the data somewhat disappointing, the market was vulnerable to downside pressures because of the recent large supply of new securities brought on by the Treasury's quarterly refunding this week and the prospects of further supply. Next week, the Treasury will sell $18.25 billion of new 52-week bills and at the same time announce the size of its two-year and five-year note auctions for the following week. The Federal Open Market Committee also meets the following week.
 Eugene J. Sherman, director of research at M. A. Schapiro & Company, said the economy had settled into a moderate growth track while exhibiting, at most, mild inflation. "Against that backdrop," he added, "the broadening view is that the Federal Reserve will maintain a stable monetary policy for the next couple of months at least."
 While the market ignored the dollar's gathering strength, analysts suggested that if the tone of the market changed to positive, the dollar could become a driving factor. But supply was in the driver's seat yesterday and prices dropped.
 Anthony Chan, chief economist for Banc One Investment Advisors, said a news service report yesterday "speculating that the Fed may further delay its easing moves and possibly consider tightening at a later date certainly threw cold water on the market and raised the market's fear of the retail sales report."
 Mr. Chan added: "The behavior of the credit markets this week does suggest that markets remain queasy about supply. Even a favorable 10-year note and 30-year bond auction were not good enough to produce favorable follow-through reaction in the credit markets."
 This suggests that any sort of supply is not likely to be received with open arms by the market, he said, referring to next week's two-year and five-year auctions.
 Looking to next week, Mr. Chan said that the markets had already discounted a large drop in industrial production and capacity utilization as aresult of the 85,000 drop in manufacturing employment. Consequently, he said, the focus of the market was more likely to be on Thursday's August report of the Philadelphia Fed of regional business activity and the Friday Michigan sentiment report, both of which are more forward looking.
 Mr. McCarthy of Economic Intelligence expects growth in the second half of this year to be around 3 percent, propelled by stronger consumer spending. "But growth will not explode, and inflation will remain low," he said. "This is an environment in which the Fed can lower rates, and they will, but not until late in the year."

HEADLINE: INTERNATIONAL BUSINESS;
Germans Are Urged to Let Shops Stay Open at Night

BYLINE: By NATHANIEL C. NASH 

DATELINE: FRANKFURT, Aug. 11

 BODY:
For decades, one rule above all others has been inviolate in German retailing: never on Sunday. Thanks to the strictest closing hours in Europe, shops in Germany turn off the lights every weekday except Thursday by 6:30 P.M., are open only one Saturday afternoon a month and, of course, stay tightly shuttered on Sunday.
 But now, in the most serious assault on this famous German tradition and the powerful retailing union that has fiercely defended it, politicians and industrialists appear to have found the ammunition to finally bring about a major change. 
 Today, in a long-awaited report whose recommendations the governing parties have promised to follow, one of the country's most prestigious economic research groups proposed that stores be permitted to stay open until 10 P.M. on weekdays and 6 P.M. on Saturdays. But even the experts, who see the change as part of the broader effort to restore flexibility to the arthritic German economy, were not prepared to go so far as to overturn the prohibition against Sunday selling.
 The study, carried out by the Ifo Institute for Economic Research of Munich, was commissioned by Germany's Economic Minister, Gunter Rexrodt. Leaders in Parliament have said they would carry out its recommendations. A spokesman for Chancellor Helmut Kohl's Christian Democratic Union predicted passage of legislation before the end of the year.
 Behind the debate over the law governing closing hours is a far-reaching struggle that touches on deeply held cultural beliefs. The battle pits industry against labor and generation against generation over whether Germany's economic vitality has been sapped by decades of encrusted regulations that govern much of daily life. With unemployment still high despite the rebound of the economy this year, business leaders have become increasingly adamant in their insistence that tough labor laws often make Germany an unattractive place for companies to set up operations.
 "This is not really a plan to boost retail sales, but it's an issue of whether Germany is an attractive place to invest," said Bernd Janssen, retail analyst in Frankfurt for UBS Global Research. "You have to put this in the context of an overall discussion of how to make Germany more flexible and competitive internationally."
 Just this week, Volkswagen, the giant German auto maker, began a new round of negotiations with its unions trying to get them to agree to more flexible working hours. Such rigidities, coupled with the highest wages and benefits paid in Europe, have prompted many economists to warn that German industry, over the long run, will migrate elsewhere.
 Indeed, both Mercedes-Benz and BMW are setting up new American auto plants, in part, to escape the high costs of manufacturing in Germany.
 German unemployment, at 8.3 percent, is high by post-World War II standards and is not expected to come down soon.
 The IFO report argued that loosening the store closing hours would generate more than 50,000 new jobs and add about $14 billion a year to retail sales in Germany, a 2 percent increase.
 But even supporters of the change said the direct impact was much less important than the deeper symbolism represented by the assault on the tight restrictions. "You're really talking about people who work until 8 in the evening who don't have time to shop, and that number is not really that significant," Mr. Janssen said.
 Polls here show that Germans are divided on whether they want to be able to shop later in the evening and on Saturday afternoons. The idea of cities that slow to a hush at night and after 2 P.M. on Saturday, leaving the rest of the time for relaxation and leisure, is hard to shake.
 As the country has enjoyed among the highest standards of living in Europe, Germans have also insisted more and more on extending their leisure time.
Germany is now almost alone among European countries that have not tailored their retail hours along American lines. In France and England there are no limits on store hours Monday through Saturday, and in Italy stores can stay open until 8 P.M. during the week, and 9 P.M. in the summer.
 But in Germany, enforcement of the closing hours is well known. Retailers who close late are often sued by their neighboring stores, and customers can find store clerks often refuse to ring up purchases after the closing time.
 The polls have found that mostly young people support the longer hours while older shoppers are satisfied with keeping the tradition.
 The closing hours have been a boon to gas station convenience stores and shops in airports and train stations, where customers often line up to buy milk, bread and cold cuts.
 Even within the retail trade the issue is still debated. The German Retail Association says it does little extra business Thursday evenings, when shops are open an extra two hours. And the retail union has argued that any new jobs that will be created will be mainly part time.
 Moreover, while the politicians in Bonn may want to rush through a change, buying bread after 6:30 may still not be possible until 1997. Current wage contracts do not expire until Jan. 1, 1997, and they also happen to govern the issue of working hours.
 Labor officials contend that to change closing hours, the industry will have to open up the contracts, giving the unions the chance to negotiate further wage increases. And they predict retailers will not want that to happen.

HEADLINE: While Others Sell Recyclables, New York Pays to Get Rid of Them

BYLINE: By JOHN SULLIVAN 

 BODY:
Oyster Bay, L.I., sells its recycled metal, glass and plastic for $25 a ton. Mercer County, N.J., sells its for $9.50 a ton, and Middlesex County, N.J., sells its for a minimum of $20.
 New York City, on the other hand, pays recycling operators $40 to $50 a ton to accept the same material. Last year it spent $8 million to get rid of material that some recycling plant operators are willing to pay for. 
 The City Sanitation Department says the disparity exists because too much worthless material is mixed in with the glass, metal and plastic that city residents put in recycling bins, spoiling the value to potential vendors. The department also says that operating costs are higher for recycling vendors in New York than in the surrounding communities.
 "I think they are getting a fair payment," said Robert Lange, director of the Sanitation Department's recycling operations, "I think the city is getting a fair deal."
 But the city's former recycling consultant, and executives at recycling processors, say that New York is throwing money away by paying companies to take the material when it should be making money, or at least breaking even. The potential savings -- $8 million to $11 million -- is only a tiny fraction of the city's $31.1 billion budget, but the city's fiscal problems have produced battles over lesser sums.
 "New York should be being paid for that material," said Lawrence Schorr, president of Resource Recycling Technology, a subsidiary of Waste Management Inc., one of the largest private trash companies in the country. "It is a false assumption that these materials are not valuable."
 Mr. Schorr, whose company runs about 150 recycling plants nationwide, acknowledged that it is more expensive to process material from a city than from a smaller town because of the greater amount of trash usually mixed with the recyclable material. But he said that a well-run recycling facility should be able to make enough money on the material to offer some return to the city.
 He pointed to his company's plant in Syracuse as an example. "The current value of the container stream in Syracuse, which would be substantially similar to New York City, would be $85 per ton," Mr. Schorr said. "That is the sale price of all the materials. The cost of recovering that material, depending on the volume and the kind of system that one would use, can be as low as $30 per ton."
 Even allowing for differences in the New York and Syracuse material, and for the costs of equipment and rent, New York should be able to dispose of the recyclable material for free, Mr. Schorr said.
Across the country, several other big cities earn money from metal, glass and plastic. Los Angeles gets $35 a ton. Dallas and Philadelphia also sell their bottles and cans to recycling vendors, while Boston disposes of its for free. Chicago, on the other hand, pays a vendor $19 per ton to process its recycled waste, but the price is still much lower than what New York pays.
 The disparity between what New York City pays and what other cities and towns get is in part a reflection of the skyrocketing value of what only a few years ago was considered garbage. When the city began its recycling program in 1988, there was barely a market at all for discarded paper, plastic and glass. Now, old newspapers sell for $117 a ton, glass sells for $23 a ton and some kinds of plastic sell for $300 a ton.
 But in a classic case of bad timing, New York awarded five-year contracts to four companies in 1993, just before the market for recycled goods exploded. At the time, city officials decided that if they offered to pay companies a fixed price to accept metal, glass and plastic, recyclers would be encouraged to set up operations in New York.
 In contrast, when the city signed contracts for recycled paper in the early 1990's, it agreed to a price that was pegged to the paper market. As a result of a consistent increase in price, the city now makes $17 million a year from its paper contracts.
 Two months ago, the city recognized the increase in the metal, glass and plastic markets and renegotiated its contracts. But in the negotiation, Sanitation Department officials agreed to continue payments to vendors. The vendors agreed to allow the city to reduce the payments if the market improved.
 For every $1 increase in the market price, the city would be allowed to reduce the payments to the vendors by 35 cents. The contractors and the city agreed to use the prices from September 1993, which was when the contracts were originally signed, as a base to measure increases.
 Mr. Lange said "in an ideal world" the city would have reduced its payments by $1 for each dollar the market increased since 1993. But he said the 35-cent figure was reached through negotiations with the contractors.
 At that rate, the city will probably find itself paying recycling vendors to accept material that both the city and the vendor agree is worth money on the open market. If the city was paying a vendor $45 per ton before the renegotiation -- the lowest bid price among the four contractors that handle the material -- the market price would have to increase by $129 per ton before the city could break even.
 Critics are asking whether the contractors are reaping a windfall at taxpayers' expense. "Obviously in the current market they are making a lot per ton, more money than if they were getting the material elsewhere," said Allan Dickar, an economist with the city's former recycling consultant, the Queens College Center for the Biology of Natural Systems.
 Kendall Christiansen, the head of New York's Citywide Recycling Advisory Board, said the only way for the city to find out if it could sell its recyclable waste on the open market would be to cancel the existing contracts and seek new bids.
 But Mr. Christiansen, who also is a spokesman for Resource Inc., one of four companies with recycling contracts with the city, said that canceling the contracts would be unfair to vendors who signed five-year contracts with the city. Mr. Christiansen also said he doubted whether the city would receive a better deal.
 "They struck a business deal with firms to establish the plants and get into the business," Mr. Christiansen said. "To turn around and rebid the contract, and say we want to rebid it because we think we can get a better deal; if the city did that, they might get fewer bidders."
 Mr. Christiansen's company receives $44.98 for each ton of bottles and cans it takes from the city.
 Mr. Christiansen said the city used the fixed price contract when it originally sought bids from recycling companies in 1993 because it was easy to administer and because it encouraged companies to come forward. He said that for the long term, the city would be better off with a contract that shared revenues between the recycling vendors and the city.
 "It was sufficient for the early years to get companies into the game, but as a long-term strategy it is not up to the task," Mr. Christiansen said. "If the city put a contract on the street that was a revenue sharing contract, or an indexed contract, we would not have a problem dealing with that."
 Mr. Lange said the city will probably seek new bids before the contract expires in 1999. But he said city officials did not want to do it too soon for fear that it could damage the area's market for recycled material.
 "You don't want to send that kind of chaos out into the recycling community unless it is absolutely necessary," he said.
 Mr. Lange said he thought that the current contract was fair to the city because so much worthless material is mixed in with the cans and bottles.
 But managers at recycling companies that do not contract for the city's metal, glass and plastic said New York is undervaluing the material. They said that other municipalities in New York state, like towns on Long Island and upstate cities, are successfully marketing their recyclables.
 Mr. Schorr said a plant should be able to accept New York's material at no cost.
 "Absolutely, no question about it, it could be received at the door of the recycler for little or no charge," he said.
 The Queens College Center for the Biology of Natural Systems has done an analysis of New York's bottle and can recycling program and has concluded that unless the city changes its metal, glass and plastic contract, it will continue to spend millions unnecessarily.
 "Given the situation in the market, there is no question that the city should be gaining considerable income from its recycling program," said Barry Commoner, director of the Queens College Center for the Biology of Natural Systems. "The fact that it hasn't is a result of the kinds of contracts that have been signed."
 Mr. Dickar, the center's economist who performed the analysis, said that if the city were to receive an average of $21 a ton for its metal, glass and plastic, it would earn $3.6 million a year. Mr. Dickar said that the total loss to the city, that income plus the amount expected to be paid to vendors, is $11 million a year.

HEADLINE: The Serbs Show Their Knack for Defeat

BYLINE: By Jack Miles; Jack Miles is director of the Humanities Center of the Claremont Graduate School.

DATELINE: CLAREMONT, Calif.

 BODY:
Defeat, some say, is the Serb form of happy ending. Rebecca West, who loved the Serbs as only a fellow romantic could, devoted the most profound pages of "Black Lamb and Grey Falcon," her study of the South Slavs, to a meditation on "Kosovo Polye," the Serb national epic. In that poem, which recalls a battle of 1389, the Serb leader, Prince Lazar, is betrayed to the Turks by one of his followers.
Yet it is not the betrayal that causes the ensuing catastrophic defeat: In the hour of decision, Prince Lazar chooses defeat because nothing is more poignant, more perfect, more heroic than death for a sacred cause. The Serbs' love affair with defeat, West argued, shaped their entire political culture. 
 Unromantic British and American analysts of the current Balkan war, who were announcing as recently as two weeks ago that "the Serbs have won," should re-read West. As the Croatian advances show, the Serbs have been unable to solidify a victory the West was intent on handing them.
What is most striking is the extent to which, over the past six years, the Serbs have chosen defeat.
It was suicidally romantic nationalism rather than canny pragmatism that led Serbian President Slobodan Milosevic in 1990 to revoke regional autonomy for Serbia's ethnic Hungarians and Albanians. His action won Serbia nothing, but it provided crucial cover for the secession of Slovenia and Croatia from the still intact Yugoslav federation, which Serbia dominated.
The Serbs sought to recover by attacking Slovenia, but they lost. Then they attacked Croatia, but they succeeded only in taking control of some border territory. Much of the Serb-held land in Croatia, the Krajina region, has now been lost in a spectacular but foreseeable defeat.
In Bosnia-Herzegovina, the ethnic Serbs tossed aside one chance after another to have their early gains turned into a permanent victory with great-power guarantees. The British, French and Russians were eager to award them with the larger part of the territory they had "ethnically cleansed" of its Muslim and Croat population. But the Bosnian Serbs held out for a larger victory.
Now, as their leaders turn on one another, victory is slipping away. Months ago, the fall of Bihac to the Bosnian Serbs was said to be only hours away. But that town is still in Bosnian Government hands. For three years, Serb artillery has been softening Sarajevo up for a ground assault that has yet to come. Will it ever?
Mr. Milosevic is the Prince Lazar of his day. The West was prepared to lift economic sanctions against his country and hail him as a statesman if he would but recognize Croatia and an independent remnant of Bosnia-Herzegovina. But he spurned the offers, seeking a larger victory though clandestine support of the Bosnian Serbs.
What, if not a mad romanticism, can have led Mr. Milosevic to expect the Serb 30 percent of the population to hold 70 percent of the territory indefinitely against an enemy who was increasingly well-armed and would fight on indefinitely because he had nowhere to run?
The claim that the Serbs have won in Bosnia can only stick if the major powers make it stick -- that is, if they make Croatia keep its forces outside Bosnia. The West has shown little inclination to do so. The Bosnian Serbs reportedly fear a joint Croatian-Bosnian assault on the Serb-held city of Banja Luka.
What of Sarajevo itself? Speculation about a deal between Mr. Milosevic and Croatian President Franjo Tudjman -- a move that could salvage a Serb victory of sorts, has been undercut by rumors that Mr. Milosevic may be overthrown. Even if he survives and Serbs hold their Bosnian territory, Bosnia's Muslims and Croats would create a classic Balkan quagmire for the one aggressor that might have known better.
In Joseph Conrad's "Lord Jim," an English sailor abandons a sinking ship whose passengers are all Muslim pilgrims. Jim does the realistic thing. After all, the ship is sinking; surely he cannot be expected to save them all. But the ship does not sink and drifts to land, and Jim spends the rest of his life running from the memory of his disgrace.
So it may be for the West in the Balkans. In its haste to end the war, the West may have declared Bosnia-Herzegovina dead only to discover otherwise. Nothing is so irretrievably humiliating as to abandon, in the name of realism, a loser who goes on to win.

HEADLINE: Russia Is Shocked

 BODY:
To the Editor:
John Lloyd's celebration of "How Russia Became a Market Economy," by the Swedish economist Anders Aslund (July 23), brings us full circle on the "shock therapy" policy he helped design with Harvard's Jeffrey Sachs. 
 Shock therapy, which involved the quick-and-dirty demolition of the old system before a new one had been built, was launched in early 1989 with the editorial support of The New York Times. Mr. Aslund now writes a definitive "proof" that the policy succeeded, except that it would have succeeded more if there had been more shock -- defined as "a rapid reduction in the budget deficit." The Times, in turn, assigns the book to Mr. Lloyd, who celebrated the Aslund-Sachs "shock therapy" during his tenure as Moscow bureau chief of The Financial Times of London.
It seems one big happy family. The only reservation Mr. Lloyd has is that while there is now a market in Russia, "the rise in overt crime and corruption (which reform has not caused, but has certainly not cured either) threatens not just the reforms but the state itself." Those of us who fought the Anders-Sachs method from its inception did in fact argue that monetary reform had to precede the destruction of the state's command mechanism or civil chaos would follow. This, in order to permit a private banking system to replace the centralized allocation of capital.
Instead, the "market" economy created is merely a black market that lives according to the law of the jungle. Beijing, on the other hand, rejected cold-turkey capitalism for the careful conversion that is being cheered by its people. The editors of The Times only kid themselves with this rosy review of Mr. Aslund's fiasco.
How is it that the same editorialists who thrill to shock therapy in Moscow are correctly horrified when Republican leaders in the 104th Congress beat the drums for shock therapy at home? Drastic action to balance the national budget in either country is an act of intellectual desperation. It invariably puts the burden of adjustment on the poorest and weakest people in society.

HEADLINE: THE CAPITALIST;
Ruble Roulette

BYLINE: By MICHAEL LEWIS 

 BODY:
ON THE morning of July 20, I was busy ducking requests from the editors of this magazine to write a column about Alan Greenspan when I opened the newspaper and discovered Tatyana Paramonova. The most recent nominee to head the Central Bank of Russia, Paramonova had been rejected for the second time by the Russian Parliament. In her eight months as acting chairwoman, she had cut the annual rate of Russian inflation from around 1,200 percent to 225 percent. But in the end she had run afoul of a superior force -- Russian bankers. "Paramonova has declared war on large Russian banks," a banker was quoted in The Financial Times, "so we have no alternative but to declare war on her." It turns out that Russian banks borrow long-term at fixed rates of interest from the Central Bank of Russia, and lend short-term to their customers. High inflation allows them to repay their debts to the Central Bank with cheaper rubles.
As a substitute for Greenspan, it is true that Paramonova had her disadvantages. She was a long way from New York; she had little immediate effect on the United States bond market; and while the slightest monetary miscue in America is surprising and newsworthy, total chaos in Russia is not. But that's almost the point. The American way of life is now more likely to be screwed up by the Central Bank of Russia than by the Federal Reserve Board. Central bankers in rich countries no longer have the power to commit serious crimes against their economies. Greenspan would be stripped of his authority by American bankers long before he would be allowed to debase the dollar badly. But whoever replaces Paramonova will be in precisely the opposite position: her successor's mandate from Russian bankers will be to hyperinflate the ruble and thereby pave the way for yet another Russian revolution. 
 Back in 1988 at one of the first Fed meetings run by Greenspan, a fellow governor brought up a curious fact. There were fewer $100 bills circulating inside the United States than inside the Soviet Union. So meaningless was the ruble that the dollar had replaced the Soviet measure of value. In early 1991, as the Soviet Union unraveled, the need for a sound ruble became an article of faith among Russian bigwigs. An influential banker named Viktor Gerashchenko claimed that "the Soviet people want a Central Bank that will sometimes say 'nyet' to the Government." That year the Central Bank of Russia announced its first great ruble reform: it froze all savings accounts and declared all 50- and 100-ruble notes worthless, all of which lead a Russian electrician standing outside the bank that had confiscated his life savings to famously proclaim, "First there was nothing to buy, and now there is no money to buy it with. In the Soviet Union, this is economic reform."
BUT THE SUBSEQUENT behavior of the new Russian state made the Soviet reform look like an economics seminar at the University of Chicago. By September 1991, austerity was again out of fashion. One chairman of the Central Bank was tossed out and another dragged in, namely the above-mentioned Viktor Gerashchenko. Fifty- and 100-ruble notes were printed again, together with a new 500-ruble note. In the fall of 1992, after yet another failed attempt at reform, the ruble was allowed to float a bit against the dollar. (The official exchange rate had been fixed so that the ruble appeared to be worth more than a dollar.) It opened at a penny and fell quickly to less than half a cent. In January 1993, with the Central Bank printing money so rapidly that it feared running out of paper, the ruble collapsed to one-tenth of one cent. In July 1993, the Central Bank declared yet another reform: all rubles printed before 1993 were worthless. At the same time, it printed new rubles even faster than before so that they, too, became worthless. Inflation spiraled upward until October 1994, when Gerashchenko resigned and the ruble fell to its low of about one-fiftieth of one American penny (that is, one dollar fetched 5,130 rubles).
AS ANYONE KNOWS who has skimmed The World Book Encyclopedia, the history of Russia can be understood as a struggle between the White Russians and the Slavs, or the Russians with long necks who want to be more like the West and the Russians with thick necks who don't. The long necks may drag Russia westward for a while, but the thick necks eventually drag it back into oblivion. To preserve their dignity and often their lives, the long necks erect a Potemkin village of sorts and then retreat hastily to Paris, until the time comes when the thick necks discredit themselves so much that the long necks are given another chance.
Last month, I think, may be viewed as the moment the long necks gave up and erected their Potemkin village. A few days before Paramonova's telling defeat in Parliament, the ruble was anchored to the dollar. Another reform! The Central Bank of Russia promises that from now until Oct. 1, the ruble will rise no higher than 4,300 and fall no further than 4,900. Supporters of the new move offer two arguments: the first is that it will reduce uncertainty and thus encourage investment; the second is that it "improves discipline." That is, when hungry serfs demand rubles to reap the potato harvest, as they always have at this time of year, the Central Bank chairman, whoever that ends up being, can point to the dollar and say, "Sorry, we need to keep the ruble strong, and so this year you'll have to starve."
OR SO GOES THE THEORY. In practice, the pressures to finance the war in Chechnya, to pay the 1.5 million Government workers who recently took to the streets to demand back pay and to harvest potatoes are what they always were. That is why the behavior of the Russian bankers is so unsettling: Now is the time the Russian bankers are meant to unite and squash the serfs, to preserve the value of their debts to the banks.
Every once in a while some outraged journalist proves once and for all that the Federal Reserve is a conspiracy of American bankers to make the rich richer and the poor poorer. The argument usually turns on the belief that a low rate of inflation helps rich people by preserving the value of their dollars but hurts poor people by slowing the economy. The theory is in many ways ridiculous. For instance, the cost of inflation falls less on the rich than on people with fixed incomes, who tend to be middle class or lower, but it does include at least one indisputable truth: rich people everywhere do indeed loathe inflation. Everywhere but Russia, where the rich have long since abandoned their currency for ours.

French in the Islands
 Q. Do you know of any French-language schools in the Caribbean islands? -- L. M. B., Somerville, N.J. 
 A. The French islands of Guadeloupe and Martinique, integral parts of France, now provide language and culture programs designed for foreign students, particularly those from the United States.
The Centre International de Recherches d'Echanges et de Cooperation de la Caraibes et des Ameriques, with facilities on both islands has begun a program called Le Francais aux Ameriques (French in the Americas).
Nine-week courses at beginner, intermediate and advanced levels give students 420 hours of instruction, while an intensive two-week course provides 60 hours.
There are also special classes for French teachers from the United States in the Easter break, lasting 68 hours, and during the summer (175 hours).
In Guadeloupe the cost of the courses for an individual student start at 4,500 francs (about $978, calculating 4.6 francs to the dollar) for the two-week course. Lodging is provided at an additional cost.
In Martinique arrangements are similar, but, in general, groups with a minimum of 10 students are preferred. The cost per person drops to 2,200 francs (about $478).
For detailed information about the programs in Guadeloupe contact Cirecca, Post Office Box 44, Petit Bourg 95179, Guadeloupe, French West Indies; telephone (590) 95.64.72, fax (590) 94.36.03.
For information on the Martinique programs contact Cirecca, Post Office Box 393, Fort-de-France 97258, Martinique, French West Indies; (596) 73.45.19, fax (596) 60.51.04.
 
Expo in Portugal
 Q. My wife and I enjoy going to Expos and we understand that there will be an Expo coming up in Lisbon. Can you give me any more information? -- Bernard S. Greenbaum, Kew Gardens, Queens
A. Expo '98, the theme of which will be "The Oceans and the Seas," will open in eastern Lisbon on June 10, 1998, the year Portugal commemorates the 500th anniversary of Vasco da Gama's historic voyage to India.
The Expo, the first to be held in Portugal and the last to be held this century, will be built on a 62-acre site on the banks of Tagus River in an economically depressed area that will be subject to a huge urban renewal project. The exhibition, which will continue for three months and cost an estimated $565 million, will leave a legacy of new parks and housing, road networks, shopping centers and cultural sites. It is expected to attract some nine million visitors.
The exhibition hopes to stress the interdependence of the oceans and the atmosphere and the effects of this on the climate; to build an awareness of the need to safeguard the world's marine heritage, and to provide a forum for the exchange of information and experience.

To London and Paris
 Q. I know the Changing of the Guard in London has cut down its daily routine. How can I find out what days they march? And as I will be in Paris for Beaujolais Nouveau are there any special events planned for the occasion? -- Dennis F. Curran, Havertown, Pa.
A. As of last Sunday and until Sept. 1, the Changing of the Guard takes place at 11:30 A.M. every other day on even-numbered days (before last Sunday it was held daily at the same time). Starting on Sept. 1 it will switch to every other day on odd-numbered days. Next May 1 it will again be held every day.
The ceremony lasts 40 minutes and takes place inside the railings of Buckingham Palace. The Guards, usually drawn from the Foot Guards of the Household Division, leave Wellington Barracks at 11:27 A.M. and march by way of Birdcage Walk to the palace.
The Old Guard forms up in the palace forecourt, going off duty and handing over to the New Guard. The guard, normally two men at each post, is reduced to a single guard at each post when Queen Elizabeth is not in residence at the palace. The Queen is there if her Royal Standard is flying from the flagpole on top of the palace. The ceremony is canceled in bad weather.
The nearest Underground stations to the palace are St. James's Park and Green Park.
Meanwhile, a separate ceremony is held at Horse Guards Parade on Whitehall. The Mounted Guard Changing Ceremony takes place daily, Monday to Saturday at 11 A.M. and Sunday at 10 A.M. The nearest Underground stations to Horse Guards Parade are Charing Cross and Westminster.
As for Paris, be prepared for a citywide celebration of Beaujolais Nouveau on the third Thursday of November, this year the 16th.
The wine will be tasted and judged in just about every restaurant and bistro. One of the highlights is the awarding of "Les Meilleurs Pots" by the Rabelais Academy, a group of journalists and painters who are wine connoisseurs, to the bistros they consider warm and friendly and which serve good wine and food.
These are a few of the past winners:
Les Pipos, 2 Rue de l'Ecole Polytechnique, (1993 winner), 43.54.11.40; Metro, Maubert Mutualite.
La Tour de Pierre, 53 Rue Dauphine (1992), 43.26.08.93; Metro, Dauphine.
Le Vin des Rues, 21 Rue Boulard, (1989), 43.22.19.78; Metro, Denfert Rochereau.
 
South African Weather
 Q. My husband and I will be traveling to South Africa in late October. What will the weather will be like in Johannesburg, Pretoria and Cape Town? And how formal is dress in these three cities? -- Suzanne L. Ethridge, Farmington Hills, Mich.
A. October is springtime in South Africa, considered by some travelers the best time to visit.
Johannesburg and Pretoria are both in what is called Gauteng, or high veld region, most of it above 4,000 feet, where temperatures are rarely excessive and low humidity and many hours of sunshine make for a pleasant and healthy climate.
In October look for average highs of 77 degrees in Johannesburg and lows of 53, with precipitation at 2.2 inches.
In Pretoria highs average 80 degrees and lows 55, also with 2.2 inches of precipitation.
Cape Town, in the Cape Mediterranean region, is a little windier than the other two and you might need a sweater at night. In October average highs should be around 70 degrees and lows 52, with precipitation at 1.2 inches. In November the highs pick up to 73.
South Africa is not in general a formal country, but for dinner in a good restaurant men would look out of place if they were not wearing a jacket and tie. At night women generally favor a dress with perhaps a cardigan for the cooler evenings. TERENCE NEILAN

Not Quite on a Spree, but Getting Acquisitive Again

BYLINE: By RITA REIF 

 BODY:
MUSEUMS HAVE BEEN Surprisingly active this year in expanding their holdings of decorative arts and design objects through gifts and purchases. While no one is claiming a sharp upsurge in acquisitions, which have been depressed for nearly a decade, a slight but noticeable increase has been reported.
"Such gifts are going up again," said Ashton Hawkins, executive vice president and counsel to the trustees at the Metropolitan Museum of Art. "And the renewed tax deductibility did help." He was referring to a recent easing of tax rules for art donors. 
 The range of objects donated or bought could hardly be broader; they run from ancient African art to modern Japanese design, from an 18th-century chandelier to Tupperware. The Cleveland Museum of Art recently purchased a 2,000-year-old Nok head of a man, a vigorously modeled, footlong work in terra cotta of a type that is little known in this country. Such ceramic sculptures are named after the village of Nok in central Nigeria, where they were first unearthed by tin miners in 1928.
The Cleveland's head is highly expressive, with staring hollows for eyes, open mouth and nostrils, and floral roundels covering the hair. It was produced between 600 B.C. and A.D. 250.
While market forces underlie most purchases by museums, gifts are made for many reasons, or sometimes spontaneously. "I knew about this Japanese wheelchair, and I wanted to see it for possible use in our show," said Paula Antonelli, an associate curator at the Museum of Modern Art who organized "Mutant Materials in Contemporary Design," an exhibition that will remain at the museum through Aug. 27. Ms. Antonelli found out from Kazuo Kawasaki, the designer of the chair -- a fold-up innovation that weighs a mere 13 pounds -- that it was available only in Japan. Rather than just sending the chair as a loan, Mr. Kawasaki donated it to the museum's collection.
Similarly, at the Metropolitan Museum of Art, an 18th-century gilded wood chandelier was added to the new Annie Laurie Atkin Galleries a few days before the galleries opened in June. The rare lighting fixture, carved about 1715 in the style of Daniel Marot, was sold in April at Christie's in New York to Jayne Wrightsman, a museum trustee and longtime donor. "Mrs. Wrightsman wanted to acquire an important object for the new English galleries," said William Rieder, an associate curator. The chandelier, which had been expected to sell for at most $500,000, brought much more: it cost Mrs. Wrightsman $717,500.
 WHILE DONATIONS OF Objects and money to museums have rebounded a bit, they have not returned to the record levels of the early 1980's. Gifts of art to all nonprofit organizations were significantly curtailed by the Tax Reform Act of 1986, under which donors could deduct no more than an artwork's original purchase price, which might be substantially less than its current value. In 1991, for one year, donors were allowed once again to claim the market value of the gifts. And in 1993, President Clinton's tax bill made market-value deductions permanent.
"Tax-wise, it was less attractive to give, and then the economy wasn't all that great either," said Graham Hood, the chief curator at Colonial Williamsburg in Virginia. Actually, Williamsburg was able to buy a prize piece of Americana, a colorfully painted dower chest, when it was auctioned by Sotheby's from a Virginia collection in May.
The chest, made about 1800 by Johannes Spitler of Shenandoah County, was expected to bring, at most, $60,000, but went instead for $343,500, a record at auction for painted American furniture. "There will now be a slight hiatus in our buying," Mr. Hood said.
The Virginia Museum of Fine Arts was also active in that sale, paying $57,500 for a towering 1820 clock by Jacob Danner, a German-born Virginia craftsman. And kitchen products by Tupperware Worldwide, the Florida plastics producer, which is celebrating its the 50th anniversary, were donated by Morrison Cousins, the designer of the 1990's versions. He sent 13 contemporary pieces but none of the originals.
This year, the Carnegie Museum of Art in Pittsburgh received its largest gift ever, "The Chariot of Aurora," an Art Deco wall 18 feet high and 26 feet long from the grand salon of the Normandie, the French superliner of the 1930's. The 32 sculptured and lacquered panels depicting dawn, dusk and the four winds were made by the artists Jean Dupas and Jean Dunand. The donor, Frederick Koch, an heir to a Kansas oil fortune, had bought the wall in 1984 for about $2.5 million.
"We've received scattered gifts and one important bequest of American modernist art this year," said Louise Lippincott, curator of fine arts at the Carnegie. "But the Normandie panels have to take the cake. We're going to subdivide one of our biggest galleries and raise the ceiling six feet. It should be spectacular, like adding a glamourous set from a Fred Astaire movie."

HEADLINE: YOUR HOME;
Saving Money on Mortages

BYLINE: By JAY ROMANO 

 BODY:
EARLIER this year, the United States Department of Housing and Urban Development established new regulations for mortgage lenders that could put some cash in the pockets of millions of homeowners.
The new rules spell out the formula that lenders must use to calculate the escrow payments that lenders often require customers to make for payment of real estate taxes and homeowner's insurance. Under formulas used before to the change, homeowners often paid more into their escrow accounts than was necessary. 
 As a result, it is estimated that as many as 6 million homeowners will receive more than $1.5 billion in credits or refunds from their lenders over the next three years as withholding procedures are changed in accordance with a timetable specified by the new rules.
But homeowner advocates say that it is not necessary to wait three years for a refund or credit -- which they say can range from $250 to as much as $2,000. They say that homeowners can have their escrow accounts privately audited to determine whether they are owed a refund and, if so, they can then prevail upon their lender to make the refund sooner rather than later.
At the same time, the advocates say, it is also wise for homeowners with adjustable-rate mortgages to make sure that their lender has been calculating interest rate changes correctly and for homeowners who are required to make private mortgage insurance -- or PMI -- payments, to determine whether it is necessary for them to continue to do so.
"A homeowner cannot just assume that the payment their mortgage company is asking them to make is the right payment," said Richard Roll, president of the American Homeowners Association, a not-for-profit consumer advocacy organization based in Washington.
Mr. Roll said that 50 percent of homeowners who have had their escrow accounts audited have found that they are entitled to a refund or a credit. With most residential real estate mortgages, lenders require borrowers to pay 1/12 of their annual real estate taxes and homeowner's insurance premiums as a part of the monthly mortgage payment. The lender then uses that money to pay the taxes and premiums when they come due. To insure that there will always be sufficient money to make those payments, most lenders require an escrow "cushion" that is usually established at closing.
But while most mortgage documents require a one-month "cushion" -- or no cushion at all -- many lenders have been holding a two-month cushion and have not been paying interest to their customers on the amount they are holding. Under the new regulations, any excess over the amount specified in the loan documents must be returned to borrowers or credited against any pending escrow increases.
In addition, the accounting procedures required by the new regulations are also expected to reduce the escrow payments that many borrowers pay on a monthly basis.
But it appears that escrow accounts are only one area in which consumers can get shortchanged. Four years ago, investigators from the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation calculated that between 50 and 60 percent of all adjustable-rate mortgage loans contained some error in the way interest charges were being recalculated. And though new accounting guidelines have been established, some mortgage-industry watchdogs say that interest calculation errors still occur regularly.
"We've found errors amounting to $15,000, $18,000, $20,000," said Larry D. Powers, president of Consumer Loan Advocates, a mortgage-auditing company in Lake Bluff, Ill. "We've seen errors created right at the closing. We've found loans that have a half-point error from the day the loan started." Typically, adjustable-rate mortgages are designed so their interest rate is recalculated after a specified time period in accordance with some widely accepted economic indicator such as Treasury bills.
But, mortgage experts say, those recalculations are often wrong. "Most people don't pay attention to it," said Ian L. Renert, a partner in the auditing firm of Hawthorne-Sterling & Company, in Stamford, Conn. "But every time a change occurs, there's a strong possibility that errors are going to occur."
Errors also occur when loans are sold by one lender to another -- an increasingly common occurrence.
"When a loan is converted from the original lender's computer system to another lender's computer system, errors often result," Mr. Renert said. "It's a rampant problem." One of the most common sources of errors, he said, are computer software- generated "rounding errors" whereby numbers expressed to three and four decimal places are "rounded off" to one. Though such errors appear small, they can result in significant overpayment when large mortgages are involved or when the error is compounded over a period of years.
David Ginsburg, president of Loantech, a mortgage auditing company in Gaithersburg, Md., said that his firm finds errors in about one-third of the adjustable-rate mortgages and in about half the escrow accounts it audits.
Mr. Ginsburg added that even if an adjustable rate mortgage has been refinanced and paid off, the borrower is still entitled to a refund of any overcharge that might have been made. "We tell people that there may be gold sitting in their filing cabinets," Mr. Ginsburg said.
Another area where consumers might save money on their mortgage payments is related to private mortgage insurance. Such insurance is typically required when the down payment made by a buyer is less than 20 percent of the purchase price. "What people are never told are the circumstances under which they can eliminate the PMI payment," said Lawrence Walner, a Chicago lawyer who specializes in handling class-action suits against lending institutions.
Mr. Walner said that what many people do not realize is that the private mortgage insurance premium -- which can run several hundred dollars a year, depending on the size of the mortgage -- should be discontinued when the equity in the property reaches 20 percent.
"Most people forget about it and most lenders forget to remind them," Mr. Walner said.
The 20 percent equity level can be attained, he said, either as the result of the borrower "paying down" the mortgage, or as the result of the property itself increasing in value to the point where the equity has increased to 20 percent.
In some cases, Mr. Walner said, it might be necessary to obtain an appraisal of the property to establish proof of an increase in equity.
Robert M. O'Toole, senior staff vice president of the Mortgage Bankers Association of America in Washington, said that the first thing borrowers should do if they suspect they are being overcharged is to call their lender.
Mr. O'Toole said that in most cases lenders will correct errors immediately. "Believe me, no lender wants to make errors," Mr. O'Toole said. "And my sense is that it doesn't happen very often."
Private audits of mortgages and escrow accounts can be obtained from the America Homeowners Association: (703) 892-4663; Consumer Loan Advocates: (708) 615-0024, or Loantech: (800) 888-6781.

At 1907 Engineers' Club, Technology Has Its Limits

BYLINE: By CHRISTOPHER GRAY 

 BODY:
IN THE EARLY 1980's, probably because of the most prominent features of its facade, an apartment converter renamed the 1907 Engineers Club at 32 West 40th Street The Columns after an extensive renovation.
But the marble is in rotten shape and the co-op board is removing large patches and replacing them with fiberglass replicas, not available to the engineers nine decades ago. 
 At the turn of the century, the American engineer was ascendant -- engineers provided the expertise to build a whole new industrial and architectural empire. Each discipline -- mechanical, electrical, civil and others -- had its own professional organization, setting code requirements, influencing legislation and establishing rules for construction.
They also had a social organization of 968 members, occupying an old house at 374 Fifth Avenue near 35th Street. In 1903, the club decided to buy land for a new building on West 40th Street opposite Bryant Park.
Built up with large brownstones beginning in the 1860's, this block began attracting a new kind of development in 1905, when three clubs began what were then high-rise buildings: the now-demolished New York Club at 20 West 40th Street, the Republican Club, at 54 West 40th, and the Engineers' Club.
At the same time, Andrew Carnegie, the millionaire industrialist, had offered $1.5 million to the engineers' professional associations to build a joint professional center. At first this included the American Society of Mechanical Engineers, the American Institute of Electrical Engineers and the American Institute of Mining Engineers. They threw in with the Engineers Club and bought land backing up to its site, at 25 West 39th Street. The 39th Street building, designed by Hale & Rogers, was a giant Roman-style stone building with meeting rooms, an auditorium, library and offices. But the 40th Street building, for social activities, was designed separately in deep red brick and soft white marble.
"There's democracy for you," Carnegie said at a ceremony in 1905. "No social influence in determining the architecture of this building, but 28 sets of plans, out of which this one was selected by unanimous choice." The one he referred to was that of the two-year-old partnership of Whitfield & King, which had been selected over Carrere & Hastings, Clinton & Russell and other established firms. Henry D. Whitfield was the brother of Carnegie's wife, Louise.
Indeed, their design was similar to the three-story garage they had designed for the Carnegies the year before at 55 East 90th Street -- except that the club is 13 stories high. The most distinctive features of the facade are the giant Corinthian pilasters at the second and third floors and the giant columns at the top.
INSIDE, the club had the usual assortment of rooms, including 66 bedrooms and a 300-seat dining room that covered the entire 11th floor. These attractions nearly doubled the membership, to 1,898. Carnegie ultimately paid $450,000 of the $900,000 cost. Mark Twain spoke at the dedication in December 1907.
New York is littered with elaborate private clubhouses whose owners have had to abandon them, and by 1972 only the engineers remained on West 40th Street.
In that year, an upbeat article in Mechanical Engineering magazine said that the Engineers Club "looks confidently toward the future," even though the professional societies had sold off their 39th Street building in 1960.
In 1979, the engineers left 40th Street for rented quarters, selling to a developer, David Eshagin. He gave his architect, Seymour Churgin, the difficult task of dividing up the large clubrooms into apartment-sized units. Whether for economy or for style, they left the giant open marble stair hall running from the first to the third floors and left several of the large central spaces as giant hallways.
On the second floor, the main club room and the library have been divided into four apartments. A recent visit to one of these found a mezzanine installed in a room that is at least as tall as it is wide and that retains its original mantelpiece and paneling.
The building was converted to a co-op in 1983, and in recent years the horizontal marble elements on the facade have been cracking and leaking.
DENNIS Mele is president of Midtown Preservation, an Oyster Bay, L.I., architectural firm. His company is supervising the replacement of the marble at the fourth and the eleventh floors with fiberglass replicas -- much lighter and much easier to fabricate. Originally, he said, the co-op wanted to repair and re-use the stone "but it fell apart in our hands" despite taking great care in removal.
The projecting cornice at the fourth-floor level has been replaced and similar work is under way at the 11th floor. The resulting change is a good summary of the strengths and weaknesses of modern substitute materials. The new cornice took the mold well and is crisp and clean. But by definition, this leaves it out of sync with the entire building, which is softly worn and aged.
The new cornice is a soft, chalky gray, an interesting color in its own right that in no way shouts out its manufactured character, as is otherwise often the case. But the material it seeks to match is marble, one of the richest and most variegated of our building stones -- the original was soft and mottled, the replacement is uniform.
The whole project, costing $350,000, is a noble effort, compromised not by intent but by the evolution of building practices. The hardest test of the builder's skill is to alter and existing structure invisibly.
Mr. Mele, too, is aware of the discrepancy but hopes that weathering will blend the new with the old.
"Matching colors is one of the most difficult things to do," he said.

HEADLINE: Hooked

BYLINE: By IAN FISHER 

 BODY:
AFTER nearly 18 hours at sea, 90 miles out in the Atlantic, trolling insignificantly along the spine of the continental shelf, Lou De Titta and his crew spotted their first trophy fish. It was a swordfish, a 10-foot, 400-pound monster whose bocce-ball eye registered nothing at the sight of Mr. De Titta or his gleaming boat, the Stress Management, equipped with gear enough to empty the oceans. The fish swished its tail just below the surface.
Let me count the ways that Mr. De Titta, his friend Greg Venturo, a veteran New Jersey offshore fisherman, and the crew of four other men did not catch this magnificent fish: For 45 minutes, they made passes with lures, threw out chunks of oily butterfish, taunted it with a squid looped through a heavy hook. They considered, jokingly, a harpoon. 
 The fish, with a bit of New Jersey swagger, would neither bite nor flee. It was Mr. De Titta who seemed spooked. "I've read about stuff like this," he said.
When the swordfish sounded for good, it was not for any lack of effort on the part of Mr. De Titta, who at 34 is no doubt among the most enthusiastic and obsessive in the state's fleet of recreational fishermen ("I am a weekend warrior," he said sheepishly, standing next to the full-sized fridge and microwave in his boat's air-conditioned cabin). An outlandishly successful entrepreneur and now skilled fisherman, Mr. De Titta is also one of the die-hards who forsake inshore species like bluefish, striped bass and fluke for the occasional trip offshore, blasting 50 or 100 miles out for big game that many in New Jersey do not realize live so close: five species of tuna, including giant bluefin weighing half a ton that can fetch $30,000 from Japanese buyers; marlin that flip mightily through the air; very finicky swordfish.
Going after the big fish is expensive and messy, but part of an industry -- encompassing boat builders to marinas to bait shops -- that contributes some $600 million annually to the state's economy, according to the New Jersey Division of Fish, Game and Wildlife. One expert estimates that offshore fishing alone, done largely by the 600 charter boats and 2,450 private boats with Federal bluefin tuna permits, is responsible for $75 million annually in the state.
Charter boats, a business that began at the turn of the century at the state's seaside resorts, charge between $1,200 and $2,000 for a six-person trip offshore that can last 18 hours or more. Put another way, anyone willing to spend $200 or $300 can experience world-class fishing close to home, even though the number of fish has declined over the last two decades because of overfishing. (The only other requirement is a strong stomach: This reporter spent eight seasick hours curled up on one of Mr. De Titta's two quite comfortable couches.)
"Every trip could be that 1,000-pound fish," said Mr. Venturo, 41, a former charter boat captain who writes fishing advice columns for several magazines. "And what people don't realize is that in the New York area, you don't have to travel a lot. You don't have to go to Australia. It's all here."
Offshore is also a place of spare, singular beauty. On two recent overnight trips -- in a lull in what fishermen are calling a healthy season for tuna in New Jersey waters, and an excellent year for blue marlin -- the Stress Management chugged by fin whales, giant creatures that grow to 79 feet and suck up dense clouds of squid and small fish; a pair of pilot whales; schools of hundreds of bottle-nosed dolphin chattering in the boat's wake, and the unobstructed view of swelling seas 10 miles in every direction. At night, the faint trail of a satellite ticked through the stars. The beauty is a good thing, because as with all fishing, big-game fishing is not always about catching a fish.
On the two recent trips, just shy of 50 hours on the water, Mr. De Titta and his crew caught two small white marlin, a 60-pound yellowfin tuna and one feisty little skipjack tuna. This is not terrible, and like most devoted fishermen, Mr. De Titta is nearly as animated about the ones that get away. "That was really cool anyway," he said of the swordfish that disappeared. "That really was."
Still, offshore fishing can offer superlatives in the size, numbers and fight of the fish. A year ago, for example, Mr. De Titta's boat hauled in 10 mahi-mahi, 8 big yellowfin tuna and a 300-pound blue marlin on a one-day trip. If that sounds like a fish story, Mr. De Titta, who projects a good-natured amazement at what his business success has brought him, will provide proof: A videotape of the trip, which he will happily pop into the boat's audio-visual center (which also houses 250 compact disks) to kill a few hours when actual fish are not biting.
"The chance of catching them is 50-50," he said. "So what's the lure? That's where the beauty of the environment comes into it -- the love to be out in the sea, to be in the outdoors, to see nature."
"If you caught fish every time you went out, it would stink, because everyone would do it," he said. "Everyone would have a boat like this."
 
At Home Afloat
 That is not likely. The Stress Management is an exceptional boat: A Viking made right in New Gretna, Burlington County, it is 45 feet long and 15 feet wide, sleeping six comfortably. Its twin diesel engines each are fired with 485 horsepower. The gas tank holds 550 gallons of fuel, burning 38 gallons an hour, enough to travel more than 300 miles. The boat has a main stateroom with an enormous bed and two full bathrooms, each with a shower and sink. Its radar is so sensitive that it picks up riptides, lobster pots, seemingly everything except the Marlboro Light butts Mr. De Titta flicks overboard every hour or so.
The cost? Mr. De Titta says it is worth $320,000, with another $30,000 or so in tackle.
"That reel there is $950," he said plainly, pointing to one of the 30 or so rods in racks on the cabin ceiling. "I have four of them."
Mr. De Titta, who is married and lives in Denville, has come a long way as a fisherman from the days when he and his brother would fish for fluke with collapsible Pocket Fisherman rods alongside their uncle in Barnegat Bay. As teen-agers in Parsippany, the two built a skiff for fishing in a local pond. As Mr. De Titta's business grew -- he is a partner in Scelba, Scelba, De Titta and Wolfson, a marketing and communications firm in Montville -- he would often pay for charter trips. At 27, he bought his first oceangoing boat, a 32-footer.
Mr. De Titta met Mr. Venturo, who is also a boat broker who outfits boats with electronics and other gear for offshore fishing, when he decided to buy a first-rate boat three years ago. "He was the first guy who asked me: What kind of fisherman am I?" Mr. De Titta said. "All the other guys asked me how much money I had."
"This is my dream boat," he added. "When we got this boat, I said, 'This is not believable that I could have this.' "
A friendship developed. Mr. Venturo taught Mr. De Titta secrets and shortcuts from his own two decades of offshore fishing. They have collaborated on a series of fishing videos that have been shown on cable television. Mr. Venturo often runs the Stress Management, babying it as if it were his own. There is a ongoing joke that Mr. Venturo picked it for himself.
"You're actually running your boat?" Mr. Venturo once asked when Mr. De Titta took the wheel.
"My boat?" Mr. De Titta asked.
"That's right," Mr. Venturo said, correcting himself. "You only make the payments."
 
A Few Nibbles
 The pair left from Manasquan on a recent Saturday at 5 P.M. with a crew of four: Wayne Pinder, an old friend of Mr. Venturo's who is also known as Hook; Tom McConlouge, who bought Mr. De Titta's old boat; Mike Mazzei, a professional diver and video photographer, and Mr. Venturo's 10-year-old daughter, Candace, an experienced fisher of deep waters. Along for the ride were a reporter and a photographer who is a boat owner himself and who claims never to have been seasick. The destination was the Wilmington Canyon, at a spot 102 miles southeast, where the waters drop quickly from 200 feet to more than 4,000.
This is high-tech fishing: Before setting off, Mr. Venturo ran home to grab a fax that a meteorologist friend had sent, showing satellite pictures of water temperatures. The tuna, he said, would be where the temperatures were highest.
"Using the coordinates, we will be able to save fuel and time to run to the exact locations where we will find fish," he said on deck. "Once we find them, it doesn't mean we can make them bite."
Indeed not, but the Stress Management ended up doing better than many other boats on the water that weekend. After nearly six hours of travel, the boat began drifting for the night, and Mr. Pinder and Mr. McConlouge fed the ocean with a steady stream of cut-up frozen butterfish -- a practice called chunking -- to attract tuna.
Nothing. At 4 A.M., nearly everyone had gone to sleep. The sea and sky were black, save the ghostly glow of half a dozen other small boats bobbing above the canyons. The water was squirming with baitfish. A school of porpoises had just swum by, Mr. McConlouge said, and he tossed another handful of bait into the water.
In early morning, the crew began trolling, dragging as many as eight lures through the water at a slow speed. Within an hour or so, Mr. Pinder started and pointed at rod No. 4: Something big with fins was stalking it. The rods were screaming, then an incredible sight: Three white marlin rocketed through the surface, wriggling in electric drops of water to shake free of the lures. A fourth fish was pulling line out quickly.
"I hooked that for you, Lou," Mr. Pinder yelled, handing one rod to Mr. De Titta. "He's on there good."
"You did!" Mr. De Titta said.
"Great job, Wayne," Mr. Venturo yelled. "That's why we call him the Hook."
Two of the fish pulled free, but Mr. Pinder dragged in the first fish, about 35 pounds, then set it free. (Many enlightened fisherman kill only what they will eat). Mr. De Titta worked his fish, roughly double in size, for a few minutes longer, then brought it to the boat shimmering and tossing its head. White marlin have blue backs and fins with silver bellies, but they are also ablaze with indigo and yellow and green. The crew posed for a picture.
"He's staring at me," Candace said, and they set it free. We were 118 miles in the ocean, over the Baltimore Canyon, where the depth is 3,600 feet.
And except for one small skipjack tuna, a 5-pounder that I reeled in (realizing later that politeness dictated the fish should have gone to Candace -- sorry,Candace), the next 10 hours to shore were completely dead.
 
Trying Again
 "We're going to have real good weather," Mr. De Titta said before another trip, eight days later. I heard the fishing's picked up a little bit. Some buddies of mine last night caught six."
Tuna, he was talking about, and to catch them this time the Stress Management was aimed almost due east to the Hudson Canyon, nearly 90 miles out, where the Hudson River once flowed.
The crew this time included Mr. Mazzei; Clay Storer, a friend of Mr. De Titta; Michael Samuels Jr., another friend; and Frank Hutchko, a truck driver who charters trips in his own boat.
At 9:45 P.M., the signs were good: The water was swarming with squid and tinker mackerel, two favorites of tuna. A quarter-mile away, fishermen on a boat called the Fintastic were battling a 200-pound tuna. The water was blue and the moon was the color of mango.
"All right, let's fish," Mr. Venturo barked.
But after a few hours of drifting, everyone but Mr. Samuels and Mr. Hutchko went to sleep. Then around 2:15 A.M., a baited hook set deep for swordfish let out a whine that jolted Mr. Venturo from the flybridge. But the fish did not stay on the line.
Fifteen minutes later, a second reel started spinning, everyone woke, and Mr. Venturo began to fight his fish with no trace of sleep. Mr. De Titta followed Mr. Venturo around the deck with a gaff, a deadly-looking stick with a pointed hook. Mr. Mazzei followed with the video camera.
In a few minutes, Mr. Venturo brought to the boat the 60-pound yellowfin, with gold glinting in the dark from its two lower fins and a band across his body.
"He gave you a little battle, huh?" Mr. De Titta said, aiming at Mr. Venturo's pride.
"He was on the boat in two and a half minutes," Mr. Venturo growled.
"It's our first tuna of the New Jersey season," Mr. De Titta said.
With little ceremony, Mr. Venturo cut off the fish's head, then jammed a piece of wire into its backbone to stop the twitching and improve the meat's quality.
It was only fish of the trip.
That, of course, did not diminish the hunt: In the morning, a pod of two dozen porpoises splashed by the boat, at times rubbing their heads together. At 8:05 A.M., Mr. Venturo spotted the distant spray of two fin whales, gorging themselves on what the electronic fishfinder said were unimaginably huge schools of baitfish. The two whales later turned to four or five, graceful black beasts rolling along the surface often within 30 yards of the boat.
"People don't have a clue," Mr. Venturo said.
"Bait, bait, bait, bait, bait, bait, bait," Mr. De Titta groused. "And nobody's feeding. Except the whales."
At 10:50 A.M., the Stress Management had its battle with the swordfish, narrowly missing a tremendous fight and a wonderful meal. Later it passed a lumbering ocean sunfish, a fish the size and shape of large gong that looks as if its tail has been cut off.
Mr. De Titta wondered for a moment why he fishes like this, boating five or more hours to the canyons, fishing and then turning around, at times empty-handed.
"I just can't picture driving to North Carolina and going to the beach," he said, thinking of an equally long drive. "Going to the beach! Then driving home."
Why, then?
"I don't know," he said. "It's that you never know what you'll catch. You never know what you will see. You never know what will happen."

Four Fish Caught...
 
1. WHITE MARLIN -- Strong lateral line and rounded dorsal fin. Usually found in blue water, but sometimes approaches shore. Can reach 9 feet and 180 pounds; marlins 35 to 70 pounds were caught.
 
2. SKIPJACK TUNA -- Black stripes on belly and sides, short dorsal fins. Can grow to cover 3 feet and 77 pounds; a 5-pound fish was caught.
 
3. YELLOWFIN TUNA -- Golden stripe on side. Second dorsal fin and finlets yellow. Can reach 82 inches and 400 pounds; a 60-pound fish was caught.
 
...And One That Got Away
 
4. SWORDFISH -- Spiny scales and folding dorsal fin. Grows to 15 feet and 1,300 pounds. Swims to 2,000 feet, but surfaces in temperate water. A 400-pounder gave the Stress Management crew the cold shoulder. (Source: Peterson Field Guides Atlantic Coast Fishes)
 
How Hemingway Saw It
 
He woke with the jerk of his right fist coming up against his face and the line burning out through his right hand. He had no feeling of his left hand but he braked all he could with his right and the line rushed out. Finally his left hand found the line and he leaned back against the line and now it burned his back and his left hand, and his left hand was taking all the strain and cutting badly. He looked back at the coils of line and they were feeding smoothly. Just then the fish jumped making a great bursting of the ocean and then a heavy fall. Then he jumped again and again and the boat was going fast although line was still racing out and the old man was raising the strain to breaking point sand raising it to breaking point again and again. -- Earnest Hemingway

HEADLINE: In Yonkers, Hope Is Chiseled in Stone

BYLINE: By ROBERTA HERSHENSON 

DATELINE: YONKERS

 BODY:
THE European tradition of stone carving in the open air has been transported to the waterfront here this summer, turning a grassy field along the Hudson River into a sculpture park in progress.
Sponsored by Art on Main Street, a nonprofit group devoted to revitalizing downtown Yonkers through performances, workshops and exhibitions, the two-month project -- called the Stone Symposium -- has put 13 sculptors and students to work hammering out their visions on 40,000 pounds of white stone. 
 The students, who are receiving $600 stipends for their seven weeks of work on the project, were selected by their teachers at Roosevelt High School here to learn the art of stone carving. The program, which will continue in October with "Windows on Main Street," an exhibition of paintings in downtown store windows, is being financed with a $50,000 Federal Community Development Block Grant. The funds are being distributed through the Yonkers Department of Planning and Development.
The sculptures include works for sitting and climbing on, like Barbara Segal's "Couch Cloud" and David Rodas's "Animated Pillow." They are taking shape daily under the curious gaze of onlookers, who stroll by at lunch hour and peer from passing trains to see what is going on.
The attention pleases Ms. Segal, the project's director, who says she wants to liven up the "magnificent site" beside the pier and bring people together in the enjoyment of art. "The public is invited to join in making the sculptures," she said.
Stone chips were flying under a hot sun one recent morning as Susan Abraham, a Manhattan sculptor, hammered away at the bench she was making. "You don't get this chance to work outside on this scale with a design of your own choosing very often," she said. Like the other artists, many of whom wore goggles and face masks for protection, Ms. Abraham was covered with fine white dust. White chips clung to her hair and clothing.
Robert Sampogna and Joe O'Donnell, Yonkers postal workers, were among the onlookers that day. (Ms. Abraham said Metro-North conductors routinely waved at the group.) "It's an excellent idea to see something being built instead of something torn down," Mr. Sampogna said. "To see something positive -- maybe something can happen." His voice trailed off, but Vinnie Bagwell, a sculptor and founding member of Art on Main Street, knew what he meant.
"Yonkers is polarized into little pockets of ethnicities," she said. "This project is not about ethnicities and not about politics. It's about creativity and imagination, and seeing something that you have in your mind become tangible."
A public reception for the Stone Symposium as well as for Windows on Main Street will be held on Oct. 14 from 11 A.M. to 3 P.M. on Main Street in the Getty Square area and from 3 to 6 P.M. at the stone-cutters' riverside site.

HEADLINE: Satan Won't Go

 BODY:
To the Editor:
Leslie Houlden warns in his review of Elaine Pagels's book "The Origin of Satan" (June 18), "This demon will not go away." Indeed. Poor old Satan is conveniently blamed for illness, madness, pure evil and simple naughtiness, and of course for such disagreeable traits as perversity, refusal to conform and heresy. He is even credited (a clever turn) with supporting the enemy or rationalizing our addictions when that suits our purpose. He won't go away because we don't want him to. 
 This sense of expediency in retaining the fallen angel in our culture inheres in Mr. Houlden's critical study of this unusual book. But it is necessarily one-sided because it concentrates -- as does the book -- on the use of demonology in establishing who the enemy is in Jewish and Christian tradition as well as history. Ms. Pagels may not state her argument with "excessive single-mindedness," as the reviewer asserts, but she does seem to limit her thesis to the strictly religious and to the early Christian period. That is not so much a criticism as an opportunity to apply her argument to the present day, a step I trust she would approve.
Mr. Houlden praises the author for her handling of orthodoxy. Therein lies the critical issue, I believe. For above all, Satan has been employed as a power tool in the enforcement of orthodoxy: religious, political, social, scientific. Maintenance of the orthodox view (that is, control) has been accomplished by burning witches and books, engendering fear of hell and retribution, developing rituals and creating priestly classes, to name the major devices. It has not all been religious in the classical sense; political and economic power have been greatly aided by demonization. I must disagree with Mr. Houlden when he questions the author's belief that demonization has grown over time and at a terrible cost. Regrettably it has.
I am put in mind of all this by a recent reading of a long unpublished manuscript completed in 1927, entitled "His Majesty." In it, William N. Searcy (my grandfather) records a visit to hell for an interview with Satan. His Majesty obliges and describes his origins as a phantom of man's imagination, a vehicle for exerting power and exploiting mankind. It is a nice conceit: Satan himself reveals his secrets, his shallowness, his artificiality. He sneers at the folly of it all and at the thousands of books that have heightened his prestige and made his name feared. Satan, after all, does not exist, so he is in the best position to share that news.
This demon is only waiting for an exit visa. Let's stamp it and let him go away.

HEADLINE: EARNING IT;
The Lure of the Coffee Bar, the Smell of the Grounds

BYLINE: By KIRK JOHNSON 

 BODY:
SARAH MEYER works in a coffee bar in Hartford. Her boyfriend works in a coffee bar. She says she has actually been to parties where every person there -- you guessed it -- works in a coffee bar.
Think that's unusual? Consider the story of Johnboy. A 24-year-old aspiring shoe designer with a shaved head and gun-metal grey granny glasses, he moved to New York from Chicago last year and took his first crowded, shared apartment in the East Village. 
 "Five people, four cats, and all of us worked in coffee bars," said Johnboy, who uses only one name. "One of us slipped into it and dragged all the rest."
Coffee-bar jobs, as a category of employment, barely existed a few years ago in most places in the nation. But like the high-end, high-test caffeine craze itself, which exploded out of the Pacific Northwest alongside the Seattle sound in rock music, coffee-bar jobs have become a touchstone of cool for a certain subculture of struggling performers, college students and assorted coffee-bar hangers-on.
Though the pay is usually only a bit above the minimum wage, slinging espresso has somehow been elevated beyond its wage, harkening back perhaps to the romantic days of cafe society or the era of the beat poets. Most economists would say these are fast-food jobs. Most people who work in these places would not.
"This is the bookstore employee," said Bob Goldin, an executive vice president at Technomic Inc., a Chicago-based company that tracks trends in the food industry. "College-educated, upwardly mobile, Generation X."
Nationwide, more than 17,000 people are now employed brewing and serving coffee, according to the Specialty Coffee Association of America. The trade group expects more than 10,000 coffee outlets nationwide by the turn of the century, compared with about 200 at the start of the 1990's.
With its idiosyncratic rhythms, rules and relationships, the coffee bar, these new workers say, has replaced the local bar as a place of socialization. That in turn, especially in coffee bars that encourage lingering over newspapers, books and conversation, has transformed the barista, or coffee brewer, into the 1990's bartender.
Ian Richer, who's only 19, has already worked at seven different coffee bars in New York City -- including six different locations of one chain. He says the central dynamic of the barista-customer relationship is that people are intensely picky about their coffee and will tell you about it at length if given the opportunity.
"You know what people always talk about?" he said. "The worst such and such they ever had -- 'I had an espresso once and the milk was cold' -- stuff like that."
But Mr. Richer says people also desperately want a good listener. He still remembers a legendary barista he worked with at New World Coffee. The man, Mr. Richer said, had an airtight memory for names, faces, coffee-drink preferences and the often tedious tales told by his customers.
"People developed this intense relationship with the guy," Mr. Richer said. "They were giving him like $25 tips a month for being such a spectacular listener."
Jerry Baldwin, the chairman of Peet's Coffee and Tea in Berkeley, Calif., and a veteran of 25 years in the coffee business, believes that the whole concept of the coffee bar is loaded with contradiction and potential conflict in which the workers, by and large, can come out frustrated.
"Here are these people, going to a special place for a special drink and they want it now," Mr. Baldwin said. "They want a friendly bartender to commiserate with them, but there's big long line behind and you've got to move the goods." Especially in the morning, it can get pretty tense. "If you saw a videotape of staff and a videotape of customers, it would be pretty grim on both sides," he said.
COFFEE-BAR workers say, however, that there is a plateau beyond grumpy customers, a realm of the unspoken sealed relationship of barista and patron in which a regular order need no longer be verbalized.
"They don't even have to say what they want -- we just know," said Nitzan Gilady, a 25-year-old actor who works at Jonathan Morr Espresso Bar in midtown Manhattan, where a corporate army charges in beneath the bar's giant coffee-cup light fixtures every morning. "You can see it in their eyes."
For actors like Mr. Gilady, the food-service industry has always been a way station. But he says the stereotypical New York restaurant waiter hoping for his or her big break has given way among many of his friends to the coffee bars. The bars look for attractive people, and actors look for jobs with flexible hours. He just left Jonathan Morr for a one-month film project. At The Coffee Pot on Manhattan's West Side, more than half the staff -- especially in winter when students go back to school -- is composed of out-of-work actors.
Another general coffee-worker type, baristas say, is the "slacker," defined by Sharon Djemal as "people who haven't really figured out what they want to do, people who still want to be in college -- they still want to hang out with the same people."
Ms. Djemal, 26, says she has "a lot of friends," in this category, but that the label does not define her: she is only making coffee for a season in a midtown Manhattan bar before her first year at Columbia University's law school this fall.
There are also some clear occupational hazards to a life of latte.
Ms. Meyer, a 19-year-old biology major at Barnard College who works in a place in downtown Hartford call Zuzu's (named for Jimmy Stewart's daughter in the movie "It's a Wonderful Life,"), said that when she and her coffee friends all get together, they sometimes "start to slip into the lingo -- you know, 'short, tall, grande.' "
And the fact is that, well, you can actually get sick of the product.
"Actually, I don't smell it anymore, and I don't drink it much anymore, either," said Daniel Fiset, a manager at The Coffee Pot in New York.
Some coffee-bar employees also worry that the big chains, like Starbucks, are reining in the anarchic spirit that, they say, makes individual bars interesting.
"They want the cheeriest, chipperist, most saccharine person you could imagine," Mr. Richer said of the corporate chains. He now works at what he calls a "mom and pop" place called Brewbar.
Of all the coffee bars visited for this article, Starbucks was the only one that prohibited employees from speaking to a reporter, referring all questions to the corporate headquarters in Seattle.
"They have a few strange rules," said a young woman at a Starbucks in Westfield, N.J., after the manager told her to say no more. Asked why she worked there, she shrugged, "It's cool."

Automotive
 
The Long Goodbye
General Motors is finally saying goodbye to Electronic Data Systems. After trying for at least the last year to find a way to profitably separate from its subsidiary, G.M. has decided on a stock swap that will leave E.D.S. in the hands of its shareholders. The computer services company has been a continuing source of minor management headaches since G.M. bought it from Ross Perot in 1984. Mr. Perot joined G.M.'s board of directors and spent years criticizing the company's management until it bought him out for $742.8 million. Earlier this year, G.M. contributed its E.D.S. shares to the automaker's underfunded pension plans, meaning the company received little benefit from owning E.D.S. "Parting," Shakespeare wrote, "is such sweet sorrow." Or maybe just sweet.
 
Music
 
Looking for the Door
In what could be another who-needs-the-headaches deal, Time Warner was said to be in negotiations to sell its 50 percent stake in Interscope Records back to the record company's executives. Interscope has such artists as Tom Jones and gangsta rapper Snoop Doggy Dogg. Time Warner has received a lot of grief, especially from the Republicans, for distributing gangsta rap music because of its violent and sexually degrading lyrics. Selling Interscope is probably the simplest way for Time Warner to escape the controversy. It is unclear whether the Republicans ever complained about Tom Jones.
 
Banking
 
Bank Attracts Very Big Investor
Yo! Who just put down more than $3 million to become a major shareholder of a relatively obscure bank in Trenton, N.J.? O.K., that's not fair because you'd never guess. White Eagle Enterprises, a New Jersey investment group, notified the S.E.C. that it bought 23,100 shares of the Yardville National Bancorp and now owns 7.1 percent, or about 165,100, of its shares. The man behind White Eagle is Sylvestor Stallone, who didn't exactly make his name on Wall Street. But analysts said New Jersey banks are prime takeover targets, so owning a hunk of Yardville may be a good move. This is the man who just signed a three-picture deal with Universal Pictures that was said to be worth more than $60 million. Sounds like there may be more Warren Buffett than Rambo in Mr. Stallone these days.
 
Securities Industry
 
Another Victim at Prudential
First, many of Prudential Securities' customers complained. Now it's the brokers. The company in 1993 settled securities fraud charges that it misled investors about the risks of limited partnerships. The company agreed to set up a $1.4 billion fund to repay the thousands of investors who had lost money. Those partnerships had been sold to them by the brokers of Prudential Securities. One of those brokers, Betty S. Allen who had sold about $12 million worth of the partnerships, had complained to an arbitration panel that all the customer complaints about the partnerships made it impossible for her to find other work in the securities industry. Her lawyer said the sales material for the partnerships that was provided by Prudential to its brokers was misleading. But brokers also got prospectuses, which laid out the pros and cons of the investments. Didn't Ms. Allen read them? Ms. Allen wouldn't comment on that last week. And now she doesn't have to. The arbitration panel awarded her $327,000.
 
Wall Street
 
A Good Start, Spoiled
Netscape Communications, the Internet software company, had a stunning debut on Wall Street Wednesday. The initial public offering was priced at $28 a share, but closed for the day at $58.25, up a dramatic $30.25. A lot of people made a lot of money. But a lot of people lost a lot of money. The issue was so hot, that the size of the offering was increased and still many investors couldn't get stock at the offering price. So they had to buy when the stock began trading. The first trade: $71 a share. And it stayed at around $70 until early afternoon before it started to decline. It then fell almost $7 on Thursday and closed unchanged, at $51.375, on Friday. That's a loss of almost $20 a share since Wednesday's first trade. So, Netscape did have quite a stunning week, no matter from where you look at it.
 
Publishing
 
Turn Off That TV
At first it sounded like refreshing news. Two new studies showed that over the next few years Americans would increase their spending on books and would even be spending more to read then they would on recorded music or home videos. The key word here, of course, is spend. Spending will increase because the cost of books will be going up, but the number of books sold is expected to almost flatten out by 1996. It could be because of electronic publishing, as more books go digital. Then again, maybe the reason will be that in 1996, we all could still be stuck in front of the TV watching the O.J. trial.
 
Tobacco
 
The President Sets an Example
President Clinton came down hard on the tobacco companies last week. He proposed regulations to keep cigarettes away from teenagers. He wants to ban cigarette sales from vending machines and wants tobacco companies to stop brand-name advertising at sporting events. "It is wrong to believe that we can take a voluntary approach to this problem," Mr. Clinton said. How true. When asked if he would voluntarily give up the cigars he occasionally smokes, he said, no, he wouldn't. "I try to set a good example," he said. "I try never to do it where people see. I admitted that I did, I did do it when Captain O'Grady was found because I was so happy. It was a form of celebration." Mr. Clinton might have just added to the traditions of smoking. Cigars are expected after a baby is born. Smoking after sex is a classic icon. And now, having a good smoke after resolving a national emergency. Perhaps that's why amid all the turmoil, analysts continue to say that tobacco stocks are still a wonderful buy.
 
Sports
 
Can Nike Be Far Behind?
It's always interesting to watch capitalism crop up in unlikely places: Vietnam, Russia, England. Yes, England. Money, and lots of it, is about to infect the very English, and amateur, sport of rugby. England's national team is negotiating a $2.4 million deal to sell promotional logo space on its team jerseys, with about a third of the money going to players. And more eye-popping in a sport in which the players often perform for nothing, Rupert Murdoch is paying $500 million to broadcast games from South Africa, New Zealand and Australia. "The whole ethos of rugby has been about sport, about a kind of courtesy, decency and manners," one rugby expert said. Yes, and basketball used to be played with peach baskets.

HEADLINE: Slowly, Survivors Sue Japan for War

BYLINE: By SHERYL WuDUNN 

DATELINE: YOKOHAMA, Japan

 BODY:
It took Song Byung Wook five decades to muster the necessary mix of anger, determination and hope, but this summer he finally decided to sue the Japanese Government for the kidnapping and forced labor that tore him from his family in Korea and left him an alien in a hostile land.
Mr. Song is not alone. A growing number of Koreans, Chinese and even Americans are taking the Japanese Government to court for mistreatment during World War II. In the past few weeks alone, dozens of people from six countries representing thousands of victims -- former sex slaves, forced laborers and even American and British prisoners of war -- have come to Tokyo to file suits in Japanese courts. 
 While some suits have been filed primarily to embarrass the Japanese Government, hundreds of thousands of others could follow if there is any sign of that the suits may succeed.
It is unclear whether the Japanese judges will agree to adjudicate these cases, but the hearings are already capturing public attention and embarrassing the Japanese authorities by spotlighting Japan's abuse of Asians and other foreigners during the war.
Like many of the one million or more Koreans who were made slave laborers in Japan, Mr. Song was abducted from Korea and taken to Japan to provide a labor force during the war years, when most young Japanese men were on the war front.
Mr. Song, a 69-year-old South Korean who now lives in the eastern Japanese city of Yokohama, was forced to smelt iron all day. He survived conditions that claimed the lives of many fellow workers, and after the war he married a Korean woman and remained in Japan, drifting among various jobs and small businesses over the years.
"I don't want to renounce the family I love now, so I would not say my life was totally ruined by the war," Mr. Song said. "But my life has been in shambles."
For decades after the war, he thought there was no hope of redress. Then a few years ago, he met with families of other Korean forced laborers, and together they began talking about the idea of a lawsuit in the Japanese courts.
"I'm not doing it for my unpaid wages, for I gave that up long ago," said Mr. Song, who plans to file his suit in September, together with 10 other Korean families, against Nippon Steel and the Government. "It's not just a matter of winning the suit. It's important to tell the Japanese people about all this."
Former slave laborers are turning to civil suits in part because South Korea and China both renounced rights to any further compensation when they established relations with Japan in the 1960's and 1970's. Now, encouraged by political liberalization and growing recognition of the idea of law, a growing number of victims of World War II are turning to the only avenue that still seems available, the Japanese courts.
Americans like Gilbert M. Hair, a former American internee, are also joining the tide to sue. Mr. Hair visited Tokyo recently to help file a lawsuit on behalf of 30,000 former internees and prisoners of war from the United States, Britain, Australia and New Zealand.
"They treated us worse than animals," he said in a statement. "For this I feel the Japanese Government should be held responsible."
Another suit gathering attention is being brought by survivors of an uprising by Chinese forced laborers at the Hanaoka copper mine in northern Japan. Nearly 1,000 of the workers had been seized in China and forced to work in the mine, where they were at times beaten with leather whips and branded with hot irons.
"We knew we would all soon die, but we figured that if we died in an uprising at least we would die with honor," said Zhang Zhaoguo, a 75-year-old Chinese laborer who returned to Japan to file a lawsuit.
The Chinese mounted an uprising in June 1945, two months before the end of the war, and they killed five Japanese. Thousands of troops were brought in and they hung Mr. Zhang and others by their thumbs from the ceiling. While Mr. Zhang survived, 418 of the Chinese workers died from beatings and torture.
Now Mr. Zhang and 10 other survivors have filed suit against the Japanese Government and Kajima Corporation, which ran the mine and remains today one of the biggest construction companies in Japan.
Many of the lawsuits are jointly filed against the Government and a corporation. Lawyers say that the suits against the Government are unlikely to succeed, but that cases against corporations may stand a better chance. Many Japanese corporations, like Kajima, that do business in Asia may feel obliged to settle to avoid tarnishing their reputations in places like China and South Korea. In general, however, the companies have declined to comment on the cases.
A breakthrough of sorts came recently when the Government endorsed a new private fund to compensate the so-called comfort women, young women and girls who were forced to have sex with Japanese soldiers. This has given encouragement to other victims.
Some former slave laborers, however, are still agonizing over whether to sue, partly because they are reluctant to relive a gruesome past.
Chon Woon Mo, who was kidnapped from his home in Korea 53 years ago, was forced to work in a copper mine and was beaten until he lost all sensation. But he remained in Japan after the war and is still debating about whether to bring a suit.
One reason he is reluctant to file suit is that he remembers good Japanese as well as bad. A Japanese supervisor at the mine where he worked took a liking to him and secretly helped him escape from the labor camp.
Mr. Chon is also restrained by his allegiance to North Korea, which does not have formal ties with Japan. And most North Koreans in Japan are hoping their Government will fight for them and get a financial settlement as part of the normalization of relations with Japan.
As many as 10 percent of the Korean laborers in Japan did not survive their service, according to various Japanese scholars. At some labor camps for foreigners, the death rate was nearly half.
The Government has been extremely reluctant to open its files on the issue and many records were burned, so the true number of deaths may never be known.
"They controlled by violence," said Tadashi Kosho, professor of economic history at Komazawa University. "The Japanese Government must make a proper apology and refund unpaid wages. Without this, Japan cannot co-exist peacefully with other Asian countries. This is not just an issue of responsibility. It is also necessary for the Japanese people."

HEADLINE: Dole Defending Middle Ground In G.O.P. Race

BYLINE: By R. W. APPLE Jr. 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Aug. 12

 BODY:
These days, almost as many roads lead to Bob Dole's office in the Capitol as to that Oval Office down the street.
Bosnia, Medicare, welfare overhaul, the budget, the ethical troubles of his colleague, Bob Packwood -- all of those subjects and many more traced paths through his shorthand conversations with aides on Thursday as he pressed the Senate toward its summer adjournment on Friday. And without missing a beat, he simultaneously told a visitor about his other current preoccupation, the 1996 Presidential campaign. 
 His message was plain: Republicanism with an ideological edge, a la Gingrich, a la Gramm, was not for him and not, he thought, for the American people. In private, he said, they took a balanced view of Federal programs, recognizing that many were beneficial, "but if you ask them in a big group, they all want to get up and shout about how awful the Government is."
He seemed sufficiently confident about his reading of the electorate to suggest that if he was nominated, Gen. Colin Powell, whom he described as "probably moderate on social issues and fairly conservative on economic and defense issues," would be eminently acceptable as a running mate -- even if party conservatives worry about his views on abortion and affirmative action.
"He's a great guy," Mr. Dole said. "I've been out to see him once, hope to go out and see him again. Just to go out and sit down and talk."
Majority leader (and hence chief traffic cop) in the Senate, vocal champion of the Bosnian Muslims, clear front-runner for the Republican nomination to oppose President Clinton, the 72-year-old Kansan is playing a lot of major roles at once. More, in fact, than anyone in recent memory, more even than Lyndon B. Johnson when he was the nearly omnipotent honcho of the Senate.
It is made no easier, of course, by the reality that the Republicans' majority is too thin to override vetoes or close off debate without Democratic help, or by the fact that three members of his flock, Phil Gramm of Texas, Richard G. Lugar of Indiana and Arlen Specter of Pennsylvania, are running against him, or that he is trying ever so hard to hold his famously tart tongue, which has gotten him in big trouble during past national campaigns.
"There's no doubt about it," he said. "We're getting a few darts now."
He thought, early on, about stepping down as leader in favor of his deputy, Trent Lott of Mississippi, Mr. Dole said, but he has decided that he has the tactical advantage where he is now: "In my view, I'm running against Bill Clinton. The rest of the Republicans may be running against me, but as long as I focus on President Clinton, I think it's good to do it from right here."
He has not had any problems with Senator Specter, who grew up in the same small prairie town, Russell, Kan., as Senator Dole did. Senator Lugar is a mannerly, low-key man. But Senator Gramm is a needler, and he clearly riles his leader. Mr. Dole tries to sound indifferent to it all, "If he has to go out and take a shot each day, well, I'm the front-runner."
But then he called attention to one of Mr. Gramm's fund-raising letters, in which the Texas conservative suggested that the Senate was becoming "a black hole for the Contract With America" and urged recipients to send money to help him in "putting Bob Dole's feet to the fire." Mr. Dole, it says, completely failed to "get the message" of the Republicans' victories in 1994.
"I think it was over the edge," said Senator Dole, adding in one of the dismissive asides he is famous for, "I don't think he raised much money."
So far, Mr. Dole has mastered the complicated political calculus of his situation, moving far enough to the right to prevent his more conservative rivals for the nomination from gaining traction but not so far as to make himself look unacceptably extreme should he reach the general election, setting himself apart from Mr. Clinton without seeming merely to obstruct.
On Bosnia, for example, he pushed through a bill calling for an end to United States participation in the United Nations embargo on arms shipments to the Muslims. President Clinton vetoed it Friday, and Mr. Dole says he will try to override the veto. But what, he was asked, if the current search for a peace formula was making progress when it came time for the override vote?
"I think that might make a difference," he said, implying that he would wait if asked. "We waited a whole year before, you know. We don't want to blow up a peace process."
What bothers the social-issue true believers and the hard-core supporters of the Contract With America is precisely the sort of balance Mr. Dole has to maintain if he is to make the Senate work, which he must do if his candidacy is to retain its credibility. Referring to Newt Gingrich, the Speaker of the faster-moving House, Mr. Dole said, "No doubt I'm the establishment, and he's sort of the revolutionary." But he insisted that the two get along well.
"It's a strong message, reining in the Government, reconnecting Government," he said. "But I don't think you want to leave people in the audience thinking you're some radical that's going to take them over the edge.
"I've started to stand up, look at the audience and say, 'Everybody in this room has been affected, directly or indirectly, by some Government program.' I see veterans out there. I see senior citizens. I see somebody who may have gone to vocational school. The Government has done many good things.
"It's got to be downsized. It's gotten too big. We spend too much money. But you get into Medicare, that's a hot button, Medicaid, that's a hot button, welfare reform, that's a hot button for a lot of people, too. It's not easy to cut spending, not as easy as making speeches. You can be tough as nails when you make speeches. I've heard a lot of good speeches."
But neither Medicare nor Medicaid had been trimmed, nor had welfare been overhauled, as Senators streamed out of Washington this weekend. They will have to be dealt with as part of the so-called reconciliation bill, in which all the loose budgetary and policy strings are tied up, sometime late this fall. It threatens to be a grand mess -- a train wreck, in the lingo of Capitol Hill.
Nor has Congress passed the line-item veto or regulatory reform. Mr. Dole concedes that the public remains frustrated, and that that could hurt him if he comes to look like part of the problem rather than a potential solution.
"People are still looking for leadership," he said. "They're looking for someone they can have confidence in. Maybe they haven't decided who that is yet. They all want the perfect candidate. They'll never find one."
As for himself, he is not about to apologize for his old-fashioned style.
"I'm not one of these 'in your face, it's got to be my way or no way' kind of conservatives," he said. "People are looking for reality. You have to work with Republicans and Democrats, if you're a Republican President. You've got to make the place run. People want to get things done around here."

HEADLINE: The Perfect Place To Make a Good Cigar;
A Trend Revitalizes the Cigar Industry and a Way of Life in Connecticut

BYLINE: By GLENN COLLINS 

DATELINE: BLOOMFIELD, Conn., Aug. 12

 BODY:
They call it tenting.
 Since the 19th century, it has been a hot-weather hallmark of tobacco-growing in the sandy loam of the Connecticut Valley. Now, once again, hundreds of acres of white netting have been deployed to protect delicate tobacco leaves so they can fulfill their destiny as luxury cigars. 
 Three years ago, this practice seemed doomed, along with an entire industry and a 96-year-old way of life. One of the nation's legendary tobacco-growing economies seemed near extinction because demand for its esoteric product was declining along with the popularity of cigars in America.
 Enter, miraculously, cigar mania.
 Sales of premium cigars -- those costing more than $2.50 each -- have jumped 29 percent in the last three years. And improbably, at a time when only 25 percent of Americans smoke -- fewer than at any time since the Government began taking surveys, cigar fervor has saved the tobacco industry in the Connecticut Valley.
 "Business here was dying and now it's thriving," said Edgar M. Cullman, chairman of the Culbro Corporation, corporate parent of the region's chief grower, the General Cigar Company. "Only a few years ago, we'd grow our tobacco, and we'd store our tobacco -- and nobody wanted to buy it. Now? We're expanding our acreage and our labor force."
 Demand has exceeded supply in this region, blessed with the mysterious soil and climate conditions that have turned its tobacco into the platinum of the cigar-making world. Called Connecticut Shade wrapper leaf -- or simply Shade -- the golden brown, unblemished cured tobacco is hand-rolled to become the outer jacket of expensive cigars.
 Shade tobacco is essential not only to the look of some premium brands, but also to their taste. Although Shade accounts for no more than 5 percent of a cigar's weight, the wrapper gives it more than 60 percent of its taste, cigar manufacturers and smokers say.
 "What looked like a dinosaur industry has enjoyed a huge turnaround," said Gov. John G. Rowland, who occasionally partakes of a Shade-wrapped cigar himself.
 Sales of premium cigars are surging as a new generation of affluent men (and a few women) have become cigarophiles, puffing at cigar dinners, traveling to dressy smoke-ins and seeking out restaurants that welcome them.
 Even President Clinton, who allows that he smokes a cigar from time to time, gave cigars a boost last week when he said they would be exempted from his new proposed tobacco restrictions because teen-agers do not smoke cigars.
The cigar boom has been ascribed to everything from the yuppie taste for self-indulgence to white-male backlash to the influence of a popular new high-gloss magazine, Cigar Aficionado.
 Whatever the reason, the resurgence is a renaissance for Shade, so called because the tobacco is grown under the shade of the tenting that was once made of cotton but is now a polymer that lasts four years longer.
 General Cigar's entire 1994 crop, which will not even be ready until 1997, is already sold out. Sales rose 45 percent in 1994 and are up 55 percent so far this year.
 The Connecticut Department of Economic Development estimates the value of cigar agriculture, exclusive of wholesaling and manufacture, at $50 million, and cigar-tobacco cultivation is "now one of the fastest-growing of our agricultural industries," said Rick Macsuga, marketing and inspection supervisor for the State Agriculture Department.
 Mr. Cullman estimated the total economic benefit to Connecticut at $100 million, "and it could have been a billion if the industry hadn't declined," he said. As late as the 1960's, 8,000 acres of wrapper tobacco were grown in the Connecticut Valley; today it is down to 1,700.
 Virtually the entire crop is concentrated in a 20-mile-square area north of Hartford.
 About 125 million cigars will be wrapped from the 1995 crop, Austin T. McNamara, president of General Cigar, said. General Cigar grows 400 acres of cigar tobacco, and much of the rest is grown by independent farmers in a cooperative.
 Growers have tried to cultivate Shade in every nook and cranny of the world, but only four places have the right soil and climate conditions: Cuba, Cameroon, Indonesia and the Connecticut Valley. The same seed, when cultivated in Virginia, Wisconsin, Florida and the Carolinas, has a totally different -- and inferior -- taste.
 Many aficionados prefer Connecticut Shade to any wrapper in the world outside of Cuba; it is illegal to import or sell Cuban tobacco, or cigars, in the United States.
 "There are a lot of people in the state who aren't even aware that we have a world-class product here," Mr. Macsuga said.
 Shade is used to wrap General Cigar's Macanudo, the largest-selling premium brand sold in the United States. (They are made in Jamaica.) Other cigar makers that use Connecticut Shade include Alfred Dunhill, Davidoff and Temple Hall.
 There is much speculation about the cigar-friendly qualities of the conditions in the Connecticut Valley; theories about the origin of the rich soil range from tidal-river overflows to glacial deposits of nutrients. Others say the valley traps moisture from the Connecticut and Farmington rivers, forming a humid, foggy bowl that permits higher temperatures during growing season, even as Connecticut's northern location provides the lower evening and winter temperatures that promote curing.
 Tobacco was grown in the Connecticut Valley by Indians before the arrival of the white man. To duplicate the shaded growing conditions under the forest canopy of tropical jungles, tobacco tenting was introduced in 1899 in Windsor, according to the State Agriculture Department.
 In the 1920's, 31,000 acres of Shade were under cultivation, and as recently as 1964, 177 farms cultivated 8,000 acres and produced 12 million pounds. The number of farms now is about a dozen, and 2.3 million pounds were produced last year.
 The cultivation of Connecticut wrapper is believed to be the most labor-intensive activity in all of agriculture. General Cigar sells its premium leaf for $43 a pound, and the cost for growing and processing it is $26,000 per acre, versus $300 for corn.
 "From the time the seed is in the ground until it's smoked, each leaf is touched 100 times," Mr. McNamara said.
 Seedlings are transplanted to the fields in early June and are tented under acres of cloth, which shades the plants from the direct sun, holds in heat and humidity and discourages insects.
 Picking begins the first week in July. There are six "primings" during the 18-week growing season, where the three most mature leaves are picked by hand from the tobacco plants every few weeks. Workers must pick rapidly while handling the fragile leaves gently.
 The green leaves are threaded onto hanger-sticks called laths, and groups of 48 leaves are then hung 36 feet high in tobacco sheds to be air-cured.
 In the hot, dark sheds, the tiers of leaves are heated with gas burners to a temperature of 104 degrees for more than a week to develop their color and taste. "You can lose a whole shed in a day if it gets too hot or too cold too fast," Mr. McNamara said.
 The leaves are shipped to the Dominican Republic, where skilled tobacco labor is cheap and abundant, to be hand-sorted for quality. After they are cured there for a year, the bales are shipped back to Connecticut for two years of natural fermentation, the "winter sweat," during which the leaves develop flavor.
 Finally, the cycle ends when the bales are shipped to be hand-rolled in Jamaica and the cigars are imported to Connecticut for marketing and distribution.
 This summer, General Cigar is employing about 700 people, mostly local residents, during the growing and harvesting season. "Basically we're working from dawn to dusk these days," said Steve Lipsky, manager of the company's 110-acre Farm 28.
 "Picking tobacco is hard work, and you have to be very careful not to break the leaves," said Emanuel Nieves, a 15-year-old from nearby Springfield, Mass., who, like generations of teen-agers from the tobacco towns, has found a sweaty summer job. The workers are paid a minimum of $5.75 an hour, higher than Connecticut's $4.27 minimum wage; the company pays productivity incentives that can earn workers an extra $125 per week.
 "Because General Cigar uses local workers, there is no exploitation of migrants," said Ann Hodgdon-Cyr, who heads the migrant-worker unit of Neighborhood Legal Services in Hartford. But there has been controversy over the use of migrant workers from Puerto Rico and Jamaica by other growers.
 An industry promoting any kind of smoking is hardly politically correct these days, and the tobacco growers have fallen afoul of the anti-smoking movement because cigars present "risks from cancer of the larynx, mouth and esophagus," said Dr. Michael J. Thun, director of analytic epidemiology for the American Cancer Society in Washington. "Cigar smokers have a 2.5-times-higher rate of lung cancer than lifelong nonsmokers."
 But since smokers of premium cigars do not inhale, and since many of them average fewer than one cigar a day, Marvin Shanken, publisher of Cigar Aficionado, argues that cigars do not have the health and addiction burdens of cigarettes.
 Indeed, Connecticut Shade is being treated with benign neglect these days by Connecticut's anti-tobacco activists. Cigar tobacco "has not attracted our attention because cigars aren't what young kids normally get addicted to," said Robert Farr, a State Representative from West Hartford who has introduced anti-tobacco legislation and coordinated campaigns against youth smoking.
 "We don't view the farmers as evil," Mr. Farr said. "It's a cash crop. Look, the Amish don't believe in smoking, yet they grow tobacco as a cash crop."
 The future of the Connecticut tobacco industry is hardly assured, especially if the United States reaches rapprochement with Cuba. If Cuban cigars are legalized again, the demand for Connecticut wrapper could wane, even though many American cigar lovers prefer the milder, mellower taste of Shade to the powerful full-bodied presence of Cuban wrapper.
 In the Connecticut Valley, though, the future is but the span of a season. "I can tell by the texture of the leaves," said Laura DeGray, a shed supervisor who has worked 33 years in the tobacco fields. "This could be our year."

HEADLINE: State Agencies Pressed to Trim Spending

BYLINE: By JAMES DAO 

DATELINE: ALBANY, Aug. 12

 BODY:
The Pataki administration has begun pressing all state agencies to tighten spending amid concerns that Federal aid may be cut, leaving the state with a gaping hole in its budget.
The state Division of Budget has sent internal memos to all state agency heads directing them to reduce spending immediately and to prepare detailed plans for cutting costs over the next two years, with measures that could include layoffs. 
The state Budget Director, Patricia A. Woodworth, has also sought to reduce overall state spending by 6 percent during the first half of the fiscal year by authorizing agencies to spend only a portion of their quarterly budgets. She said the purse strings may be loosened for some agencies during the second half of the year, but others may face further reductions.
Gov. George E. Pataki, a Republican who ran on a pledge to shrink state government, said he would have tried to squeeze agency budgets even further if he thought the state was in robust fiscal health.
Now, he said, there is even greater urgency to reduce spending because the Republican-dominated Congress is likely to cut billions of dollars in aid for health care, welfare and education this fall, which could leave the state with a deficit when its fiscal year ends on March 31.
"Obviously it is a concern," Mr. Pataki said on Thursday. "And it's certainly a reason why we have to be prudent in our approach to spending money."
The Pataki administration's biggest worry is Medicaid, a more than $20 billion program in New York State. Because the program is financed jointly by the Federal, state and local governments, cuts in Federal aid could increase the remaining partners' financial burdens.
One leading Congressional plan would reduce projected Federal Medicaid spending in New York State by about $2.7 billion a year, according to the Health Care Association of New York State, a group representing hospitals and nursing homes. Other plans supported by southern governors would reduce New York's share of Medicaid dollars significantly more.
"We have to be prepared, and that means to the extent we can find ways to give ourselves additional flexibility in the spending plan now, that's better than waiting," Ms. Woodworth said.
State Comptroller H. Carl McCall, who has already predicted a budget shortfall of $2.7 billion for next year, has warned of other fiscal problems. He said the state's projections include many shaky assumptions, including sales of assets that have yet to be identified and savings that are likely to fall short. There is also a possibility that the economy will weaken, reducing tax revenue, he has said. Income from taxes has already declined because of tax cuts enacted this year that will grow substantially next year.
"I applaud what the Governor is doing in terms of aggressively managing the budget process, even if it means cutbacks for agencies," Mr. McCall, a Democrat, said. "On the other hand, it suggests that two months after hailing this as a great budget, the Governor has realized it might not hang together."
To help in the cutting, Ms. Woodworth and two other Pataki aides, Donald G. Dunn, the first deputy secretary, and James G. Natoli, the director of state operations, are reviewing cost-cutting plans from every agency.
In an Aug. 9 memo to agency heads, Ms. Woodworth recommended that they reduce office supply purchases, renegotiate service contracts, limit travel, consolidate work groups and eliminate programs. She also suggested that managers find cuts that can be made without legislative approval.
Ms. Woodworth and Mr. Pataki said layoffs should be a last resort, but would not rule them out. The state has laid off about 2,400 employees this year, including 489 political appointees.
"If it turns out we have too many employees, then we'll look for the most humane way to approach that issue," Ms. Woodworth said.
Though most departments are developing their plans in private, some information has dribbled out. A recent Health Department memo, for instance, instructed managers to find up to 20 percent in cuts this year and up to 20 percent more next year.
Similarly, a Department of Social Services memo recommended privatizing services, consolidating units and laying off 400 workers over two years. It also called for lowering child-support collection goals, to save on personnel, even though Mr. Pataki recently endorsed aggressive new measures to increase child-support payments.
The preparations have sent new waves of anxiety through a work force already shaken by layoffs, agency consolidations and calls for privatization by the new administration.
"They have the feeling that this government is trying to save on the backs of workers," said Danny Donohue, president of the Civil Service Employees Association, the largest state workers' union. "It makes them wonder every day about their jobs."
Predictably, Democrats have accused Ms. Woodworth of holding back spending in Democratic districts first. Assembly Speaker Sheldon Silver, a Manhattan Democrat, said he believes Mr. Pataki simply wants to cut spending so he can carry over a huge surplus into next year's budget.
But some Republicans, too, have reacted testily to Mr. Pataki's initiatives. In recent comments on an Albany radio station, the Senate majority leader, Joseph A. Bruno, a Rensselaer County Republican whose district contains many state workers, complained that the administration had not explained its plans clearly enough to a frightened work force.
"Every day, it appears there is some other news, another shoe drops," said Mr. Bruno, a close ally of Mr. Pataki. "It just creates concern, panic, anxiety."

HEADLINE: In Unusual Partnership, Farmers Help Safeguard New York Water

BYLINE: By ANDREW C. REVKIN 

DATELINE: DELHI, N.Y.

 BODY:
In 1955, when he was 23, David Taylor watched his grandfather's 200-acre farm in Delaware County vanish beneath the rising waters of New York City's newly completed Pepacton Reservoir.
He had planned to take over the farm, and until last year had pursued a claim against New York City for the loss of the dairy business. The claim, locked in 1950's economics at $2,500, had become virtually worthless. 
 Now 63, Mr. Taylor has choked back the deep bitterness he feels toward the city 100 miles to the southeast. In a remarkable turnaround, he and other farmers have become unlikely allies of New York environmental officials as they feverishly seek ways to keep the 19 upstate reservoirs clean.
Mr. Taylor is helping administer a pioneer program, paid for by New York City but run almost entirely by farmers, in which farmers are finding ways to cut the flow of pollution and parasites from their pastures, milkhouses and barns into the reservoirs. In recent years, Federal officials have become concerned that New York's water, although still safe, is being significantly degraded by runoff from barnyards and faulty sewage treatment systems.
Forged from the grass roots, the $35.2 million program is one of the nation's first field tests of the theory that local, flexible efforts to cut pollution can be far more effective than top-down, by-the-book regulation. It is also being held out by Federal agricultural officials as a national model for urban-rural cooperation.
"We've proved that a city can sit down with a bunch of hill farmers and cut a deal," said Dennis Rapp, a former state agriculture official. "Nobody believed that New York City, of all places, would be able to deal with farmers. If it can be done here, it can be done anywhere."
For farmers, the incentive is an average of $75,000 per farm for improvements that cut pollution and, in most cases, improve production, like cement liners that keep the manure in barnyards and grassy buffers that absorb nutrients from animal waste. As Thomas Hutson, a farmer from the Cannonsville watershed, put it, "We've made some changes here that are not only an improvement environmentally, but hopefully will help my bottom line."
Even more significant, perhaps, the farm program has become a major talking point in the negotiations among officials from New York City, the state, and upstate communities over the city's efforts to protect its water and avert a Federal order to build a $6-billion filtration system.
The meetings have been organized by Michael Finnegan, the general counsel to Gov. George E. Pataki, who has previously been viewed as favoring upstate development over the city's efforts to protect the watershed. The talks are aimed at generating consensus by Tuesday so that state officials can approve the city's water protection plan by a Sept. 15 deadline set by the Environmental Protection Agency.
Several participants in the meetings have said that the early success of the farm program has provided a crucial stepping stone for rebuilding trust between New York City and the watershed communities that, for generations, have felt bullied and betrayed.
The improbable partnership between city environmental officials and upstate dairy farmers nearly began as open warfare.
In September 1990, under pressure from the E.P.A., the city issued a 104-page "discussion draft" of proposed revisions to its watershed regulations. Many rules focused on farms, which were seen as contributing a significant portion of the unwanted nutrients and intestinal parasites that have threatened water quality in recent years.
"As soon as I saw page 27, I knew it was going to put us all out of business," Mr. Taylor recalled as he thumbed through a well-worn copy of the watershed plan.
He was taking a break two hours into a monthly meeting of the Watershed Agricultural Council, the 21-member body set up to accept city funds and dole them out for pollution prevention projects. Twenty farmers are on the panel with one representative from the city's Department of Environmental Protection. Mr. Taylor is vice chairman.
Grinning wryly, Mr. Taylor pointed out the most untenable regulations in the 1990 draft, which forbade spreading fertilizer or storing manure within 500 feet of any spring or stream. In Delaware County, virtually every barn was built next to a stream. In the past, milk would have been chilled in the running water. And the green hills are laced with streams and pocked with springs -- the very water sources that attracted city engineers in the first place.
Mr. Taylor, who keeps 120 dairy cows on 368 acres a few miles north of the reservoir that swallowed his grandfather's farm, asked county agricultural agents to help him assess how the rules would affect his property. They put out red flags marking the forbidden zones. "I would have lost 39 percent of my cropland," Mr. Taylor said.
Other provisions gave the city the right to inspect private property, apparently without a warrant. "Our own sheriff can't even do that," Mr. Taylor said.
As upstate politicians forged a coalition to fight the plan, Mr. Taylor and hundreds of frustrated farmers hastily met in school auditoriums to rage against the rules. Some farmers threatened to set their dogs on any city officials who set foot on their land.
"The city had made so many promises when they built the reservoirs," Mr. Taylor recalled. "They were going to settle all the claims, maintain the roads. None of that happened, so this time people didn't believe them. People said, 'You whipped it to us once, but we have good memories. We won't stand for it a second time.' "
Mr. Taylor called on the state for help. Mr. Rapp, at the time deputy commissioner for environmental affairs of the Department of Agriculture and Markets, offered to set up a forum where farmers and city officials could seek some sort of "just peace."
In a series of meetings, the ad hoc task force slowly lowered the temperature of the debate, Mr. Rapp, now a consultant in Albany, recalled.
In part, the meetings were meant to show farmers the links between their fields and herds and the drinking water for 9 million people. Agricultural experts from Cornell University gave slide presentations showing how calves, with their immature immune systems, were reservoirs for cryptosporidium and giardia, two of the parasites of concern to regulators.
Federal and county agricultural experts spoke about the concept of the "whole farm plan," in which outside experts tailor recommendations for each farm. They projected that in 9 out of 10 cases, reducing the flow of pollutants would also boost profits. For example, by partitioning a pasture into sections and rotating herds, grass would be eaten more efficiently, requiring less fertilizer and producing less harmful runoff.
A critical juncture was reached in the spring of 1991, when the farmers invited Albert F. Appleton, the city's Environmental Protection Commissioner, and some of his rule writers and regulators to visit Delaware County's dairies. Their first stop was the farm of David Taylor.
Mr. Appleton, now a consultant at the Regional Plan Association, recalled slogging behind Mr. Taylor, a fourth-generation farmer, as he showed them his fields and pastures -- and the little red flags. "It was all factual, not confrontational," Mr. Appleton said. "He showed us how much land he'd lose. It was fairly clear after that that if we had to ultimately force this, this was going to be really messy."
Talk turned from complaints to solutions.
While upstate politicians continued to attack New York City, printing T-shirts emblazoned with diaper-clad cows, the group of farmers and city officials pushed ahead.
The city's point man became Laurence Beckhardt, whose degree in urban planning lost significance as he got a new education in soil science. Mr. Beckhardt began making thrice-weekly trips to the dairy farms of Delaware County from the Brooklyn apartment where he had once tried raising tomatoes and beans on his terrace. But the trips were worth it, he said, because the barriers between upstate and down began to dissolve.
As the watershed program evolved, farmers insisted that it be run locally, be entirely voluntary, and be financed by the city. In return, the city demanded the right to reinstate stringent regulations if the farmers failed to recruit at least 85 percent of the 550 farmers in the watersheds by the fall of 1997. The farmers did not flinch and a deal was struck.
Mr. Appleton said the hardest challenge was persuading New York City's budget office to approve expenditures for things like grass seed, manure-composting pits and pasture fencing. Finally, the first phase of the project began in 1993 with a $1 million investment spread over 10 farms.
Even harder was the task of Mr. Appleton's successor, Marilyn Gelber, who had to persuade the Giuliani administration to expand the pilot project that was begun under the previous administration.
Ultimately, though, New York City signed a $35.2 million contract with the Watershed Agricultural Council, and as of August, the program was ahead of schedule with nearly 200 farms signed.
With the installation of simple systems like willow saplings to hold river banks and additional fencing to guide herds around fields in a way that cuts pollution, both farmers and water-quality experts are finding that their early goals are being met.
Some environmentalists remain uncomfortable with the unquantified nature of the project. Mark A. Izeman, a lawyer studying the watershed for the Natural Resources Defense Council, said the project has goals for numbers of participating farmers, but not for reductions in phosphorus or other major pollutants.
"Farming is a land use that everyone wants to preserve," he said. "But even with this approach, you still need pollution reduction benchmarks to make it a real success."
But program officials countered that the project has monitoring stations at critical points that will document changes in pollutants and hazardous microbes. Federal funds have begun to flow into the agricultural council for detailed studies of parasites in dairy herds.
Officials from other states and the Federal government have begun visiting the farms. Cities as close as Syracuse and as far away as San Antonio and Des Moines, where water supplies are in agricultural zones, are all closely watching the farm program, Federal officials said.
It may well be that, in the end, the most significant aspect of the project will have nothing to do with science, and a lot to do with integrating a region that for so long has been divided by water.
While just four years ago being in the watershed of one of the reservoirs seemed to be the kiss of death for a farmer, now it appears to be providing a new lease on life, said Thomas Hutson, one of the farmers who had once vowed to set his dogs on any New York City inspector.
"What we've all learned is that there isn't that much of a difference between the down staters and people up here," Mr. Hutson said. "We've found a way to humanize the whole regulation business."

HEADLINE: IDEAS & TRENDS;
The Fare to Texas And Other Mysteries

BYLINE: By ADAM BRYANT 

 BODY:
STEP right up, folks, and test yourself against the Air Fare Dart Board. It's a game of skill, a game of chance, and best of all, you're never sure if you've won or lost.
Thanks to another fare skirmish last week, we've got an invigorating mix of prices and routes on the board. 
 For advance-purchase fares, we've got New York to Harlingen -- that's in the dry, dusty southern tip of Texas -- for $198 one-way. Too rich for your blood? For $157 -- in the off season -- you can fly instead to London from New York.
And for a little variety, we've got some last-minute fares that rarely go on sale. There's LaGuardia to Chicago's O'Hare for $403 one-way on American, or you could fly instead from Newark to Chicago's Midway airport for $282 on Kiwi Airlines. Westchester Airport to Pittsburgh -- $317 one-way on USAir. Pittsburgh to Boston: $89 on Nations Air.
And a new feature on the dart board: American Airlines is testing new "Cable Saver Fares," which it advertises every Wednesday on a local cable station in Las Colinas, Tex., near Dallas. You could have flown from Dallas to New York this weekend for $129, round trip. That little jaunt on a moment's notice normally costs about $1,200 or more.
Those are the choices on today's dart board, ready for the first throw. Or did you want to ask questions first, say, about why some destinations cost more than others, when fares go on sale and why?
So why does it cost more to fly from New York to Harlingen than it does to fly to London, Brussels or Paris?
Remember that old Economics 101 lecture about supply and demand you slept through in college? When vacations drop off in the fall, more airlines will fly more empty seats between New York and these big European cities than between New York and Harlingen, which attracts little competition.
And since an airline seat is a terrible thing to waste, marketing types try to figure out ways to fill every seat. After all, once the airline decides to put a flight in the air, the cost of serving each additional passenger is almost nil. Lower the price for advance-purchase fares and maybe you can fill up the plane. And after the plane is about two-thirds full -- roughly the industry's break-even point, on average -- every extra fare is gravy. That break-even point can change with the type of aircraft, though, and other things like landing fees at certain airports.
Hey, why are some fares on short routes over $300 and others less than $100?
The main reason is upstart carriers that go into a market convinced that if they lower fares, they can move people out of their cars and onto their planes. With lower costs than the big guys, they can turn a profit more easily. But without competition, established airlines often charge whatever they can get away with.
Experts who track air fares, like Robert W. Harrell at American Express, will tell you about the 80-20 rule for short-haul air fares. On some routes, passengers pay about 80 cents a mile, so that a 300-mile hop can cost about $240. But low-fare carriers often charge about 20 cents a mile, so the same distance on a different route might cost you $60 or so. This 80-20 guideline breaks down on longer trips, because the cost of flying one mile drops as an airline is able to spread out the cost of the airport fees and the like over a longer trip.
These fare wars are confusing. What's going on?
Basically, the window they give you to buy the fares is now typically measured in days rather than weeks. But you can buy discounted tickets for travel months in advance -- this last fare sale was for trips right up to Dec. 15. The experts will tell you to jump if the discount is about 35 to 40 percent. Anything less, wait until the weather changes.
Don't be so convinced that you're getting a great deal even with the sale. Tom Parsons, who publishes Best Fares magazine, said he's counted at least 25 fare increases in the last three years.
And then there are all those hidden charges. The fine print in an American Airlines ad last week noted that taxes and fees of up to $38 are not included in the international fares.
Is anything being done to simplify fares?
American Airlines, in a widely reported break with tradition, tried it three years ago with Value Pricing, but that effort crumbled into that wonderful half-off fare war that lasted for weeks.
The latest person to try to add some sense to the system is Kevin Mitchell, who started Business Travel Contractors Corporation. He wants to help big companies cut special deals with airlines for fares based on the length of the trip. Imagine that. Who knows whether that will help the rest of us?
Why do fare sales advertise one-way tickets based on round-trip purchases?
Practically everybody sells things that way. See your shoes? You paid $35 for the left one, but the store made you pay another $35 for the right one. It should make perfect sense.

HEADLINE: THE WORLD;
Fortune Cookie: Your Ignorance Clouds Asian Joy

BYLINE: By NICHOLAS D. KRISTOF 

DATELINE: TOKYO

 BODY:
WHEN America ordered Japan 50 years ago to surrender or face "prompt and utter destruction," the Japanese Government responded with the word "mokusatsu."
The Japanese Prime Minister claimed later, perhaps disingenuously, that he meant this to mean an ambiguous "no comment." But American translators took it as a firm rejection, based on the more common definition, "ignore, treat with silent contempt." President Truman immediately gave the go-ahead for dropping the atomic bombs on Hiroshima and Nagasaki, and then Japan surrendered on Aug. 15, 1945. 
 If there really was a misunderstanding over "mokusatsu," it was one of the most lethal in the history of miscues. Yet looking back at the half-century of American involvement in Asia since the end of the Pacific war, what is most striking is the pattern of lethal miscues.
 
Gulf of Ignorance
 The Vietnam War in particular is now seen as flowing from a tendency to misinterpret nationalism as largely Soviet-inspired Communism. Americans have traditionally shown a far richer knowledge of the china that they eat on than the China that is the most populous nation on earth.
Half a century later, American ignorance of Asia remains a greater problem than ever. Asia is almost certainly going to be more integral to America's future than it has been during the last 50 years, for it has a weight of population and wealth and arms that are likely to leave the rest of the world in the dust. Even Indonesia, which most Americans think about for approximately 15 seconds a year, now has a population of 190 million and is projected to have nearly as big a population as America by the middle of the next century.
In economic terms, tiny Hong Kong is now richer per capita than its former colonial master, England. Japan has more savings than any country in the world, its banks are the biggest on the globe, and if the yen appreciates 20 percent more it will nominally push the United States aside to have the biggest gross national product in the world. In any case, although the United States has had the biggest economy in the world for more than 100 years, many economists believe that if output is adjusted for international prices, then China will surpass the United States within a generation or so.
"This part of the world is going to grow in importance," said Walter F. Mondale, the American Ambassador to Japan. "It's going to grow in wealth and in strategic and political significance."
Yet while Asia has never been so important to the United States, and by almost all measures will be more important to Americans in the next half-century than Europe will be, Asia remains remote and alien in the American mind, except in pockets on the West Coast that have linked themselves to trade and investment with Asia. Over all, however much America's future lies across the Pacific, America remains psychologically an Atlantic nation.
Mutual ignorance has fostered misperceptions ever since Asia and the West discovered each other. In the 19th century, when the first Japanese visited America, they noticed that American women wear high-heeled shoes. So they wrote home that American women have heels that do not touch the ground, like dogs.
More recently, Vietnam was an American conflict as well as an Asian one. It was not until this year that the United States was able to reach out and recognize the Communist Government of Vietnam -- paradoxically, a regime that has less legitimacy today than in the days when American planes were bombing it. Yet that too has a certain symmetry, for when the recognition came it reflected almost exclusively American reasons, including excitement at the opportunities in Vietnam's economy.
 
'Rorschach Blot'
 "Asia is sufficiently far away and exotic enough to Americans that it becomes a Rorschach blot on which they perceive their greatest hopes and worst fears," said William H. Overholt, a managing director of Bankers Trust who has lived in and followed Asia for a decade.
One gauge of American understanding of Asia is simply the flow of students. Some 250,000 Asians are studying in the United States, while about 7,000 Americans are studying in Asia.
Likewise, most American high schools do not offer Asian languages as an option, and much of American education still seems to follow the thinking of a Texas Governor, James "Pa" Ferguson, who in 1917 vetoed a bill to finance the teaching of foreign languages in classrooms. He explained: "If English was good enough for Jesus, it's good enough for the schoolchildren of Texas."
In contrast, under the rule of Communist hard-liners in Beijing, rundown junior high schools in even the most remote Chinese villages teach English to barefoot peasant students as a requirement beginning in the seventh grade.
To be sure, Americans have never misunderstood Asian countries so disastrously as some Asians themselves. No Westerner ever misinterpreted the situation in China as catastrophically as Chairman Mao did at the end of the 1950's, when he launched policies that produced the worst famine in world history, killing some 30 million people.
China understands even less of the American political process than America understands of its. Chinese leaders periodically make what seem to Westerners to be breathtakingly inane statements about conspiracies by America and Britain to divide, conquer and weaken China. One reason China has repeatedly shot itself in the foot over its policy toward Hong Kong is that it interprets every British move as part of a grand conspiracy to ruin Hong Kong.
China and other countries sometimes do their best to be incomprehensible. The great emperor Qianlong in 1793 ordered, "Be sure to prevent any contact between the barbarians and the population," and it sometimes seems the order has never been rescinded. If Americans know next to nothing about the Chinese peasantry -- who account for one person in six on this planet -- that is in part because the Chinese Government restricts access to the countryside.
In studying how America can prepare for a Pacific century, it helps to consider the one country that has really managed to re-tune itself from Europe to Asia. If America is looking for a model, it is Australia. At the beginning of the 1980's, Australia was a European country that happened to be located at the tip of Asia; now it in many ways is an Asian country of European stock.
The Government made a major push to emphasize the teaching of Chinese, Indonesian, Japanese and Korean, and 180,000 Australians are now studying Japanese -- more than three times the number of Americans who study Japanese. On a per-capita basis, 50 times as many Australians study Japanese as Americans do. In the Australian State of New South Wales, Asian languages are taught even at most elementary schools, and by 2010 every student from kindergarten through high school will be studying foreign languages.
Australia has also recruited Asian university students, so that 10 percent of those studying on Australian campuses are now foreigners. More Indonesian and Singaporean students go to Australia than to any other country.
The economy down under has also been redirected, with 63 percent of Australia's exports now going to Asia. Australian companies are investing in Indonesia and other neighbors, and Japanese now flock to Australia's Gold Coast to play golf, snorkel, and eat beef; you can buy a calf in Australia for the price of a good steak in Tokyo.
Australia shows that it is possible for a meat-and-potatoes country to boost its ties to and understanding of the chopstick belt. Of course, Asia too needs to try to understand the West and especially to make itself a bit more transparent. But the question for America, looking back at the price it has paid in the last half-century for its misunderstandings of Asia, is whether it too is ready to try harder in the next half century.

HEADLINE: New Watchdog Group Ranks Nations in 'Corruption Index'

BYLINE: By BARBARA CROSSETTE 

DATELINE: UNITED NATIONS, Aug. 10

 BODY:
Everyone in global business, diplomacy or even charitable organizations is familiar with the problem of corruption. But in a world where one person's bribe is somebody else's commission, corruption can be as hard to prove as it is to combat.
Two years ago a group of people with experience in international agencies and business who saw the need for a worldwide lobby against corruption formed a research and advocacy body they called Transparency International. This year the group published its first Corruption Index, a poll of polls that takes a tentative step toward ranking the world's most corrupt and least corrupt countries. 
 Using seven surveys made by risk analysts and business organizations, Transparency International, based in Berlin, ranked 41 countries -- mostly in Asia, Europe and the Americas -- from least to most corrupt in the opinion of people who have tried to work with them.
Cleanest of all was New Zealand, one of only four countries to score above 9 on a scale from 1 to 10. Close behind were Denmark, Singapore and Finland. The United States, with a score of 7.79, trailed most northern European countries and Chile. But Americans did better than either the French or the Japanese.
At the bottom -- most corrupt -- end of the scale, with scores below 3, were Indonesia, China, Pakistan, Venezuela, Brazil, Philippines, India, Thailand and Italy.
The collation and analysis of the seven admittedly often impressionistic surveys was done for Transparency International by Johann Graf Lambsdorff of the University of Gottingen in Germany. Mr. Lambsdorff, an economist, said in a telephone interview from Germany that Transparency International was beginning its own survey this year and building its own data base.
This weekend the organization is opening an address on the Internet's World Wide Web to solicit personal experiences of corruption from people working for international organizations. (The address is http:// www.gwdg.de/ uwvw/icr.htm -- or Transparency International, Heytstrasse 33, D-10825 Berlin.)
Mr. Lambsdorff said that Transparency International was primarily looking for corruption in government and public life, but that methods of doing business, public or private, were closely related to social and cultural patterns of behavior. He wants to know about these also.
"There are so many different systems of corruption, or cultures of corruption, established in the world," Mr. Lambsdorff said. Sometimes corruption is not measured only in payoffs or kickbacks but also in the way personal, family or ethnic relationships are used. In many places, some of these behavior patterns are not considered unethical, even if a government tries to make them illegal.
The Far Eastern Economic Review, Asia's leading news and business magazine, explores some of these issues in its Aug. 10 issue. Polling 3,000 executives in Asia, it found that more than a third of business leaders in Malaysia, Indonesia, South Korea and Thailand said they would rather bribe a customer than lose a big sale. In Singapore, where anti-corruption laws are tough and effective, about a quarter of executives polled still said they would prefer a bribe to failure.
Despite cultural differences, Mr. Lambsdorff said, "if I compare all the surveys, it is quite striking that they are highly correlated, as high as 90 percent." He said that the surveys he used cannot be seen as statistical proof that one place is more corrupt than another, "but among people with experience there is a certain pattern of ranking."

HEADLINE: Iraqi Defector Says He Will Work to Topple Hussein

BYLINE: By YOUSSEF M. IBRAHIM 

DATELINE: AMMAN, Jordan, Aug. 12

 BODY:
A son-in-law and top aide of President Saddam Hussein of Iraq who defected to Jordan this week vowed today to work to topple the Government in which he played a major role for more than a decade.
The man, Lieut. Gen. Hussein Kamel, was a chief arms procurer and senior decision-maker for the Iraqi Government for more than a decade, during which time Iraq entered wars against Iran and Kuwait. He defected to Jordan this week, along with his brother, who is another son-in-law, and their wives and families. 
 "We will work inside Iraq and in the whole Arab world to topple the regime of Saddam," he said.
Asked whether he has begun meetings with American military and intelligence officials who are reported to have flown to meet him in Amman, General Kamel declined to confirm that such meetings have taken place or that there had been any pledges that he would turn over Iraqi secrets to foreign countries. He contended that his only goal is to bring down the Iraqi Government.
"There have been no American contacts yet," he said. "We will try to get support primarily from Arab nations." He added that "we will not reveal any secrets unless it is in the interest of Iraq."
General Kamel spoke in a calm, self-assured style at a news conference in the Little Palace inside the royal court complex of King Hussein of Jordan. He said he decided to defect after failing to persuade his father-in-law to reform his policies, which the General said had led "to the total isolation of Iraq."
He declined to reveal information about the inner workings of the Saddam Hussein Government or to comment on the reportedly lavish lifestyle of its leaders. But he warned that his silence over personal secrets of Saddam Hussein and the reported financial abuses of his relatives and sons "will be broken" if Baghdad continued to attack him personally, as it has done since Thursday.
Baghdad's official media today described General Kamel as a "traitor," "coward," and a "thief" who stole millions of dollars.
In remarks broadcast live in Jordan and elsewhere in the Arab world, General Kamel said, "We call upon Iraqi army officers and the Republican Guards, the special Guard forces, civil servants and the Iraqi society to get ready for this important change of turning Iraq into a modern state, dealing with the international community with realism and with the Arab world with friendship to remove differences and get rid of whoever is impeding our march toward progress."
He said the Iraqi regime is "dealing with its isolation in a very wrong way characterized by executions, arrests and doing great harm to the people, which further increases its plight." He said that families of soldiers who died in the country's wars were not getting the financial support due them and that other families cannot find basic foodstuffs, clothing or essential medicine.
The country is under international sanctions, imposed by the United Nations since Iraq's invasion of Kuwait in 1990, which have apparently caused severe hardship.
"We will work seriously to change the regime in Iraq and we have initiated contacts inside and outside Iraq immediately," Mr. Kamel said. But he did not offer specifics about which countries or Iraqi opposition parties he may have contacted.
The General, denied that he had been an integral part of the decision-making process when Iraq used poisoned gas to kill thousands of Kurdish villagers and Iranians and carried out brutal repression of uprisings by Shiite Muslims and Kurds, saying that he had been a constant critic of such practices.
Mr. Kamel stopped short of condemning Iraq's invasion of Kuwait in 1990, another decision in which he participated as a senior official. In answer to a question on whether the invasion was an error, he said. "We are not looking at mistakes, but we look at lessons from these experiences and to adopt whatever is right in the future."
He said that the various positions he has held in the Iraqi Government, including running Iraq's oil industry, atomic research, missile and weapon acquisitions and reconstruction after the war clearly made him fit to take command of Iraq after his father-in-law was toppled.
The General, who is a cousin of President Saddam Hussein and is married to the Iraqi leader's eldest daughter, Raghad, was joined at the podium by his brother, Saddam, a commander of Iraq's missile force who fled with him. But Saddam Kamel stood silently throughout the conference. General Kamel said his priority now was "to establish contacts with Iraqi officials and nonofficials inside and outside Iraq," adding that he will also initiate contacts with the international community only with the purpose "of lifting the embargo and sanctions."
He seemed to leave a little room for some entente by refusing to attack President Hussein or his two sons, Uday and Qosai, personally despite numerous reports that Uday Hussein had taken over many of the General's responsibilities over the past year.
"I never had bad relations with Uday or Qosai on personal matters," he said. "The sensitivity between us grew from my constant criticism of the management of the country."
General Kamel said he left Iraq for the nearly 700-mile-long trip to Amman in an official convoy of cars and that the escape had been accomplished without a hitch.
"I left naturally because I am a well known person in Iraq," he said. "I don't think any group of soldiers or border guards would even think of stopping me. We had many cars, a large entourage and several security personnel and we entered Amman naturally." His assertion was confirmed by Jordanian officials.
But General Kamel says that things have changed radically since his departure on Tuesday. He said today that he understands that Republican Guards units have been deployed all over Bagdhad.
But he also contended that various segments of the army and the secret police were bound to understand the meaning of his departure and mobilize to fight the regime.
When asked why he did not choose to stay inside Iraq, using his privileged position and immense power to engineer a coup against his father-in-law, General Kamel said he did not want to work in secret because it would constitute treason and conspiratorial behavior. "I preferred to go outside and work in the open," he said.
Arab officials have suggested, however, that General Kamel had lost much of his power and had in effect been dismissed from virtually all his posts before his defection.
 Mr. Kamel dismissed any talk of an Iraqi retaliation against Jordan for granting him and his party asylum, saying the condition of the Iraqi economy and army would not allow any military action against Jordan, which he said would be a suicidal move. "If Iraq could attack Jordan, it would have done so, but the reality is that it cannot," he said.
 He also left the strong impression, which was not confirmed by Jordanian officials, that he has the Jordanian King's support and approval in his effort to topple Saddam Hussein. On several occasions he suggested he may live and work out of Amman, but he also left the door open for a move to another Arab country.

HEADLINE: Flat Wages Seen as Issue In '96 Vote

BYLINE: By LOUIS UCHITELLE 

 BODY:
Wage stagnation, which has persistently held down the living standards of tens of millions of Americans, is finally emerging as a big economic issue for both Democrats and Republicans as the 1996 election campaign gets under way.
The Clinton Administration, in particular, is pushing the issue, convinced that by emphatically recognizing the problem, the Democrats can win back votes lost to Republicans in last November's Congressional election. And both parties recognize that wage stagnation is at the heart of the debate over the budget. 
 "You need to make wages a major campaign issue," said Laura D'Andrea Tyson, chief of the President's National Economic Council. She noted that President Clinton frequently refers to wages in his speeches and public remarks. He argues that he has presided over the revival of the economy and the creation of millions of new jobs, and that the task now is to create a strategy to make wages grow again.
"If the Republicans are speaking of this problem, we identified it for them," Ms. Tyson said.
The Republicans are certainly speaking of the problem, and a common response is emerging from party leaders: that Mr. Clinton lacks a solution to the problem. "If he is suggesting that he is politically impotent on this huge issue," said Tony Blankley, a spokesman for Representative Newt Gingrich, the House Speaker, "then he is opening himself up to the argument that he should hand over the Presidency to someone who isn't impotent."
The problem with wage stagnation as a campaign issue is that there is no ready solution. And campaign issues without ready solutions do not easily sway voters, says James Carville, President Clinton's chief strategist in the 1992 election, who coined the slogan, "It's the economy, stupid."
It's not that Mr. Carville fails to recognize the importance of wage stagnation. "I defy anyone who studies American history 100 years from now to say that affirmative action or abortion were more important than wage stagnation," he said. "In all honesty, wage stagnation is a hard thing to grasp and blame someone for."
Wage stagnation, actually a 20-year-old phenomenon, means that the wage of the typical, or median, American worker has basically stayed unchanged, once a discount is made for inflation. That has been the case whatever the measure: individual hourly wages, weekly wages, or family income, according to Labor Department data.
When prices go up as fast as wages, Americans are left without the wherewithal to improve their living standards, dashing the traditional American dream. Only upper-income people, those who earn more than $80,000 a year, have kept ahead of inflation, while at the other end of the income spectrum, below $30,000, the typical worker's wage has lost ground.
Although the problem has been plaguing Americans for years, it is just now rising to the level of a major campaign issue, in the absence of other compelling economic problems, like those that existed in 1992, when Mr. Clinton challenged George Bush for the Presidency.
A recession had just ended. The unemployment rate was much higher than it is today, and during the Bush years the work force had failed to grow. Promising to revive the economy and to create millions of jobs, Mr. Clinton hammered away at his opponent for failing on these counts. And he won.
Nearly three years into the Clinton Administration, these issues seem neutralized. The work force has grown by more than 7 million jobs, as Mr. Clinton often reminds the electorate. Economic growth, while not sufficiently robust for Mr. Clinton to claim boom times, is not so weak that the Republicans can easily accuse the President of hard times.
"Absent a recession, which is possible, the economy will tend to create a close election," said Ray Fair, a Yale economist who studies voter reactions to economic issues.
But the economic revival has failed to revive wages. Quite the contrary, four years into the recovery, the wage problem has worsened in some ways.
This year, not only wages but total compensation, including benefits, are failing to keep up with inflation. Before, when companies added up what they paid in wages and benefits, like health care and pensions, the total has usually exceeded the inflation rate. The lag in total compensation is the first since the last recession.
"Middle-class squeeze may be a better descriptive phrase for what is happening than wage stagnation," said William Kristol, a former adviser to Republican candidates and now editor of The Standard, a conservative magazine. He said the 1996 campaign might offer an opportunity to address the problem. "If the economy stays in reasonable shape," he said, "you could get a substantive debate over the competing solutions to wage stagnation and the social problems that go with it."
That would not be an easy debate. Wage stagnation hovers in the background of the budget furor, but voters need skills in economics to connect the two and make a judgment.
The Clinton Administration argues, for example, that wages will continue to stagnate if the Republicans succeed in trying to balance the budget by eliminating such items as federally financed job training, tax incentives for education, Head Start programs and subsidized student loans. All of these programs lead to a more skilled work force, the Administration argues, and eventually higher wages.
The Republicans insist that a balanced budget in itself will push up wages over time. A balanced budget means less borrowing by the Government from the pool of national savings. Less Government borrowing frees up money for companies to borrow, at lower interest rates. And these borrowings, invested properly, generate jobs in an expanding economy and ever-higher pay.
No one knows which approach is right or whether the problem requires some other tonic -- much stronger economic growth, for example, or more powerful unions, or a lower capital gains tax. Professional economists can be found advocating each viewpoint.
"Unfortunately or fortunately, people do not vote on economic theories, but on results, and they are not getting them," said Richard A. Gephardt, the House minority leader, who is working with White House strategists to make wage stagnation a big campaign issue. "They sought results in 1992 and 1994 and they are going to keep looking."
The frustration could bring noneconomic issues to the fore. Senator Bob Dole's strategists think so, and he is the front-runner for the Republican Presidential nomination.
"The 1996 election will be a referendum on President Clinton's Presidency," said William Lacey, who is Mr. Dole's deputy campaign chairman. "And in that referendum, Dole will be seen as superior in terms of Presidential leadership and character."
President Clinton, on the other hand, plugs away at making wage stagnation a main issue. Endorsing federally sponsored affirmative-action programs in a speech last month, he argued that rising resentment against minorities is really resentment that incomes have stagnated.
What would be more appropriate, he said, "would be an honest debate about how we all got into the fix we are in, and what we are all going to do together to get out of it."

HEADLINE: Stray Bullet Hits a Girl, 3, Walking Home in the Bronx

BYLINE: By RANDY KENNEDY 

 BODY:
A 3-year-old girl who was walking home with her mother early yesterday in the Bronx was shot in the back and seriously injured by a teen-ager who was aiming at a man he had argued with earlier in the evening, the police said.
The girl, Aungahne Williamson, who was listed in critical but stable condition last night at Lincoln Hospital, had been taken by her mother, Nicole Woods, to sleep over with Ms. Woods's sister-in-law in the Mott Haven section. 
 But after midnight the girl began to cry, and her mother was called to pick her up, said Stacey Woods, Ms. Woods's sister. As Ms. Woods was walking with her daughter along East 143d Street, she met three men she knew at the corner of Brook Avenue, and they offered to escort her back to her apartment on East 140th Street.
What Ms. Woods did not know, said Capt. Richard Ward, a detective at the 40th Precinct, is that one of the men had been in a heated argument about a woman earlier that evening with a youth from the neighborhood, Jose Rivera, 19.
At about 2:30 A.M. as the men set out with Ms. Woods and her daughter for their apartment, Mr. Rivera happened to walk by, pulled out a .38-caliber revolver and fired at the man he had fought with, Captain Ward said.
The bullet instead struck the girl, who was about seven feet away from the intended target, in the lower back.
Stacey Woods said that seconds before the shooting, as Mr. Rivera stopped on the street, some of the men in the group realized what was about to happen and started to run, as did Ms. Woods and her daughter. Ms. Woods said that Aungahne "was running but then she started to cry." She added, "And then Nicole looked down and saw the hole in her shirt."
Mr. Rivera fled after the shooting. "I felt that Mr. Rivera knew he missed his target and hit the girl," Captain Ward said. "That's why he fled the scene." Following tips about street nicknames, officers from the 40th Precinct arrested Mr. Rivera at 10 A.M. yesterday in his apartment at 605 East 138th Street, where they said he was sleeping with the .38-caliber revolver tucked under his pillow. Captain Ward said that five bullets remained in the six-bullet chamber.
Mr. Rivera, who is unemployed and does not have a prior record, was identified in several lineups and was expected to be charged with attempted murder, felonious assault and criminal possession of a weapon.
Stacey Woods said late yesterday that Aungahne, who was being kept in the intensive-care unit, was conscious and talking, but that she did not understand what had happened to her.

HEADLINE: NEIGHBORHOOD REPORT: THE RICHEST -- The Richest and Poorest Blocks in Queens;
Where the City Looks More Like The Suburbs

BYLINE: By DAVID M. HERSZENHORN 

 BODY:
Summer mornings are quiet in Douglas Manor, a hamlet of country living within New York City lines. Crickets chorus, a lawn mower whines and, on this particular morning, a water truck rumbles along the winding narrow streets and stops outside 315 Arleigh Road. The doorbell rouses the McEleavy family just after 9 A.M. 
 The water man unloads the usual: five five-gallon glass jugs of Mountain Valley Spring Water, bottled at the source in Hot Springs, Ark., and delivered at $14.50 a piece in one of the swankiest sections of Queens.
In Douglas Manor, a peninsula on Little Neck Bay and one of a few elite enclaves in Queens, like Malba in Whitestone or Forest Hills Gardens, life seems more Long Island than New York City. But residents pay city taxes, can send their children to city schools and rely on city services, even if some won't drink city water.
According to an analysis of 1990 Census data prepared for The New York Times by the sociology department at Queens College, a rectangular strip in Douglas Manor, framed by Arleigh, Beverly, Shore and Douglas Roads, is the borough's wealthiest swatch. Houses on average are worth more than $500,000. Average household incomes exceed $130,000. In what was once a Protestant community, religious backgrounds now vary.Its residents, almost all white, are mostly professionals and civil servants.
But the strip, with about 140 homes, is indistinguishable from the other three-quarters of the neighborhood. Throughout, the architecture is eclectic: Dutch colonial, Italian villa, Spanish hacienda and more. By Queens standards, homes are palatial. A few face the waterfront, others the lush marshland of the Udall's Cove wildlife preserve. Each household pays $425 a year to the Douglas Manor Association, which owns and maintains the shoreline, employs a security patrol and manages the pier, where any resident can moor a boat.
Residents say what they enjoy most about the neigbhorhood is not its status. It is more of a sanctuary, they say.
Nick Ansanelli, 35, a pharmacist who moved with his wife and parents to Douglas Manor from Astoria last year, says he has seen the best and the worst of his native borough. "The quality of life deteriorated in New York City over the years because of vandalism, theft, graffiti," he says.
Mr. Ansanelli says he watched neighborhoods like Astoria and Jamaica -- which includes the poorest districts, according to the Census data -- lose their splendor as they became rental communities with many absentee landlords. Zoning laws prevent multi-unit residences in Douglas Manor, where only a handful of homes are rented. And there are no sewers -- each house has a cesspool -- so, for now, developing apartments is impossible.
"This is a piece of country in the city," says Bob Unger, 50, retired after 25 years as a city police detective. "If you find something like this, you stay in the city."
Routine life centers around the Douglaston Club at 600 West Drive. Founded in 1918 in a mansion built in 1732, the club has five tennis courts, a swimming pool, a bowling alley and 300 member families. Membership is by invitation; jackets are required after 5 P.M. Monthly dues are $90. Swimming and tennis cost extra.
At the McEleavy home, June McEleavy cares for the children -- ages 18, 13 and 5 -- and studies nutritional counseling. Her husband, Joe, owns a Long Island medical supply company."All the kids here swim, they sail and play tennis," Mrs. McEleavy says. "It sounds very elitist, but it really isn't. I consider this a working-class neighborhood. There are a lot of two-income families." DAVID M. HERSZENHORN

Graph: "CENSUS DATA" Each U.S. Census tract is broken down into two to six block groups of 500 to 1,000 people each. For example, Census Block Group 443.002, as indicated in the accompanying map, is Block Group 2 of Census Tract 443. According to 1990 figures, an area of Jamaica has the lowest average household income of all block groups in Queens, and an area of Douglas Manor has the highest. Some census tracts as a whole, however, may have higher or lower average incomes. In the accompanying charts that break down demographic information, race statistics do not add up to 100% because Hispanics may be of any race. The analyses of the census data were prepared for The New York Times by Dr. Andrew A. Beveride, a sociologist at Queens College. "CENSUS BLOCK GROUP 443,002" shows statistics for Census Block Group 443,002.; "CENSUS BLOCK GROUP 1483.003" shows statistics for Census Block Group 1483.003. (Source: Dr. Andrew A.

Jury Duty, Part Two: The Fight on Lenox Avenue

BYLINE: By ROBERT LIPSYTE 

 BODY:
THE STORY the jury heard began well after midnight one mild morning last February. We were told by Augustine Diaz, 43, unemployed, that he and James Mitchell, homeless, had been thrown out of the Harlem apartment they shared with Rosa Rodriguez, 43, unemployed, after a squabble, perhaps over the crack they smoked. They left with Mr. Diaz's television set in a shopping cart.
On Lenox Avenue, Mr. Diaz and Mr. Mitchell encountered Jonathan Smith, 37, unemployed, who had been socializing and was losing his buzz from at least four beers, perhaps eight. 
 They took a meeting. Mr. Diaz said he need $20 from the sale of the television set -- he told the jury it was for cab fare to his mother's Bronx apartment and a flop for Mr. Mitchell -- and Mr. Smith offered to help him get it for a commission of anything over $20.
The partnership unraveled when Mr. Diaz wanted to accept a $20 offer and Mr. Smith wanted to look for a better deal. They began pulling at the shopping cart. Mr. Diaz is 5 feet 5 inches and 130 pounds and Mr. Smith is 6 feet, 225. During the struggle, Mr. Diaz fell against a restaurant door and opened an eight-stitch gash in his forehead. They moved away from the cart and continued scuffling. Mr. Mitchell jumped on Mr. Smith's back.
Tonya Johnson, 29, unemployed, came out of the shadows and made off with the cart. Mr. Diaz testified he heard Mr. Smith shout something at Ms. Johnson, which Ms. Johnson testified were instructions to take the cart. She said she knew Mr. Smith from seven months of sharing crack once or twice a week. Mr. Smith told us that he did not shout at Ms. Johnson, that he did not know her, and that he did not use drugs.
Mr. Mitchell tried to chase Ms. Johnson, but, according to Mr. Diaz, he was blocked by Mr. Smith -- "held at bay" was how Ms. Johnson described it. In any case, she escaped, and Mr. Smith took off. Mr. Diaz was bleeding profusely, and Mr. Mitchell called 911 for an ambulance. The four came together again within 10 minutes when police officers arrested Ms. Johnson and Mr. Smith.
Mr. Mitchell soon disappeared, but Mr. Diaz, Mr. Smith and Ms. Johnson were reunited two weeks ago in the court of Justice Leslie Crocker Snyder, whose resemblance to Candice Bergen was deliberated by the jury during the period in which we were not allowed to discuss the case. Judge Snyder, brisk, friendly, in firm control without seeming capricious or authoritarian, was one reason jury duty was such a satisfying experience. But it was troubling as a human story.
We were 12 middle-class people, 11 white, most working, making judgments about lives we did not fully understand. Everyone in the case was a drug or alcohol abuser, all but Ms. Johnson said they were on public assistance.
Mr. Diaz had been a long-haul trucker before being shot in a robbery, Ms. Rodriguez had an undergraduate degree in psychology.
They all had police records, and Ms. Johnson was in prison, after pleading guilty to this robbery and another crime. So why was our time, not to mention the scarce resources of the criminal justice system, being spent on a case about some crackheads fighting over a $20 television set?
We never talked about that. It was a thrillingly serious jury that focused on reasonable doubt, credibility and the meaning of the charges against Mr. Smith, two counts of second-degree robbery, which involves force.
We eventually decided that we couldn't speculate that Mr. Smith already had robbery in mind when Mr. Diaz was hurt but that it was in his mind when he prevented Mr. Diaz and Mr. Mitchell from chasing Ms. Johnson and the set. We found him guilty on one charge.
But we were frustrated. There were so many questions we wanted to ask.
Mr. Smith's defense seemed flabby, yet the prosecutor's case seemed less than airtight. Both lawyers floated divertingpossibilities that drifted off like soap bubbles. They were advocates, not truth seekers, and we were accomplices in a system that rewards superior advocacy.
In the Age of O. J., one worries whether the last word is really the jury's or something the jurors were fed.
But we accepted the deal and got into the process and fulfilled our mission. When it was over, Justice Snyder came back to the jury room and thanked us for our time and said she wanted to explain why such a minor event deserved four days and so many people and such effort. As we knew, Mr. Smith had three prior felony convictions. He was someone to whom the system needed to pay serious attention.
A member of the jury appropriately thanked Justice Snyder for being a model of humanity and professionalism, and we all left in time for dinner.
As foreman, I felt good about what we did and how we did it. The bubbles of doubt and guilt the lawyers blew have popped. But the questions about the system float on.

She said she knew Mr. Smith from seven months of sharing crack once or twice a week. Mr. Smith told us that he did not shout at Ms. Johnson, that he did not know her, and that he did not use drugs.
Mr. Mitchell tried to chase Ms. Johnson, but, according to Mr. Diaz, he was blocked by Mr. Smith -- "held at bay" was how Ms. Johnson described it. In any case, she escaped, and Mr. Smith took off. Mr. Diaz was bleeding profusely, and Mr. Mitchell called 911 for an ambulance. The four came together again within 10 minutes when police officers arrested Ms. Johnson and Mr. Smith.
Mr. Mitchell soon disappeared, but Mr. Diaz, Mr. Smith and Ms. Johnson were reunited two weeks ago in the court of Justice Leslie Crocker Snyder, whose resemblance to Candice Bergen was deliberated by the jury during the period in which we were not allowed to discuss the case. Judge Snyder, brisk, friendly, in firm control without seeming capricious or authoritarian, was one reason jury duty was such a satisfying experience. But it was troubling as a human story.
We were 12 middle-class people, 11 white, most working, making judgments about lives we did not fully understand. Everyone in the case was a drug or alcohol abuser, all but Ms. Johnson said they were on public assistance.
Mr. Diaz had been a long-haul trucker before being shot in a robbery, Ms. Rodriguez had an undergraduate degree in psychology.
They all had police records, and Ms. Johnson was in prison, after pleading guilty to this robbery and another crime. So why was our time, not to mention the scarce resources of the criminal justice system, being spent on a case about some crackheads fighting over a $20 television set?
We never talked about that. It was a thrillingly serious jury that focused on reasonable doubt, credibility and the meaning of the charges against Mr. Smith, two counts of second-degree robbery, which involves force.
We eventually decided that we couldn't speculate that Mr. Smith already had robbery in mind when Mr. Diaz was hurt but that it was in his mind when he prevented Mr. Diaz and Mr. Mitchell from chasing Ms. Johnson and the set. We found him guilty on one charge.
But we were frustrated. There were so many questions we wanted to ask.
Mr. Smith's defense seemed flabby, yet the prosecutor's case seemed less than airtight. Both lawyers floated divertingpossibilities that drifted off like soap bubbles. They were advocates, not truth seekers, and we were accomplices in a system that rewards superior advocacy.
In the Age of O. J., one worries whether the last word is really the jury's or something the jurors were fed.
But we accepted the deal and got into the process and fulfilled our mission. When it was over, Justice Snyder came back to the jury room and thanked us for our time and said she wanted to explain why such a minor event deserved four days and so many people and such effort. As we knew, Mr. Smith had three prior felony convictions. He was someone to whom the system needed to pay serious attention.
A member of the jury appropriately thanked Justice Snyder for being a model of humanity and professionalism, and we all left in time for dinner.
As foreman, I felt good about what we did and how we did it. The bubbles of doubt and guilt the lawyers blew have popped. But the questions about the system float on.

GIANT BLUEFIN
By Douglas Whynott.
242 pp. New York:
Farrar, Straus & Giroux. $21. 
 THIS ambitious attempt to catch, clean and dress the bluefin-tuna fishing story is a quietly mystical portrait of a group of New England fishermen (and one woman) and the brutal devotion of their work. North Atlantic bluefin was considered almost worthless 30 years ago; a single giant tuna, which can grow longer than 10 feet and weigh more than 1,000 pounds, can now bring its catcher as much as $10,000. Douglas Whynott, a professor of English at Mount Holyoke College whose previous book, "Following the Bloom," dramatized the business of migratory beekeeping, gives us a delicious story: Japan, which still says no to imports of many American products, cannot get enough of the luscious North Atlantic bluefin for its sushi bars.
Because the Japanese reject fish for sushi that have been hauled in by net -- the jostling bruises the delicate consistency of the meat -- the bluefin fisherman must stand on a steel "pulpit" on the bow of the boat, waiting for schools of tuna to rise to the surface, and then harpoon each fish individually.
Mr. Whynott paints this Winslow Homeric style of fishing -- nearly extinct off New England before the Japanese became a world economic power -- with broad-brush action scenes and character studies of passionate fishermen, wild and crazy spotters (pilots who fly planes above the sea to identify herds), smarmy American seafood dealers, fussy Japanese buyers and, though less successfully, National Marine Fisheries Service bureaucrats whose quotas, intended to preserve the dwindling herds by limiting the seasonal catch, spoil the fishing folk's fun. Mr. Whynott's jazzy jargon about the fish themselves could sometimes use an editorial filleting. ("The ram of water through the gills serves the high-oxygen, high-metabolism needs of the bluefin's high-velocity life style.") As in any fish story, the best moments in "Giant Bluefin" are a briny blend of romance and mystery.

HEADLINE: VOICES: VIEWPOINT;
How Managed Health Care Will Allow Market Forces to Solve the Problems

BYLINE: By LLOYD M. KRIEGER; Dr. Lloyd M. Krieger is a resident at U.C.L.A. Medical Center.

 BODY:
ONE of the problems that has dogged attempts at health care reform is that the health care sector simply does not follow the laws of economics.
Consumers pay little or nothing for services, so they give no attention to prices. Physicians serve as the buyers of services for patients, but they are not the payers. Insurers pay for the services, yet they have historically had little say in purchasing decisions. Within a small community there is often wasteful duplication of expensive equipment and services, and yet the less efficient provider is almost never forced out of business. With managed care, much of this is changing. 
 Managed care is even correcting one of the medical sector's most intractable market failures: the excess supply of specialty physicians.
By the late 70's, it was clear there were too many specialists in the United States. While the needs of the population called for 60 percent of physicians to be primary-care doctors and 40 percent to be specialists, the converse has been the case.
With an excess of specialists, some, in theory, should go out of business, some change fields and some move to other locations. Those remaining should be forced to lower prices. But in practice, the glut of specialists has prompted more visits to specialists and more specialist procedures -- as well as a paradoxical increase in the price of services as physicians have tried to maintain their incomes. In the end, too many specialists has meant too much health care spending.
When these facts became clear, academics, policy analysts, business people and government planners called for a decrease in the number of specialists being trained. If there were fewer people to do expensive procedures, fewer expensive procedures would be done.
Several steps were taken. In the early 80's, Medicare began to pay specialists less and generalists more, and medical schools changed their curricula to encourage interest in primary care.
None of the efforts made a dent. Medical students continued to find the specialties to be more intellectually rigorous, technologically exciting and still somewhat more financially rewarding than primary care. And academic health centers continued to train large numbers of specialists to provide highly skilled cheap labor for patient care. Besides, specialists continued to find jobs and make a good living.
Enter managed care.
Managed care programs, which create networks of doctors and hospitals to provide care for enrolled patients, have acted to reduce the number of specialists to cut health care spending. The networks are now the buyers of physician services and, since there is an oversupply of specialists, it is a buyer's market.
On a practical level, managed-care plans have limited the number of specialists in their networks and have forced the remaining doctors to negotiate discounts.
MANY specialists now face the decision dictated by the classic laws of economics: switch fields, retire or move. And everyone is lowering fees. Some specialists are retraining to work as generalists. There are not yet many examples of heart surgeons dropping their scalpels to administer flu shots, but some physicians are expanding their practices to see a wider cross-section of patients and deliver primary care.
Things are now tough for a young specialist finishing residency, particularly in the West, where managed care has deeply penetrated the market. In California, many managed care plans are simply not hiring any more specialists.
I, in fact, am a resident in training in California to become a plastic surgeon. When I selected this subspecialty, I had already earned an M.B.A. and worked as a health care consultant, so I knew the havoc managed care would wreak on the medical specialties. Still, with its opportunities for creativity and problem solving, plastic surgery enticed me, and in the end I chose satisfaction over ease of employment.
But I am increasingly in the minority as word of the dwindling demand for specialists filters down to medical students. While a career as a specialist may seem as appealing to them as it does to me, more medical students are electing for residency in primary care.
In fact, the market is already overcorrecting a bit. Managed care plans seek to have half the proportion of specialists in their networks as exist in the current health sector. This proportion is almost certainly too low, and patients are beginning to complain about restrictions on their access to specialists and long waits once that access is granted. With time, the market can be expected to correct these excesses.
The important lesson is that managed care has finally introduced market forces to the medical manpower issue. If managed care networks are equally successful at making the laws of economics apply to hospitals, patients and to themselves, then there is hope that the nation's health care mess might be resolved by the market after all.

HEADLINE: E-Mail Puts Officials In Reach

BYLINE: By ELSA BRENNER 

 BODY:
WHEN one Eastchester resident's vacation was ruined this summer by noisy buses idling outside her door, she E-mailed local government officials and gave them a piece of her mind. Another resident questioned the legality of permit parking on a public road in the town, and he too took to his computer to complain. One man only wanted an electronic copy of the proposed master plan of development, but he too addressed his concerns to: cavanauj@nyslgti.gen.ny.us like the others did.
All three notes landed on the desk of Town Supervisor James E. Cavanaugh, one of 73 municipal officials in New York State who now have E-mail addresses as part of a state-financed $2 million grant "to bring local governments into the modern age," said Anthony M. Pascarella, director of the Telecommunications Initiative Project. 
 The project, which is financed by the State Archives and Records Administration, enables municipalities to obtain information from the State Legislature, the State Office of General Services and many databanks through the Internet. It also allows local government officials to communicate with each other and with residents of their communities.
For Linda Gislao in Eastchester, who had planned a simple vacation at home catching up on a few good books, the idling buses and the fumes they gave off invaded the peace and quiet she had hoped for that week.
"Dear Supervisor Cavanaugh," she wrote in her E-mail note, describing the problem and her thwarted plans. "Please explain to me how these buses are allowed to sit along the side of the street (in back of private houses) when this street has signs posted, 'No parking at any time.' "
Two days later, she had a response. "Thanks for your E-mail on the bus problem," Mr. Cavanaugh said, explaining that he was bringing the matter to the attention of the county, which runs the bus service.
"A copy of my letter to them has been forwarded to you (the old-fashioned way, via U.S. Mail)," the Town Supervisor wrote. "We will continue to monitor the situation."
Ms. Gislao and Mr. Cavanaugh have become part of a growing number of constituents and their elected officials who are discovering the joys of electronic mail. Under New York's telecommunications grant, about 250 local governments are expected to have E-mail addresses by the end of the year.
Officials taking part in the project will be able to subscribe to professional discussion groups on the Internet with colleagues in other parts of the state. In some cases, those groups and other on-line seminars could replace traditional conferences that are held for the same networking purposes -- saving taxpayer dollars that might have been spent to pay officials' travel and hotel expenses, not to mention the cost of time spent away from the office.
Mr. Pascarella said the electronic age could signal a time of reduced spending for government. "Think of the money saved by eliminating the paper, postage and handling of regular mail," he said. "That's just the beginning. The possibilities are endless."
In Rye, Town Clerk Frances C. Nugent called the latest developments in electronic communication "mind boggling." Apprehensive at first about the new technology, she said that she has learned quickly "despite being a senior and grandmother" -- although she was put off at first when Mamaroneck's Town Clerk, Patricia A. DiCioccio, sent an E-mail to check if her colleague in Rye was enjoying "surfing the Net."
Ms. DiCioccio recalled that Ms. Nugent responded with "a bit of huffiness and wanted to know if I was pulling her leg." "She said that she had never surfed anything in her life," Ms. DiCioccio continued.
Mostly now, Ms. Nugent says she uses her town's access to the Internet to retrieve information from state databanks and to manage local records, often communicating with other town clerks in the process. Rye, like other municipalities under the grant, has access to state lists of equipment for purchase, state archives and records, and revocation lists of licenses and permits from the State Department of Environmental Conservation.
Ms. Nugent said that minutes of Rye's Town Council meetings from 1660 through 1994 are now electronically preserved, including the proceedings from the acquisition of the land for the town from American Indians on June 29, 1660. Also, assessment information, tax records and other archival data are available for public access.
Many municipal officials see E-mail and the Internet as a significant timesaver in their busy schedules. Ms. DiCioccio said that now her communications go directly to the person she wants, without the need for time-consuming "exchanges of pleasantries and such" on the telephone.
Mr. Cavanaugh in Eastchester agreed, saying that in his opinion, E-mail was "essentially like putting a note right on someone's desk." "It certainly beats leaving messages on an answering machine or waiting on hold," he continued.
"It also beats playing telephone tag all day," said Susan S. Egginton, General Services Administrator for Westchester County. She noted that "hundreds of county employees" regularly use E-mail on the job.
Meanwhile, White Plains' Deputy City Clerk, Anne M. McPherson, said she was using the Internet to track bills through the Legislature. Also, she said, the city receives press releases from the White House, referring pertinent ones to appropriate departments.
White Plains is planning a home page, which is the "front page" on an Internet site, to provide residents with information about events and city services. Demographic and economic data for those who may be considering moving their business to the city will also be available.
Many other municipalities are also planning home pages to help their local business communities, following the lead of Kingston, N.Y., which developed one early this year to promote its historic and scenic virtues. Lowell Thing, a member of the Kingston Landmarks Commission who helped develop the home page, said that there has since been an upswing in the number of tourists coming to visit. He said the city was hoping to add sound bytes of the city and videos of some local scenery to the home page in the coming months.
In Dobbs Ferry, Trustee Brian D. Monahan, who is also a teacher of computer science at Iona College, said his village was considering a home page in conjunction with other Hudson River towns to attract tourists. The county, too, is preparing a home page on the Internet to increase tourism, Mrs. Egginton said. "It's in the works, along with computer kiosks for the public in shopping centers and airports," she said.
Home pages, databases and cost and time savings aside, officials say that the overriding benefit of going on line is the ability to communicate with the people they serve.
"It's a technology that fosters communication," Mr. Monahan said, explaining that for many people, E-mail seemed easier to write and read. "People will sit down to do that when they won't take the time for a traditional letter," he said.
"But we aren't ready to throw out all of the paper," he said. "The new technology isn't for everyone. There will always be some who prefer the old way."
The village is planning on-line community bulletin boards that will list meetings and garbage pickups and also serve as a forum for discussions. "After all," Mr. Monahan said, "we're in jobs as public servants because we like to be involved with our neighbors. And the more they talk to us, the better we'll like it. So we have a stake in seeing this move ahead."

A LIFETIME OF RICHES
The Biography of Napoleon Hill.
By Michael J. Ritt Jr. and Kirk Landers.
Illustrated. 241 pp. New York:
Dutton. $24.95. 
 SUCCESS is the great American secular religion, a "drama of economic salvation," as the historian Irvin G. Wyllie writes in "The Self-Made Man in America." The gospel of success, as propagated over the years by authors of hundreds of inspirational books, beginning with Ben Franklin, promises salvation (wealth) through faith (ambition, perseverance) and good works (industry, frugality). Among the sturdiest toilers in the vineyard of evangelical materialism was Napoleon Hill, author of "Law of Success" (1928), "Think and Grow Rich!" (1937), "The Magic Ladder to Success" (1930) and other improving books.
Hill's biography has now been written by Michael J. Ritt Jr., executive director of the Napoleon Hill Foundation, and Kirk Landers, a journalist and freelance business writer.
Given Mr. Ritt's ties to the Hill legacy (the Prophet died in 1970 at the age of 87), this is hardly an objective account, and, as befitting the quasi-religious overtones of the subject, the prose at times acquires the pious inflections of a Life of a Saint. But credit the authors with candidly demonstrating that Hill was no such thing.
In his unpublished autobiography, on which the authors heavily rely, Hill accorded himself a classic Horatio Alger boyhood. He was born in 1883 in the uplands of Wise County, Va., to a family that represented, he said, three generations of "ignorance, illiteracy and poverty." But in fact Hill's grandfather was a printer; his father became a self-taught dentist and treated his neighbors until the state licensing authorities got wind of his activities. He then enrolled in dental school at the age of 40 and went on to practice legally. Hill's stepmother, the widow of a school principal, civilized the wild-child Napoleon, making him go to school and attend church. She also bought him a typewriter, and with it he wrote up news items for rural newspapers. Thus emerged a talent for writing that he would later apply to exhorting Americans to get rich.
Fresh out of commercial college, Hill talked himself into a job with a prominent lawyer. One weekend, the manager at a coal mine the lawyer owned got drunk and became involved in the accidental shooting of a black bellhop. With the boss away, Hill took charge, arranging to have the death covered up. As a reward, his employer made him manager of the mine at the age of only 19.
So far so good, Horatio. But Hill had congenitally itchy feet; he abandoned the mines for law school, supporting himself by composing profiles of successful people for an inspirational magazine. Unable to earn enough to pay for his law course, he moved to Washington as the magazine's correspondent and wangled an audience with Andrew Carnegie, who, according to Hill, took a shine to him and planted with him the idea that changed his life. The steel magnate told him to interview the wealthiest men in America and assemble the secrets of their success in a book, which would be "one of the most enlightening documents ever written." Carnegie cannily did not offer to finance the project, telling Hill that "the rewards from this labor would be far in excess of any payment he might offer," but he did provide him with letters of introduction to fellow tycoons. And so, Hill later wrote, "the Hand of Destiny reached out to me."
This sounds a bit too inspiring to be true. Nor was Carnegie's advice all that original. Compendiums of interviews with great industrialists revealing the secrets of their rise were a staple of success literature. Nevertheless, Hill devoted his spare time for the next 20 years to researching the "laws" of success.
But he also had to earn a living, and in this endeavor he had rather spotty, well, success. For two years he taught advertising at the La Salle Extension University in Chicago, then left to co-found the Betsy Ross Candy Company but soon was quarreling with his partners. Hill seems to have had a complex appropriate to his first name and his stature (5 feet 6 inches). Next, he launched a correspondence course in salesmanship, which folded after America entered the Great War. Hill volunteered as a propagandist for the Wilson Administration. On Armistice Day he was struck by one of his great ideas -- starting a success magazine called Hill's Golden Rule. After a couple of years he lost the magazine in a power struggle with some of his employees, whom Hill darkly accused of a vendetta. He paid back one of the plotters by denouncing him to the F.B.I. as a German agent.
Hill regarded such setbacks as a "test of his faith," but he was not immune to despair. After another of his business failures, he confessed, "I had spent the better portion of my life in chasing a rainbow. . . . I had begun to place myself in the category of charlatans who offer others a remedy for failure which they, themselves, cannot successfully apply." But such moments of introspection were brief; soon Hill was off chasing rainbows. He founded another periodical that featured ads for Hill-conceived organizations like the Peptomists and the Co-Operative Club, a Rotary clone that helped its members make business contacts and find "happiness through constructive service." (The periodical went under.)
But Hill was ever distilling his laws of success. Finally he found a self-help book publisher willing to back him. Working furiously, Hill delivered himself of his magnum opus, the eight-volume "Law of Success," which set down his 15 principles ("A Definite Chief Aim," "Self-Confidence," "Habit of Saving," "Initiative and Leadership," "Imagination" and so on). Soon he was raking in royalties of $2,500 a month, the authors say, and he was at last able to buy his neglected wife, Florence, whose family money had bailed him out of business failures, the luxuries he had long promised her. (His letters to her during their many separations show he practiced advertising on his own wife. In one he writes, "The shining pot of gold is almost within my reach.")
As fast as the money rolled in, he spent it, purchasing fine clothes, a Rolls-Royce and a 600-acre Xanadu in the Catskills, where he planned to establish "the world's first University-sized Success School." Unfortunately, the year was 1929, and eight-volume sermons on how to make millions would, as the Depression deepened, seem in bad taste. Royalties dried up, takers for his syndicated success column dwindled and the owner foreclosed on Xanadu.
Unbowed, Hill scrabbled a living by promoting his "Mental Dynamite" lecture series and editing and writing Inspiration Magazine. Through a Congressman friend, he got a job turning out public-relations materials for the Government. Hill claimed that he became a confidant of F. D. R. himself. Maybe so, but I somehow doubt that Hill coined the remark "The only thing we have to fear is fear itself," as he asserted, though he was a prosperity-around-the-corner guy who believed that curing the Depression was a matter of restoring confidence. Macroeconomics has never been the strong suit of apostles of individualism.
IN 1937, with the business climate looking up and self-help primers like Dale Carnegie's "How to Win Friends and Influence People" back in style, Hill composed his biggest hit, "Think and Grow Rich!," which the authors say sold 20 million copies over the next 50 years (Alice Payne Hackett's "70 Years of Best Sellers" suggests the figure was considerably lower). Newt Gingrich lists it among the books that most influenced him. By then Florence had divorced him and he was married to a younger woman of "dazzling beauty and steamy sex appeal" named Rosa Lee Beeland, who helped him write "Think and Grow Rich!" and later produced a self-help book of her own, "How to Attract Men and Money." She spoke with authority: she took Hill for all he had when they eventually divorced.
In his remaining years Hill advised companies with "labor troubles" (union organizers), married a good woman and buckled down to merchandising his books and success courses, with the backing of a wealthy disciple, the insurance executive W. Clement Stone, who made the Master's books required reading for his agents. From Hill's inspiring life I have gleaned another Law of Success: Don't waste your time chasing a rainbow. Package it and sell it to others. Then you'll find a pot of gold.

Vesco, alleged swindler of more than $200 million, recently arrested in Cuba; Kirk Kerkorian, who announced last spring, erroneously, that he was mighty enough to swallow the $18 billion Chrysler Corporation; the billionaire Rupert Murdoch, who seems to pocket politicians around the world like a kid shoplifting gum. And how about the hero-rogues? How thrilling to read about Nicholas W. Leeson, the 28-year-old bond trader who detonated the old British bank Barings from his office in Singapore! And Joseph Jett, who cost Kidder, Peabody and its parent, General Electric, $210 million! Gadzooks -- who can forget the bloated corpse of the media baron Robert Maxwell floating in the ocean, dead possibly by his own hand, leaving in his wake embezzlement in the hundreds of millions?
Such figures may appear larger than life, but in the pre-millennial wired world, we understand as never before that everything is connected to everything else and that the capital being risked by the financial supermen may well include some of our own. More than 50 million American families now own stock, and information about markets and interest rates and stock averages and indexes and earnings reports and government statistics fizzes around us constantly. We worry that we should know what it all means. An army of tired men in their 50's collapses before the Cheshire smile of Louis Rukeyser each Friday night, waiting for sagacities, while younger investors of both sexes hunch over their radios seeking Bloomberg's report on the Nikkei. 
 It is only natural that writers of fiction might find money and its masters to be interesting, and this year has seen a crop of first novels that locate their dramas in the bond-trading department or the corporate suite, most written by people familiar with the jargon and strategies of such places. Among them so far this year are "Bombardiers," by Po Bronson, a former salesman at First Boston; "Free to Trade," by Michael Ridpath, a former fund manager for an international bank; "The Takeover," by Stephen W. Frey, a bank vice president; "Nest of Vipers," by Linda Davies, a former merchant banker; and "Knockoff," by Bill Levy, a former reporter with eight nonfiction books under his belt. With the exception of "Bombardiers," an appealing farce with almost no plot, these books are being marketed by their publishers under the rubric "financial thriller." Like the cold war melodramas that began to appear in the 1960's, the financial thrillers seem to have cut a fresh genre from the headlines. As such, do they tell us something new? Have any of the traders-turned-novelists whispered to us what we might terribly need to hear?
The answer is a resounding no. What happens in these novels looks a lot like writing-by-recipe. Begin with a brilliant young banker or trader, who through dint of hard work and savvy finds himself (or herself, in the case of "Vipers" only) thrust into the pivotal role in an acquisition or stock play or currency-trading conspiracy. Chances are that he is handsome, in top physical condition and knows all the best restaurants. He is also under 35 and unfettered by children or a spouse. (We are given to understand that he is not a promiscuous creep, however.) Specify his salary, to the dollar, as well as the liquor he drinks. Place action in one of the world's financial centers like New York or London. Use dialogue like this: "It's five hundred million dollars, with a coupon of nine and a quarter percent. Maturity is ten years. It is offered at ninety-nine. The yield is nine forty-one. Got that?" ("Free to Trade"). Toss in greedy patrician bosses with names like Granville Winthrop or Hamilton McKenzie and portray them with the subtlety of Mr. Burns, the demonic, hand-rubbing owner of the nuclear power plant on "The Simpsons." These bankers/traders/corporate chieftains are not to be trusted. Add the riff on speed-beauty-horror of the information economy. Work in some good-looking women. They too are under 35, and are not to be trusted. Some of them will die horrible, even misogynistic deaths. Assume the Federal Government is either blundering or wasteful. Be sure to explain obscure details of the trading strategy or merger-acquisition. Toss in a hired assassin, who knocks off minor players with sadistic efficiency. (Same assassin may demonstrate his bona fides by performing fiendish karate moves on gangs of black youths who conveniently cross his path.) Add plot twists and occasional moments of romance with the beautiful untrustworthy women. Make the hero learn he has been entrapped-manipulated-set up (he will use his prodigious mind to unravel the plot set against him and thwart the hired assassin); have somebody chase the hero down an alley or through darkened corporate offices. Be sure that same hero is able to locate usually impossible-to-locate information either by brilliant last-second cognition or through a trusty pal conveniently buried deep in the corporate edifice. (In fact, whenever information is needed by the hero, be sure it arrives with nerve-soothing convenience moments after it is required.) Deploy melodramatic cliches (from "Free to Trade": "My heart was beating wildly"; from "The Takeover": "His heart pounded in his chest and perspiration poured from his body"; from "Nest of Vipers": "Her pulse raced with rage and sorrow, and she felt sweat bead her back"). Now increase frequency of frantic phone calls. Knock off one of the good-looking women. Make hero "lie low" somewhere other than his usual swell digs -- preferably a roach-infested apartment in Harlem -- and patrician overlords nervous as hero-trader confronts-outflanks-reveals them. Bad guys lose, good guys win. Lights up, roll credits. Last shot: hero-trader on beach-avenue-farm with . . . the one woman who could be trusted.
 HAVE we seen these plots before? Yeah -- about a zillion times, in all the usual places (that is, on television). None of the so-called financial novels I've read in the last few months propose to comment on what is really interesting about money: the social inequity it causes, its corrosive action on a human soul, the broader cultural effects of capitalism or simply what it really is like to labor in the dense, well-remunerated seams of corporate power. Even the satirical "Bombardiers" never makes the reader uncomfortable at how and where the gold is piled in our society, though it should be said that the novel's zany observations about bond traders intentionally subvert the culture of money.
It is possible to inscribe an arc from Charles Dickens and "Nicholas Nickleby" to Theodore Dreiser and "The Financier" to F. Scott Fitzgerald and "The Great Gatsby" to Sinclair Lewis and "Babbitt" to John P. Marquand and "Point of No Return" to Louis Auchincloss's early novels to Joseph Heller's vastly underrated "Something Happened" to William Gaddis's "JR" to John Updike's "Rabbit Is Rich" and even to Tom Wolfe's "Bonfire of the Vanities"; that is, each of these older novels successfully investigates some element of capitalism. This recent crop of books is not in that tradition. Their debt, "Bombardiers" excepted, is to Robert Ludlum, Tom Clancy, John Grisham, Judith Krantz and Paul E. Erdman's "Crash of '79."
IN fact, as rude as it may be to say it, I think perhaps we have already reached a familiar moment in the half-life of a genre. Just as, say, the cold war spy books and then the legal thrillers quickly parodied themselves, the financial thriller may now be running the risk of becoming mere electronic rigging and fevered gamesmanship, full of workplace texture but subordinating to plot any attempt at characterization and thoughtful writing and banishing from view the deeper potential of the novel. The publishing industry will quickly move on in any case; doubtless soon we will have the Internet thriller, the purloined movie-script thriller, the war-with-China thriller, the right-wing militia thriller, the virus thriller, the right-wing militia virus thriller and so on.
But capitalism keeps finding new forms, and there is no reason the novel will not chase after them. The American economy increasingly seems to resemble a dangerous casino (which may explain why so many people now seek their fortunes in real casinos, including the ones in Wall Street). Despite the recent vigor of the Dow Jones industrial average, companies are still cutting thousands of jobs or sending them abroad. Were John Steinbeck alive today, he might understand the economic violence of our times and find a narrative that connects the shop floor to the executive. Were John Cheever or Richard Yates writing now, perhaps their short stories might possess a harder, more desperate edge representative of the age. Dickens would see that capital laughs at government. (Shakespeare, strolling the boulevards of the 1990's, would set "Richard III" in Time Warner -- if he did not, that is, end up being Hollywood's highest-paid screenwriter.)
More to the point, perhaps there are young unpublished novelists out there who intuit what 21st-century global capitalism will be, or is already -- who can narratively connect the suffering in American-hired, Korean-run, Japanese-owned, Malaysian-staffed sweatshops to the billions flickering on screens to the secret hearts of the supermen in limousines. Perhaps there is a young writer who will show that we are all now bound upon the wheel of postindustrial capitalism and that the social and political implications of this historical process are disturbing, if not for us, then for our children.
But until then, the bright publisher-hyped moment of the "financial thriller" seems undeniable, ascendant. Not long ago, I sat at lunch in Manhattan with a friend and we discussed the phenomenon of novels whose plots move like roller coasters along the world's fiscal ganglia. "Yes!" he exclaimed, his eyes wide. "I've been thinking about this, I have an idea myself, actually. You take a guy -- some sort of global corporate guy with a lot of power -- and he realizes that the dollar is no longer the world's reserve currency, the yen is stronger, whatever, and he comes up with a new form of digital money that only he can control. . . ."
Yes, yes and so on. No doubt such a novel is being written, even now.

DATELINE: ROME, Aug. 11

 BODY:
Movie buffs pick up L'Unita on Saturdays, when the old Communist Party newspaper virtually gives away videos of Italian movie classics. Hypochondriacs prefer La Repubblica, which for months offered installments from an illustrated medical encyclopedia. Corriere della Sera, the Milan-based grand old lady of Italian journalism, scored a big hit this year with a world atlas that came wrapped inside the paper.
This is what newspaper competition in Italy is all about these days -- gifts, games and gimmicks, anything to increase circulation in a country where newspaper readership, historically low compared with most of Europe, is on the wane. 
 Popular magazines have also been drawn into the game, loading down newsstands with perfumes, combs, necklaces, gardening tools and cooking utensils. Italy's news magazines also dabble in the gimmicks, although their strongest pitch is the weekly parade of naked women on their covers, complemented this summer with a sudden outbreak of male nudity on the inside pages. In a recent cover story on Italy's beach culture titled "Slaves of Summer," the weekly Panaroma featured a picture of a bare female bottom set off by two hands in pink handcuffs.
But it is the war of the "gadgets," as the promotional freebies are called here, that draws the most laments from purists. The war, which has been going on for several years, shows no sign of abating.
This fall L'Unita will come forward with classics of American cinema while La Repubblica and Corriere will find themselves in an embarrassing head-to-head collision, as each offers readers installments from rival encyclopedias.
The fact is that gadgets work. Ever since L'Unita, now the paper of the Party of the Democratic Left, began issuing its Saturday videos, for which readers pay an extra 4,500 lire, or nearly $3, sales have soared from an average Saturday circulation of 120,000 to 450,000.
Marco Ledda, who heads the newspaper's marketing department, said that advertising was up 25 percent and that sales in regions like the south of Italy, where interest in left-wing newspapers is minimal, have jumped by as much as 800 percent.
"Gadgets are the easiest way to gain readers, the best way to beat competitors and the best way to make your name known," said Antonio Pilati, director of the Institute of Media Economics. "But it is like pumping adrenaline into a weak body."
Corriere's successful marketing of its atlas, which followed popular teach-yourself English and French courses, has helped the paper surge ahead of La Repubblica to again become Italy's top-selling daily. On the first day of the atlas campaign in January, the paper sold an extra 400,000 copies, and by mid-1995, its average daily circulation was 790,000, well ahead of La Repubblica's 610,000, said Enrico Gervasi, of the TBWA advertising agency, which handled the campaign.
But the surge in numbers poses the obvious question: If people buy newspapers to get something else, where does that leave the newspaper? The answer is often the nearest trash bin, said several newsstand owners who have monitored Saturday readers as they reach for the videos and toss away L'Unita.
A more telling example is that of L'Informazione, a Rome newspaper that won readers with real-life detective series until last spring, when the series ended and the paper folded.
Alberto Ferrigolo, who wrote a series of articles for the far-left paper Il Manifesto criticizing the gadget craze, said readers did a weeklong "slalom" at their newsstands, alternating between papers depending on what they have to offer -- besides the news -- on any given day.
"It is a drug," he said, "and a lot of journalists feel frustrated because newspapers are no longer the focus of interest."
In fact, the gadgets have only slowed the decline in newspaper readership, which Mr. Ferrigolo says has fallen from 6.7 million to 6.2 million, leaving Italy above only Portugal and Turkey in the region in terms of readers per population.
Experts cite a number of causes for such a poor showing, like bad distribution and an even worse postal system. But above all, the experts point to the powerful draw of Italian television, which captures more than half of Italian advertising revenues.
But another reason for the troubles of the Italian press stems from its long history as a voice for political and business interests. Some newspapers are directly linked to political parties, and as such receive subsidies from the state. But most are owned by Italy's industrial barons.
La Stampa, based in Turin, has long been part of the Fiat industrial empire, which for the last decade also has controlling shares in the Rizzoli publishing house, which owns Corriere della Sera. La Repubblica is owned by the De Benedetti family, which owns Olivetti, and Il Sole 24 Ore, a financial newspaper, belongs to Confindustria, the lobbying group for Italian business.
The result is a highly partisan press that in its devotion to internecine political intrigues often surpasses even the prodigious appetite for political gossip here. "The papers are a little too political, and far from the interests of the people," Mr. Pilati said.
Proponents say inserting books, dictionaries, films, compact disks and maps into newspapers gives readers more information and attracts young people.
"If the Corriere is becoming a defender of the Italian language, I see that as a very noble thing," said Mr. Gervasi of the TBWA advertising agency. "And if the dailies are being attacked by television, protecting themselves through promotion is something very positive."

HEADLINE: Bosnian Serbs, Angry at Setback And Tired of War, Blame Leaders

BYLINE: By JANE PERLEZ 

DATELINE: BANJA LUKA, Bosnia, Aug. 13

 BODY:
Accustomed to bragging of victory rather than swallowing defeat, the usually self-assured Bosnian Serbs here are saying they feel betrayed and are fed up with the war they have conducted with seeming invincibility for so long.
A sense of shock and bewilderment descended on this city, the largest the Serbs hold in Bosnia, as the truth sank in that the Serbian-held Krajina area had caved in without a fight to the Croatian forces. 
 For the first time since the Yugoslav conflict began, soldiers and ordinary citizens are questioning the motives of the Serbian President, Slobodan Milosevic, and the Bosnian Serb leaders who, for the time being, make their headquarters here: Radovan Karadzic, the political leader, and Gen. Ratko Mladic, the commander of the military.
"We feel betrayed by everyone," said a 35-year-old soldier who was home from the front for a five-day break. "Karadzic is accusing Milosevic, Milosevic tarnishes Karadzic, and we are only the pawns in their game."
Adding to the confusion is the spectacle of a cold-blooded public brawl between the once-unified Dr. Karadzic and General Mladic. Last week, Dr. Karadzic demoted the military chief, but when General Mladic refused to step aside and all 20 of his generals backed him, Dr. Karadzic unceremoniously reinstated him.
Each has accused the other of being mad, said officials who were present while the accusations were flying.
Dr. Karadzic, a psychiatrist by profession, said last week that General Mladic was certifiably crazy, an official who was present said. And General Mladic told Dr. Karadzic recently that he had "spent too long with his patients," one of the general's aides said.
What this demoralized spirit in the ranks and the cracks in the hierarchy will mean on the battlefield or at the negotiating table as the United States pursues new peace proposals is hard to discern.
Dr. Karadzic said in an interview published on Saturday in the Bosnian Serb government newspaper Glas Srpski (Serbian Voice), "I prefer that the international community spits at us while we win and we fulfill our aims than the international community pities us and spits at our enemies who, God forbid, would be winning."
General Mladic, who was said by his supporters to be at the battlefront for the last two days, knew that public support for the war effort was very low, an aide said.
The general will try to restore confidence by gaining a battlefield victory in the coming days, the aide said. When that is achieved, he said, General Mladic will settle his score with Dr. Karadzic.
But while the two leaders were getting back to business as usual, at least publicly, the tone was completely different among the people in the cafes, restaurants and homes of Banja Luka.
In this city, the site of some of the most vicious "ethnic cleansing" by the Bosnian Serbs, many Muslims and Croats have fled, leaving behind Bosnian Serbs very loyal to their cause.
On the main street today, a jeep bore a grisly hood ornament -- a human skull with a blue United Nations helmet propped on top.
But beneath such shows of defiance, there was plenty of evidence that faith in the war has been ruptured.
A medical assistant who has worked in the surgery wards of the Bosnian Serb military field hospitals for the last four years said all his army colleagues and civilian friends in Banja Luka wanted the war to end immediately.
"If it's not over in a month, we've all said we are leaving and going away as far as possible -- to New Zealand," he said, showing badly bitten fingernails. "Karadzic has no support; people turn off their television sets when they see him."
An official who accepted the entreaties of Dr. Karadzic to come from Belgrade to help run a governmental department here said that he had set a deadline, Jan. 7, the day Serbian Orthodox Christians celebrate Christmas. "If the war is not finished by then, I will be out of here by the following Christmas," he said.
The economy has crashed so badly, the official said, that the average wage in Banja Luka is now the equivalent of about $60 a month. The embargo imposed by President Milosevic on Serbian-held areas of Bosnia a year ago has worsened an already weak economy, the official said. Factories are at a standstill and jobs are scarce, he said.
Apparently in response to the people's desire to leave -- an estimated 200,000 Bosnian Serbs have fled to Serbia since the war started -- Dr. Karadzic said in a speech in the town of Prijedor last week that further emigration would be banned. He criticized local Serbs who had smuggled themselves into the columns of refugees from Krajina who passed through Banja Luka on their way to Serbia.
"In the future, no one will go anywhere," Mr. Karadzic said. "People must share the common destiny with their army."
But soldiers, who a month ago were being told that the Bosnian Serb fighting machine was strong enough to take on NATO, were openly dispirited, and cited the failure of Serbia to intervene and help Serbs hold on to Krajina.
"The fall of Knin had catastrophic effects on the army," said a soldier, referring to the capital of Krajina. "We are afraid we may be betrayed in the same way Knin was. Then we'll have no control over our destinies."
Another soldier, asked if he was ready to accept a peace plan, said he would have voted to do so last year, but the leadership had told them to vote against it in a referendum. The soldier, who was also on leave for five days, said he found it insulting that the Serbian soldiers in Krajina were forced by their military leaders to give up without a fight.

HEADLINE: Some Republicans Are Wary Of Balanced-Budget Promise

BYLINE: By MICHAEL WINES 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Aug. 13

 BODY:
The Republican-led Congress that left town last week for its summer recess heads home rightly boasting that it has made as much progress toward setting a Federal budget as Democrats made by this time of year when they ruled Capitol Hill.
But this is no ordinary year, or garden-variety budget. Rather, it is the cornerstone of Republican fiscal policy, the first of seven budgets intended to erase the annual Federal deficit by 2002. Yet despite some progress in cutting spending this summer, even some Republicans are beginning to fear that their first year's effort on the budget will fall victim to the clock and the irresistible pressures of re-election politics. 
 The fear swirls around a single piece of legislation that the House and Senate will begin writing next month. It folds into one immense package the Republican plans to curb spending in the most popular and politically sensitive benefit programs, including Medicare, Medicaid, welfare and Federal pensions.
In Capitol Hill parlance, it is called the reconciliation bill. But that is a misnomer, since the measure is likely to pit irreconcilable political forces in the most bitterly fought political battle in years, if not decades. If the Republican leadership can pass it -- and there is no assurance that they have the votes to do so -- President Clinton must decide whether to veto it, and, without major changes, he almost certainly will.
Mr. Clinton's veto is a trump card. While vetoes of spending bills can force Federal agencies to close their doors for lack of money, a veto of a reconciliation bill merely prevents Congress from trimming the benefit programs in the bill. That means the benefit checks continue to flow to recipients -- and the longer they flow, the more their budgets balloon above Republican targets.
Because of that, some Republicans predict that Congress will try to play its own trump, attaching the reconciliation bill to legislation raising the Federal debt ceiling -- in effect the Government's credit limit -- which is expected to come to a vote this fall. That could present Mr. Clinton with the distasteful choice of signing the legislation containing the cutbacks or bringing the entire Government to a halt for lack of money.
At stake is more than just the solvency of the nation, as if that were not enough. The outcome of the standoff may be crucial not just to Republican hopes of retaining control of Congress, but to Mr. Clinton's chances for winning a second term in the White House. The victor in the budget dispute would be able to claim a majority of political support for its budget policies, as well as the high ground in the 1996 campaigns for the White House and Congress.
There is always the chance, of course, that the two foes will compromise early on a single deficit-cutting budget. But no one rates those chances as high.
"I've tried every scenario I know to figure out a way to avoid a meltdown this fall, and I've not been able to find one," a senior budget analyst for Senate Republicans said last week. "The question is not so much how to avoid it, but what to do the morning after."
In interviews last week, Republicans cast the impending budget battle as almost a test of manhood, a fight they must win if only to prove their political mettle.
"We've made such a big issue out of balancing the budget that it would be absolutely irresponsible for us not to reach that goal," said Senator Charles E. Grassley, an Iowa Republican on the Finance Committee. "Eventually, Republicans have to conclude, 'Are we going to govern or not?' And I think we'll conclude that we have to."
In fact, Congress has already taken real votes for deep spending cuts. Before its recess, the House passed 11 of the 13 major spending bills that set 1996 budgets for the bureaucracy, and the Senate passed 6 of them, all rolling back many popular programs and abolishing others.
Leaders in both chambers say they intend to pass compromise versions of all 13 bills by the start of the new fiscal year, Oct. 1. If they do, they will have reduced discretionary spending -- for Cabinet agencies, the White House and most other purposes besides benefit checks and interest on the national debt -- by 4.4 percent below the 1995 level.
Mr. Clinton has promised to veto some of those bills. But Republicans are basically united, public reaction has been muted and analysts widely anticipate that most will prevail.
Still, those 13 bills represent only a third of Federal spending. The real struggle is over the remaining two-thirds, most of which will likely wind up in the House or Senate reconciliation packages -- and in the thick of the 1996 campaigns.
In the reconciliation bill, Congress will try to pare the growth of benefit programs that have been virtually armor-plated for decades. The order of battle is huge: overhaul Medicare; replace most welfare entitlements with block grants to the states; revise Medicaid, cut billions in crop subsidies, and, perhaps, change the federally guaranteed student loan program.
Most, if not all, of those efforts will reach a climax in the reconciliation bills that the House Ways and Means Committee and the Senate Finance Committee will try to write next month. In many Congresses, overhauling just one major program could consume an entire season of lawmaking; this Congress hopes to finish work on the reconciliation package by mid-November.
In this process, there lies great political peril.
House members, all of whom face re-election next year, began to hear the first notes of worry about changes in Medicare when they returned to their districts for town hall meetings with voters during the first week of August. But the House is relatively united under its right wing; the Republicans' greatest potential for division lies in their more moderate and independent-thinking majority in the Senate.
There, jockeying for position in the 1996 Presidential race has already caused stress fractures in Republican unity.
One harbinger of trouble surfaced last week when Senator Bob Dole of Kansas, the majority leader, was forced to pull his own proposal to overhaul welfare from the Senate floor. Mr. Dole was not just done in by an unusually united Democratic minority, but also by his own party's right wing, which is lined up behind his rival for the Republican Presidential nomination, Senator Phil Gramm of Texas.
That pushes welfare into an already frantic September, and raises the question of whether the Senate's 54 Republicans can hang together long enough to push a reconciliation bill into law.
Some analysts suggest that will be tough. "They've got problems with Medicare cuts to begin with," said Stanley Collender, the chief budget expert for Price-Waterhouse in Washington. "Throw welfare in there and you may have enough Republican votes to defeat it."
The senators could ease the pain of some cuts by taking some money from the seven-year, $245 billion tax cut that the House and Senate tentatively agreed to in June. But that would very likely rankle the House, where conservatives are demanding an even bigger tax cut.
Other money-raisers, like lengthening the seven-year path to fiscal balance or lowering cost-of-living indexes for pensions and other benefits, might anger the House or parrot Mr. Clinton's own plan, two unacceptable choices from the Republican perspective.
Many Republicans nevertheless predict that the Senate will bite the bullet. Senator Slade Gorton, a Washington Republican who sits on the Budget Committee, predicted a "titanic struggle" that would end in passage of the bill. Senator Grassley agreed. "Reconciliation is a tough vote any way you look at it," he said. "But I suppose that by folding a lot of issues into one vote, you avoid a lot of tough votes later on."

HEADLINE: U.S. and Russia Seek Balkans Accord

BYLINE: By ALESSANDRA STANLEY 

DATELINE: MOSCOW, Aug. 13

 BODY:
Russia and the United States, which have separately proposed new diplomatic initiatives to halt the widening war in the Balkans, sought to coordinate their approaches at a meeting here today.
Moscow is eager to play a larger role in bringing an end to the fighting, but its support for Serbia, a traditional Russian ally, has often put it at odds with Western diplomatic efforts. 
 Foreign Minister Andrei V. Kozyrev met with Anthony Lake, President Clinton's national security adviser, in the Russian resort town of Sochi today. Mr. Lake sought to enlist the Russian Government's support for Washington's newest proposals, which take into account the latest developments on the battlefield.
Mr. Lake left the two-and-a-half-hour meeting without comment, but his hastily scheduled stop, which was added to a round of private consultations in France, Germany and England, indicated that Washington is increasingly aware of the need to address Russia's concerns over the Balkans.
Alarmed by Croatian troops' recent successful attacks on rebel Serbian troops in the Krajina border territory, Moscow said on Friday that it wanted to be host to an international peace conference in Moscow, and President Boris N. Yeltsin offered to personally mediate preliminary talks between Serbia, Bosnia and Croatia.
Mr. Kozyrev did not discuss the American proposals with reporters. Instead, eager to paint Russia as a major player in negotiations, he said after his meeting with Mr. Lake that he believed that Washington did not object to Mr. Yeltsin's recent call for an international peace conference in Moscow.
Saying Russia's idea for an international conference preceded by three-way talks among the warring sides "finds recognition with the U.S. side," Mr. Kozyrev added: "This is very important. We have them on board now in search of a political solution."
But he acknowledged that Washington did not look favorably on Russia's insistence that the United Nations lift its military and economic sanctions against the rump Yugoslavia. "In American thinking," Mr. Kozyrev said, "it looks like lifting or suspending sanctions is not the immediate task we want it to be."
There are few details on the plan Mr. Lake is presenting. Mr. Clinton has denied that it is an altered version of a 1994 peace-plan map that would give 51 percent of Bosnia to a loose Muslim-Croatian federation and 49 percent to the Bosnian Serbs, who now hold more than 70 percent of it. But a review of the plan, drafted by Russia, France, Britain, Germany and the United States, has been mentioned.
Some American and Western diplomats say that the American plan includes a proposal to persuade the Muslim-led Bosnian Government to swap the surrounded enclave of Gorazde, the last remaining United Nations "safe area" in eastern Bosnia, for territory near Sarajevo.
There have been reports that the United States is considering threatening Bosnian Serbs with more NATO bombing and that Bosnian Muslim fighters might be joined by troops from other Muslim nations.
Russia, which complained about not being consulted about NATO air strikes in the past, is unlikely to approve of a larger role for NATO in the region.
Russia has been openly unhappy with what it sees as thinly veiled American and German approval of Croatia's recent blitz against rebel Serbs.
Washington is backing its initiative by sending Assistant Secretary of State Richard C. Holbrooke to Sarajevo, Zagreb and Belgrade this week to discuss the proposals with leaders in the region.
After meeting in Moscow with the Serbian President, Slobodan Milosevic, on Thursday, Mr. Yeltsin on Saturday sent 90 tons of relief supplies to Serbian refugees fleeing the fighting in Croatia.
American and European negotiators have been seeking to persuade President Milosevic to recognize Bosnia, and possibly Croatia, in exchange for lifting international economic sanctions on what remains of Yugoslavia. Moscow strongly supports freeing Yugoslavia of the sanctions.
At a special session of the lower house of Parliament on Saturday, Russian deputies, in a nonbinding ballot, voted to release Russia from its pledge to uphold sanctions against Yugoslavia.
Although Mr. Yeltsin is not obliged to act on it, the resolution reflected both the strong pro-Serbian sentiments in Russia, and the pressure Mr. Yeltsin is under from nationalists and Communists to distance himself from the West and take a strong stand in the Balkans.

Clinton Phones British Leader
 WASHINGTON, Aug. 13 (Reuters) -- President Clinton telephoned Prime Minister John Major of Britain today to discuss new United States proposals to end the Balkan conflict, an Administration official said.
Mr. Clinton and Mr. Major spoke for half an hour about the United States delegation that has been holding talks in Europe and a follow-up team that will tour Balkan capitals starting Monday for talks with the parties to the war.
"Prime Minister Major was generally supportive of the efforts," said the official, who spoke on condition of anonymity. But he gave no substantive details of the discussion or of the plan.

HEADLINE: Murdoch-Led Newspaper War Threatens to Crush Britain's Independent

BYLINE: By SARAH LYALL 

DATELINE: LONDON, Aug. 13

 BODY:
Conceived in secret just nine years ago by a band of ambitious journalists from the right-leaning Daily Telegraph, The Independent was born in a rush of optimism and excitement at the height of the big-spending 1980's in Britain. Its ringing challenge of an advertising slogan -- "It is. Are you?" -- summed up the newspaper's mission nicely: to publish a paper free from the political and financial obligations that so often attend news coverage here.
For a few heady years, it all seemed to work. But now, plagued by Britain's recent recession, the rising cost of newsprint, defecting readers and, above all, by a price war instigated by Rupert Murdoch, The Independent is floundering. Circulation has slipped to about 300,000 from a high of 423,000 in 1989; more than 70 editorial employees have quit or been dismissed in the last year, and analysts say the newspaper and its sibling, The Independent on Sunday, are losing $1.6 million a month. 
 Perhaps most alarming to its once-idealistic founders, The Independent is no longer independent. Instead, it is owned by three newspaper groups that keep an anxious watch on its bottom line. Two hold stakes of 43 percent each: Mirror Group P.L.C., the owner of two leading tabloids, The Daily Mirror and The Mirror on Sunday, which are sympathetic to the Labor Party, and Independent Newspapers P.L.C., which owns a chain of Irish newspapers and is run by Anthony F. J. O'Reilly, chief executive of the H. J. Heinz Company in Pittsburgh. Prisa, the Spanish company that also owns El Pais, Spain's leading daily newspaper, owns 12.6 percent.
The result is a paper that many Britons feel has lost its way. "It's a competent newspaper," said Stephen Glover, one of The Independent's since-departed founding editors. "But what is it trying to do?"
The answer is complicated. In the last few years, it has often seemed the paper's only goal was to hang on for dear life. "The paper should by all accounts have lain down and died a long time ago," a media analyst said, speaking on condition of anonymity, and acknowledging that he had too often predicted The Independent's imminent demise.
Jostling with The Independent at the newsstand are several other broadsheets, known in Britain as quality newspapers, all with strong party philosophies. They include The Times of London, a Murdoch-owned paper that has been the traditional voice of the establishment; The Daily Telegraph, which reflects the views of business and of the Conservative Party's right wing, and The Guardian, the paper of the left, which more or less supports Tony Blair, the current Labor leader.
However well these papers do -- The Daily Telegraph's circulation in June was 1.07 million -- none does as well as the most popular tabloids. In June, for example, The Sun had a daily circulation of 3.99 million.
At The Independent's offices on the 18th floor of a tower in Canary Wharf, a renovated commercial section on the outskirts of London, staff members say they live in fear of what will happen next. "We're all incredibly gloomy," a longtime editor said, speaking on the condition of anonymity. "We've spent the last three years with all the other papers mocking and deriding us, we've just had 43 redundancies, and we're all been asked to do a lot more. It's incredibly disruptive."
Last month, when the paper's editor, Ian Hargreaves, announced the most recent round of dismissals, he also outlined overall budget cuts totaling about 25 percent of the paper's costs. Among other things, The Independent has merged its back-office operations with those of the Mirror Group, shut a number of overseas bureaus and reduced its staff in the United States.
The trouble for The Independent probably began as early as 1990, when the paper decided to stretch by starting The Independent on Sunday. Though the Sunday paper sold well and was considered a journalistic success, it was introduced at the end of the worst advertising recession in memory. The Sunday paper lost money and began to drain resources from the daily Independent.
In September 1993, Mr. Murdoch, whose News Corporation already owns London's most successful tabloid, the weekly News of the World, and Sunday broadsheet, The Sunday Times, decided to make an all-out circulation push for his daily broadsheet, The Times of London.
The Times had always been outperformed by The Daily Telegraph, and Mr. Murdoch had never liked the free-thinking Independent because the paper presented itself from the beginning as a direct challenger to his own partisan newspaper style. Indeed, many of The Independent's readers came from disenchanted enthusiasts of the pre-Murdoch Times.
He decided to cut the cover price of The Times by one-third, to 30 pence, or about 48 cents, from 45 pence. The Times's rivals had no choice but to follow suit. Last summer, The Telegraph reluctantly cut its price to 30 pence, though The Guardian held firm at 45 pence. Mr. Murdoch responded by going down to 20 pence. The Independent, which could ill afford it, tried to keep pace by dropping its price part way.
Circulation went haywire. By January 1994, The Independent's circulation had fallen 17.7 percent, to 290,804 from 353,198 in January 1993. "It's been bloody murder," Mr. Hargreaves said.
The price wars began to subside this July, when The Times raised its price to 25 pence and The Telegraph and The Independent each went to 35 pence. But the prices are still artificially low, which benefits Mr. Murdoch, who has the resources to offset the losses from The Times.
Editorially, The Independent is at an interesting crossroads. About half the paper's readers are younger than 35. Many of them are politically skeptical, Mr. Hargreaves said, in tune with a newspaper that has made its way by taking issue with the policies of both the Conservatives and the Labor Party.
"Of all the troubles that we've had and all the pressures that we face," he said, "none of them have anything to do with anyone saying what the paper's agenda should be, or what it should cover."
But, Mr. Hargreaves acknowledged, independence can be relative. "We do have a particular form of independence," he said. "We're independent only as long as we stay in business, and we're only going to be in business in the long run if we stop losing money."

HEADLINE: Low Ranking for Poor American Children

BYLINE: By KEITH BRADSHER 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Aug. 13

 BODY:
Poor children in the United States are poorer than the children in most other Western industrialized nations, as young Americans suffer the brunt of several trends toward greater economic inequality, a new study shows.
Only in Israel and Ireland are poor children worse off than poor American youths, according to the study, an analysis of 18 nations by the Luxembourg Income Study, a nonprofit group based in Walferdange, Luxembourg. 
 The results are the most comprehensive of several recent analyses, and are particularly striking because the United States has the second highest level of economic output per person of the countries examined, after Luxembourg itself, and has the most prosperous affluent children of any of the 18 nations.
It may not be surprising that childhood poverty is worse in the United States than in Scandinavia, where governments have racked up huge national debts while trying to maintain elaborate social safety nets. But the United States also ranks below countries like Italy, which has a considerably smaller economy per person and has less generous social policies than many northern European nations.
The United States appears to have sunk through the rankings over the last 30 years, although no conclusive data are available now, said Timothy M. Smeeding, one of the study's authors and director of the Luxembourg Income Study. The American lead in overall prosperity has dwindled since the 1960's, income inequality has risen briskly in the United States and child poverty spread here in the 1970's and 1980's, although it may have leveled off in the early part of this decade.
Child poverty has also risen in Britain and Israel, while showing relatively little change in Continental Europe, according to the latest study.
Some conservative economists have questioned the validity of studies that attempt to compare levels of income and distribution of wealth among nations with somewhat different economic systems and societies. There is general acceptance within the field, however, of the idea that the United States has proportionately more of its children in poverty than other affluent countries. The debate revolves instead around what to do about it.
The results of the Luxembourg Income Study report, which is based on census survey data from the various countries, are consistent with less statistically detailed work by other social scientists.
The study comes as Congress is deciding whether to limit Federal spending on various welfare programs. Senator Bob Dole of Kansas, the majority leader, tried to push welfare legislation through the Senate last week, but ended up postponing action until after Labor Day following strong resistance from Democrats and from conservatives within his party.
During a press conference on Thursday, President Clinton expressed strong concern about stagnant incomes, particularly for less-affluent Americans. "We've got to grow the economy and raise incomes," he said. "That's why I want to raise the minimum wage, that's why I want to give every unemployed worker or underemployed worker the right to two years of education at the local community college, that's why I'm trying to have a tax cut that's focused on child rearing and education: to raise incomes."
Mr. Smeeding said there appeared to be several reasons why the United States had such extreme poverty among children.
The United States has the widest gap between rich and poor, he said. The United States also has less generous social programs than the other 17 countries in the study, which are Australia, Canada, Israel, and 14 European countries: Austria, Belgium, Britain, Denmark, Finland, France, Germany, Ireland, Italy, Luxembourg, Netherlands, Norway, Sweden and Switzerland. The study did not include several Western European nations like Greece, Spain and Portugal that have very poor children but limited data.
American households with children tend to be less affluent than the average American household, a pattern that is not true in many other countries.
This trend may reflect that American mothers are less likely than European mothers to return to work quickly after childbirth, partly because inexpensive, high-quality child care is more widely available in Europe, said Lee Rainwater, the research director of the Luxembourg Income Study and the co-author with Mr. Smeeding of the latest report. The Luxembourg group sent copies of the report to prominent social researchers last week and will make it more broadly available in the coming days.
Some conservative analysts question whether international comparisons of prosperity should even be attempted. They point to the many differences among nations' economies and societies.
There are more poor children in the United States than in many affluent countries, but that partly reflects the high number of poor immigrants and unwed teen-age mothers here, said Douglas J. Besharov, a resident scholar at the American Economic Institute, a conservative research group here.
"Is there more poverty in a big, diverse country like ours than in Western Europe?" he asked. "The answer is yes."
He and other conservative economists argue that the price the other countries pay for avoiding extremes of childhood poverty may be slower economic growth, which, they assert, leads to lower living standards for all. A large chunk of European social assistance to young families takes the form of generous unemployment benefits that have eroded incentives for people to work, Mr. Besharov said.
The Luxembourg Income Study is financed by the National Science Foundation in Washington and similar agencies from 18 other governments. Its staff has been working for the last decade to develop ways to make reliable international comparisons. The group is a repository for computerized data on income distribution from 25 countries around the world, which it makes available for free to social researchers.
In addition to his work with the study, Mr. Smeeding is an economics professor at Syracuse University and one of the nation's leading experts on income calculations. While he personally favors expanded social spending in the United States, he is generally regarded in the field as an undogmatic thinker. Mr. Rainwater is a professor emeritus of sociology at Harvard University and the author of many books on poverty.
Their study is critical of Republican efforts to cut American social spending now.
The study compares incomes of poor and affluent households with children. The figures include not only after-tax wages and other personal income but also cash benefits from the government, like food stamps and the tax credit on earned income for low-income working parents with children. The calculations take into account differences among countries in the size of families and in the cost of living.
The figures do not include free government services, like the free medical and child-care services available in many European countries.
Sheila B. Kamerman, a professor of social policy and planning at Columbia University, said that for this reason, the latest analysis may have underestimated the extent to which poor American children lag in income. "If you were looking at in-kind benefits as well as cash benefits, the situation in the U.S. would look even worse," she said.
Professor Kamerman and Alfred J. Kahn, another Columbia University social policy professor, published a lengthy study two weeks ago reviewing social programs in Britain, Denmark, Finland, France, Germany, Italy and the United States and found that American poor children received the least help.
Poor children in Denmark do particularly well in comparison to poor American children. Vita Pruzan, the director of the children, youth and family research division at the National Institute of Social Research in Copenhagen, said in a telephone interview that in reducing child poverty, the Danish Government had found it particularly effective to provide free obstetric and nursing services.
Denmark also makes a particular effort to help single mothers who do not receive child support payments from the fathers of their children. "If the father is absent and doesn't pay, the state will pay what he is supposed to pay," Dr. Pruzan said. "The state tries to collect the money from the father, but that is not her problem."
Poor children in Italy are also better off than poor American children, even though the median income in Italy is considerably less than in the United States. Free child care for some poor children and a low-cost health care system have helped, said Patrizia Ghedini, the head of the family issues department of the regional government for the area of northern Italy around Bologna.
But in Italy, the gap separating rich and poor is also smaller than in the United States. According to the Luxembourg Income Study report, a poor household with children near the bottom of the income scale in Italy earned $12,552 in 1991, while an affluent household with children near the top of the scale earned about $44,280. For the United States, the comparable figures that year were $10,923 and $65,536.

HEADLINE: 50 Years After V-J Day, the Memories Are Sweet

BYLINE: By DOREEN CARVAJAL 

 BODY:
Squeezed in a neon canyon of billboards touting Sony, Samsung and Suntory, thousands of veterans made a sentimental journey to Times Square yesterday, remembering a delirious V-J Day celebration that spontaneously erupted in the same spot 50 years ago.
A half-century had naturally dulled the euphoria; this crowd kept to their chairs, humming softly to Glenn Miller, laughing at Henny Youngman ("I said, 'Doctor, how do I stand?' He says, 'That's what puzzles me.' "), leafing through memories of when they were lean, fearless and 19. 
 "I'm here because I missed the original party 50 years ago," said Alfred Kempski, 71, of Deer Park, L.I., who spent the real V-J Day on a crowded wooden troopship steaming toward Japan.
What he missed on Aug. 14, 1945, was a crowd of more than a million people celebrating a two-word news flash: Japan Surrenders. The block party in Times Square stretched from 40th to 52d Streets, a frenzy of hugging and dancing that came to be symbolized by a Life magazine photograph of a young sailor's passionate kiss of a nurse in a crisp white uniform.
Yesterday's anniversary celebration, which was hurriedly organized by the city, was considerably smaller. The crowd, which city officials estimated at more than 8,000, was truly big enough for a block party, filling Broadway between 44th and 45th Streets.
"It seemed like the only people who cared were the vets themselves," said Marty Algaze, a spokesman for the Mayor's Office. "The problem has been pulling it together and raising money from corporate sponsors. I think a lot of them were saying it's not such a big deal."
With two giant black and white posters of the Life magazine kiss for a backdrop, Julie Wilson, Margaret Whiting, Mr. Youngman and Celeste Holm volunteered to perform for the anniversary. Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani and his wife, Donna, also took part, trying mightily to demonstrate a 1995 version of the V-J kiss.
It was a different world then, said the Mayor, who was a year old at the time. The Brooklyn Dodgers were in third place, the New York Giants in fourth. The Times Square billboard advertised Pepsi-Cola. And men like Milton Hirschberg cradled carbines instead of canes.
"I was on guard duty when surrender came and we were greatly relieved," recalled Mr. Hirschberg, 80, of Flushing, Queens. He came to the V-J anniversary wearing a yellow Hawaiian shirt of palm trees and blazing suns. He opened it to reveal a faded T-shirt, some 50 years old, which he wore while serving in the 10th Army. To prove his military service, he brought along a leather album of black and white photographs of Japan. They were taken, he said, with a smuggled camera.
There was something about the soft breeze blowing through Times Square that made old men sentimental. Everywhere there a veteran digging in his pockets for a memento.
Herbert Brown, of North Miami Beach, Fla., produced the small salmon-colored card certifying that he had witnessed the surrender of Japan.
"Oh, I was only 19 then. It's hard to believe it was 50 years ago," he said.
Kenneth Johnson, 75, fished in his pocket and found black and white photographs with ruffled edges of a lean young soldier, darkly handsome. "That's me," he said.
Like other veterans at the event, he said he found it strange to live in a time when the enemies he fought are now his country's allies. "A Japanese man came up to me before this started and said, 'What's going on today?' I said, 'If you guys had won the war we wouldn't have been here today.' "
Daniel S. Fruchter, of the Pearl Harbor Survivors Association, was even more blunt: "We've won the war, but we've lost the peace, and this country is losing its way. We're now a debtor nation to Japan. War is economic and we've become beholden to them."

HEADLINE: Cable TV's Quiet Victory

BYLINE: By MARK LANDLER 

 BODY:
In the rush before the House passed its sweeping communications bill this month, Gerald Waldron was amazed.
Mr. Waldron, who represents network television affiliates, was among the legion of lobbyists prowling the halls of Congress. The local phone companies were out in force, as were the long-distance carriers, and every other conceivable sector of the communications industries. 
 Every group, that is, but the cable television industry, whose conspicuous absence was startling to Mr. Waldron.
Startling, that is, until he stopped to think about it. For cable businesses, the best policy was to avoid drawing attention to the legislation's exceedingly kind treatment of their industry.
While the House bill, like the Senate version passed earlier this summer, would grant new freedoms to all of the leading communications businesses, only cable television would be deregulated without long delays or steep hurdles.
Cable operators managed to gain all this while lying low because of Congressional misgivings about the mixed results of the 1992 attempt to regulate prices.
But now consumer advocates and Democratic lawmakers fear steep price increases as the House prepares to reconcile its bill, passed on Aug. 4, with the Senate legislation passed in June.
"Consumers have no protection against rate gouging," said Representative Edward J. Markey, a Massachusetts Democrat who tried unsuccessfully to limit the House bill's deregulation of cable rates.
The House bill would lift rate caps on cable networks like CNN and MTV after 15 months. Smaller cable systems would be deregulated immediately. The Senate bill would lift rate caps on all systems, except for those that Federal regulators deem to be charging "substantially more" than the national average. President Clinton has threatened to veto the legislation, in part because of the deregulation of cable. But it passed both the House and Senate by margins that would appear to be veto-proof, or a two-thirds majority vote. And if something resembling either the House or Senate version becomes law, consumer activists predict that cable operators would soon raise their average monthly rates by $5 to $7 -- an increase of 22 percent to 32 percent over current rates.
"They have every incentive to raise rates quickly, because they face no competition right now," said Bradley Stillman, director of telecommunications policy at the Consumer Federation of America.
Mr. Stillman said that a cable company would have to charge an additional $5 a month to make up in one year the revenue it lost in the three years since Congress voted to re-regulate cable rates. The Federal Communications Commission, which slashed basic rates by an average 17 percent in 1993, estimates that consumers have saved roughly $3 billion in that period.
Cable executives, who acknowledge that they kept a low profile during the House debate, insist that it is ludicrous to suggest that they would increase basic rates at a time when competition is escalating and they are seeking to enter the local telephone business.
"Cable companies learned their lesson the last time around," said Marc B. Nathanson, the chairman, president and chief executive of Falcon Cable Systems Company, a midsize cable operator based in Los Angeles. "I think the companies will act more responsibly now. Rates will go up gradually, stabilize, and then come down."
For now, though, competition in cable seems more theoretical than real. Direct-broadcast-satellite providers like DirecTV and Prime Star are signing up customers at a good clip. But direct-broadcast satellite still has fewer than 2 million subscribers -- compared with 61 million for cable.
While the Bell telephone companies could emerge as cable competitors, technological and regulatory snags have slowed their progress.
The Bell Atlantic Corporation and U S West Inc. both recently withdrew applications to the F.C.C. to upgrade their networks for video services. Moreover, many analysts say that since the Baby Bells can now compete in the long-distance market, they will train their guns on the AT&T Corporation and the MCI Communications Corporation, rather than on cable giants like Time Warner Inc. or Tele-Communications Inc. Long-distance is a much bigger business than cable, and the Bells already own much of the equipment needed to provide that service.
And just as the phone companies plan to offer cable service, cable operators are gearing up to provide local phone service. This prospect, legislative experts said, helped cable gain such favorable treatment.
Republicans in the House and Senate hope that cable -- by competing with local phone service providers -- will act as a counterweight to the Bell companies, preventing them from quashing competition in new markets.
Consumer advocates acknowledge that the cable industry has struggled on Wall Street in recent years. But they said that even this does not justify a wholesale increase in cable rates.
Gene Kimmelman, the co-director of Consumers Union, said that over the seven years that rates were deregulated, from 1986 to 1993, cable ratcheted up its rates at three times the rate of inflation.
On the local level, large cable operators like Tele-Communications Inc. and the Cablevision Systems Corporation used to face protests from customers angry over rate increases. Now nobody is picketing the headquarters of Cablevision in Woodbury, L.I., said Peter Wunsch, a Long Island resident who once organized such protests.
"Most people seem resigned to the fact that their rates are going to go up," he said.
The prospect of rising cable rates also stirred few emotions during the House's recent debate on the telecommunications bill. With little fanfare, lawmakers rejected Mr. Markey's cable amendment by a substantial margin of 275 to 148.
But the cable issue is far from dead, said several legal experts.
President Clinton has threatened to veto the House bill, citing its lax treatment of cable as one of the reasons.

HEADLINE: It's Not Quite Paradise;
Running an Inn on Block Island Teaches Owners All About Beauty and Balance Sheets

BYLINE: By KIRK JOHNSON 

DATELINE: BLOCK ISLAND, R.I.

 BODY:
You discover things about life out here in your first season running an old Victorian inn on a windswept speck of tidal moors and bluffs. Sheets, for example. Brad and Anne Marthens can tell you a lot about sheets.
It was their first week in business in late April when the Marthenses discovered that the innkeeping guidebooks were wrong about linens. On Block Island, because of the vicissitudes of the ferry schedule -- and the fact that the nearest commercial laundry is on the mainland -- an inn needs three full sets of linen, not two. Dirty sheets go out on the 12:30 P.M. ferry to Point Judith, R.I., and they do not come back until the 9 A.M. boat the next day, at the earliest. 
 "We needed a lot more," Mrs. Marthens said with a sigh. "Of all the things we didn't realize."
Mrs. Marthens's words provide an apt coda for the couple's first year as innkeepers. The things they didn't realize, for better and worse, have formed the texture of their lives since they came to this island, nearly two hours by ferry off the tip of Montauk, L.I., last fall.
They had never run an inn before or lived on an island, but here they dived in head first, life savings and all, pursuing their dream in a 116-year-old, 21-room hilltop retreat called the Atlantic Inn, leaving friends, jobs, routines and familiarity all behind them.
They have not found paradise or perfection. Life here, they said, has been confusing and invariably challenging. But unlike the thousands of people who only dream of tossing aside the workaday world, the Marthenses have done it.
The saga began last September, when they signed papers selling their home in Cheshire, Conn. Leaving their lawyer's office, the Marthenses drove directly to the ferry, their car loaded with what they could carry.
The rest of their belongings, which followed later, could not fit in their small upstairs managers' apartment, so it has been scattered through various rooms of the inn or put into storage.
Through the winter, with the inn closed and empty, the couple painted, changed fixtures and doorknobs and made lists. Now, in late summer, they race to keep up with the seasonal crush, gratified that the inn is full most nights, but staggered by the burden as well.
Like one long shakedown cruise, they said, the year is ending as it began: complicated, noisy, chaotic, at times profoundly moving, but always new. They keep a stack of letters perhaps six inches high from strangers all over the country who wrote to wish them good luck and courage after the Marthenses' story was told in an article in The New York Times last fall.
"We certainly have questioned ourselves many times, saying, 'What have we done?' " said Mr. Marthens, a 35-year-old former advertising executive for Times Mirror cable television.. "But I can honestly say we've never been happier. I'm convinced we made the right decision, even though it has not been an easy road."
Some moments, the Marthenses said, will be etched in their minds forever. They both speak of the day last spring, about a month before opening day, when the dining room was still a mess of dust and dirt and uninstalled carpet. Out of nowhere, their chef and first employee, Lawrence Busteed, announced that dinner would be served. He spread a white tablecloth and put out the good china, and they all sat down together in the silent, empty, dirty inn and dined.
"Sometimes they get to a point where they just don't know what to do," said Mr. Busteed, who grew up in an innkeeping family (his parents once managed the Atlantic Inn) and knows the business's inherent anxieties well. Mr. Busteed, 33, said part of his role was to provide a calming influence. "I just keep telling them, 'It takes time; it takes years,' " he said.
It also helps to have emergency financial reserves, as the Marthenses were repeatedly told in the innkeeping course they took before the purchase.
One morning in mid-March, for instance, after a weird but typical Block Island spring -- alternating periods of icy cold fog and blazing sun -- the Marthenses realized that the paint applied just last summer by the previous owners had begun to bubble and peel. It was a month before opening day, and the whole exterior needed painting. That crisis, along with the sheets and a few lesser bumps, have pushed the couple's first-year expenses about 15 percent to 20 percent higher than they had planned, although still within the amount they had set aside. Most of their other assets -- including the proceeds from their home in Connecticut and almost all their savings -- have been put into the down payment on the inn, which they bought for $1.1 million.
The real bottom line of innkeeping, however, is not the money but the workload: as the summer season reaches its crescendo, from mid-August through Labor Day, and the inn is full almost every night, the Marthenses say they are working harder than they ever have.
Forget the genteel charm of the inn's croquet-field front lawn, the wide-beamed wicker-strewn front porch and the melodic tinkling of the early evening cocktail hour. You cannot hear the hushed, distant thunder of the surf when you are behind the front desk, or at the computer, paying the bills at 5 A.M.
What's worse, the Marthenses have found that in order to spend time with their 5-year-old son, Brad Jr., and minimize his hours in day care, they must work separate shifts, which means less time together as a family. One of them must always be on duty by 6:30 A.M. to help get ready for the breakfast buffet, and one -- usually Mr. Marthens -- also works in the evenings, helping out in the dining room.
"We've lost dinner time together," Mrs. Marthens said.
At crush times, like Sunday morning checkout time, they work side by side behind the front desk, beaming at the compliments and listening with solicitous earnestness to the complaints, while their son plays on the front foyer carpet.
The Sunday scene at the front desk epitomizes the Marthenses' juggling act: One woman wants to check out but worries about her bags. Two tennis players, who are not guests, saunter in, wondering why they were kicked off the court. That forces Mr. Marthens to play the heavy; the courts, he tells them, are reserved for guests.
Meanwhile, Brad Jr., with a glue stick, cotton balls and paper, is creating art and playing peekaboo with guests through the grandfather clock's glass window. When the traffic clears, Mr. Marthens steps out from behind the desk, absently picks up scraps of waste paper, approves his son's project -- all the while engaging another guest in conversation -- then heads back behind the counter.
Want a day off? If it's August, it's probably out of the question. An old inn full of guests cries out at every turn with its endless wants. If you do not consciously drag yourself away, it will suck you back in. Even slipping away for just a few hours is an act of will.
"Not caving in -- that's the hard part," said Mrs. Marthens, 37, a former office manager who quit her job when her son was born. "You just have to say, 'I'm going.' " Block Island's summer economy works on the same principle -- that a whole year's worth of commerce can be crammed into one season. In high summer, 15,000 people might be on the 11-square-mile island -- whole battalions in running shorts and roller-blades, sweatbands and swimsuits. There are two seasonal movie theaters, and you can get a plate of calamari at Rebecca's until 2 A.M.
In winter, almost all the inns, including the Atlantic, close, along with many of the stores, and the population plummets, to about 500.
But island life also has a continuity the Marthenses said they had not anticipated. Lives get bound up in places like the Atlantic Inn. Old properties like this attract orbits of people who love them, and they sometimes cannot tear themselves away.
When Mrs. Marthens's father died in June near Providence, R.I., for example, she said her grief had been immediately tinged with panic. How could they leave the inn? Who would cover for them?
From out of the blue, the previous managers -- Mr. Busteed's parents, Ken and Linda -- called from their home in Vermont. They had heard from their son and through the Atlantic Inn network that the Marthenses were in trouble. Did they need a couple of pinch-hitters for a week, at no charge?
"Innkeeping is such a commitment," Mrs. Busteed explained. "You put so much of yourself into it, 15 hours a day, every day you're open. There's like a loyalty, an esprit de corps as things blossom -- it's hard to leave."
Bill Keogh is another member of the Atlantic Inn cast. A 45-year-old carpenter and handyman with a ponytail and a beeper, he came for a couple of weeks of work, putting up siding for the previous owners. That was 16 years ago, and he's still here.
"I was still in my radical stage -- my hippie stage, maybe," said Mr. Keogh, who had bounced around much of the country before landing here. "I'd found a lot of New England difficult, but this place was different."
Mr. Keogh, known to all as B. K., eventually started his own construction business on the island and started a family. But when the Marthenses arrived, he returned to help them paint the inn's rooms throughout the winter.
And the Marthenses say they will never forget one of their first guests, a librarian from New York City. For a time, in fact, she was the inn's only guest. Sometimes in the mornings and afternoons, she and the Marthenses would sit together and chat. She learned their story and met their son, who will enter kindergarten this fall, and when the islandwide town meeting was held during her stay, she went as a sort of amateur anthropologist, intrigued by island politics. She also brought back all the literature she could find about the island's school system, while the Marthenses stayed at the inn and worked.
"She was just the nicest woman in the world," Mr. Marthens said. "It was exactly the right way for us to kind of ease into innkeeping."
Atlantic Inn veterans like Mr. Keogh say they believe the island and the inn will also fold the Marthenses in its embrace so they will never want to leave. Standing on the croquet field as fog swirled around the inn's yellow porch lights, Mr. Keogh said that even if things do not quite work out, island life gradually takes you in and keeps you, and you're better for it.
"I've been broke, and I can't think of a better place to be broke," he said.

HEADLINE: Pulp Nonfiction: When Textbooks Refuse to Die

BYLINE: By JON NORDHEIMER 

 BODY:
It would take a close reading of McGraw-Hill's all-time best-selling college text, the $61 "Economy," to understand why publishers sometimes have to destroy textbooks to save them -- or to make more money on them. But it does not take too close a study of the company's current civil lawsuit against the publishing industry's garbage man to know that the same people who turn wood pulp into ideas expect equal diligence when it comes to turning ideas back into pulp.
When expensive texts on child psychology or chemistry hit the used-book market, sales of new editions dip, along with profits for the publishing house and royalties to authors. So publishers would rather get rid of excess inventory than let it show up as bookstore discounts. 
This wrinkle in the laws of supply and demand underlies the McGraw-Hill lawsuit against a book-disposal company and a mix of shady characters and reputable used-book sellers.
The suit, filed last December in Federal District Court in Newark and amended in June, offers a window into a world that sounds more like pulp fiction. It is a world where cartons of unsold books, scheduled to be destroyed, are spirited away to secret hiding places in warehouses, and where button-down book distributors are portrayed as willing henchmen of a disposal company -- with the fitting name of Guaranteed Destruction Inc. -- in a plot to make books come back from the grave.
McGraw-Hill, a leading publisher in the $1.6 billion wholesale college textbook market, contends in the suit that Guaranteed Destruction, hired by the publisher in 1993 to destroy tons of unwanted new or damaged books, secretly sold trailer-loads to intermediaries who funneled them into the campus book trade.
In the suit, Michael Emposimato, the president and owner of Guaranteed Destruction, was portrayed as the central figure in what McGraw-Hill called a $12 million book diversion scheme. Among the 19 other defendants were distributors with ties to two major retail and college bookstore chains, the Follett Corporation and Barnes & Noble Inc.
As any college student knows, the cover price of a new textbook is high and fosters a huge -- and legitimate -- market in used books that can be sold the next semester to a whole new group of students, usually at a sizable discount. But a revised version of a textbook, ostensibly undertaken to update material, cuts short the resale life of a previous edition.
College divisions, in planning press runs, are generally spared the "best seller or bust" ordeals of publishing but must deal with such variables as student enrollments, shifting trends in course studies and professors' changing preferences.
Publishers like McGraw-Hill prefer to destroy many overstocked, damaged or out-of-print books rather than let them enter the discount market and compete with its titles at full retail price, although "the books we destroy represent less than 4 percent of total units printed," Frank Lawton, a McGraw-Hill vice president, said.
In the past, the big publishing houses had employees "chop" the unwanted books -- strip the covers and spines -- and had the remains carted to landfills. But as landfill fees shot up along with the cost of employee benefits, publishers began looking for other solutions.
Enter Guaranteed Destruction Inc. of Parsippany, N.J.
"If you are going to protect inventory, then protect it right up to the finish," Mr. Emposimato said in an article in Publishers Weekly last October. He said his company had foolproof methods to prevent overstocks of books from "going out the industry's back doors."
McGraw-Hill executives at the company's operations in Hightstown, N.J., winced at these words. The company had hired Guaranteed Destruction in 1993 to remove and destroy tens of thousands of unwanted books. But a month before the Publishers Weekly article appeared the company received an anonymous letter stating that several warehouses in northern New Jersey were stuffed with McGraw-Hill books illegally diverted by Guaranteed Destruction.
McGraw-Hill turned the matter over to the corporate director of security, William Fernhead, who assigned two private investigators to watch Guaranteed Destruction's main warehouse in Union, N.J.
Mr. Fernhead said an electronic tracking device had been inserted in the scooped-out pages of a book sealed in a 22-ton shipment of cartons picked up by a Guaranteed Destruction tractor-trailer at McGraw-Hill's Hightstown plant on Nov. 15.
The detectives followed the truck to the Union warehouse, where the books were unloaded. A few days later, they noticed a large number of McGraw-Hill cartons being loaded into a beige van at the rear loading dock of an adjacent structure.
The investigators trailed that van about 10 miles to a parking lot in Denville, where the books were transferred to a parked red van. Hours later, two men arrived and drove the red van to Newark, where about 75 cartons were unloaded at New Jersey Books, a distributor of used and new books.
The driver of the red van was later identified as John P. Golden. He and the owner of New Jersey Books, Edward Mueller, had already served prison terms after pleading guilty in 1989 to Federal charges of conspiring to steal books.
Last December, McGraw-Hill filed suit against Mr. Emposimato, Mr. Golden, New Jersey Books and Hector Bido, a Guaranteed Destruction employee identified as the driver of the beige van. In January a tip led investigators to 21 Guaranteed Destruction trailers at a garage a few miles from the company's warehouse. The trailers held nearly one million books owned by McGraw-Hill and other publishers, including Simon & Schuster, HarperCollins and Harcourt Brace.
In court papers, Mr. Emposimato, who sold Guaranteed Destruction earlier this year to a company called Books Into Books, denied any wrongdoing and said McGraw-Hill "does not take sufficient precautionary steps to insure that its books do not re-enter the marketplace."
But through his lawyer, Robert F. Dato, he refused to comment on the case. Mr. Dato said: "The publishers think they have an easy target here because he is the garbage man of the industry. But it's the publishers who have been caught with their pants down because of their practice of overproducing too many books."
Last week, McGraw-Hill settled with a distributor named in the suit, MBS Textbook Exchange Inc., whose majority owner and chairman is Leonard Riggio, chairman and chief executive of Barnes & Noble. MBS admitted no wrongdoing but agreed not to participate in any future book diversions.
The suit contended that MBS paid $3.5 million to a middleman fronting for the Guaranteed Destruction diversion. Last week's settlement with MBS disclosed no details of the supposed transactions. "We're happy to get this behind us," Robert Pugh, president of MBS, said. "The books in question represent only a fraction of the books we sell."

HEADLINE: Israelis and Others Feel the Sting of a Cellular Phone Bug

BYLINE: By LAWRENCE M. FISHER 

 BODY:
A software bug inside one model of Motorola cellular phone, coupled with the voracious appetite of Israelis for cellular calling, has demonstrated an area of vulnerability in the growing web of digital communications systems -- and prompted Motorola to issue a worldwide recall.
Motorola introduced the Alpha digital phone in December, and sporadic problems were reported in Hong Kong in February. By April, after about 65,000 Alphas had been distributed in Israel by Cellcom, the second-largest cellular provider there, the Alphas were being blamed for sound quality that made voices inaudible, a lack of reception in areas where reception was promised, the cutting off of calls and long periods when the phones simply did not work. 
 Motorola wound up asking 150,000 Alpha users in six countries to return the phones to have the software changed.
"The problem was not exhibited by all phones, but we took out all of the phones that had the potential to exhibit the bug," said Jim Caile, vice president of marketing for Motorola's cellular systems group. "It was all taken care of in a matter of six weeks."
The problem seems to have been worst in Israel because so many residents use cellular phones.
The Alpha adheres to an emerging standard for digital cellular telephones called time division multiple access, or T.D.M.A. Its software, embedded on a read-only-memory, or ROM, chip, switches its radio signal from one channel to another at frequent intervals. The bug caused the phone to lock on to one channel and stay there indefinitely, blocking other users in a particular cell from sending or receiving calls until its batteries died or it was switched off.
Cellular service in Israel is inexpensive -- less than 3 cents a minute, charged to the caller only, compared with, for example, about 65 cents a minute in the San Francisco area, where owners pay for calls received as well as made. As a result, people often leave their phones on all the time. Studies show that Israelis' use of cellular telephones is eight times that of the average American, said Moshe Pearl, a spokesman for the Israeli Communications Ministry -- but no studies have explained why.
"People in Israel live from hour to hour listening to the news and then need to share the information or act on it immediately," Mr. Pearl said, and cellular phones are also a status symbol, carried everywhere, always turned on.
In most other nations, cellular phone users tend to turn the phones on only to make calls, often using pagers to screen incoming messages first, Mr. Caile of Motorola said. When the phones are left on, they periodically call in to "register," and it was during this automatic connection that the Alpha phones were locking up a given frequency, blocking the channel to other users.
Mr. Caile said the total costs of replacing the software in all 150,000 Alphas would be $10 million to $20 million and would be covered by Motorola's normal reserves for warranty repairs. Motorola and Cellcom both remain the subjects of several class-action lawsuits in Israel.
Some computer security experts said the problem with Alpha, while short-lived in itself, should send a warning about the rush to digital telecommunications. Digital cellular phones convert speech to the ones and zeros that computers understand, which can easily be compressed, enabling many more conversations to be sent over a given amount of radio bandwidth than with conventional analog signals. But digital phones are prey to the same kinds of software bugs that cause cursors to freeze and computer networks to crash.
"There are tremendous risks as soon as you put something in software," said Peter Neumann, a computer security specialist with SRI International in Menlo Park, Calif. "If you change a bit here or there you can bring the whole system down."
The cellular industry "has foisted a disastrously insecure technology on the public," he said.
But other analysts said the Alpha flaw had more to do with simple quality control than with more fundamental risks in a new technology. The pressure to be first to market in a business as competitive as cellular telephones prompts the release of products before they have been adequately tested, these analysts said.
"The problem here is really that Motorola's new products, across the board, tend to have problems," said Ira Brodsky, president of Datacomm Research in Wilmette, Ill. "It's not surprising that when the big guys like Motorola and Ericsson feel pressured to get things out quickly, they have bugs. This is less an indication of something that will plague the industry than something that will plague Motorola."
Hanan Achsaf, Motorola's managing director, told a meeting of the Israeli Parliament's Economics Committee that the company did not have time to properly field-test the Alpha before marketing it, The Jerusalem Post reported in May.
Motorola said it continued to sell the phones after problems emerged in Hong Kong because it believed the problem was in the network rather than in individual handsets. When it determined the problem was in the phone, it halted production and began replacing the faulty software, Mr. Achsaf said.


GRAPHIC: Officials at Motorola have discovered a glitch in some of their phones that disrupted and halted service in several parts of Israel. How it happened:
 
CELL PHONES IN ISRAEL
Graph: "Cellular Anarchy"
 The Government has encouraged cheap cellular phone service to combat the relatively poor installation network for normal phones. Israelis pay two to three cents a minute for cellular phone use, while people in the U.S. can pay upward of a dollar a minute.
 
PHONE USAGE IN ISRAEL
 Because the service is so cheap, many Israelis leave thier portable phones on constantly.
 
WHAT THE PHONES DO
 While on, portable phones emit a signal to cells that identify the phone so that it can receive calls. Normally, the phone, after locking in a call that allows it to transmit and receive calls, switches rapidly through channels in that cell, allowing other users to also end and receive calls by not monopolizing the cell.
 
THE PROBLEM
 Because phones are on at all times, they would periodically lock into a cell. The software glitch would not allow the phone to change channels, but would monopolize entire cells so that other phones in the area could not send or receive calls. The portable phone would not release the cell until its batteries ran down.

HEADLINE: MEDIA: TELEVISION;
With its Olympic megadeal, NBC sees itself as the network of big-time sports.

BYLINE: By Bill Carter 

 BODY:
AFTER NBC made one of the most expensive sports deals in history last week when it agreed to pay $1.27 billion for the television rights to the 2000 Summer Olympics in Sydney, Australia, and the 2002 Winter Olympics in Salt Lake City, the usual attacks by rival networks decrying the economic folly of overpaying for sports events were surprisingly muted.
In fact, executives from the other networks generally praised the pre-emptive strike by NBC. Peter Lund, for example, president of the CBS Broadcast Group, said, "It was a very shrewd, opportunistic get on NBC's part." 
 Mr. Lund calculated that in the worst case NBC would lose no more than $100 million on the seven-year deal, which he broke down to about $15 million a year. "That's negligible," he said, especially when measured against the long-term value NBC is likely to see from the deal.
Long-term value and strategy were what NBC's executives said the deal was all about.
The president of NBC, Robert C. Wright, who made the decision to circumvent the usual Olympic bidding process by making a "take it now or leave it forever" offer for the two Olympics, said the strategy was "technology driven more than anything else."
NBC, he explained, wants to position itself as a provider of free programming that will serve as a continuing attraction to viewers, who in the next 5 to 10 years will have access to more and more programming delivered by cable lines, phone lines and satellites -- all of which will cost money to receive.
"The next few years are going to be hard years" for networks, Mr. Wright said. NBC's hedge against becoming an afterthought to what he called the "new navigational systems" that will deliver television signals is to offer programming available nowhere else.
"There is a great deal of value in a marketing plan that includes identifying yourself as the network of the Olympics," he said.
That identification is very much in NBC's plans, because networks are increasingly looking for ways to "brand" themselves. And big events are an essential part of such a strategy, Mr. Wright said.
To Dick Ebersol, president of NBC Sports and the architect of the network's ascension to leadership in sports among the broadcast networks, the Olympics are a "brand" that reaches more than 90 percent of television viewers.
"That's how many people see at least one hour of the coverage of the Games," Mr. Ebersol said. "In the old days other shows on television brought all or most of the country together, shows like Ed Sullivan or Jack Benny. Now it takes a big sports event."
Big sports events are also critical to advertisers looking to reach all or most of the country at one time. "They need to launch new product lines," Mr. Ebersol said. "They have to have events like these."
NBC will also try to benefit from its ties to the Olympics by putting the ringed Olympic logo ( "one of the most identifiable symbols in the world," Mr. Ebersol said) onto all NBC sports telecasts for the next seven years. The rings will also be shown on the network's two domestic cable channels, CNBC and America's Talking, and its European-based cable service, Super Channel.
Part of the deal calls for NBC to farm out extensive coverage of the two Olympiads to CNBC and America's Talking, a move that will surely prompt more cable systems to add the channels to their offerings.
By the time the deal is complete, Mr. Ebersol said, the asset value of the channels, especially America's Talking, which is only two years old, will have increased enormously. At the same time, NBC has enhanced its relationship with its affiliated stations, which stand to make enormous profits when the Olympics are shown.
In 1990, NBC was considering how to profit the most from an imminent change in cable regulations that would let broadcasters gain some compensation from cable systems that carry their broadcast signals.
"We talked about what it was that we put in front of people that no -cable system would dare take away from its viewers," Mr. Ebersol said. "And big sports was the answer."
So NBC committed itself to retaining as many big sports events as it could. The result in the next year will be perhaps the biggest season any network has ever had in sports, with telecasts of the World Series, the Super Bowl, the National Basketball Association playoffs, Wimbledon, the United States Open Golf tournament and the Summer Olympics in Atlanta. (CBS will telecast the Winter Olympics in 1998.)
"Don Ohlmeyer has done a fantastic job finding the entertainment shows that NBC needs to bring in viewers," Mr. Ebersol said, referring to the president of NBC's West Coast division. "My job is to bring in the big events."
In the late 1960's, Mr. Ebersol and Mr. Ohlmeyer were proteges of Roone Arledge, then president of ABC Sports, who turned the Olympics into the colossus of television events.
Mr. Ohlmeyer was a sports director and producer of the Olympics. Mr. Ebersol, while still in college in 1968, was the first Olympics researcher Mr. Arledge hired.
One lesson Mr. Ebersol learned from Mr. Arledge at ABC was how to manipulate the Olympic bidding process to his network's advantage.
In 1972, just days after completing coverage of the 1972 Games in Munich -- which included the murder of 11 Israeli athletes and became the most-watched news event of that year -- Mr. Arledge presented the Olympic organizers with a pre-emptive $25 million "take it or leave it" offer for the 1976 Games. They took it.
Mr. Ebersol said he remembered that precedent. "Like father, like son," he said.

The Fantasy Coup

BYLINE: By BOB HERBERT; Anthony Lewis is on vacation.

 BODY:
Retired Gen. Olusegun Obasanjo, a respected former President of Nigeria, was taken from his home one morning last March by henchmen of the Nigerian dictator, Gen. Sani Abacha. General Obasanjo was accused, along with about 40 others, of plotting to overthrow General Abacha.
A farcical set of proceedings was held before a secret military tribunal and convictions were handed all around. General Obasanjo, it is believed, was sentenced to 25 years in prison. His onetime deputy, Gen. Shehu Musa Yaradua, was also given a long prison term. Many of the alleged coup plotters were sentenced to death. 
 Among the weirder things at work here is the peculiar kind of gratification General Abacha has managed to derive from these developments. By imprisoning and threatening to liquidate his perceived enemies, the tyrannical Abacha has drawn the respectful attention of major world leaders. President Clinton, Pope John Paul II and President Nelson Mandela of South Africa are among those who have urged him to be merciful. General Abacha says he may seriously consider those requests.
Now consider this. There was no attempt at a coup in the first place. The arrests were bogus; the secret trials were cruel exercises in make-believe. As Randall Robinson, executive director of TransAfrica, has said many times, there is not "a scintilla of evidence" that any of the so-called defendants had plotted to overthrow General Abacha.
The "coup" was a fantasy concocted by General Abacha as justification for a brutal crackdown on his political opponents. General Obasanjo, who had been trying to bridge the differences between the many ethnic and political factions in Nigeria, has not even been allowed contact with his wife or his attorney. When the attorney held a press conference to declare that his client was innocent, he, too, was arrested.
Meanwhile, General Abacha continues to pursue his policies of ruin in Nigeria. He is the latest and the worst in a succession of corrupt and brutal military leaders who have managed to bring near total devastation to a country that has 100 million people and is rich in natural resources, including oil.
"Nigeria is a country that is about to break apart now," said Mr. Robinson. "They have disbanded all democratic bodies. They have suppressed all imaginable freedoms. The generals have emptied the coffers. They've siphoned off billions and stashed them in foreign accounts."
Nigeria is a billion dollars in arrears in its payments to oil field operators. Its inflation rate exceeds 100 percent. The per capita income of its people -- despite 25 years of oil exports worth $210 billion -- is about $240, even lower than in Haiti.
Worse, the deadly blight in Nigeria is spreading to other African nations. Nigeria is one of the world's great transshipment and money-laundering centers for illegal drugs. Nigerian couriers are distributing drugs throughout Africa (and to many other places as well, including the United States). In South Africa, where Nelson Mandela's noble experiment is beating the odds against a miracle, a troubling rise in drug consumption is the direct result of the availability of drugs from Nigeria.
The situation in Nigeria has deteriorated to such a degree that some form of violent upheaval seems all but inevitable, perhaps even civil war. Calls are growing for increased international pressure to try to thwart such a disaster, which would threaten the stability of all of western Africa.
Amnesty International said recently, "The international community must muster any and all pressure on the government to prevent what would be a catastrophe of an unseen magnitude."
Mr. Robinson, who is leading a campaign of prominent African-Americans against the abuses in Nigeria, warned that an "explosion is awaiting." He would like the United States to lead an oil boycott aimed at undermining the Abacha regime.
Some 20 African countries, including Uganda, which endured the hideous experience of Idi Amin, have been making tremendous strides toward real political freedom and economic development. Those efforts will be completely overshadowed if a tragic meltdown occurs in Nigeria, which, with more than twice the population of South Africa, is the true colossus of the African continent.

Turner's Quest for Network Now Leads to Microsoft
The media world is watching yet another effort by Ted Turner to acquire a network.

HEADLINE: Welcome, Nouveaux Riches

BYLINE: By David Frum; David Frum is a senior fellow at the Manhattan Institute.

 BODY:
Is something weird happening at the top of the American class system? Newsweek magazine, heavily borrowing from more serious works by writers like Michael Lind and Nicholas Lemann, has gone so far as to complain of the birth of an irksome new "overclass" -- a self-congratulatory new class of arugula-eating, nanny-employing, laptop-carrying former antiwar protesters.
It's always tempting to roll one's eyes at trend journalism. But in fact, something -- if not weird, then at least peculiar -- is happening, and all the distress gives us our best clue as to what it is. Just as writers and social critics savaged the vast new middle class that emerged in the 1950's -- its vulgarity, its banality, its taste for cars with tail fins and bungalows in the suburbs -- so writers and social critics are now expressing their discomfort with an even more unprecedented and outlandish social phenomenon: history's first mass upper class. 
 Until recently, virtually everyone in America was, by contemporary standards, shockingly poor. The median male income in 1950 ($13,768 in 1994 dollars) did not reach up as far as today's federally defined poverty line ($15,141 for a family of four).
Prosperous towns had a small, affluent elite made up of doctors, lawyers and bankers. A few thousand genuinely wealthy people hugged the edges of the continent in their Boston, Newport and Manhattan enclaves. Otherwise, people congratulated themselves if they could claw their way into a solid working-class job.
Then the great postwar boom exploded. Between 1945 and 1975, tens of millions of families moved into the middle class. By 1970, more than half of all American households earned between $25,000 and $75,000 (in contemporary money).
We now look back on those years with nostalgia, but at the time this extraordinary surge of affluence provoked disdain. Scan the important books of the boom years, and one is confronted again and again by the hostility to the new mass middle class. Pete Seeger complained in one of his songs that they lived in "boxes made of ticky tacky," and people who flew over them on their way to Europe emphatically agreed.
Then, sometime around 1975, the great exodus out of poverty stopped. The proportion of American households earning less than $25,000 -- 40.3 percent in 1993, according to Census Bureau data -- is almost exactly the same as it was 20 years ago. Stranger still, the growth of the middle class reversed itself. Between 1980 and 1993, the proportion of American households earning $25,000 to $75,000 a year dropped from 50.7 percent to 47.1 percent.
Where did all those formerly middle class people go?
They didn't join the ranks of the poor: remember, the under-$25,000 proportion hasn't budged. Instead, just as the American economy pulled its most talented people out of poverty in the 1950's, it pulled the ablest of its middle class into affluence in the 1980's.
In 1950, fewer than one million American families earned as much as $60,000 in today's money. So rare was real wealth that the Census Bureau did not even keep numbers on incomes greater than that. As recently as 1967, only slightly more than one million American families earned more than $100,000 a year (in 1993 dollars).
But by 1980, 2.7 million lucky households counted incomes of more than $100,000. And by 1993, this group had doubled again, to 5.6 million households. And nearly one million American households were enjoying incomes over S200,000. The growth of high-income households accounts for virtually all of the shrinkage of middle-income households.
Nothing like this immense crowd of wealthy people has been seen in the history of the planet. And, unsurprisingly, writers and social critics have reacted with the same dyspepsia with which they once greeted the mass middle class. The millions of new rich are said to be vulgar. They are self-absorbed. They are smug.
Well, perhaps they are. Why wouldn't they be? But they are also the latest manifestation of the great miracle of modern American life, the long 20th century tidal roll of ever-increasing abundance. Some may find it amusing to abuse the big new upper class. Fair enough: mocking the recently rich is a tradition that dates back to Petronius.
But the mockers should remember two things. America's wealth is not concentrated in the hands of an elite caste. Some economists are alarmed by the recent enrichment of the top 1 percent. But the top 1 percent is not getting rich by itself. On the contrary, the new money is finding its way to a population that is not only rapidly growing but also heterogeneous.
More important, the expansion of the upper class cannot fairly be blamed for the apparent stagnation of incomes in the middle class.
Those troubles are real -- the median household income has grown by only 10 percent in 20 years -- but they originate in the turmoil of American society as much as in the economy. About 40 percent of all married couples earn incomes of more than $50,000, according to the Census data. Unfortunately, while 61 percent of American households were made up of married families in 1980, in 1992, only 55 percent were.
This is not to deny that the efflorescence of wealth confronts a country with serious new problems. Of course it does. The Bible describes them in grisly detail. But these problems are not socioeconomic; they are moral.
More than a century ago, worried by the new rich of post-Civil War America, educators like the Rev. Endicott Peabody founded a network of preparatory schools (in his case, Groton) to instill in the children of the Gilded Age rich an ethic of self-control and social responsibility. A mass elite will need to absorb Peabody's ethic in a new way.
But elites are inevitable. If we want to civilize a new and mass elite, we must accept the fact of their existence in a rather more realistic way than we have until now done.

HEADLINE: Jordan's King Speaks of 'New Era' for Iraq

BYLINE: By YOUSSEF M. IBRAHIM 

DATELINE: AMMAN, Jordan, Aug. 14

 BODY:
In his first public comments on the defections of the Iraqi President's sons-in-law and daughters to Jordan, King Hussein called the episode "a very hard blow" to Iraq's leadership and expressed hope that it would "usher in a new era" for that country.
The King's remarks, published today in an Israeli newspaper, were the clearest indication yet of his break with President Saddam Hussein of Iraq, reflecting a widespread perception here that Baghdad's power is waning and that it cannot retaliate against Jordan. 
 While not mentioning Saddam Hussein by name, the King said that any change in Iraq would "only be a change for the better."
The Jordanian monarch's comments to the Yediot Aharonot newspaper followed his decision to allow one of the defectors, Lieut. Gen. Hussein Kamel, to hold a news conference here on Saturday, at which the former Iraqi official vowed to work to overthrow his father-in-law.
Even the fact that the King's first comments on the defections were made to an Israeli newspaper is bound to be seen in Baghdad as a hostile act.
Israel and Iraq are bitter enemies. Iraq targeted Israel with missiles during the 1991 Persian Gulf war, and only strong American pressure restrained Israel from a major air retaliation. Furthermore, the King's remarks follow several gestures over the past two years distancing himself from Saddam Hussein.
The King's increasingly critical stance towards Iraq, an ally from 1980 through the gulf war, was underlined by two other developments in the past two days.
One was an unannounced visit on Sunday by Prince Turki al-Faisal, the chief of Saudi intelligence, who is said by Jordanians to have met with General Kamel with to try to organize a more active opposition to the Iraqi Government.
Jordanian officials also confirmed today that preparations were under way for a meeting soon between King Hussein and King Fahd of Saudi Arabia in Riyadh. The two have not been on speaking terms since the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait in 1990.
These moves represent a significant shift in relations between Jordan and all the Arab countries on the gulf, which resented what they perceived as Jordan's support for the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait and attempt to dominate the region.
While Jordanian officials continued to insist that General Kamel would not be allowed to use Jordan as a base to oppose Iraq, the King's actions suggested that Jordan is prepared to take a more active role.
"The Jordanian interest now is to see the Iraqi people in good shape under whatever regime that can achieve that," Kamal Alshaer, a member of the Jordanian Senate, said in an interview.
Jordanian officials also suggested in interviews that plans for the defection may have been communicated to the King in mid-July, when General Kamel met the monarch during an official visit to Jordan.
In the King's interview in the Israeli newspaper, he noted that he had met with General Kamel then, adding that "What he told me was in total contradiction with the official accounts, allowing me to appreciate to which point the situation has become difficult in Iraq."
That the King had failed until then to appreciate how far conditions have deteriorated is open to question. Jordanian intelligence services are well aware of the worsening social and economic situation brought about by international sanctions against Iraq since the gulf war.
Rather, it suggests the King's sense that Iraq has weakened and may be ripe for a new leadership.
Arab diplomats here pointed out that the defection has also provided the King an opportunity for reconciliation with the Arab gulf states.
With the loss, due to the gulf war and its aftermath, of what had been an extremely lucrative relationship with Iraq, earning Jordan billions of dollars in the 1980's, Jordan is eager to resume agricultural and industrial exports to the Gulf states, which have largely boycotted Jordan's products since 1990.

HEADLINE: INTERNATIONAL BUSINESS;
A Miracle Worker Turned Fugitive

BYLINE: By SAM DILLON 

 BODY:
Few people were prepared for the finale to Gerardo de Prevoisin's ruinous attempt to build Aeromexico into Latin America's biggest airline: out of the blue, the former insurance executive quit as Aeromexico's chairman, emptied his office, purged his computer files and fled Mexico, apparently with his young secretary.
Nobody seems quite sure where Mr. Prevoisin is today, and those who may know are not telling. 
 Before his fall, he was held up as a stirring example of Mexico's efforts to put state-owned enterprises into the hands of the country's best entrepreneurs. He was admired on Wall Street, and his reputation won him the presidency of the International Air Travel Association, a club of airline chief executives.
But since his disappearance last fall, Mexico has issued a warrant for his arrest on fraud charges, and Aeromexico's new management has sued him in Mexico and the United States, accusing him of embezzling $72 million. Last week, Mexican newspapers were dominated by headlines about Mr. Prevoisin's claim, discovered in Texas court documents, that he had donated $8 million last year to Mexico's ruling party.
The emerging details of Mr. Prevoisin's tempestuous tenure, and new information about the circumstances of his departure, are etching a portrait of a self-dealing, sometimes childish and perhaps criminal corporate autocrat.
Just when Mexico is approaching a new wave of privatizations, the revelations are providing a cautionary tale of the dangers of moving too fast from state control into the uncharted waters of free enterprise.
In the six years that Mr. Prevoisin ran Aeromexico, he emitted a cacaphony of warning signals -- and all were ignored. He moved into a saturated international market and neglected his domestic routes. He made ill-considered acquisitions, saddling Aeromexico with crushing debt. And he racked up mounting losses at the company, even as he was displaying a healthy taste for luxury -- and a proclivity for scandal -- in his private life.
"He was acting like a fantastic 7-year-old child," said Julio Cesar Margain, who worked closely with Mr. Prevoisin at Aeromexico as an aviation planner.
Today, both Aeromexico and Mexicana, a domestic airline that Mr. Prevoisin took over in 1993, are being run by a group of banks. The banks are struggling to rework $2 billion in debt and to find new investors for the carriers, which control 70 percent of the Mexican market. Last Wednesday, Ernesto Martens, who succeeded Mr. Prevoisin as Aeromexico's chairman, told a news conference that "our finances today are viable, and they will permit us to continue serving Mexico."
But just avoiding bankruptcy has not been easy. Mr. Prevoisin (pronounced pray-vwah-SEEN) left the companies in such disrepair that creditors seized a Mexicana jet on a Miami runway and even slapped a lien on Aeromexico's headquarters building. Since the peso's December devaluation, the airline's dollar costs have surged and the Mexican economy has plunged into recession, making passengers scarce.
So far, a few foreign investors, including Continental Airlines, have held talks with Aeromexico, but the future is hardly secure. The Government might be reluctant to sell an airline so identified with Mexico to a foreign buyer, and some people speculate that a rich Mexican family might take control with a foreign carrier as a minority partner.
If Mr. Prevoisin's stewardship of Aeromexico ended in near disaster, it began with great hopes in late 1988, when the airline was Government-owned, bankrupt and known derisively among passengers as "ErrorMexico." President-elect Carlos Salinas de Gortari decided to sell, and Government officials persuaded Mr. Prevoisin, then a 46-year-old insurance executive and the scion of a prominent Mexican banking family, to assemble the investor group to buy it.
At first, he seemed to be making all the right moves, even though he had no experience in aviation. He hired capable managers who helped him trim the carrier's fleet by more than a third and reduce its work force of 12,000 by two-thirds. Putting emphasis on shuttle flights from Mexico City to the industrial hubs of Monterrey and Guadalajara, he established Aeromexico as Mexico's business airline. A year after he took over, more than 90 percent of Aeromexico's flights were arriving on time, compared with about 50 percent previously. Aeromexico's market share climbed to 40 percent, from 27 percent.
But then, many analysts say, Mr. Prevoisin overreached. Emboldened by his early successes, he expanded into the international market -- just when he should have been minding the store at home. The Salinas administration's deregulation of the airline industry had generated more than a dozen start-up carriers, making Mexico the most competitive market in Latin America.
Mr. Prevoisin's top aides warned him against diverting resources from the domestic market, but as on many other matters, he brushed their objections aside. His imperious style rubbed some of his fellow executives the wrong way; in two years, two chief operating officers resigned after bitter clashes with him.
"Gerardo was an abrasive autocrat, and he insisted on expanding too fast," said Guillermo Heredia, Aeromexico's chief operating officer from late 1990 through 1992. "He didn't have the resources. He should have worked to consolidate the domestic side first."
He insisted on starting new routes to Frankfurt, Rome and Paris, ignoring market studies that showed little demand, Mr. Heredia said. He ordered 18 Boeing jets for $1.2 billion, though his subordinates later canceled orders for 12. Then he became preoccupied with airline takeovers.
Allied with Charles E. Hurwitz, the Houston financier who made headlines with his efforts to chop down the virgin redwood forests he acquired in a takeover of the Pacific Lumber Company in California, Mr. Prevoisin sought during 1992 to buy Continental Airlines, which was then bankrupt. Rebuffed, he moved to acquire Mexicana, Aeromexico's main competitor, and Aeroperu, the ailing state-run airline of Peru.
Mr. Heredia argued against the purchases, and quit after his warnings were spurned. Three months later, Aeromexico purchased controlling shares of both airlines. Though they would later sap Aeromexico's finances, the takeovers initially brought Mr. Prevoisin international glory.
Later in 1993, Mr. Prevoisin's fellow airline chief executives elected him to the presidency of the International Air Travel Association, and Salomon Brothers shone Wall Street's spotlight on him at an annual transportation conference at the World Trade Center in New York.
In his personal life, Mr. Prevoisin was also flying high, assembling a fleet of luxury cars and buying a high-security vacation compound in Vail, Colo., valued at $5 million. He was also raising eyebrows in Mexico by carrying on a not-very-discreet relationship with his secretary well before his wife died of cancer, according to two close associates who insisted on anonymity. The associates said the secretary fled the country with him, and this spring, Aeromexico lawyers referred to Mr. Prevoisin's former secretary in court papers as his mistress.
Meantime, financial clouds were gathering. Aeromexico's losses widened from $37 million in 1992 to $49 million in 1993. Also in 1993, Mexicana showed a loss of $95 million.
Mexicana officials today blame Mr. Prevoisin for the worsening finances, saying that despite promising to raise $50 million from investors to help modernize Mexicana, he instead cannibalized its best routes for Aeromexico and shifted some of its planes to Aeroperu's fleet.
"Prevoisin pillaged Mexicana," said Robert D. Papkin, a Washington lawyer for Mexicana.
The Government had retained a 34 percent stake in Mexicana, and in August 1994, after the airline defaulted on several loans, Guillermo Ortiz, who was then a Treasury Under Secretary, stepped in, along with creditor banks, and demanded that Mr. Prevoisin invest $200 million in the airline or step down.
He missed their Sept. 2 deadline, and the next day, Aeromexico announced his resignation. Mr. Prevoisin "immediately removed everything from his office, had the computer records regarding his primary activities purged, and had records regarding his activities -- other than basic Aeromexico accounting records -- removed," Aeromexico's lawyers said in a civil suit the company has filed against him in Federal court in Texas, where he had conducted various business transactions.
He fled Mexico on Sept. 8, according to court papers. Mr. Prevoisin has dual French-Mexican citizenship, and Mexican authorities, though conceding uncertainty about his whereabouts, requested his extradition from France in April.
In the Texas suit, Aeromexico accused Mr. Prevoisin of embezzling $72 million, using some of it to buy his Vail properties and some of it to buy additional Aeromexico stock to increase his control.
"This guy stole money and used it to improve his equity in Aeromexico, thereby gaining additional power to steal more money," said John H. Barr, a Dallas lawyer who is representing Aeromexico in the suit.
Mr. Prevoisin's lawyers have argued in court that the Government of President Ernesto Zedillo, who took office Dec. 1, is harassing Mr. Prevoisin because of his ties to the Salinas Government. "With the recent change of administration in Mexico and the beginnings of Mexico's current political, economic and social crises, Mr. Prevoisin's prominent ties to the programs of the previous administration became a decided detriment," one defense document stated, saying he was "one of a number of prominent Mexican citizens targeted as scapegoats for the country's daunting problems."
Kenneth R. Wynne, the Houston lawyer coordinating Mr. Prevoisin's legal team, said Mr. Prevoisin had worked closely with the Government in trying to invigorate Mexico's airlines. "It would be inaccurate and unfair to portray the acquisition of Mexicana and other business decisions as only his," Mr. Wynne said. "They were the result of a lot of collective input."
Aeromexico's 1994 losses, which were made worse by the peso devaluation, were catastrophic: $453 million on revenues of $814 million. This year, Aeromexico has retreated from the brink of bankruptcy, and last week it announced the completion of a debt revamping.
"It was a step in the right direction," said George B. Pearson, an aviation consultant with extensive Mexican experience. "But it doesn't mean they are out of the woods."

 	 	 		--------------------	 	
 
Revamping Approved
 MEXICO CITY, Aug 14 (Reuters) -- A Mexican Government agency said today that it had approved, with conditions, the financial revamping plans of Aeromexico and Mexicana airlines.
A consortium of banks will control both airlines, but they must be split up within three years, the Federal Competition Commission said.
Aeromexico's restructuring plan, under which creditor banks may end up with as much as 90 percent of the airline, has already been put into effect. Mexicana's plan has yet to be formally announced.
The commission said the plan assured "that in a brief period healthy competition will be restored in the commercial aviation market."

HEADLINE: Conference Board Chooses a Harvard Dean as New Chief

BYLINE: By DAVID CAY JOHNSTON 

 BODY:
Richard E. Cavanagh, the executive dean of the John F. Kennedy School of Government at Harvard University, was appointed president and chief executive yesterday of the Conference Board, a worldwide organization of 2,500 leading executives, yesterday.
Mr. Cavanagh, 48, succeeds Preston Townley, who died last year. 
 The Conference Board conducts seminars, runs private forums for senior executives, publishes about 100 studies annually and surveys business conditions, including publishing a help-wanted index that measures the job market in newspapers and a monthly survey of consumer confidence.
The Conference Board is enjoying double-digit growth in attendance at its conferences and seminars. Mr. Cavanagh will lead a staff of 222 with a budget of more than $32 million.
He said that he hoped to expand the Conference Board's influence in North America and Europe into Latin America and Asia. "There will be a lot of frequent-flier miles," he said.
"What I hope to do is internationalize the Conference Board more," he said, "because business is more global these days. The second thing is that business changes and keeping relevant is a full-time task."
Mr. Cavanagh said he chose the Conference Board over offers to head large companies because "this is an organization whose whole purpose is ideas and information."
John R. Hall, the chairman of Ashland Inc., and the Conference Board chairman, said, "In Dick we found someone, out of more than 1,000 applicants, who had a background in the worlds of business through McKinsey & Company, in Government from when he was in Washington and in nonprofits from Harvard."
Albert Carnesale, provost at Harvard University, said that Mr. Cavanagh "has the rare combination of a strategic thinker and a skilled implementer," adding, "He not only gets things done, but gets the right things done."
Although Mr., Cavanagh's Harvard duties were administrative, Mr. Carnesale said, "he always tried to remember that this is a school," and he taught business ethics.
James R. Schlesinger, the Defense Secretary from 1973-75, who is chairman of the the Mitre Corporation, said that at Harvard, Mr. Cavanagh was "superb." At the Conference Board, he said, Mr. Cavanagh "should combine a degree of intellectual excellence with a pragmatism that should appeal to the business leaders who are its members."
Marjorie Kelly, publisher and editor of Business Ethics magazine in Minneapolis, said she was delighted with the appointment. "I think that there is a role for the Conference Board board to step out and speak more forcefully about business ethics and to do it in their customary way, which is with good statistics and good research," she said.
Mr. Cavanagh, who calls himself "a free-enterprise Democrat," graduated cum laude in 1968 from Wesleyan University, where he has been a trustee since 1988. He earned an M.B.A. at Harvard in 1970 and then joined McKinsey. From 1977-79, in the Carter Administration, he was an executive director of the Office of Management and Budget, where he instituted cash management improvements that the General Accounting Office said had saved the Government $12 billion annually.
He returned to McKinsey in 1979 as a partner and left in 1988 to become executive dean of the Kennedy School of Government at Harvard.
Earlier this year Mr. Cavanagh married Patricia Ann Sypher, a Boston business consultant.

HEADLINE: Cigarette Vending Machine Debate Is Broadened

BYLINE: By BARRY MEIER 

 BODY:
President Clinton's proposal to ban all cigarette vending machines is broadening a debate that has been unfolding in recent years in cities and towns across the nation.
Since the late 1980's, more than 120 municipalities have banned cigarette vending machines in an effort to discourage smoking by children and teen-agers, said Robin Hobart, a spokeswoman for Americans for Nonsmokers' Rights, an anti-smoking group in Berkeley, Calif. At the same time, a further 137 communities, including major cities like New York, Chicago and Seattle, have restricted where machines can be placed, often in areas where only adults are allowed, Ms. Hobart said. 
 Mitchell Zeller, a special assistant for policy at the Food and Drug Administration, said the President's proposal, part of the Government's overall effort to curtail underage smoking, could be modified after agency officials heard comments from industry executives and others. But, he added, past research indicates that only a total ban on cigarette vending machines will help stem the supply of cigarettes to the youngest smokers, those around 10 years old.
"What we have learned from tobacco control experts is that when you try limited measures, they don't work very well," Mr. Zeller said.
Whatever the case, any move to limit machine sales of cigarettes would be another blow to a steadily shrinking segment of the cigarette and vending machine industries.
Sheldon Silver, a spokesman for the National Automatic Merchandising Association, a trade association in Chicago, said Commerce Department statistics indicated that sales of cigarettes through vending machines represented only 1.2 percent of all cigarette sales in 1993. That is down sharply from the early 1970's, when Federal data indicated that vending machine sales represented 17.8 percent of all cigarette sales.
In terms of revenue, vending machine sales of cigarettes have also been declining steadily, falling to $2 billion in 1994 from $2.9 billion in 1991, according to Vending Times, a trade publication in New York City.
Still, officials of companies that operate vending machines expressed outrage over the Federal proposal, arguing that it would have little impact on underage smokers.
"It's a Band-Aid," said Jack Kerner, president of Melo-Tone Vending Inc., a vending machine operator based in Somerville, Mass. "It's going to make Mr. Clinton look like a savior with the do-gooders, but to say that this is going to stop kids from smoking is ridiculous."
Mr. Kerner also said a total ban on cigarette vending machines would have a striking economic impact on vending companies. But Mr. Zeller disputed this.
He said information collected by the F.D.A. indicated that few new cigarette machines had been shipped since 1990, and that operators were in the process of converting older cigarette machines to those that sell other products.
"The average cigarette machine sells less than five packs a day," he said.
As the dispute over cigarette vending machines has hopscotched around the country in recent years, the question of how often underage smokers use cigarette machines has been at the heart of the debate.
Mr. Silver, the trade association spokesman, said a survey commissioned five years ago by his organization found that only 9 percent of teen-agers 13 to 17 bought cigarettes from machines. Of those interviewed, the largest group, 43 percent, said they bought cigarettes from convenience, while the second-largest, 29 percent, said they made their purchases at gas stations, Mr. Silver said.
Those results are at variance with others collected by the F.D.A. A 1989 survey of 10th-grade students in Minnesota, for example, found that 71 percent had purchased tobacco from vending machines. In addition, vending machines apparently appeal to the youngest smokers. The F.D.A. said that one vending industry study had found that while only 2 percent of 17-year-olds used cigarette machines, that figure went up to 22 percent for 13-year-olds.
"A 10- or 11-year-old kid can't pass for 18 even if they have a fake I.D.," Mr. Zeller said. "They are going to do everything they can to avoid a face-to-face transaction and that is the appeal of a machine."
In efforts to counter local efforts to curtail machines, vending industry officials have argued that so-called lock-out devices can effectively prevent the sales of cigarettes to underage smokers. Essentially, a lock-out device requires a clerk, for example, to set off a mechanism that unlocks a vending machine before a sale can occur.
"Lock-outs put us on the same footing as over-the-counter sales," Mr. Kerner said. "We have taken an iron monster will no brains and said we can monitor age."
But just how effectively lock-out devices work or whether vendors use them is in question. Last year, for example, the Journal of the American Medical Association published a study of minors' access to cigarette vending machines in communities in Texas. It found that in Arlington, which has required lock-out devices since 1991, that only one of 17 machines inspected had such a mechanism.
An underage buyer sent in by a research team was unable to purchase cigarettes from that machine, but purchases were made at the 16 other machines, the study found.

HEADLINE: Takeover Bids Made for Two Big Utilities

BYLINE: By JOHN HOLUSHA 

 BODY:
Two big power-company takeovers -- one hostile, one friendly -- were proposed yesterday, providing an early sign that the coming free market for electric power will lead to a major consolidation among utilities amid a struggle to cut costs.
In an attempt to unite the two companies that serve eastern Pennsylvania, Peco Energy Company, the parent of the Philadelphia Electric Company, made a hostile offer of $3.8 billion, or $24 a share in stock, for PP&L Resources Inc., the parent of the Pennsylvania Power and Light Company, which serves a number of cities outside the Philadelphia area. 
 At the same time, the Union Electric Company of St. Louis and Cipsco Inc., a power company in central Illinois, agreed to merge in a stock deal valued at $1.2 billion. The companies said they expected to generate cost savings of $570 million over the next 10 years by eliminating duplicate jobs and combining other overlapping operations.
After decades of operating as government-regulated monopolies with total control over their designated service areas, electric utilities are being driven to become larger and more flexible as big industrial customers have developed the ability to generate their own power at lower cost or to go outside their local areas to buy electricity from cheaper suppliers. In response, the Federal Government and several states have moved to deregulate the industry.
"Each of these mergers is different, but the general theme is that utilities have to cut costs to become more competitive," said Barry M. Abramson of Prudential Securities Research. "Most of these companies have done a lot of cost-cutting and are as lean as they are likely to be, so a merger gives them the opportunity to cut costs again."
One of the big issues that has emerged from the various deregulation proposals is whether the benefits of a freer market in electric power will flow mostly to big industrial users at the expense of small business and residential users, who may be asked to shoulder additional costs for maintaining the vast distribution networks needed to deliver electricity.
State regulators, who must also deal with the question of who pays for investments in existing power plants that may no longer be competitive, are being forced into a difficult balancing act.
"Regulators will try hard to see that small customers will suffer no increase in costs," Mr. Abramson said, "although most of the savings will be passed on to large customers." He noted that transmission systems would remain local monopolies subject to regulation, even as competition spreads in the business of generating electricity.
Earlier this year, the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission approved a proposal that would force electric utilities to open their transmission systems to power generated by competitors. That will allow big industrial customers to negotiate for lower rates by threatening or actually importing power from lower-cost generators in other areas.
The proposal would also give low-cost independent power companies access to the distribution grids owned by integrated utilities and allow them to compete with those utilities for desirable big customers.
Given the new rules of the road, utilities are being forced to seek combinations with neighboring systems to gain strength with their big customers and achieve economies of scale, said Robert Guberman, a vice president of A. T. Kearney, a consultancy. "The industry is not burying its head in the sand," he said. "This is the beginning of a flurry of actions -- some agreeable, some not agreeable."
The two utility proposals yesterday followed on the heels of a planned merger between the Northern States Power Company and Wisconsin Energy Corporation, two big Midwestern utilities. On May 1, they announced the intention to merge into a company to be called the Primergy Corporation, based in Minneapolis. The companies provide power to 1.3 million customers in the upper Midwest and gas to 350,000 customers. All the pending deals are subject to approval by shareholders and state regulators.
In making its hostile bid for PP&L yesterday, officials of Peco said they were doing so because months of discussions had not produced an agreement.
Joseph Paquette Jr., the chairman of Peco, in a letter to his counterpart at PP&L, said the stalemate "makes clear the need to present a specific proposal now so you and your board can fully evaluate the potential benefits a combination provides to PP&L Resources and shareholders and customers."
Mr. Paquette said the companies had adjacent service areas and would be a "natural fit." He predicted that the combined companies would be able to lower rates for electricity and save $2 billion over 10 years, with the benefits divided between shareholders and customers.
PP&L, which had been informally discussing a merger with Peco since November, expressed reservations, although it promised to "fully evaluate" the offer.
In a letter to Mr. Paquette, William F. Hecht, PP&L's chairman, said his company was concerned about Peco's "high cost structure" and whether the combined company could recover Peco's "considerable past investment costs." Moody's Investors Service recently estimated those costs above $4.86 billion, Mr. Hecht said, adding that Peco's rates were 55 percent higher than PP&L's.
In an interview, Mr. Paquette noted that the $24-a-share offer was 27 percent above PP&L's previous price and said the combination was "too good to ignore and too good to delay."
The price of PP&L's shares rose yesterday in response to the offer, closing at $21.50, up $2.625. Peco's shares declined $1, to $26.75.
If the merger is completed, the combined company would be one of the largest utilities in the nation, covering most of eastern Pennsylvania. Peco provides electricity to the city of Philadelphia and its suburbs, and supplies natural gas to the suburbs. PP&L provides both services as far west as Williamsport. The deal includes nuclear power plants, but not the Three Mile Island plant near Harrisburg, which is owned by General Public Utilities.
Union Electric and Cipsco have adjacent service areas on the Missouri and Illinois sides of the Mississippi River. "We have contiguous territories and are similar in the way we treat costs, so we will have a seamless transition," said Clifford L. Greenwalt, Cipsco's chief executive.
Part of the savings generated by a merger would be returned to customers under legislation adopted in Missouri and pending in Illinois, executives for the companies said in telephone interviews. Some of those savings will come from the elimination of 300 jobs through attrition rather than layoffs.
Under the terms of the merger, neither company would retain its current form. Instead, a new holding company would be formed, with shareholders of Union Electric getting one new share for each one held and Cipsco shareholders receiving 1.03 shares. The companies said they expected the combination to qualify as a tax-free exchange.

HEADLINE: CREDIT MARKETS;
Treasury Securities Prices Are Firmer in Thin Trading

BYLINE: By ROBERT HURTADO 

 BODY:
Prices of Treasury securities were firmer yesterday in thin volume, despite last week's heavy supply of new issues and prospects of fresh supply just ahead.
The only new economic data out was the report on June business inventories, which was more a rear view of the economy than a forward one, and the July Atlanta Fed regional survey of manufacturing conditions. Most of the day's market activity was attributed to technical trading. 
 Dealers and traders yesterday appeared to be more focused on today's report on industrial production and capcity utilization, and tomorrow's housing starts, and Thursday's jobless claims and the Philadelphia Fed report.
The 30-year bond rose 9/32 , to a price of 992/32 for a yield 6.95 percent, down from 6.97 percent on Friday.
Thomas E. Donne, vice president and a senior portfolio manager at the Banc One Investment Advisors Corporation in Columbus, Ohio, said: "Quite frankly the feedback from the street was quiet trading and not much volume. That's called summer."
There was a little pressure on prices, he said, because of left-over supply from the refunding last week, a lot of asset back securities and additional supply from the corporate bond side.
Mr. Donne noted that there had been a rise in Japanese money in the market since the relaxation of regulations by the Japanese Ministry of Finance a couple of weeks ago, "but not enough to disturb the market from where domestic economy and Federal Reserve policy would ordinarily take us."
He added, "I expect the market will get through this supply all right, but rates could rise a little."
"At these price levels, Treasury securities are looking more interesting," Mr. Donne said. "Everything we have seen is consistent with the modest growth and contained inflation." He said the long bond would draw considerably more interest from the market at a 7.10 percent yield, with current yields probably in a range considered fair value. "We're close to turning bullish," he said.
Yesteray's June business inventories firmed at two-tenths of 1 percent, slightly lower than the three-tenths of 1 percent that had been forecast. Retail inventories were unchanged in June and were also revised lower in May, which contributed to the overall weakness in the inventory number.
Economists noted that business sales were up seven-tenths of 1 percent, and that put the inventory to sales ratio at a fairly lean 1.30, boding well for third- quarter economic growth.
The July Atlanta Fed index of regional manufacturing conditions moved into positive territory in July at 6.1 from a negative 5.0 in June. James Hale, an analysts at MMS International, a San Francisco-based market research and analysis firm, said that would translate "into a National Puchasing Management index adjustment of 54.8 percent, up from 49.9 percent." "And," he added, "that is consistent with the gradual return to expansionary manufacturing levels that other indices have signaled."
Mr. Hale also noted that the Atlanta price index fell 7 points, to 20.3 in July, in line with other signs of moderating inflation at the intermediate level of production.
At yesterday's regular weekly bill auction, rates were slightly higher, with the three-month maturity up one basis point, to 5.42 percent, and the highest since July 31, when the rate was 5.44 percent, while the six-month issue was two basis points higher at 5.42 percent and the highest since July 24, when it was 5.46 percent. A basis point is one-hundredth of a percentage point.
The following are the results of yesterday's Treasury auction of new three-month and six-month bills:
(000 omitted in dollar figures)

	3-Mo. Bills	6-Mo. Bills	Average Price	98.630	97.260	Discounted Rate	5.42%	5.42%	Coupon Yield	5.59%	5.67%	High Price	98.635	97.265	Discounted Rate	5.40%	5.41%	Coupon Yield	5.57%	5.65%	Low Price	98.630	97.255	Discounted Rate	5.42%	5.43%	Coupon Yield	5.59%	5.68%	Accepted at low price	69%	13%	Total applied for	$46,888,976	$47,994,907	Accepted	$12,070,776	$12,137,671	Noncompetitive	$1,514,000	$1,413,035	
 
Both issues are dated Aug. 17, 1995. The three-month bills mature on Nov. 16, 1995, and the six-month bills mature on Feb. 15, 1996.

HEADLINE: Growth in Inventories Is Slower, In Adjustment to Lower Demand

BYLINE: By Bloomberg Business News 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Aug. 14

 BODY:
Stockpiles of unsold goods grew in June at the slowest pace in 15 months as American businesses adjusted to weaker consumer demand for autos and other big-ticket items, the Commerce Department reported today.
Growth in business sales also slowed. 
 The Commerce Department said inventories increased two-tenths of 1 percent in June, to a seasonally adjusted $958.46 billion. While the monthly increase was the 15th in a row, it was the smallest during that period. In May, inventories rose four-tenths of 1 percent.
Economists had expected a gain in June of three-tenths of 1 percent, a survey by Bloomberg Business News found.
In the slowdown that has followed last year's burst of economic growth, many businesses have been saddled with excess supplies of goods, ranging from autos to cellular telephones.
In June, companies "went a long way to eliminate their inventory overhang," said Carl Palash, chief economist at MCM Moneywatch in New York. "But they still haven't reached a point where they want to start restocking."
If companies do not restock, the economy may slow further. But many companies may be close to the point at which they are ready to increase ordering again. Last week, the Federal Reserve's survey of nationwide economic conditions said inventories were at manageable levels in many parts of the country.
A separate report today from the Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta suggested that the economy might be gaining momentum. The Atlanta Fed reported that manufacturing production rose in July in the Southeast.
Still, consumers are being stingy. "Increased debt and slower job growth will limit improvement through the end of the year," said Scott Brown, an economist at Raymond James & Associates in St. Petersburg, Fla., referring to spending. Preliminary Government figures released last week showed that retail sales fell one-tenth of 1 percent in July.
The inventory gain reported for June reflected increases in stockpiles of wholesale and manufacturers' goods. Retailers' inventories showed no change. Supplies decreased at auto dealers because of discounting and promotions.
The report from the Commerce Department also showed that business sales rose seven-tenths of 1 percent in June, to a seasonally adjusted $683.08 billion, after increasing eight-tenths of 1 percent in May.
The inventory-to-sales ratio, a measure of how long it would take to sell goods currently stockpiled, fell to 1.40 months in June. That was the lowest ratio since January and a decline from 1.41 in May, a Government spokeswoman said. In June 1994, the ratio stood at 1.39.

HEADLINE: CURRENCY MARKETS;
Dollar's Strong Rally in Japan Fades Later in Europe and U.S.

BYLINE: By The Associated Press 

 BODY:
The dollar's rally stalled yesterday as a bout of profit taking in the United States and Europe weakened earlier gains in Asia and left the currency little changed.
"Today's been pretty much a non-event," said John McCarthy, a foreign-exchange manager with ING Capital Markets. 
 In Tokyo, there was unconfirmed speculation that the Bank of Japan was buying dollars at an exchange rate of 94 yen. That helped the dollar surpass the five-month high it hit against the Japanese yen on Friday in New York.
But the dollar started losing ground during European trading, narrowing its gains. The dollar ended unchanged against the German mark and barely down against the yen. Once trading commenced in New York, the dollar-selling expanded as traders locked in profits from the currency's recent strong advances.
"We've come a long way in a fairly short time with the dollar, ' said Dennis Pettit, a foreign-exchange manager with the New York branch of Long-Term Credit Bank of Japan.
In late New York trading, the dollar settled at 93.66 yen, down from 93.90 in New York on Friday. The dollar fell to 1.4360 German marks from 1.4396 marks. The British pound rose to $1.5720 from $1.5709.
On Friday, the dollar reached a two-and-a-half-month high against the mark and a five-month high against the yen.
Those highs were the culmination of several weeks of intervention by the Japanese central bank and two joint interventions by the central banks of Japan and the United States on behalf of the dollar.
The dollar has also been bolstered by the Japanese Government's announced program to encourage Japanese investors to invest abroad.
In addition, the market's optimism has been fueled by speculation that the German central bank will lower interest rates next month and that the Federal Reserve will not reduce rates anytime soon. Lower interest rates tend to weaken a currency by making bank deposits denominated in it less attractive.
Since July 6, the dollar has gained 10 percent against the yen and 4 percent against the mark.
Traders said yesterday that the markets ignored economic data from the Commerce Department showing that businesses held their inventory growth to the smallest gain in 15 months. Some analysts surmised that the economy entered the second half of the year with little risk of recession.

HEADLINE: When a Hard-Nosed Producer Insists on New York

BYLINE: By DINITIA SMITH 

 BODY:
Dick Wolf, executive producer and creator of "Law and Order," was "pouring" money, as he puts it, into the economy of New York City. He had rented the parents' association room of the Collegiate School on West End Avenue in Manhattan for an actors' run-through. (Cost of room rental: $200 the first three hours, $25 each additional half-hour.)
A few blocks away, on West 81st Street, another episode of the show was being shot with a cast and crew of nearly 100 and some 22 trucks and cars. All night long, two "parking P.A.'s" (parking production assistants) had sat alone in their cars in the darkness, holding spaces for "Law and Order" vehicles. (Cost, $85 per man per 12-hour shift.) 
 Sometimes, especially on the Upper West Side, residents get so mad about losing parking spaces to "Law and Order" crews that they throw bottles or try to ram the P.A.'s with their cars. Still, Mr. Wolf says, every day he shoots in New York, he spends $70,000 to $75,000. And every year he shoots at least 22 episodes of "Law and Order," produced in association with Universal Television. Each episode costs $1.4 million, $1 million of which is spent directly in the city.
A record number of films and television shows are being shot in New York City this summer, including five prime-time dramatic network series -- among them "Central Park West" and "New York News" -- and about 20 feature films. Last year, said Patricia Reed Scott, Commissioner of the Mayor's Office of Film, Theater, and Broadcasting, film and television companies spent about $1.7 billion in the city. By far the biggest proportion of that revenue came from television production, at just under $1 billion. But the economic impact, Ms. Scott said, is actually 2.3 times the amount spent directly.
Movies and television shows are now the country's second-largest export, after aircraft and aerospace. And New York City has now become the second-most-important venue for television production after Los Angeles, with more than 100 programs, including studio shows, currently on television produced here.
One reason for the boom, Ms. Scott said, "is the persistence of Dick Wolf," who has insisted that his shows be shot here. Another is the success of "Law and Order," now entering its sixth season, making it the second-longest running dramatic series currently on network television. (Only "Murder, She Wrote" has run longer.)
"Dick Wolf makes brilliant use of New York's great acting pool," Ms. Scott said. "He's brilliant at capitalizing on the headlines."
At the run-through at the Collegiate School the other day, two actors were discussing a plot development: growing romantic tension between the assistant district attorney, Claire Kincaid, played by the Canadian Jill Hennessy, and her boss, Jack McCoy, played by Sam Waterston, who like many actors in "Law and Order" is a veteran of the Broadway stage.
"I don't think it's gone that far," Ms. Hennessy said of the on-screen relationship.
"If it had, we wouldn't tell any of you!" said Mr. Waterston, drawing a laugh from the crew.
"The more of us who don't know, the better it's going to play," said Mr. Wolf.
"I know where it can come out -- the Hugh Grant episode!" said Michael Chernuchin, the writer of that script and an executive producer of "Law and Order," referring to a forthcoming episode reminiscent of Mr. Grant's recent legal difficulties.
The show's "bible" -- the source of many of its stories -- is "the front page of The New York Post," said Mr. Wolf. "There is a tabloid sense to the show. When something major happens, we can be on the air in 10 weeks." There have been episodes based on the deaths of Lisa Steinberg, the heiress Anne Scripps Douglas and Libby Zion, daughter of the journalist Sidney Zion.
There was a time when "Law and Order" was just about the only prime-time dramatic series being shot in New York City, because of the high cost of filming here. In 1991-92, producers boycotted the city because of a dispute with local craft unions over pension and welfare payments.
Mr. Wolf, who already had a contract with the unions, stood his ground and continued to film here. Still, in 1992, with shows fetching lower prices in syndication, he was under pressure to cut costs by pulling "Law and Order" from New York City. This time, Mr. Wolf sat down with the craft unions and won changes in work rules.
The next year he won further concessions to produce "New York Undercover," which stars Malik Yoba and Michael DeLorenzo and is now going into its second season on Fox Television. Mr. Wolf's contract has become a model for other contracts between television producers and unions.
Mr. Wolf, a large, rough-spoken man of 48, was born and reared in New York City. "I moved to California because that's where the business is, but I've been trying to get back ever since," he said. During his childhood the Dodgers were still in Brooklyn, and there was the Roxy theater to delight a boy.
The son of an advertising executive, Mr. Wolf followed in his father's footsteps. He wrote the slogan, "I'm Cheryl, Fly Me," for National Airlines, and "You Can't Beat Crest for Fighting Cavities." In 1977 he moved to California to write feature films, among them "Masquerade," "No Man's Land" and "School Ties." But the struggle wore him down. "Getting a script on film is basically like getting hit by lightning on a sunny day," he said.
Out of frustration, Mr. Wolf turned to television, where the route from script to production is faster. He worked on "Hill Street Blues" and "Miami Vice." In late 1988 he pitched the idea for "Law and Order" to network executives. The series is a "catch 'em and cook 'em show," as Mr. Wolf puts it -- meaning the cops hunt for the killer, and the district attorneys then try to bring the criminal to justice.
He insisted that "Law and Order" be shot in New York City. Universal Television balked, but then, Mr. Wolf said, the president of Universal Television, Kerry McCluggage, "bit the bullet and let us come into New York."
Every episode of "Law and Order" shot in New York City costs about $25,000 more than it would in California -- "and that's still too much for the bean counters," Mr. Wolf said. The city is not hospitable to film crews, and every time his trucks get stuck in traffic it costs "thousands of dollars" in overtime.
His crews sometimes block traffic and tie up elevators. The rumble of generators and the blast of floodlights on night shoots keep people awake. "It's one thing we constantly apologize for," Mr. Wolf said. "You know how annoying it can be when a film crew is in your building." Nevertheless, he insists, "98 percent of the reaction has been positive."
Besides, he said, New York City has an ineffable something -- an almost overwhelming atmosphere -- that has made him insist on shooting here rather than in California. "The light in California is different," he said. "It doesn't have that gritty, grainy quality." Mr. Wolf also wants to be able to see high rises through the windows of the rooms in his scenes.
And then there is weather: he wants to be able to shoot in rain and snow and boiling sun. "In Toronto, they 'dressed' an alley with garbage to try and make it look like New York," he said, "but the city came and cleaned up the alley."
"Everything else supposedly shot in New York doesn't look like New York," Mr. Wolf said. " 'N.Y.P.D. Blue' is one of my favorite shows. But I can tell you every scene not shot in New York. When you hear a cop talk on 'Law and Order,' you know it's a New York cop."
"There is a different type of actor in Manhattan than in Los Angeles," he continued. "Manhattan actors are predominantly stage actors. They are used to looking at the totality of the show, rather than just their scenes."
Over the years Mr. Wolf has availed himself of actors with experience on Broadway, like Jerry Orbach, who plays Detective Lennie Briscoe. (His sidekick, played by Chris Noth, has been replaced this season by Benjamin Bratt, who will play a new character, Reynaldo Curtis, "a smart young Latino police detective." Mr. Bratt has a California background.) Broadway actors who have made guest appearances on the show include Ron Leibman, James Earl Jones and Elaine Stritch.
At the moment Mr. Wolf is developing two new shows that he insists must be shot here. One is "Swift Justice," "a kind of Batman without the mask," he said. The other is "Feds," about the United States Attorney's Office in Manhattan.
"Anything that's ever happened on the planet can happen in New York City," Mr. Wolf said. "There are eight million stories in the Naked City. And we've only done 112."

HEADLINE: Calming Stormy Seas With New Kinds of Ship Hulls

BYLINE: By WILLIAM J. BROAD 

 BODY:
FROM the ancient Egyptians onward, ship makers have been relatively quick to change the means of powering their vessels to increase speed and range, going from muscle to wind, steam, oil and eventually the atom. But hulls during those propulsion revolutions remained essentially the same. The great arc known as the monohull prevailed by virtue of its simplicity, buoyancy and dynamic lift. For millenniums it ruled the waves.
Now, however, a number of upstarts are racing to challenge the leader, perhaps bringing changes as fundamental as those that have marked the history of maritime propulsion. The aim is greater speed and stability than is feasible with monohulls. 
 At an astonishing pace, innovators in places that include Japan, South Korea, Britain, Denmark, Finland, Norway and the United States are hammering out new kinds of hulls and racing them through the sea, making more than a few waves as experts anticipate a major transportation shift.
"We'll see a greater variety of ship geometry from now on," Dr. Owen F. Hughes, a naval architect at the Virginia Polytechnic Institute, said in an interview. "Some of these designs could revitalize the shipping industry and make it more like the airline industry."
Experts say the force behind the changes is not a single advance but rather clusters of technologies that are making radical ideas, in themselves sometimes relatively old, practical and economical for the first time. Factors aiding the revolution include gas turbines, water jets, control systems for fins and stabilizers, and all kinds of computers and miniature electronic devices.
"They let you exploit the ideas," said John R. Meyer, a naval architect and author of an article on new hulls in the current issue of The Naval Institute Proceedings, a monthly magazine published in Annapolis, Md. "It's easy to design something new, but you've got to have the technology to make the thing work."
Hulls that are exceptionally stable in rough seas are already helping oil and gas explorers work in deeper waters, cruise ships and ferries improve passenger comfort, navies get a military edge and oceanographers probe the sea in more tumultuous states.
And the promise of very fast hulls is dazzling the military and cargo transporters, who want to become more competitive with airlines by cutting transoceanic shipping time in half.
"We'll be able to carry 100 times more than a 747," boasted Collister Johnson Jr., president of Fastship Atlantic, a company in Alexandria, Va., that is perfecting a class of high-speed cargo ships built around jet engines and water jets.
To be sure, many of the world's largest ships in all likelihood will remain monohulls for a long time to come, especially in cases where neither extra speed nor stability is considered worth the premium cost. Aircraft carriers and petroleum tankers will doubtless continue to ply the seas in their usual forms, irrespective of the new developments.
Down through the ages, monohulls and such close cousins as catamarans and trimarans have done their work by riding over and through the waves, slicing and bashing their way forward while struggling to keep roll, pitch and heave to a minimum, trying to lessen seasickness and the danger of sinking.
By contrast, many of the new designs seek to exploit the calmness of subsurface waters. As divers and submariners know, the chaos that often characterizes surface waters quickly gives way to eerie peacefulness just a short distance beneath the waves.
One of the first ships to take advantage of this intrinsic calmness was the small waterplane area twin hull, or Swath. Conceived around the turn of the 20th century and perfected by the Navy during the cold war, Swath ships have two hulls, similar to catamarans, only each is deep underwater and is basically a submarine zooming along.
The design is extremely stable, even in treacherous seas. The buoyant twin submarine hulls hold the power trains and propellers. Thin, strong struts from these hulls run upward and are linked in the air to form the ship's superstructure.
Swath ships were a theoretical curiosity until the late 1960's, when Dr. Thomas G. Lang of the Naval Ocean Systems Center in San Diego invented a system to give them added stability at high speeds. He envisioned a submerged control surface at the stern, connecting both hulls, that would be adjusted with gyroscopes and servomechanisms to lessen the ship's pitch, or the rising and falling of its bow and stern. The control surface would move in such a way as to counteract large motions.
Dr. Lang also envisioned two adjustable winglike canards forward on each submerged hull to control roll, or the tendency of a ship to rotate back and forth on its longitudinal axis.
In 1972, the Navy launched an 88-foot experimental Swath ship. It looked something like a floating billiard table, but it worked. And it was so stable that even in high seas it could act as a landing pad for helicopters and as a launching pad for the deployment of undersea gear through a central well.
In the Navy, the Swath idea slowly evolved over the years, eventually becoming the basis for a secretive class of ocean surveillance ships that lowered microphones to spy on enemy submarines. And one ship, dubbed the Sea Shadow, was developed experimentally as a test for stealthiness.
In great secrecy, the 160-foot-long vessel was finished in 1983, intended to test radar evasion at sea. It looked like no other ship, the angles of its superstructure sides similar to those of the stealth fighter and the stealth bomber. Covert nighttime tests were conducted near San Francisco from 1983 to 1986, and the ship was unveiled in 1993.
Today, dozens of Swath ships are in use or under construction around the world, the majority for civilian purposes. From Dr. Lang's original idea, the submerged stabilizers have shrunk, and their control is now far easier and finer thanks to computers and miniaturization.
"The advantage of advanced marine vehicles like Swath is not speed but ride quality," said Dr. Joseph F. Sladky Jr., president of Kinetics, a concern in Seattle that does marine engineering research. "It's not how fast you go, but how comfortably you go fast."
Swath ships are appearing as ferries and cruise ships. For instance, the Nekton Pilot is a live-aboard dive ship that sails out of Fort Lauderdale, Fla., taking 30 passengers to scuba dive and snorkel in remote Caribbean areas. The 354-passenger, 420-foot-long Radisson Diamond, built in Finland, cruises the Caribbean and Mediterranean and is said to perform with exceptional smoothness and quietness.
Finally, Swath ships are considered the future of oceanography, with many planned. The Monterey Bay Aquarium Research Institute, a private research center based in Pacific Grove, Calif., is building a 117-foot one that will have berths and laboratories for 24 researchers and crew members. With a range of 2,500 miles, it is to do wide-ranging studies of deep ocean ecology.
More experimental than Swath ships are a whole series of new hull designs that seek to exploit the calmness below in new ways, by employing parts that not only have buoyancy but also generate hydrodynamic lift as they speed through the water, as hydrofoils do. By contrast, Swath vessels stay afloat exclusively by virtue of hull buoyancy.
At the Naval Surface Warfare Center, designers such as Mr. Meyer are perfecting a hybrid ship that relies on a single submarine hull, and thus a single strut going up to the superstructure. It is known as the hydrofoil small waterplane area ship, or Hyswas. In theory such a ship can go very fast, perhaps up to 50 knots.
In July, a 27-foot-long Navy test vehicle began trials off Annapolis. With four seats and standard navigational gear, it is meant to reach a speed of 37 knots.
At rest the vehicle looks like a conventional boat. But as it speeds up, the control computer positions the submerged foils at an angle where they generate lift, forcing the boat to rise so that only the thin strut is cutting through the water.
In theory, it is capable of carrying 2,500 pounds of payload over 800 miles at 20 knots. Predictions suggest that the craft will have less than three degrees of roll and pitch -- a minuscule amount -- when operating at speeds above 30 knots in eight-foot seas.
In contrast to traditional hydrofoils, in which submerged winglike structures lift a hull, Hyswas ships get some of their lift from the submerged hull's buoyancy. That allows the vessel to rise at lower speeds and gives it much greater range, stability in high seas and payload capacity than a hydrofoil.
Sensors receive motion and position data throughout the ship, and a computer analyzes them to determine the optimum fin positions to minimize boat motions. Positions are adjusted up to 100 times a second.
The Navy will give no specifics about possible missions, saying only that Hyswas ships offer "an ability to operate at high speeds over long distances in heavy sea conditions."
While the Navy's test vehicle is propelled by a conventional propeller, a Japanese ship with a similar hull design uses a gas turbine and water jet. Known as the Kawasaki Techno-Superliner, the 56-foot-long experimental ship is part of an aggressive Japanese program meant to produce a 50-knot vessel able to carry 1,000 tons of cargo on relatively short hauls around the Japanese archipelago.
A super-fast cargo carrier meant to haul big loads between continents is under development by Fastship Atlantic, which hopes to start construction next year on 770-foot-long ships meant to revolutionize the shipping business. Moving at twice the speed of current freighters, each ship would use eight jet engines to fire jets of water out of its stern.
The secret is a monohull whose stern is sculptured, lifting it up and reducing drag. "That dramatically decreases resistance and improves speed," said Mr. Johnson of Fastship. In theory the ship will zip across the Atlantic in three and a half days.
Dr. Hughes of Virginia Polytechnic, a Fastship enthusiast, says the idea is one of many that are going to materialize in the next few years, mainly thanks to the ubiquitous computer chip.
"We couldn't be doing all these new things if it weren't for the computer, which is used everywhere -- in design, building and operation," he said. "There's more and more automation on board. Monohulls ruled the waves for a long time. But now all kinds of new things are in the works. The water jet alone is causing a revolution. We'll see a greater variety of ship geometry from now on."

HEADLINE: NEW JERSEY DAILY BRIEFING;
Therapist's Dismissal Is Upheld

BYLINE: By TERRY PRISTIN 

DATELINE: TRENTON

 BODY:
The Shrewsbury Borough school board acted within its legal authority when it dismissed a part-time, tenured speech therapist and contracted with a county agency to provide similar services at less than half the cost, the State Supreme Court ruled yesterday. 
 Gillian Impey, who was replaced in 1990 after 20 years with the school district, had argued in a lawsuit that the law permitting staff reductions for economic reasons could not be used to justify replacing a tenured professional who earned $20,000 with a public employee who was paid $8,000, The Associated Press reported.

HEADLINE: Timber-Related Workers Suffer From Cutbacks

 BODY:
To the Editor:
Your reporter and I must not have been attending the same Senate Natural Resources Committee "workshop" on Aug. 9, headed by Senator Frank H. Murkowski of Alaska (news article, Aug. 10), held in response to the timber harvest restrictions in Alaska's Tongass National Forest. You focus on Federal bureaucracy, instead of on the Tongass and the livelihoods of the timber-dependent workers who rely on it. 
 As a representative of pulp, paper and sawmill workers in the Tongass, I testified about the timber supply crisis. Timber reductions have forced at least three mill closures in the area. Hundreds of men and women have lost their jobs. With the job base at home gone, former millworkers have had to leave their families to work at distant job sites.
Our members once had secure employment that allowed them to plan for the future. Saw and pulp mills were the economic base our members relied on for their livelihoods and their future.
We appreciate the Senator's efforts to bring a sound, balanced approach to the management of the Tongass.

HEADLINE: Rich Nation, Poor Children

 BODY:
The gap between rich and poor in the United States is huge. That is reason enough for some in Congress to fight to preserve cash assistance, health insurance and child care benefits for the poor. But the majority sentiment on Capitol Hill seems to be that while poor Americans might be falling behind their neighbors, they are well off by international standards.
Not so, says a new study by a nonprofit group in Luxembourg. Poor children in America are worse off than poor children in 15 of the 18 Western industrialized countries included in the study. The annual incomes of the poorest 10 percent of families average about $19,000 in Switzerland, $14,000 in Canada and only $11,000 in the United States. Only Israel, at $8,000, and Italy, at $7,000, lag behind the United States. These figures include Government benefits like food stamps and adjust for differences in family size and consumer prices. But because the data exclude Government-provided health insurance, the United States may rank even worse than the numbers indicate. 
 American families are rich on average, but poverty disproportionately affects the young. About 22 percent of American children live in poverty, while only about 15 percent of the general population is poor. One reason is that America leads in the percentage of families run by single women. Also social security -- a Federal program -- has cut down poverty among the elderly.
Another important reason behind child poverty is the lack of an adequate social safety net. European countries provide tax credits, day-care allowances or Government-guaranteed support for poor families. But the United States is on the verge of dismantling food stamps and cutting back tax credits for the working poor -- at a time, the Luxembourg study shows, when America's poor are already suffering more than their counterparts in other industrial nations.
One out of every five American children is poor. Congress must take care not to make their plight worse. Judging from the experience of America's allies, their condition is reversible.

 BODY:
To the Editor:
"Many Cities in U.S. Show Sharp Drop in Homicide Rate" (front page, Aug. 13) and the experts you consult to explain recent homicide trends seem to have missed the forest for the trees. 
 There are four prominent peaks in the homicide rate, as displayed in your front-page graphic.
These high-water marks occurred in 1933, 1974, 1980 and 1991. Each one coincides with a significant downturn in the United States economy.
Growth in the standard of living has always been a major determinant of criminal activity, including homicide, going back for many centuries. The experience of the past several decades is no exception.

HEADLINE: A Year After Boat Exodus, Threat to Castro Dissipates

BYLINE: By TIM GOLDEN

DATELINE: HAVANA, Aug. 11

 BODY:
A few blocks from the tourist hotel where rioters had shattered the windows, a few more from the downtown stores they had dared to loot, an industrial mechanic named Roberto sat with some friends in the afternoon heat, recalling how the Revolution had trembled.
"We never saw anything like that before," the lanky 37-year-old said, leaning in the doorway of his decrepit apartment building. "They were throwing rocks at the police!" The gathering fell silent for a moment, and then Roberto added, "But that passed." 
 A year after Cubans' discontent erupted in a spate of boat hijackings, a flood of refugees and the most serious street disturbances since Fidel Castro seized power in 1959, the threat that the Government faced last summer has faded, say diplomats, political dissidents, officials and many ordinary Cubans.
Reflecting modest economic reforms, some Havana streets where Cubans had offered a symphony of complaints now buzz with snack vendors, bicycle repair shops and small, family-run restaurants. Farmers' markets that were legalized last fall do brisk business in everything from piglets and goats to snake oils and spaghetti sauce.
While continuing to ration bread after five years of economic devastation, the authorities are spending more generously on circus. Uncharacteristically interesting films draw restless teen-agers to the theaters, and unemployed workers are staying home to watch pirated offerings like "Jurassic Park" and "Forrest Gump" on television. Power blackouts have been reduced from as long as 12 hours a day last summer to 8 hours a week.
For those still inclined to protest, the Government has at times deployed legions of uniformed and plainclothes police officers, including a new Special Brigade of paramilitary agents.
For those still eager to emigrate, a new American policy of deporting undocumented Cuban migrants has left long visa lines outside the United States diplomatic mission here as virtually the only viable option.
Official statistics and interviews with scores of Cubans suggest that most people's lives have become only somewhat easier to bear. After the collapse of the Soviet bloc and its economic support system for the island, hope seems as rare in most households as a steak dinner or a full tank of gas. Yet if most Cubans still share a deep sense of frustration about life under the hemisphere's only Communist Government, many people say the desperation that defined the country's mood last year has increasingly given way to resignation.
As a robust-looking President Castro prepared to celebrate his 69th birthday on Sunday, many Cubans were again skeptical that significant political change might come to the island before his death.
"Most people have accepted the idea that there is not going to be any change here that does not come from within the Government," said a Roman Catholic priest, who like many other Cubans spoke on condition that he not be identified. "They are learning patience again, because what alternative do they have? They saw what happened last year and they think, 'Why take the risk if nothing is going to change?' "
With critical shortages of food, electricity and public transportation last summer, Cubans' anger flared -- as it had before -- in conflicts over the illegal flight of refugees from the island.
That June and July, emigrants began pouring off the island. Small groups of refugees seized state-owned vessels and fled to southern Florida, where they were received as heroes. Others left on makeshift rafts. On July 13, Cuban coast guard ships chased a tugboat stolen from the Havana harbor out to sea and rammed it until it sank; at least 37 people drowned.
After hundreds, possibly thousands of young people rioted on Aug. 5, throwing stones at the police and ransacking stores, Mr. Castro announced that the Government would no longer try to stop the rafters. The exodus that followed left more than 32,000 Cubans in American refugee camps.
"It was something that had not happened in 36 years of revolution," the head of the Young Communists Union, Victoria Velazquez, said of the street disturbances. "We were not prepared for something like that."
Some officials who sought last year to avoid any open discussion of the unrest now acknowledge privately that the rioting had shaken the Government badly, if only briefly. In public, Cuban leaders have taken to mythologizing the quick and careful suppression of the disturbances by the police as one more heroic page in their history.
"Aug. 5 was not a bad day for the Revolution, but rather a great victory," Mr. Castro said last month, attributing the disturbances to local agitators encouraged by the United States. "There has to be an Aug. 5 every time these kinds of elements, the enemies of the Revolution, try to play the game of the imperialists."
In an apparent effort to purge memories of the defiance, the Government commemorated the anniversary of the disturbances with a huge march along the Malecon, the boulevard that runs along the Havana waterfront. Thousands of uniformed and plainclothes police officers were stationed in the area just in case, and the theme of the rally was "Cuba Lives."
Even the most upbeat officials do not contend that people on the island are living well.
But after five disastrous years that saw the economy contract at least 34 percent according to official figures (some foreign economists estimate the collapse at closer to 50 percent), officials are starting to say for the first time that the worst is over.
In 1994, the authorities say, the economy grew 0.7 percent. For the first half of this year, they say the figure was 2 percent.
Except for some increases in vegetable production, nearly all of the rebound has come in exports and joint ventures involving foreign companies. Many of the plants, farms and factories where most Cubans work have continued to stagnate, if not to deteriorate further. But the sense of at least a potential recovery has been magnified by palpable changes on the street.
Lines of waiting commuters, once endless, have begun to shrink as the Government has reorganized its transportation system, distributed hundreds of thousands of bicycles and taken donations of buses, tires and batteries from cities in Canada and Europe. With steadier fuel supplies and the refurbishing of several big electric generating plants, blackouts have been cut back sharply in the capital.
The farmers' markets that were legalized last October have nearly doubled to about 250, and more are being opened around Havana, the country's political tinderbox. Despite tight control over the licensing of self-employed workers, street vendors and garage repair shops have spread. Family-run restaurants, outlawed last year, have been allowed to reopen.
For the growing numbers of Cubans who have some access to American dollars or to the foreign-exchange certificates provided as an incentive to state workers, restaurants, nightclubs and stores that sell imported items in dollars have mushroomed. As excess Cuban currency has been soaked up by price increases on items like rum and cigarettes and by cuts in subsidies, the value of the peso has strengthened sharply against the dollar.
"For people who have money, this is glorious," said Vladimir Torres, 21, a former mechanic's apprentice who was selling young goats the other day at a bustling agricultural market outside Havana. "The people who don't -- they are still hungry."
The modest improvements have not relieved Cubans from having to dedicate hours each day to finding food, getting to work and otherwise taking care of their basic needs. But that circumstance itself, many Cubans opposed to the Government lament, might be enough to undermine any anti-Castro cause by keeping people too preoccupied to rebel.
Boredom being a handmaiden of the counterrevolution, the Government has doubled the daily television schedule from 6 hours to 12, going heavy on sports programming and recent American movies. The Young Communists Union has started up scores of neighborhood computer instruction centers, put on salsa concerts and karaoke shows in poorer neighborhoods, and is taking 400,000 young Cubans camping and to the beach.
Even as the pressure has lessened, the Government has continued to play on the concerns of many Cubans that any alternative to their current troubles might entail the loss of the benefits they still have.
Reports by the state-run news media tell of food shortages and political turmoil in Russia and the former Soviet republics. By contrast, officials praise the "stable" economic successes of China and Vietnam, where the Communist Party retains power.
In a similar vein, the official cast of Cuban history has grown steadily more nationalistic. Communist solidarity is rarely mentioned anymore. Instead, the Revolution is portrayed as part of a long continuum of anti-imperialist struggle. Marx and Lenin still have their place, but it is far smaller now, for instance, than that of the Cuban patriot Jose Marti.
The imperialist threat and the defense of social equality have also been central themes in a strong Government campaign against a pending Congressional proposal to tighten the United States economic embargo on Cuba.
The Republican bill, sponsored by Sen. Jesse Helms of North Carolina and Rep. Dan Burton of Indiana, would impose sanctions on foreign companies that do business with Cuba and press for the return of properties confiscated from private owners since the Revolution.
"In a country like Cuba where 85 percent of the families own their housing by virtue of the laws of the Revolution and the work of the Revolution, all of those families would lose the ownership of their homes," Mr. Castro warned in a speech last week. "It is something so stupid that we were almost about to send a telegram to Helms and Burton and tell them: 'Hey, thanks very much. You are really helping us.' "
Diplomats say the Cuban Government might also thank the Clinton Administration for a migration agreement in May that has helped eliminate a major source of political volatility in summers past.
Aware that they will now be deported from the United States if caught, Cubans have all but given up trying to reach American shores by raft and boat.
Some dissidents argue that the more significant change has been not in the quality of people's lives, but in the renewal of some Government controls.
When scores of squatters moved into an Old Havana building recently, the police were in place to evict them swiftly and without incident. When the Government held local elections last month with its usual one-party slate, it reported a turnout of 97.1 percent and only a small percentage of blank and nullified ballots.
Only a few anti-Government activists have been imprisoned for any length of time in recent months, and several prominent dissidents have been released. But at the same time, the police and party organizers have kept those they view as potential troublemakers at home with a series of strong warnings, dissidents say.
"I wish people were ready to protest, but I do not see it," said one well-known human rights campaigner, Elizardo Sanchez. "The repressive strategy is to keep people from coming together, and it works. If they do not come together, it is very hard for them to protest."

HEADLINE: 2 Political Parties Turn to Airwaves for Medicare Debate

BYLINE: By ADAM CLYMER 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Aug. 15

 BODY:
Democrats and Republicans are taking their quarrels over Medicare to the airwaves, with the Democrats buying television advertisements in 13 states and the Republicans purchasing radio spots in 11 Congressional districts.
One Democratic advertisement will say, "Republicans are wrong to want to cut Medicare benefits" and preserving them is "what's moral, good and right by our elderly." The other will accuse Republicans of favoring "charging elderly $600 more a year for medical care, $1,700 more for home care." 
 The Republican advertisement in the St. Louis district of Democratic Representative Richard A. Gephardt will begin, "Some politicians, like Congressman Richard Gephardt, are ignoring Medicare's looming bankruptcy."
It concludes: "Medicare's survival is at stake, and Congressman Gephardt refuses to face this danger. Congress is taking a break and Richard Gephardt is home. Call him -- now -- at his local district office. Tell him to stop playing politics with Medicare."
Introducing the Democratic commercials, Don Fowler, chairman of the Democratic National Committee, showed them at a news conference today and said the party would spend $850,000 to broadcast them "in selected markets" in 13 states. Then he passed out videotapes.
A reporter asked if the modest $850,000 purchase of advertising time meant Mr. Fowler was counting on more impact through free broadcasts on news programs. Mr. Fowler replied with a grin, "Knowing all of you to be good, fine, warm-hearted people, we're counting on you for a lot."
The budget resolution adopted by the Republican-controlled Congress called for $270 billion in savings from currently projected Medicare expenditures over seven years. President Clinton recently proposed a program he said would save $124 billion in the same period, but Republicans said his plan would actually save $192 billion. They also contended that their program would allow Medicare to grow by 6.4 percent and was therefore not a "cut."
Republicans say the proposed reduction in Medicare spending is required to avert the bankruptcy in the Medicare trust fund foreseen in seven years by the fund's trustees in an April report.
Democrats say that such warnings are routine, and that the cuts proposed by the Republicans are much bigger than needed to preserve Medicare and are designed instead to finance a tax cut for the wealthy. But the tax-cut argument was left out of their television advertisements, which will be broadcast for two weeks starting on Wednesday.
The Republican National Committee and the National Republican Congressional Committee refused to say how much they were spending on the radio advertisements. "We view that as strategic information," said Mary Crawford, a spokeswoman for Republican National Committee. The advertisements will be broadcast next week, she said, with a heavy emphasis on commuting hours and talk shows.
The Republican broadcasts cite the Medicare trustees' report, using an announcer's voice and the "economist Nancy Mitchell" and "Robert Betz, health expert." Mrs. Mitchell is an economist who has worked for the Republican National Committee, Vice President Dan Quayle and now Citizens for a Sound Economy, a conservative group. Mr. Betz heads Robert Betz Associates, a consulting firm here that deals with health policy issues.
The Democratic television advertisements use pictures of happy elderly people playing with children and of Mr. Clinton in the Oval Office, as well as shadowy images of Speaker Newt Gingrich and Senator Bob Dole of Kansas, the majority leader.

HEADLINE: A MAYORAL PANEL URGES DISMANTLING OF CITY HOSPITALS

BYLINE: By ELISABETH ROSENTHAL 

 BODY:
A hand-picked mayoral advisory panel recommended yesterday that New York City abolish its municipal hospital system, a proposal that Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani praised.
In a blunt analytical report, the seven-member panel accused the city's Health and Hospitals Corporation of delivering inefficient, low-quality health services and asserted that its 11 hospitals and its assortment of clinics, nursing homes and home-health agencies were poorly prepared to compete in a marketplace dominated by managed care. 
 The only realistic option, the panel concluded, was to dismantle "the increasingly unmanageable public hospital system" and to remove the city from the business of delivering health care.
"This advisory group has taken the most dramatic step since the creation of H.H.C.," said Maria K. Mitchell, the Mayor's special adviser on health policy and the executive director of the advisory panel. "The report presents a framework for the devolution of H.H.C."
Mr. Giuliani declined an interview to discuss the panel's report before its official release, scheduled for Thursday, but his spokeswoman, Colleen Roche, said that he "is enthusiastic about its recommendations."
Early in his administration, Mr. Giuliani proposed selling three municipal hospitals -- a proposal still pending -- and he has since spoken in general terms about wanting to sell even more. But the panel's recommendations go substantially farther, providing a sweeping proposal for dismantling an agency that each year provides care for hundreds of thousands of patients -- most of them poor.
The panel's findings come at a time when public hospitals across the country are in crisis, and Los Angeles County has plans to close dozens of clinics and severely reduce services at hospitals.
The report envisions a fragmentation of the system, with some hospitals and clinics ultimately being bought by other medical centers or health care companies and some functioning independently without city aid. In the meantime, the report said, hospitals should be given greater independence "to facilitate removing the city from the role of ownership and operation of health delivery systems." Ms. Mitchell provided a draft copy of the report to The New York Times.
Implicit in the report is that those hospitals and clinics that cannot establish an independent existence will close, although Ms. Mitchell said in an interview that the panel felt there were "obvious solutions" for most of the public hospitals.
Still, as word of the panel's report spread yesterday, the proposals drew prompt and angry criticism from politicians, community leaders and patients. Fernando Ferrer, the Bronx Borough President and a potential rival for Mr. Giuliani's job, said that selling or closing the hospitals would mean "more sick people, unquestionably."
He added: "To sell all of them or close them, just to meet a political-ideological objective, begs the issue of how you care for sick people in New York."
Ms. Mitchell said the panel's primary motivation was not to save money but to get more value for the billions of dollars that the city spends on health care. Concluding that the city's "health care return on its substantial and generous investment is inadequate," the panel said that poor patients would receive better treatment at these revamped hospitals or at private medical centers, whose business has fallen because of managed care and have been aggressively courting patients on Medicaid and Medicare. The report said that by shifting hospital patients into managed care, the city could achieve a 5 percent to 15 percent reduction in Medicaid costs, currently $2.4 billion a year.
But other obstacles loom. Since the Health and Hospitals Corporation was created by an act of the New York State Legislature in 1969, it would probably take a legislative act to dissolve it, Assembly Speaker Sheldon Silver said. He added that the hospitals agency could probably decide to sell off some of its assets, although the State Health Department has to approve all hospital sales.
A spokesman for the City Council said that it will not sit by while the Mayor dismantles the hospitals agency.
"It's not surprising that the recommendations are outlandish and outrageous, given the administration's newly articulated strategy of pushing for the maximum only to settle for the minimum," Michael S. Clendenin, the council's spokesman, said.
Board members of the Health and Hospitals Corporation were livid yesterday about the report and the secrecy that had surrounded its preparation. Calling the report a "star chamber effort," David R. Jones, a longstanding board member, said that the 16-member board had asked repeatedly about the preparation of the report but had received few answers.
"They are basically circumventing the fiduciary requirements of a state-created agency," he said of the Giuliani administration. "This is not the way a public official should act, with this kind of subterfuge and paranoia."
At Bellevue Hospital, the oldest public hospital in the country, some patients and staff members interviewed yesterday reacted with anger and dismay when told about the proposals.
"That's crazy," snapped Gail Haynes, a 43-year-old woman with AIDS. "If the Mayor privatizes all the hospitals, where will the poor people go for medical care? They're doing so many things to shut us out these days."
Mrs. Haynes attends one of the hospital's dual-diagnosis units to battle the H.I.V. virus and severe depression. She said she was worried that private owners of Bellevue would discontinue her program.
"If I'm locked out, and can't get AZT, I'll just die sooner," she said.
Many patients and employees interviewed at Bellevue and other public hospitals said they were worried that quality, out-patient care would be harder to come by for the city's poor people.
"Will they turn you away because you can't afford it?" said William Green, 39, who has attended the hospital's Clean and Sober Clinic for six months. "A sale would affect a lot of people who are in worse shape than I am."
Barbara Thompson echoed the thought as she left Lincoln Hospital in the Bronx. "Without this public hospital, being that I'm an asthmatic, I'd probably be dead much sooner," she said, clutching a small brown shopping bag of medication that the hospital often provides free.
But Gleecia Moore, who is 31 and unemployed, said that private ownership of public hospitals would improve them. "It would increase quality," she said. "I had a friend who was in Mount Sinai and it was so beautiful."
Under the leadership of its new president, Dr. Bruce Siegel, the hospitals agency has moved quickly to cut down its notorious bureaucracy, eliminating hundreds of beds and thousands of jobs in the last year.
But the Mayor and Ms. Mitchell have made no secret of their impatience with the public hospital system, relentlessly pushing for even faster change.
And despite a successful campaign to make the hospitals run more efficiently, Dr. Siegel has said that city budget cuts and reductions in Medicaid reimbursements had left the agency facing a $400 million budget gap for the fiscal year that began July 1. Dr. Siegel did not immediately return calls for comment.
The mayoral panel said its goal in dismantling the hospitals corporation was the elimination of a two-tiered medical system in the city: one for insured patients at the private hospitals and another for the poor people who use the public system.
The report suggested that the Mayor should create a steering committee that would look at each public facility to see how it could be transformed with the "goal of dissolving H.H.C." It presented various options, including selling or leasing hospitals as well as having them operated by independent boards.
Health economists have expressed doubts than anyone would want to buy a few of the corporation's older and more debt-ridden hospitals, although some H.H.C. centers, like Coney Island Hospital, are considered valuable.
But Ms. Mitchell said the city has received numerous inquiries about the three hospitals it has previously announced that it would sell, Elmhurst Hospital Center and Queens Hospital Center in Queens and Coney Island Hospital in Brooklyn. She said that the city intends to have an offering plan for the hospitals in October and expects to sell them within four or five months.
To assure that poor people have access to quality care, the panel suggested creating an independent monitoring agency. To assist employees who are displaced by the changes at the hospitals agency, the panel called for massive job retraining to teach medical personnel skills they may need to play a greater role in outpatient care.
The report said that many patients who had received care at municipal hospitals . would probably transfer to one of the city's private hospitals, noting that a number had already done so. Because managed care organizations have pushed hospitals to move treatments to outpatient settings and to shorten the amount of time patients stay in the hospital, private hospitals are looking for business in order to survive.
But patients, employees and community advocates expressed skepticism that private hospitals would pay attention to their needs.
"If you don't have money, you won't get the attention," said Norma Davila, who works at Woodhull Hospital in Bushwick, Brooklyn.
Said Sidique Wai, president of the People's Alliance, a community organization in Brooklyn: "The people are going to suffer -- the people who don't have constituencies -- and we are going to fight this to the very end."

HEADLINE: Stocks Fall on Reaction to Stronger Dollar as Dow Slips 19.02

BYLINE: By LEONARD SLOANE 

 BODY:
The stock market retreated yesterday, at least partly because of the dollar's rebound to its highest levels in six months against the Japanese yen and the German mark.
Traders were concerned about the impact of a stronger dollar on American corporations doing business overseas. Until recently, these companies have been competitive in world markets because the weak dollar has made their products less expensive than locally made goods. 
 "This could be a problem for industrial profitability," said Edward D. Walczak, chief investment officer of Vontobel U.S.A. "In addition, yesterday's economic statistics were by no means robust."
The Federal Reserve reported yesterday that total production by the nation's factories, mines and utilities rose a slight one-tenth of 1 percent in July, with the manufacturing component falling two-tenths of 1 percent. And plant capacity-use rates fell in July for the sixth month in a row, with industries running at 83.4 percent of their maximum, compared with 83.6 percent in June.
Stocks trimmed their losses later in the day when bond prices surged on a Johnson Redbook Service report that department-store sales slumped last week. The price of the bellwether 30-year Treasury bond gained 24/32, to 99 26/32, and its yield slipped to 6.89 percent, from 6.95 percent on Monday.
The Dow Jones industrial average fell 19.02 points, to 4,640.84. Among the broader indexes, the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index dropped 1.17 points, to 558.57, and the Nasdaq composite index fell 0.07 point, to 1,012.37.
Declining stocks narrowly exceeded advancing issues on the New York Stock Exchange, 1,192 to 1,033. Volume on the Big Board rose significantly to 331.1 million shares from 264.9 million shares on Monday.
Consumer-goods companies that earn a large percentage of their profits overseas reacted to the soaring dollar yesterday with declines. McDonald's closed at 37 3/4, down 1 1/8; Coca-Cola fell 7/8, to 65 1/2; Colgate-Palmolive fell 3/8, to 68 5/8, and Pepsico closed at 46 3/4, down 1/4.
Drug companies were also lower because of their big profit-making enterprises overseas. Pfizer fell 3/4, to 49 3/4, and Abbott Laboratories dropped 3/4, to 38.
Stocks of smokestack companies were lower, which some analysts attributed to the falloff in the plant capacity-use rate. Reynolds Metals fell 1 1/4, to 61; International Paper declined 5/8, to 81, and Caterpillar fell 1/4, to 65 3/4.
Some technology issues turned in yet another strong performance. Micron Technology was up 4 1/8, to 69 5/8; Sun Microsystems, rose 1 3/8, to 53 7/8, and Cirrus Logic, gained 3 1/8, to 49 1/8.
Financial-company stocks, which are usually interest sensitive and are frequently traded in tandem with bonds, also advanced. Fannie Mae rose 1, to 93 1/2, and Freddie Mac gained 7/8, to 64 1/8.
And insurance stocks, which also serve as proxies for the bond market, ended the day higher. Lincoln National closed at 40 7/8, up 1/2; American International Group was at 73 1/2, up3/8, and Torchmark closed at 39 3/8, up 1/2.
Two large retailers reported lower-than-expected earnings yesterday and their stocks sunk in response. Dayton Hudson fell 1/4, to 72 3/4, and Home Depot declined 7/8, to 42 3/8.

HEADLINE: Appliance Maker to Pay For Fleeing West Virginia

BYLINE: By PETER T. KILBORN 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Aug. 15

 BODY:
About 800 people in West Virginia, a state so ravished by waning factories and dying mines that it always leads the nation in unemployment, will be splitting $11.5 million from the Maytag Corporation of Newton, Iowa, which left them in the lurch when it closed a vending-machine plant and opened a new, lower-wage factory in South Carolina.
In one of the lushest settlements of a plant-closing dispute ever, some longtime employees at the plant, where Maytag built Coca-Cola vending machines, stand to get more than $100,000. In West Virginia, that buys a car and a good-sized house with a pool. Some newer, young workers will receive less than $10,000. 
 Early this month, the big appliance company agreed to settle a class action brought by workers at the plant, who said that Maytag broke years of promises to keep its plant and workers in the little city of Ranson in eastern West Virginia. The $16.5 million settlement, of which lawyers will receive $5 million, came after three days of the first of three trials, which were expected to last six months.
Judge David H. Saunders of the Jefferson County Circuit Court approved the preliminary agreement today, leaving only a hearing for workers on the fairness of the settlement, scheduled for October.
"I think we all feel very good about it," said Joann Henry, 62, who earned $11.45 an hour as a machinist at the plant and who now works in a liquor store. "It's like the little person really tried hard, and the little person won."
The workers did not claim that Maytag had violated the Federal plant-closing law four years ago when it closed the Ranson plant and moved production to Williston, S.C. Maytag had given workers the required 60 days notice. But the workers argued that the company had broken its years of promises.
"They lied," said Nancy Fritts, another plaintiff who earned $14.35 an hour installing wiring in vending machines. Mrs. Fritts, 45, and her husband, Gary, 48, who lost his job at the plant, too, used to drive seven miles to work. Now they drive 30 miles to jobs at an automotive brake-shoe plant that pays them $12.56 an hour. "When a manager tells you, You ain't going no place," she said, "you believe them."
The company fought back.
"There was a perception on their part that we had promised not to close the plant," said Tom Schwartz, spokesman for Maytag. "They interpreted things we said to imply lifetime employment."
A lawyer for the company, Roger A. Wolfe, said: "The settlement was simply a question of risk avoidance. Maytag maintains very strongly that it did not do anything wrong."
Paul C. Sprenger of Washington, the lead trial lawyer for the workers, called this the biggest class-action settlement ever of a factory-closing lawsuit.
But despite the big numbers, the case was, as the worker said, pulled off by the little guys. None of the usual big institutions -- a Government agency or a labor union -- took part. Just one worker, Victor Roberts 3d, decided to fight the company in May 1991, when it disclosed its plan to close that July. Mr. Roberts went to Paul G. Taylor, who had just finished law school at the University of Richmond and begun practicing in Martinsburg, W.Va.
Mr. Taylor filed a suit on Mr. Roberts's behalf. An item about the case appeared in a local newspaper. And then others started calling.
"It got to where I was speaking with hundreds of people," Mr. Taylor said.
Another lawyer, Christopher Janelle, joined the case in 1992 after graduating from the same law school. They refiled the case as a class action.
Maytag, too, started small, using local lawyers. But then it turned to Jackson & Kelly, the state's biggest law firm.
"I knew they could overwhelm me in paper and wear me down," Mr. Taylor said.
So three months ago, when he came across a mention of Mr. Sprenger in a law journal, he turned to his firm, Strenger & Lang.
The issue in the case was the workers' 14 claims of breach of contract and misrepresentation. West Virginia, like many states, gives employers freedom to hire and fire at will, without explanation. But the employment-at-will prerogative can be modified by assurances of job security, and Mr. Taylor said Maytag made many.
In the year before the closing, Maytag began remodeling a plant in Williston to make vending machines. There, it would pay 900 workers an average of $7 an hour, $6 less than in Ranson. The workers' lawyers say the company said it wanted to expand production and would operate both plants. But in October 1990, it laid off 150 workers, and people started to worry.
At periodic plant meetings, however, management assured the workers that the rest of their jobs were safe, the lawyers said. The company's employee handbook also was phrased in a way to imply that if workers followed the rules, their jobs were safe.
The first of three trials, two on the claims, one for damages, had entered its third day when the company proposed the $16.5 million settlement. Mr. Sprenger speculated that his plan for his next witness helped bring the company around.
He had taken a four-hour videotape deposition of Leonard Hadley, Maytag's chairman and chief executive. What Mr. Hadley would say, Mr. Sprenger would not disclose. "We were going to play it on big-screen TV," he said.

HEADLINE: AT&T Says It Will Offer Internet Access Service

BYLINE: By PETER H. LEWIS 

 BODY:
AT&T announced plans yesterday to offer access to the Internet, saying that it wanted to make on-line services as common and as easy to use as the telephone.
The company, which has 80 million telephone customers worldwide, said it intended to offer Internet services ranging from secure business transactions to electronic mail, voice and video conferencing, and wireless access. 
 Thomas J. Pincince, senior analyst for Forrester Research Inc. in Cambridge, Mass., said: "We expect within the next six months AT&T will be well on its way to becoming the dominant Internet access provider. No one else can match their reach and their ability to target business and residential customers."
But details were sketchy in AT&T's announcement, which comes a week after a broad push into Internet services by the rival MCI Communications and a week ahead of a new Internet-based venture by the Microsoft Corporation.
AT&T officials declined to indicate when telephone customers would be offered dialing access to the Internet services -- requiring a personal computer, a modem and a standard telephone line -- except to say that technical trials would begin within 60 days and would be available initially in limited areas. The officials also declined to discuss pricing for the new Internet services.
"We expect to be competitive, but we won't lock in on prices until we're pretty close to the actual release of the product," said Tom Evslin, vice president of AT&T Worldnet Services, one of three new business units established.
Mr. Evslin said AT&T would not widely market the new services until the trials indicated that "the service is up to the quality people expect from AT&T."
Business customers seeking to gain access to the Internet through dedicated local area computer networks will be able to begin ordering service on Sept. 1, Mr. Evslin said.
AT&T officials acknowledged that their giant communications company had been slow responding to the phenomenal growth of the Internet, a global web of computer networks that now links 30 million to 40 million people.
The officials said company strategy had shifted several times in recent years, leading to a seemingly disjointed assortment of investments and alliances that included the Ziff Communications Company's Interchange Online Network; Bolt, Baranek & Newman's BBN Planet Internet services company and the Imagination game network.
Analysts said that even though AT&T was a relative latecomer to the on-line services industry, it would enter the rapidly growing electronic market with a formidable array of strengths, not the least of which was a powerful brand name.
The strengths also include a customer data base with tens of millions of names and addresses, a well-established long-distance billing structure, decades of experience in customer service, and lots of cash.
"Before this, AT&T looked like ship with a loose rudder, swinging wildly," said Jerry Michalski, managing editor of Release 1.0, a newsletter published in New York. "Now, they have a credible on-line and Internet offering. They're determined to take advantage of what they're good at, which is taking care of individual customers and (800) service business customers, and making on-line access at least appear simple."
AT&T has licensed Internet navigation software from Netscape Communications Inc., and has secured the rights to a variety of other software tools that the company said would make it easy to find and use information on the global computer network.
Shares of AT&T rose 25 cents yesterday, to $52, on the New York Stock Exchange. Shares of Netscape, which went public last Wednesday, surged $3.375, to $54.625, in Nasdaq trading, after the licensing agreement was announced.
Unlike the most popular on-line services of the moment, AT&T's strategy calls for the use of relatively advanced information tools embedded in the network itself. The tools include so-called intelligent agents that can be instructed to scan the networks around the clock for items of interest to the consumer, AT&T officials said.
The company is creating three units to offer Internet services. Of those, AT&T Worldnet Services will be responsible for offering business and residential customers access to the Internet through dedicated networks, dial-up telephone services, and wireless communications.
Another, Hosting and Transactions Services, will help AT&T's (800) business customers develop electronic storefronts and services on the Internet's World Wide Web.
The third unit will develop content for Worldnet.

HEADLINE: FUTURES MARKETS;
Prices for Copper Soar on Belief That Supplies Will Soon Tighten

BYLINE: By The Associated Press 

 BODY:
Prices for copper rose sharply yesterday on heavy speculative buying in anticipation of tighter supplies this fall.
Declining world stockpiles could put the market in position to test the seven-year-old record high of $1.6475 a pound, analysts said. 
 "The performance of the copper market in July and the first half of August has been outstanding," said William O'Neill, a senior futures strategist with Merrill Lynch. "If this performance is indicative, it points to the potential for higher prices in the fall."
On other commodity markets, gold prices rose, silver stalled, sugar fell sharply, and grains and soybeans retreated. The Commodity Research Bureau's index of 21 commodities fell 0.43 point, to 234.28.
Copper for September delivery climbed 2.45 cents, to $1.3895 a pound on the Commodity Exchange in New York.
The surge supported the view of some analysts that copper would return to its mid-July levels above $1.45.
"More people are going to the camp that supplies are likely to tighten in the near term before anticipated new mine production comes on stream early next year," said David Rinehimer, an analyst at Smith Barney.
Despite increased production, world copper consumption could outstrip new supplies by 500,000 metric tons this year, he said.
World stocks dropped by 644,000 metric tons last year.
"The mistake of the market earlier in the year is that it underestimated the demand potential," Mr. O'Neill said. "Demand levels have far outstripped expectations all through the period of recent economic slowdown."
After the close of trading, the Comex reported that American copper stocks in warehouses rose by 470 tons, to 15,553.
On other metals markets, gold traders shrugged off the strength in the dollar, which normally depresses gold prices. October gold rose $1 an ounce, settling at $388 on the Comex. But September silver ended 0.7 cent lower at $5.345 an ounce as traders took profits from the market's early rally.
Sugar futures also succumbed to profit taking. October sugar sank 0.15 cent, to 11 cents a pound on the New York Coffee, Sugar and Cocoa Exchange. Sugar prices hit a seven-week high of 11.21 cents on Monday on concerns about tight supplies.
Grain and soybean futures prices weakened on the Chicago Board of Trade. Wheat for September delivery fell 5 cents, to $4.325 a bushel; September corn slipped 0.25 cent, to $2.81 a bushel; September oats ended unchanged at $1.5825 a bushel, and August soybeans dropped 4.5 cents, to $5.87 a bushel.

HEADLINE: Economic Development Head Has New Job, but Same Boss

BYLINE: By DAVID FIRESTONE 

 BODY:
As president of the city's Economic Development Corporation, Clay B. Lifflander has spent the last 20 months reporting to Deputy Mayor John S. Dyson. Yesterday, Mr. Lifflander announced that he was leaving city government for the private sector -- to work for Mr. Dyson.
Mr. Lifflander, 33, will become president of Millbrook Management, Mr. Dyson's multimillion-dollar investment company, which has holdings in wineries, manufacturing plants and broadcast stations. His wife is pregnant with the couple's first child, and Mr. Lifflander said he had been seeking an opportunity to make more money than his $110,000 city salary. 
 "I used to earn a lot more money, and I have issues accordingly," said Mr. Lifflander, who was formerly managing director of Smith Barney Shearson's corporate finance division, specializing in mergers and acquisitions.
Mr. Dyson, who joked that he was in effect "raiding himself," said he tried to talk Mr. Lifflander out of leaving public service. But when it became evident that Mr. Lifflander intended to go, and he had received offers from several investment banks, Mr. Dyson offered him an interest in the company's growth and what he described as a "very generous salary," which neither man would disclose.
"It's a normal thing to expect that people of Clay's ability will spend a year or two in the government as a contribution to society," Mr. Dyson said, "and then will want to go on with their private life."
To avoid a conflict of interest, Mr. Dyson put his holdings in a blind trust before joining the Giuliani administration and said he became concerned about his company recently after its president retired. Had the position not been filled, he said, he would likely have resigned himself to resume control over the company.
The Economic Development Corporation is the city's agency for encouraging business growth and for attracting and retaining private-sector jobs in the city. Under Mr. Lifflander, the agency has most notably been involved in the redevelopment of 42d Street, negotiating deals with the Walt Disney Company and Madame Tussaud's, the London wax museum, for new attractions in the Times Square area.
Mr. Dyson said the corporation was "looking for another young investment banker like Clay" to fill the president's job.

Japan's Imports Grew in July, Cutting Surplus

 BODY:
Japan's trade surplus shrank by an unexpectedly large 23 percent last month as growth in imports far outstripped the increase in exports, the Finance Ministry said yesterday in Tokyo. The politically sensitive surplus with the United States declined by 31 percent, as Japanese exports to this country fell for the first time in 32 months.
The trade data, coupled with intervention in the currency market by the central banks of Japan, the United States and Germany, helped the dollar rise strongly against the yen. 
 The surprisingly big decline in the Japanese surplus left economists divided about the outlook for the trade imbalance.
"Japan's trade surplus is on a declining trend, with the effect of the yen's rise starting to depress the volume of exported products," Reuters quoted Takumi Tsunoda, an economist at the Yamaichi Research Institute of Securities and Economics, as saying.
But Russell Jones, a senior economist at Lehman Brothers in Tokyo, said, "I would question whether this surge in imports is going to continue, given the slowdown in the Japanese economy," Bloomberg Business News reported. "Trade adjustment is going to be gradual, rather than dramatic. This figure is erratic. I just don't expect it to be sustained."
In its report, the Finance Ministry said Japan's trade surplus with the rest of the world shrank in July to $9.43 billion from $12.25 billion a year earlier. Exports rose 10 percent, to $38.03 billion from $34.49 billion, while imports increased 29 percent, to $28.59 billion from $22.24 billion.
"The basic drive behind the falling surplus is an unprecedented increase in import penetration," said Jesper Koll, an economist with J. P. Morgan in Tokyo, Bloomberg reported. "The whole spectrum of domestic demand is being filled with imports substituting for high-priced domestic products."
When calculated in yen, the surplus declined even more, falling 33 percent. Yen-denominated exports fell 5.2 percent, while imports increased 10 percent.
Japan's trade surplus with the United States, a source of friction between the two nations for years, fell for the second consecutive month in July, declining to $3.87 billion from $5.62 billion. Exports to the United States fell 2.8 percent, to $10.34 billion from $10.64 billion. Shipments of automobiles fell 31 percent, to $1.76 billion.
Some economists said Japanese car makers slowed shipments in July because the strong yen reduced the amount of Japanese currency produced by sales denominated in dollars. Others said the decline reflected a carry-over effect from the threat in June of trade sanctions. The Clinton Administration had threatened to impose punitive tariffs on imports of Japanese luxury cars unless Japan agreed to open its automotive market further; an agreement was reached on June 28.
"There may be some trade dispute-related adjustment in exports in June and July," Lehman's Mr. Jones said. "I would think they would start to come back."
The decline in exports to the United States also reflected slower shipments of personal computers and steel.
Japanese imports of goods from the United States rose 29 percent, to $6.47 billion from $5.02 billion. Shipments of computer chips rose 56 percent, and auto shipments increased 42 percent.

HEADLINE: Japan Apologizes

 BODY:
Prime Minister Tomiichi Murayama of Japan has finally offered the apology for his nation's World War II conduct that generations of Asians have waited so long to hear. To understand the significance of his words, uttered yesterday on the 50th anniversary of Japan's surrender, it is necessary to recall the enormity of Tokyo's war crimes.
Millions of Chinese civilians were gratuitously slaughtered, 300,000 in a single massacre at Nanjing. Millions of Koreans were enslaved, including tens of thousands of women forced to provide sexual services to Japanese troops. Gruesome chemical and biological warfare experiments were carried out on Chinese civilians and European prisoners of war. In a vast arc of land and sea sweeping from the borders of India to those of Siberia, 20 million died. 
 In Western memory, these atrocities tend to be overshadowed by the horrors of Nazism. Americans recall mainly Pearl Harbor, the Bataan death march and the costly victories at Iwo Jima and Okinawa. But in Asia, Japan's murderous savageries are scorched into national memories, although relatively few survivors of that era remain.
Some Asians remain aggrieved that only Mr. Murayama apologized, not Japan's Parliament. Others still press for monetary reparations to Japan's victims and their survivors. But in general, Asians are reacting favorably to his statement.
It is difficult, too, for outsiders to understand why Japanese politicians found it so hard for so many years to apologize. Part of the answer is the long dominance of the Liberal Democratic Party, a conservative grouping that has embraced strong nationalists and even former war criminals. Another factor is what might be called the official version of war guilt, presented at the postwar Tokyo War Crimes Tribunal and implicitly endorsed by United States occupation authorities. According to this view, a largely unknowing Japanese nation was hijacked by a small militarist clique. It followed that the military elite, not the nation as a whole, was responsible for wartime atrocities. A later Japanese elaboration of this official version drew on the atomic bombing of Hiroshima and Nagasaki to portray Japan as purely a victim nation, ignoring the context of earlier Japanese aggression.
For all of Japan's official amnesia, nobody seriously believed that the absence of an apology meant Tokyo might again embark on the path of military conquest. The practical concern was that without accepting responsibility for its conduct in the war, an economically powerful Japan could not comfortably take its appropriate place in Asian discussions of security. With potential problems from Korean reunification to tensions in the Taiwan Straits and South China Sea now looming large, Japan's absence from these discussions was growing increasingly awkward.
Fifty years have now passed since the end of the war. New generations have grown up. At last Japan has expressed an unambiguous apology. How much better to look ahead to the emerging issues of the 21st century than to continue tongue-tied about the horrors of the mid-20th.

HEADLINE: Counsel to the Brokenhearted;
For Lawyer, Bitter Divorces and Touch of Humor

BYLINE: By JAN HOFFMAN 

 BODY:
It is a pitfall of being a divorce lawyer, in contrast to, say, a corporate litigator, that once a case is over, the client has no further need for your high moral dudgeon or your billable hours.
But Eleanor B. Alter, one of New York's premier divorce lawyers, whose firm charges the bitter and the brokenhearted $400 an hour for her counsel, has a number of dedicated repeat customers. 
 "I represented one man through three different wives and did two prenuptials with him," she said the other day. "When his psychiatrist said he couldn't sustain a relationship with a woman, he said, 'That's not true -- I've had a relationship with Eleanor for 20 years.' "
After 28 years in the business, Mrs. Alter has overseen the termination of more than 2,000 marriages, not counting two of her own. In recent years, her clients have included Joy Silverman, the ex-inamorata of Sol Wachtler, the state's former top judge; Mia Farrow, Woody Allen's ex-inamorata, and now one Nancy Richardson, the would-be ex-wife of Frank Richardson, a Wall Street financier whose diaries became tabloid fodder earlier this month because of their impassioned passages about Kimba Wood, a New York Federal judge.
No one ever said the decorum of divorce litigation compared favorably to high tea. And in Mrs. Alter, 56, clients find an advocate who is widely regarded as canny, feared and ferociously loyal, which is not to say that she is universally beloved. "Oh, lots of people will tell you I'm a bitch," she said .
Within the matrimonial bar, there has been much speculation that it was either Mrs. Alter or her co-counsel in the Richardson case, Norman M. Sheresky, who leaked the diaries to reporters. Fingers also pointed to Mrs. Alter when a videotape of Mr. Allen's and Ms. Farrow's adopted daughter Dylan, purportedly speaking about being sexually molested, surfaced in that case.
But Mrs. Alter insisted that while she may play hardball, she does not play dirty. She did not release the videotape, she said, and neither she nor Mr. Sheresky leaked the Richardson diaries. It would have been poor strategy, she said, with professional pride. "Because they've been published, the diaries are no longer much good to us as a litigation weapon," she said. "Everyone knows that the unfired bullet is more powerful than the fired one."
That is the kind of you-blink-first attitude that leads colleagues like Harriet Newman Cohen, another doyenne of divorce, to put distance between her and Mrs. Alter. Within the practice's inner circle, Ms. Cohen said, "there are the ones who are considered scholarly and discreet -- well, like me and my partners -- and then there's the jugular group, the rough bunch." She sighed. "But we're all self-promoters."
Some legal adversaries have become friends: Elkan Abramowitz, the lawyer for Woody Allen, whom Mrs. Alter savaged during the vicious 1993 custody trial, dined at her house so that they could watch together the television miniseries about their case.
Law and boudoir shenanigans have been linked in Mrs. Alter's mind since she was 14, when she learned about sex by secretly reading transcripts from the eye-popping trial of Mickey Jelke, the so-called "pint-sized oleomargarine king" who was convicted of being a pimp. The transcripts were lying around the house because her father, Charles D. Breitel, then an appellate judge, was hearing the case.
Judge Breitel would later be elected to New York's Court of Appeals. In 1973, he was elected Chief Judge, the position later held by Mr. Wachtler.
Mrs. Alter's father was less than enthusiastic upon learning that as a fledgling associate, his eldest child, who had attended law school at Harvard University and graduated from Columbia, was being handed divorce cases by her firm. In the mid-1960's, matrimonial work had an even more tawdry reputation than it does now, because the only legal cause for divorce in New York then was adultery, with its de rigueur raids and flashbulb photos. (The laws began to change in 1966.)
But except for the fact that she has been occasionally harassed and stalked by the ex-husband of her first divorce client, Mrs. Alter took to the practice with alacrity. She is not fazed by marital muck and misery, the sobbing messages left on her answering machine at 3 A.M., even the would-be murderous rants a client may go into when the lawyer has to deliver bad news. Actually, she rather enjoys it. And while she says emphatically that settling a case is always better than trying it, she obviously relishes a good fight, both for her own sake as well as her client's.
But to gear up for the battle royal, she said, she must believe she is on the side of right. Once, after a wife complained that her husband battered her regularly, Mrs. Alter angrily called the husband's lawyer, who cautioned her to check the woman's credibility.
Her client produced Polaroids and Mrs. Alter was persuaded; she had never seen a face in worse condition -- black and blue, bloodied, oozing yellow and green. She triumphantly showed the Polaroids to her adversary. Upon which she learned they were snapshots from a recent face lift.
"I withdrew from the case," recounted Mrs. Alter, a garrulous woman with a ripe, ready laugh.
Despite her years practicing family law, about which she lectures at law schools in New York and Chicago, she said she is still capable of being shocked. "What people will tolerate emotionally from their spouses shocks me," she said.
Also, the extent of child abuse. Substance abuse. And certain sexual proclivities. She recalled sitting in a judge's chambers, the two of them flipping through a husband's catalogue of sex tools, trying like the devil to figure out the manifold uses.
But of all her cases, she said she found the breadth of Mr. Allen's conduct toward Ms. Farrow and the children to be the most shocking. "Why did he bring a custody proceeding?" she said, referring to Mr. Allen's efforts with respect to three of Ms. Farrow's children. "He never spent a night alone with them, couldn't name one of their friends, nor a pet nor a doctor."
Mrs. Alter and Ms. Farrow eventually parted ways over fee disputes. And Mr. Allen ended up paying virtually all of Mrs. Alter's $1.6 million tab.
Of Mrs. Alter's current role representing Ms. Silverman in divorce actions in two states against Jeffrey, her husband of nearly 20 years, a case that makes a bowl of spaghetti look straightforward, she would only say that she would fight efforts to compel Mr. Wachtler to testify. "My father loved the court, and so anything that hurts it would affect me, too," she said. (Judge Breitel died in 1991.)
In her nearly three decades of practice, Mrs. Alter said, not only have scenes from marriages gone from bad to baroque but also the sex of her middle-class and wealthy clientele has changed. Nearly half of her clients now are women.
"When I started, almost 100 percent of the initiators were men, and in recent times, it is even or slightly more women," she said. "That's because women are more economically independent, it's not a stigma to be divorced, and their expectations about marriage have been raised, incorrectly or not.
"And as more and more women enter the work force, the same temptations and stresses that applied to men do to them, too. As it becomes more acceptable and easier to get divorced, that has a self-fulfilling prophecy."
Near the end of a late-afternoon interview, the phone rang sharply in her office and she said quickly into it: "I'm coming home! I'm coming home!"
And so, given her dubious perch overlooking a vast moonscape of shattered romances and depleted bank accounts, it was something of a surprise to learn that this past New Year's Day, Mrs. Alter herself pledged to tilt at the marriage windmill a third time.
An early first marriage, during which she became a mother of two sons, was to William D. Zabel, who would become a dean of the trust and estates bar. The divorce was settled and the two remain sufficiently amicable.
Her second marriage, to a man she would only describe as a Connecticut corporate lawyer, lasted 13 years, produced no children and ended in 1982 with a deeply unpleasant divorce during which, she said, she was sued for alimony and property.
"Well, I had to come to terms with the fact that I wasn't very good at marriage," said the woman whose clients rely on her to be an expert on the topic.
Last year, persistent friends fixed her up with the man who would become her third husband, Dr. Allan M. Lans, now 63, a psychiatrist for the Mets and the head of Kirby Forensic Psychiatric Center, an institution for defendants deemed incompetent to stand trial or found not guilty by reason of insanity. She and her husband argue at the dinner table about who is the craziest of them all -- the criminally insane, professional ballplayers or divorce clients -- often with no clear winner emerging.
She still believes that having a committed, permanent relationship is the best way to live one's life: her wedding vows included the phrase "till death do us part."
And no, she didn't sign a prenuptial agreement to protect her assets against divorce. "The subject never came up," she said.

City's Plan To Improve Stadium Criticized

BYLINE: By RICHARD SANDOMIR 

 BODY:
An expert hired by the Yankees to assess the latest proposal by New York City to keep the team playing in the Bronx has said the improvements are inadequate and will not speed traffic flow to and from Yankee Stadium.
George Steinbrenner, the Yankees' principal owner, has regularly cited heavy traffic, poor access to garages and inadequate parking as some of the reasons for his dissatisfaction with Yankee Stadium. 
 The expert's analysis is not an automatic rejection of the plan, said David Sussman, the team's general counsel. "We look to meet again with the city soon to see what direction this must take," he said, although no meeting has been scheduled. "It will take time for the city to digest the report."
But he added, "There isn't much additional time to get this thing going."
The Yankees' 30-year lease at Yankee Stadium expires in 2002.
The city and the team have been squabbling for two years about where the Yankees will play after 2002. Forrest Taylor, chief of staff to Deputy Mayor John S. Dyson, said:"The city recognizes Yankee Stadium as one of the many jewels in New York City's crown and is therefore committed to keeping the Yankees there. We'll continue to aggressively pursue solutions to the concerns raised by the Yankees."
Taylor would not discuss the findings of the Yankees' expert, nor would a spokesman for Clay Lifflander, president of the city's Economic Development Corporation, which hired Hellmuth, Obata & Kassabaum to draw up the stadium plan.
The expert, Vollmer Associates, was hired to assess Hellmuth's architectural plan and made its findings known July 24 at a City Hall meeting.
Hellmuth proposed building three garages with 6,000 parking spaces adjacent to the stadium and enlarging an existing one; building a new bridge across the Harlem River and building new ramps from the Major Deegan Expressway and the 145th Street Bridge. The plan also calls for adding retail stores, entertainment attractions and a new outer wall around the stadium for concourses.
Sussman said Vollmer reported that "the highway system and infrastructure that supports it has so many fundamental problems that the introduction of new garages and roads leading there doesn't change the traffic impediments to the site."
Although the proposed new and expanded garages provide the parking required by the Yankees, Vollmer said the new roads and bridge "do not alleviate the overriding impediment, which is it takes an hour and a half to three hours to get out of the stadium."
The consultant did not make any recommendations to modify the proposal.
"That's not the role of the expert or of the Yankees," Sussman said.
Vollmer also raised questions about the city's ability to manage the costs of the project and get the necessary approvals to proceed with the work, which would also include converting local streets to dedicated access roads.
"Approvals aren't only about whether, but when," Sussman said. "If it can be approved, what's the duration of construction and what is the cost?"
Sussman added, "With the end of the lease seven years out, and trying to be as realistic about the construction and approval times, there isn't much additional time to get this going."
The expert's opinion may be one step away from the team's rejecting the city's latest plan, which was excoriated at a community hearing last February as overly favorable to the Yankees and an insult to the neighborhood. Several people criticized the plan as creating an enclave around the stadium while shutting out local residents and causing parks and playing areas to be moved.
Separately, the city has also met recently with Fred Wilpon, the Mets' co-owner, about plans to build a new stadium and entertainment complex on the site of Shea Stadium. "It was very positive," Taylor said.

World Bank Cancels Nepal Project Loan

BYLINE: By PAUL LEWIS 

 BODY:
The World Bank's new president, signaling that the institution is taking a more cautious approach to lending, has withdrawn $175 million in credits promised to a hydroelectric project in Nepal, canceling the $1 billion development.
James D. Wolfensohn, who has been the international lending agency's president for about two months, said Nepal was too poor for the power project to succeed. The decision was announced last Friday. 
 The withdrawal of the promised credits from the project, known as Arun 3, was a sign that Mr. Wolfensohn wants the World Bank -- which spent $10.4 billion on development last year -- to become more cautious in financing big infrastructure projects.
It also means that a borrowing country's ability to manage a development project, and to profit from it, is likely to become an increasingly important consideration when the World Bank decides whether or not to offer financial backing.
"Canceling Arun 3 signals a very rigorous approach to evaluation," said Jan Piercy, the United States representative on the World Bank's executive board.
In announcing the cancellation, the bank said that the increase in domestic electricity rates needed for the project's success, along with expensive new social and environmental programs, was "beyond what Nepal could realistically have achieved at present."
Bruce Rich of the Environmental Defense Fund said, "We've not previously seen the bank put such public stress on insuring projects are properly implemented."
The bank also said it doubted that other donors would provide additional funds after a finding last year by the Federal Audit Office of Germany that Arun 3 "is not ripe for decision at this stage, especially in regard to its economic viability, sustainability and the minimization of risk."
The Nepalese project had been opposed for years by many private environmental and antipoverty groups. They saw it as an example of World Bank lending for big projects that in some cases had backfired, increasing poverty and harming the environment instead.
Opponents of the power project argued that it was too large and costly for a country whose population, they said, had an average income of only $180 a year. Instead, they favored building many smaller hydroelectric stations.
"This was a 200-megawatt plant costing $1 billion, when the rule of thumb is $1 million per megawatt," said Patrick McCully of the International Rivers Network, a California environmental group. "It was too expensive and would have undermined other development priorities."
In making its announcement, the bank promised to develop "alternative approaches to meeting Nepal's energy needs."
As a result of the protests, Arun 3 last year became the first development project to be referred to an independent inspection panel that the World Bank created, under Congressional pressure, to evaluate complaints about projects. The panel initially sided with the project's critics, but reversed that position after the World Bank proposed "remedial measures."
Ultimately, however, Mr. Wolfensohn canceled the planned credits after a review carried out by Maurice Strong, a Canadian businessman who organized the United Nations' Earth Summit in Rio de Janeiro in 1992.
Within the World Bank, concern about big projects began in 1992, when a report by a former bank official found that 37.5 percent of projects backed by the bank were performing badly, often because of mismanagement by the borrowing country. The growth of World Bank lending had already begun to slow as a result.
Later this year, Brazilian environmental groups plan to ask the inspection panel to rule that the Rondonia state government is mismanaging a project intended to repair damage to the Amazon rain forest caused by road building.

Treasury Issues Advance Despite Loss Earlier in Day

BYLINE: By ROBERT HURTADO 

 BODY:
The bond market yesterday showed the resiliency that it has displayed many times this year, recovering from early losses to end with modest gains.
Bond prices fell early in the day following comments by Alan S. Blinder, the vice chairman of the Federal Reserve, which indicated that the Fed was unlikely to cut interest rates anytime soon without evidence that the economy is slowing. 
 But as the price of the 30-year bond fell and its yield approached 7 percent, buyers began to emerge, traders said.
The rebound was helped by a report on industrial production and capacity utilization, which was weaker than expected.
The price of the 30-year bond settled up 24/32 of a percentage point, to 99 26/32 ; its yield, which moves in the opposite direction from its price, slipped to 6.89 percent, from 6.95 percent on Monday.
The Federal Reserve said yesterday that industrial production rose one-tenth of 1 percent in July after a revised one-tenth of 1 percent drop in June. Industrial production was unchanged in May. Capacity utilization fell to 83.4 percent, the sixth consecutive monthly decline. While capacity use was a little higher than the 83.1 percent forecast, that was largely a result of increased use of electric power during the heat wave in July.
"Indeed, were it not for the heat wave, industrial production would have dropped in July," noted Donald Fine, chief market analyst at Chase Securities. Manufacturing output dipped two-tenths of 1 percent, with motor vehicles the weakest sector and computer and office equipment the strongest.
Bond prices opened lower after Mr. Blinder, in an interview Monday night, indicated that economy would have to weaken from current levels before the Fed would again push interest rates lower.
Eric Hamilton, senior fixed-income analyst with Technical Data in Boston, said Mr. Blinder's comments "spooked traders who were still factoring in the chance for another easing at next week's Federal Open Market Committee meeting." The committee sets Fed interest rate policy.
But bonds soon recovered, rising in the late afternoon after the release of a Johnson Redbook report showing lackluster store sales in the first two weeks of August.
Bonds were also bolstered by a surge in the dollar. The currency rose to its highest level in six months after the Fed and the Japanese and German central banks bought dollars on foreign exchange markets.
Mr. Hamilton of Technical Data said the stronger dollar prompted those who were selling short, or betting that bond prices would fall, to cover their positions, pushing the market higher.
"Looking ahead, the stronger dollar intervention seen today should continue to have a positive impact on the market," he said. "Those central banks now holding a fresh supply of dollars typically look to put these funds back into the Treasury market." This, he added, should be enough to keep the downside of the market protected over the next couple of trading sessions.
Mr. Fine of Chase Securities, however, noted that the market could soon have other concerns. "Lurking in the minds of bonds market participants is tomorrow's announcement of two-year and five-year Treasury notes," he said. "Both issues are expected to be increased in size, and will temporarily add to the market's supply distribution woes." .
In the municipal bond market, where states, cities and their agencies sold $1.089 billion in new securities through negotiated and competitive sale, Los Angeles priced one of the larger issues.
The city sold $229 million in general obligation bonds through competitive bidding won by BA Securities. The serial bonds are insured by the Financial Guaranty Insurance Company and are rated triple-A by the rating agencies.
Underwriters said the serial bonds were priced to yield from 3.75 percent for a bond due in 1996 to 6.30 percent for those due in 2015.

HEADLINE: Utility Output Offsets Weak U.S. Industry

BYLINE: Reuters 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Aug. 15

 BODY:
Hot weather kept utility companies busy and bolstered national industrial output in July for the first time in five months, the Federal Reserve said today, offsetting widespread weakness among manufacturing businesses.
Total production by the nation's factories, mines and utilities rose a slight one-tenth of 1 percent after a revised one-tenth of 1 percent drop in June. But capacity-use rates edged lower for the sixth month in a row, so that industries ran at 83.4 percent of their maximum, the lowest since February 1994, when they were at 83.2 percent. 
 Analysts said the industrial sector was slowly pulling out of a slump caused by big stockpiles of unsold goods. Consumer caution about buying new cars and other costly goods diminished the positive impact of steady business investment in new machinery.
"It looks like companies were trying to keep everyone cool in July and increase their computing power, but aside from that, not much else was happening," said Lynn Reaser, an economist at the First Interstate Bancorp in Los Angeles. "Clearly the economy does not appear to be in recession, but it's quite weak."
In fact, production at manufacturing companies fell for a fourth month in a row as the year's second half opened, down two-tenths of 1 percent after drops of one-tenth of 1 percent in May and June and a seven-tenths of 1 percent decline in April.
"The decline in manufacturing was led by a 3.2 percent drop in the output of motor vehicles and parts, but the output of many other industries also decreased significantly," the Fed reported, especially for suppliers to auto makers.
"Gains at producers of electrical machinery, industrial machinery and computer equipment and paper helped stanch the decline," the central bank said. Computer output rose 3.7 percent and electrical machinery output was up 2.2 percent.
The key factor that kept overall industrial output from sagging was a 3.6 percent jump in production by utility companies, which strained to generate enough power to keep air- conditioners working in an exceptionally hot summer. Utility output had fallen nine-tenths of 1 percent in June.
Mining industries' output rose 1 percent in July because of coal mining and oil and gas production. Their output was up a slight three-tenths of 1 percent in June.
The economic expansion slowed to a five-tenths of 1 percent annual growth rate in the second quarter of this year, from 2.7 percent in the first quarter as inventories mounted in the face of fading consumer demand.
As auto makers retooled for 1996 models and closed some plants temporarily in July, assembly rates for new cars held steady at 6 million a year, but the rate for light trucks fell to 4.8 million from 5.3 million a year in June.

HEADLINE: TRACK & FIELD;
Out of Banishment and Back in Race

BYLINE: By MARC BLOOM 

 BODY:
For four years Danny Harris, the 1984 Olympic silver medalist in the 400-meter hurdles and the runner who ended Edwin Moses's 10-year unbeaten streak, led a double life.
Competing on the Grand Prix circuit in Europe, Harris won most of his races, set records and, in 1990, was ranked No. 1 in the world. At home in Los Angeles during the off season, Harris was a cocaine addict. 
 Now Harris, who turns 30 next month, has only one life to live. And in Zurich tonight at the Weltklasse track and field meet, he will face his biggest challenge since returning to competition after a drug suspension.
Harris, the only track and field athlete in the world ever suspended for cocaine use, will compete against Derrick Atkins of Atlanta, the gold medalist at last week's world championships in Sweden.
"My goal this summer is to beat all the medalists from the world games," said Harris, who did not make this summer's United States team because of a hamstring muscle injury.
Last month, after the injury cleared up, Harris won a race in Nice, France, in 47.98 seconds, the same time run by Atkins in Sweden. Harris also won in Stockholm and was a close second to Atkins in London.
"It's exciting to be running again," Harris said. "Staying healthy is the most important thing."
The London meet, in Crystal Palace, was especially poignant for Harris. It was there a year ago when he was denied entry on the eve of the event. Despite being reinstated months earlier by U.S.A. Track and Field, the American governing body, Harris was still considered ineligible by the International Amateur Athletic Federation, which rules the sport worldwide.
Harris had tested positive for cocaine use in February 1992 at the United States National Indoor Meet in Madison Square Garden. He was given a four-year suspension.
In 1994, following successful drug rehabilitation, Harris's ban was cut to two years by American authorities, who permitted him to compete immediately. But the I.A.A.F. did not concur with the United States' ruling until the end of the season.
Harris first turned to cocaine while on the threshold of becoming one of the sport's superstars. As an 18-year-old Iowa State freshman, he was considered the baby of the 1984 Olympic team, coming within a stride of Moses in Los Angeles. That year, he broke the world junior record five times.
After winning three successive N.C.A.A. titles, Harris left Iowa State to compete on the international circuit.
"It was an economic decision," said Harris, the youngest of six children who was raised by his grandmother in Perris, Calif., after both his parents died.
Harris earned money from races and received a shoe contract with Nike. He was considered Moses's successor when he stopped Moses's streak at 107 straight victories during 1987 and ran 47.48 to finish a close second to Moses at the world meet in Rome.
In 1988, Harris was the Olympic gold-medal favorite but was crushed when he did not make the United States team. "That's when I started experimenting with cocaine," said Harris, who now lives in Ames, Iowa.
Harris insisted he did not use the drug while competing abroad. He said the overall effects of cocaine, however, may have contributed to his fifth-place showing at the 1991 world meet in Tokyo.
While banned substances like anabolic steroids are considered an aid to performance, for their muscle-building tendencies, cocaine can be a hindrance, especially in technical events like the 400 hurdles.
"Cocaine can impair neurological function, and upset your stride pattern between the hurdles," said Bob Adams, a sports medicine physician, who was with the American squad in Sweden.
"Because of cocaine," said Harris's coach, Steve Lynn of Iowa State, "Danny probably lost a world record."
When the positive test was announced, Harris also lost his new home and his shoe contract. He was broke.
"It was devastating," he said. "But at the same time I felt relief. My secret was out. I did not have to protect it any longer."
Harris completed two drug rehabilitation programs in California and still attends counseling sessions regularly.
"I've been clean for a couple of years," he said. "Have I licked it? Cocaine is not something you lick. It's something you respect and are on guard about every day."

HEADLINE: University Admits Depriving Workers Paid as Contractors

BYLINE: By DAVID CAY JOHNSTON 

 BODY:
The Texas A & M University System admitted yesterday that it had illegally paid 400 farm laborers as independent contractors rather than as employees, cheating the Government out of about $86,000 in payroll taxes and depriving the workers of unemployment, disability and Social Security benefits.
The university decision was remarkable not only because a large institution publicly acknowledged its error and accepted responsibility, but also because it illustrated how organized labor and advocates for the poor can use existing laws to protect workers who are denied legally required benefits. 
 The Internal Revenue Service said that eight years ago it estimated that 3.7 million employees were illegally being paid as independent contractors, but that the number has ballooned since then following huge layoffs by corporations and Government agencies. The I.R.S. said it could not give a precise number because it has not had the funds to update its survey.
In recent months the I.R.S. -- with the aim of increasing Government revenues -- has intensified its audits of large employers, notably I.B.M. just last month, which make extensive use of contract workers. Often companies, after huge layoffs, have hired outside contractors to replace the laid-off workers, but in some cases the very workers who were discharged have been brought back as contractors.
House Republicans have been supporting a bill that would liberalize the use of independent contractors, and in June delegates to the White House Conference on Small Business voted worker classification laws those most in need of clarification.
The issue of contractor versus employee is a complex one under I.R.S. rules, but the essential test is whether the employer exercises control over the work. Companies often prefer to use contractors because not only do they save on taxes, which become the sole liability of the person hired, but also they are much freer to use people intermittently without having to pay severance or unemployment benefits. But when an employee is misclassified as an outside contractor, the employer may be liable for all the back taxes owed.
The Texas A & M infractions occurred in 1990-93, and were discovered by Texas Rural Legal Aid, an advocacy organization for the poor, which brought a class-action suit on behalf of Berene Murillo, a farm laborer in Plainview, Tex., and others.
The university then asked the I.R.S. to audit it to determine any tax liability. William J. Helwig, a lawyer for the university system, said the audit found illegally paid workers at 10 of the university system's 18 agricultural experiment stations, which grow crops and test farming techniques.
"We have instituted a system of management controls and audits" to prevent a recurrence, Mr. Helwig said.
Lawyers for the Texas Rural Legal Aid said the impact of the admission and settlement should extend beyond Texas and beyond farm laborers.
William H. Beardall, litigation director for Texas Rural Legal Aid, said, "We really expect that the example set by Texas A & M in admitting what it did was illegal, in taking remedial steps and its promised efforts to educate farmers will go farther in suppressing this practice than any other effort which has been undertaken in Texas or the nation."
Marc Grossman, a spokesman for the United Farm Workers of America, said he was pleased that an institution would acknowledge its errors, but said, "The practice is pervasive and widespread across the country despite what the law says." He added that the Government had "never done anything serious to stop this abuse."
The Texas A & M University system, which comprises eight campuses with 76,000 students and seven state agencies, including 18 Texas Agricultural Experiment Stations, held a joint news conference with the Texas Rural Legal Aid yesterday. The university promised to pay all back taxes, which it estimated at $86,000, to pay $120 to each affected worker and in the future to pay all farm laborers as employees.
"When one of the nation's largest educational institutions can fall into a practice that cheats ordinary workers out of their Social Security benefits," Mr. Beardall said, "it illustrates how widespread the problem is."
The system will also pay Texas Rural Legal Aid $30,000 to cover legal fees and spend $20,000 for advertisements in Spanish language newspapers to announce the settlement and advise laborers how to collect the $120 payments.
Bob Merrifield, deputy director of the Texas Agriculture Experiment Station, said the university system would also publish a pamphlet telling farmers that farm laborers must be paid as employees.
"Of course we acknowledge that mistakes were made," Mr. Merrifield said, "but there was never any overt attempt to defraud these workers. We have moved to correct these mistakes and implemented controls to insure that they do not re-occur."
Mrs. Murillo, the only named plaintiff, said at the news conference in Austin, the state Capitol, that she sought help from Texas Rural Legal Aid because the I.R.S. was demanding taxes, penalties and interest and she was denied jobless benefits.
"I have always hoed cotton and harvested vegetables," Mrs. Murillo, who is 55, said through an interpreter. "I am very proud of my work. But what really bothered me, angered me, was that my bosses never paid into my Social Security, because when I reach my old age and I won't be able to work, I won't have any way to support myself." With the settlement, she should be eligible for Social Security benefits.
In an interview later, Mrs. Murillo said: "I feel good about the settlement because now this won't happen to me or other people. It's good for all the workers, so they won't be treated as self-employed."
The lawsuit contended that the Agricultural Extension Service fraudulently paid Mrs. Murillo as an independent contractor to save 51 cents an hour in payroll taxes.
Mrs. Murillo, the suit said, should have been paid $3.80 an hour. Under Texas law, employers must pay the entire Social Security taxes for farm laborers, Kay E. Drought, a Texas Rural Legal Aid lawyer, said. Because she made so little money, Mrs. Murillo would have just 7 cents an hour deducted for Federal income taxes and should have netted $3.73 an hour.
But as an independent contractor, Mrs. Murillo would have been liable for the full amount of Social Security, which together with income taxes would have netted her $3.22 an hour.
From the employer's side, the agricultural extension service would have paid $3.80 in wages plus 51 cents in disability, unemployment and Social Security taxes for a total cost of $4.31 per hour.
Individuals like homeowners have no obligation to report payments to the I.R.S. when they hire an outside contractor like a plumber or electrician, because they could not deduct these payments. However, businesses, including institutions like Texas A & M, must report these payments on a Form 1099.
Gilbert Cardenas, a labor economist at University of Texas-Pan American in Edinburg, Tex., who studies farm workers, said the settlement "is a victory for the migrant farm workers because it's bringing the issue into the open and people are admitting mistakes."
"For the Texas A & M system, a particularly proud institution, to admit responsibility for errors and to move to correct those errors as humbly and contritely as they did in the press conference should be an example to other employers who violate the law," Mr. Beardall said.

HEADLINE: 3-Nation Effort Propels Dollar Sharply Higher

BYLINE: By KEITH BRADSHER 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Aug. 15

 BODY:
Moving with rare unity, the United States, Germany and Japan today sent the dollar soaring to its highest levels in nearly six months by buying more than a billion dollars in currency markets around the globe.
The Bank of Japan bought dollars for yen in Tokyo, the Bundesbank purchased dollars with marks in Frankfurt and the Federal Reserve Bank of New York spent yen and marks alike to buy dollars in New York. When it was all over, the dollar had risen 2.9 percent against the mark, to 1.4778 marks, and 3.5 percent against the yen, to 96.99 yen. 
 Coming on top of earlier gains this summer, the dollar has now recovered most of the losses it suffered against those currencies during its deep slump from January through April, when it briefly touched a low of 79.80 yen.
[The dollar continued to climb in Asian trading Wednesday, rising as high as 99.05 yen.]
A senior Treasury official in the United States said that today's intervention showed that the world's seven leading economic powers were successfully coordinating their currency policies. The finance ministers of those nations, known as the Group of Seven, announced in a communique after a meeting in April that they wanted an "orderly reversal" of the dollar's decline.
"What has happened since is a function of the agreement that all of the seven nations had when they sat around the table," said the senior Treasury official, who insisted on anonymity.
Yet international coordination is always easier when it means doing what countries already need to do for domestic reasons. Both Japan and Germany are struggling with stagnant economies, and driving down the value of their currencies will make their goods cheaper and easier to sell in foreign markets.
The United States and Japan tried repeatedly to brake the dollar's slide last winter, with little success. Several rounds of intervention this summer, coming after the dollar had begun to recover, have proved much more effective.
While American officials kept to their policy today of refusing to discuss where they want the dollar to go in the future, traders predicted today that the dollar could break through the psychologically important level of 100 yen to the dollar in the coming days or weeks. The dollar last traded at 100 yen in early January.
Today's intervention was notable not for its scale, but for the vigorous participation by the Bundesbank of Germany, which had previously played a secondary role or abstained. The new level of coordination, and a strategy of trying to ambush the market when it least expects it, has proved more effective in steering currency markets, where the daily volume of trading dwarfs the sums spent by governments in interventions.
Nor have currency interventions alone been responsible for the dollar's rise. The Japanese Government has made it easier for financial institutions there to take their money out of the country and buy dollars, while the strengthening American economy and rising financial markets have made the United States an attractive place to invest.
Still, the dollar remains well below its levels of even five years ago, when it was trading at around 160 yen, and even further below its peak in 1985, when central banks began large-scale efforts to drive the dollar down after it peaked at 263 yen.
When the dollar buys more yen, marks and other foreign currencies, then imported products, from Japanese cars to German beer, may become cheaper or rise in price less quickly than otherwise. In addition, many American tourists overseas find their vacations less expensive.
But the effects of currency shifts are often muffled, particularly for Americans buying foreign products, as companies tend to wait and see if the currency rates represent a genuine trend. That might be particularly true this time, because many foreign companies, notably Japanese car makers, never passed along to consumers the full cost of the dollar's fall earlier this year.
A few economists today questioned whether a strong dollar was in the interests of the United States. C. Fred Bergsten, the head of the Institute for International Economics here, predicted that the trade deficit, already headed for a record of as much as $180 billion this year, could widen to as much as $250 billion in a couple of years as the dollar rises.
Still, a stronger dollar does give the Federal Reserve more leeway to cut short-term interest rates, which stimulates the American economy but also makes short-term investments in the United States less attractive, thereby weakening demand for the dollar.
And American officials have long contended that the main problem is not the United States' trade deficit but rather Japan's trade surplus. And that surplus dropped sharply in July, the Japanese Government said today, as Japan's imports rose while exports to the United States fell for the first time in 32 months.
The greater Japanese demand for foreign goods means that Japanese companies have more need of dollars and other foreign currencies, which caused the dollar to begin rising today.
In a slight departure from usual practice, Bundesbank officials were the first to announce today that interventions were under way. In the past, they have preferred to confirm their participation in international interventions already announced by other central banks.
Adding to the effectiveness of today's intervention was the fact that many senior Wall Street executives and wealthy speculators were vacationing away from their computer terminals, so there were few traders around with the authority to place large bets against the success of the central bankers' effort.
Swiss officials announced today that their central bank had also intervened in currency markets, buying dollars with Swiss francs. But international monetary officials said the Swiss had acted on their own.

Dollar Up in Tokyo
 TOKYO, Wednesday Aug. 16 (By Bloomberg Business News) -- The dollar rose above 99 yen for the first time in six months in trading today, bolstered by expectations that central banks would continue to buy dollars.
The dollar rose as high as 99.05 yen -- its highest level since Feb. 10 -- before retreating to 98.40 yen in afternoon trading. The dollar was trading at 1.4873 marks.
The retreat in the yen, whose strength has hampered efforts to revive the Japanese economy, accelerated a rally on the Tokyo Stock Exchange. The Nikkei index of 225 issues closed up 706.01 points, or 4.05 percent, at 18,158.73. On Monday, the Nikkei rose 536.15 points, or 3.17 percent.

HEADLINE: Compaq Cuts Its PC Prices In Effort to Widen Its Lead

BYLINE: By LAURENCE ZUCKERMAN 

 BODY:
In the opening gambit of what is expected to be a fierce competition among personal-computer manufacturers, the Compaq Computer Corporation reduced prices yesterday on its line of office and home computers by as much as 25 percent.
Compaq also introduced several new models featuring the Intel Corporation's most powerful Pentium microprocessor and said that it would offer more storage capacity on its commercial machines to make room for the new Windows 95 operating system and the heftier new application programs that run on it.
 Price cuts are not unusual this time of year in the personal computer industry, as manufacturers try to reduce inventory to make room for their new fall lines. Apple Computer recently lowered its prices, and most other Compaq rivals are expected to announce their own price cuts within days. 
 But competition is growing fiercer by the month, new products are being introduced and prices are being cut at an increasingly rapid pace, squeezing profits.
Overshadowed lately by aggressive newcomers like the Hewlett-Packard Company and Packard Bell Electronics Inc., Compaq, which is the world's biggest seller of PC's, set out to reclaim its image as the industry's leader.
"The objective here is real straightforward," said Ross Cooley, Compaq's senior vice president and general manager for North America. "We intend to widen our lead over the No. 2 market share leader, wherever they are in the world."
Compaq first started its rise to the top of the industry by sharply cutting prices in 1992. The move effectively eliminated the price difference that had existed between high-end brands like Compaq and I.B.M. and less well-known discount machines. That set the stage for Compaq, with its up-to-date manufacturing and strong management to gain market share. Last year, the company surpassed I.B.M., No. 1 in sales.
Since then, other companies have followed in Compaq's footsteps, challenging the company on both price and features, while Intel has aggressively lowered the cost of its microprocessors, the electronic brains inside personal computers.
Hewlett-Packard, the $25 billion computer giant based in Palo Alto, Calif., has been the most aggressive new challenger. In the last 18 months, it has risen to become the sixth-largest seller of PC's worldwide. Earlier this week, the company introduced a new line of home computers.
The competition has driven many companies to introduce new models as soon as new technology becomes available. "The pace appears to be moving faster and faster," said Richard Zwetchkenbaum, an analyst at the International Data Corporation, a market research firm in Framingham, Mass. "There is no end to it."
Nowhere is this more true than in the market for home computers, where Packard Bell, the privately held company based in Sacramento, Calif., has become the leader. Several top manufacturers, including Compaq, will introduce two lines of home computers, one in late summer and the other in early fall. The fall models will be equipped with more advanced telephone and multimedia features.
By refusing to be undercut by its competitors, Compaq makes life even more difficult for already struggling rivals such as AST Research Inc., AT&T Global Information Solutions, a unit of the AT&T Corporation, and the Digital Equipment Corporation. Without a large volume of sales, those companies do not have the advantage of economies of scale to boost profits.
But lower prices hurt Compaq as well. "It isn't a margin enhancer," Mr. Cooley acknowledged, speaking of the latest round of cuts. As a result of yesterday's announcement, Eugene Glazer, an analyst at Dean Witter Reynolds Inc., cut his estimate of Compaq's third-quarter earnings to 83 cents a share from 93 cents.
Compaq stock closed yesterday at $53.625 a share, down 50 cents on the New York Stock Exchange.
In its announcement, the company said that it would now charge $1,599 for a 75-megahertz Pentium machine with 8 megabytes of memory and 630 megabytes of storage space compared with $1,650 and $1,799 currently charged by the Dell Computer Corporation and Hewlett-Packard for similarly configured machines with less storage capacity.
Compaq's 75-megahertz Presario home computer with 725 megabytes of storage would be reduced 18 percent, to $1,799 from $2,199.

HEADLINE: INTERNATIONAL BUSINESS;
Treasury Chief Says Strong Dollar Isn't a Threat to Trade

BYLINE: By KEITH BRADSHER 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Aug. 16

 BODY:
As the dollar continued its climb today, Treasury Secretary Robert E. Rubin said that the Government was committed to maintaining a strong dollar and did not see it as a threat to the ability of American business to compete abroad.
In an interview, Mr. Rubin gave no hint of what level he wanted to see the dollar maintain in the future. But the overall tone of his remarks -- one of the clearest reviews of American currency policy since he took office in January -- suggested satisfaction with the dollar's recovery this summer from its plunge in the spring. 
 Mr. Rubin's remarks came the day after the central banks in the United States, Japan and Germany intervened together to push the dollar to a level it had not seen in almost six months. The dollar, which had hit a low of 79.75 Japanese yen on April 19, jumped 3.5 percent against the yen and 2.9 percent against the German mark on Tuesday, and rose slightly today to close at 97.93 yen and 1.48 marks.
[In Tokyo, the dollar was little changed Thursday afternoon, trading at 98.08 yen and 1.4768 marks.]
The vigorous intervention on Tuesday had led some economists to question whether the Clinton Administration, and Mr. Rubin in particular, was running the risk of helping to push the dollar so high that it might begin to choke off American exports. A stronger dollar, while enhancing the international buying power of Americans and helping to curb inflation, also tends to make American goods more expensive for foreigners.
When asked about these concerns today, Mr. Rubin responded with a carefully couched but forceful defense of his currency policy.
"If you talk to people who run businesses in this country today, and I do, I don't think there is much question that we are competitive in most industries today," Mr. Rubin said over a lunch of turkey salad, carrot sticks and fruit salad in his private dining room overlooking the White House. "I think it is the height of unsound policy to devalue yourself into competitiveness."
Private economists have estimated that virtually all American industries can offer lower prices than their Japanese rivals in international markets with the dollar at 85 yen and that most would retain an edge even at 100 yen to the dollar.
While Mr. Rubin did not say anything that appeared calculated to startle or move currency markets -- Treasury secretaries have historically favored a strong dollar -- he still provided his most detailed explanation yet of why he believes a strong dollar is in the nation's best interest. Beginning when the dollar was plunging against the yen and the mark in the spring, Mr. Rubin has repeatedly said that he supported a strong dollar but was cautious about outlining his reasons.
Mr. Rubin, who once traded currencies on Wall Street at Goldman, Sachs & Company, has noted before that Government intervention in currency markets depends on good timing. Fighting a powerful market trend is usually fruitless, but a well-timed intervention can be highly effective in reinforcing a trend. And that seems to be exactly the strategy the Administration has pursued.
The stronger dollar has made Treasury officials more willing to discuss their actions; one senior official held a telephone conference call with several reporters Tuesday soon after the intervention.
In defending the stronger dollar against those economists who contend that it will widen the American trade deficit, Mr. Rubin was careful today to avoid language that would give any explicit signal of how high he thought the dollar should be.
Mr. Rubin also repeated his calls for Congress to raise the ceiling on the Federal debt and to pass resolutions allowing current Federal spending to continue while Congress and the White House resolve their dispute over budget policy. While there is no risk that the United States will have trouble paying its debts, he said, even the appearance that the Government is running out of money could affect the value of the dollar.
The value of the dollar must be protected to safeguard the buying power of Americans, Mr. Rubin said. A strong dollar makes imported goods less expensive in the United States, and also puts pressure on American producers of comparable goods to refrain from inflationary price increases, Mr. Rubin said.
"It means our terms of trade are better, which means that American consumers are able to consume less expensively," he said.
By limiting inflation, the stronger dollar also tends to reassure financial markets and hold down interest rates, Mr. Rubin added. Investors in Treasury bonds and other financial instruments that pay fixed sums of money at regular intervals tend to demand higher interest rates when inflation threatens to erode the value of their holdings.
"It takes pressure off interest rates in this country because if the dollar is strong, there will be less concern; inflation will be less of a concern," he said.
Mr. Rubin went out of his way to point out that he was not talking about the short-term interest rates set by the Federal Reserve. The Administration, and Mr. Rubin in particular, has a policy of not commenting on Fed monetary policy.
A strong dollar is also needed to insure that central banks continue to hold large sums of dollars as part of their foreign exchange reserves, he said. Moreover, it also helps insure that the United States can continue to finance its budget deficits by selling bonds denominated in dollars, Mr. Rubin said. The Carter Administration sold bonds denominated in Swiss francs and German marks in the late 1970's when the falling dollar made it hard to persuade foreigners to buy American bonds.
As long as the dollar is strong, business transactions of all types, notably for oil, will continue to be done in dollars, Mr. Rubin said. While Mr. Rubin did not elaborate, many economists have noted over the years that if oil had been priced in other currencies, as the ministers of some oil-producing countries have periodically threatened to do, then the price of oil in the United States would have risen steeply in recent years as the dollar lost value.
Taken together, Mr. Rubin said of the points he had raised, "These are good, hard reasons that relate to the welfare of the American people."
Mr. Rubin dismissed the suggestion made on Tuesday by C. Fred Bergsten, a Treasury official in the Carter Administration and now the director of the Institute for International Economics here, that the Administration might be pursuing political gain by seeking a strong dollar.
"The decisions that we have made with respect to our views on the dollar, and anything that we have done with respect to the dollar, are motivated entirely, 100 percent, by what we think is best for the economy of this country, and zero, or no percent, by any political considerations," Mr. Rubin said.

HEADLINE: Hurricane Stalls in the Atlantic, Pounding 1,000 Miles of Beaches

BYLINE: By MICHAEL JANOFSKY 

DATELINE: VIRGINIA BEACH, Va., Aug. 16

 BODY:
Hurricane Felix hovered more than 150 miles off the Atlantic coast this evening, its ponderous progress toward the shore nearly stalled as it churned a vast sweep of the ocean like a giant eggbeater. But in seaside communities from Florida to New England, mountainous surf from the distant storm was already wracking up a growing toll of damage.
In Sandbridge, an affluent seafront community here, clawing surf since Sunday has shredded sections of the metal sea wall built seven years ago to hold back the tide, leaving steel ribbing twisted like a kite that had been battered by the wind. In several places, the surging seas have already breached coastal defenses, tearing wooden decks from ocean-view homes and flooding roads. 
 By most estimates, the storm, whose winds slowed to 75 miles an hour, or barely hurricane strength, will not make landfall until sometime Thursday. Officials said the storm was nearly stationary for six hours this evening. For many here, the greater fear is not when or where Felix will storm ashore, but rather how long it will continue to meander somewhere off the coast, relentlessly grinding away at beaches and shore-front resorts along more than 1,000 miles of coastline.
David Basco, a professor of civil engineering who has studied beach erosion in Sandbridge for five years, said he was stunned by the force of the water at high tide today.
"For this early in the storm, and for a storm that far away, there was a lot of water over the wall," said Mr. Basco, director of the Coastal Engineering Center at Old Dominion University in Norfolk, Va.
With the water surge expected to reach as high as five feet when the storm peaks, a record level for the Virginia Beach area, he also said he was not sure how many homes on the ocean -- with or without a sea wall -- and in the low-lying areas beyond could withstand relentless pounding. "This one will be quite devastating on the dunes," he said, "and most of the people without walls will get a pretty good hit. They are not designed for such a big storm."
His assessment echoed a survey this week by the Virginia Beach Fire Department, which predicted that at least 40 houses along the ocean in Sandbridge "could fall like a zipper opening up from the weak and missing sections" of the sea wall.
"This one will not do the spectacular damage to buildings that Andrew did," said Orrin H. Pilkey, a professor of geology at Duke University who studies shoreline erosion, referring to the devastating hurricane of 1992 that caused a record $30 billion in damages mostly in South Florida.
"But this is hitting early in the hurricane season," he said, "and that is going to set up many beaches for more damage from storms through the rest of the season, leaving them naked and unprotected."
As a Category 1 hurricane, the tamest rank given by the National Hurricane Center in Miami, Felix is far weaker than most of the hurricanes that have battered the East Coast in recent years, including Andrew, Emily in 1993 and Gloria in 1985.
But experts say Felix is covering a staggering amount of territory, -- almost 107,000 square miles These circumstances make it distinctive in its own right, working like an oceanic eggbeater to churn wind and waters toward shorelines for a longer period of time than most hurricanes. The effects of Felix are expected to linger over some beach areas for as long as 30 hours.
Most other hurricanes have traveled straighter, swifter paths.
"This one is not crossing the shoreline quickly, the way Hugo did in 1989," Mr. Pilkey said. "It's just standing out there, pounding, pounding, pounding, pounding. I expect replenished beaches to take a big hit. They are more unstable than other beaches."
Replenished beaches are those where sand has been added to fortify an eroding coast line. Mr. Pilkey cited Monmouth, N.J., Ocean City N.J., Ocean City, Md., Virginia Beach and Wrightsville Beach, N.C. among areas that could expect significant beach erosion as a result of Felix's loitering -- not to mention the economic losses of vacationers evacuating for safer ground.
John S. Bone, the executive director of the Outer Banks Chamber of Commerce in North Carolina, said local businesses were losing $4.5 million a day this week in rent, lodging and retail sales. "It's devastating economically already," he said, "and it hasn't even hit yet."
For residents of Sandbridge, at the south end of Virginia Beach, if problems of beach erosion are decreasing it is only because there is not much beach left to erode. Some of the homes are still protected by metal sea wall bulkheads, which are illegal in some states, like North Carolina, South Carolina and Maine.
But the surf has ripped away sea walls in many spots and eaten away much of the beach in front of homes, whether the sea walls stand or not.
Janet Peterson, a 49-year-old high school English teacher, was planning to evacuate this afternoon, to join friends inland. She said when she bought her house in 1985, it faced 100 yards of beach. Almost none of it remains, and noting the unusually ferocity of the surf today, she said she would not be surprised if Felix claims her part of the wall.
"When I bought this house, I had a beautiful free-standing deck over the back. That washed away in '87," she said. "Now, we've got less buffer than ever before.
Dr. Steven W. Lyons, a meteorologist with the National Hurricane Center in Miami predicted the possibility of a "long scouring of the beach area."
But that much force could jeopardize much more than ocean-front properties, he said, threatening many inland areas so well.
"This isn't the catastrophic type, where a large number of people drown from a huge storm surge or a huge number of buildings are leveled," Dr. Lyons said. "But it's still going to be nasty. The wind will have more time to loose and break things, and flooding can be a major disaster with storms that stall."

HEADLINE: Low Interest Rates Reviving Housing Starts, U.S. Finds

BYLINE: By ROBERT D. HERSHEY Jr. 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Aug. 16

 BODY:
Though falling interest rates have done little to perk up car sales this summer, they are reviving the housing industry, figures released by the Commerce Department showed today.
In a surprisingly robust performance, the nation's builders broke ground for homes in July at the fastest clip so far this year, a 1.38 million annual pace that represented the biggest monthly surge in 16 months. 
 As a result, analysts said, the Federal Reserve seemed likely to defer any further cuts in interest rates.
"Housing's starting to do pretty well," said Robert Van Order, chief economist for the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation. "When rates drop from over 9 percent to under 8, you get some kick from it."
The 6.7 percent jump in housing starts last month was the fourth advance in a row. The results were even more impressive because the department revised upward the totals for both June and May.
"This is really a very strong gain," said Robert R. Davis of America's Community Bankers, a trade group for savings institutions. Such strength, mirrored in a 5.3 percent jump in permits issued for construction, further diminished chances that the Federal Reserve would further ease monetary policy at a meeting of its Open Market Committee next Tuesday, analysts suggested.
"This pretty much guarantees that there will be no change in policy," said Paul L. Kasriel, chief domestic economist at the Northern Trust Company in Chicago.
On Monday, Alan S. Blinder, the Fed's vice chairman and an official somewhat more inclined toward lower interest rates than most colleagues, indicated reluctance to seek a reduction now.
But while the housing rebound embraced both single-family homes and multi-unit dwellings last month, the report was somewhat marred because the strength was highly concentrated in the South, which has long accounted for more than 40 percent of the new-home market.
Starts in the South soared 15.5 percent, to a 656,000 annual pace, or 47.5 percent of the total, while the West managed only a 2.2 percent rise, the department found. And starts actually declined 4.8 percent in the Northeast, where activity is lowest, and fell seven-tenths of 1 percent in the Midwest.
But David F. Seiders, economist for the National Association of Home Builders, said he was not much disturbed by this. He noted that the South contained some of the fastest-growing markets and said he had to believe that the Northeast was stronger than the figures, which are subject to significant revision, showed.
Mr. Seiders also cited the latest tabulation of the association's housing index, compiled from a survey of builders about their model-home traffic, their current sales and their expectations for the next six months. The index climbed another two points in August, to 53, its fourth straight advance from April's low reading of 38.
"Builders feel pretty comfortable with the inventory level" of unsold homes, Mr. Seiders said.
The revision in June starts lifted the pace to 1,293,000 from an initially estimated 1,263,000, while May starts are now put at 1,282,000, up from 1,264,000, the department's report showed.
The actual number of homes started last month, with no adjustment for seasonality, was 125,000 -- 1.1 percent above the June level but 2.2 percent below that of July 1994.
Permits, the report also showed, were at a pace of 1,343,000 in July as all regions except the Northeast showed increases.
Shipments of mobile homes, reported with a one-month lag, ran at a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 329,000 in June, unchanged from the May pace but 11.5 percent above that of June 1994.

HEADLINE: 2 Sides Nearing Agreement on Water Pollution, Pataki Says

BYLINE: By ANDREW C. REVKIN 

 BODY:
Four months into an effort by Gov. George E. Pataki's office to broker peace talks between New York City and the upstate communities whose streets, waste-water plants and cow pastures drain into the city's 19 reservoirs, the Governor said yesterday that "conceptual agreement" had been reached on many aspects of a plan to cut pollution of the city's drinking-water supply.
Drafting of a detailed written agreement could begin by Sept. 1, Mr. Pataki said in a written statement. Such an agreement would help the city avert a Federal order to build a $6 billion filtration plant. 
 Federal environmental officials said they were optimistic about a resolution of the long-festering dispute.
"The talks have been surprisingly positive," said Richard L. Caspe (pronounced KAS-pee), director of the regional water-quality division of the Federal Environmental Protection Agency, which will ultimately rule on the workability of New York City's plan to keep its water clean without filtration. The Federal agency grudgingly agreed last spring to push back its deadline for a filtration-avoidance plan until Sept. 15.
Mr. Caspe said the negotiators had reached agreement on many aspects of what he called "about 20 blockbuster items." He said he was prevented from discussing details by the ground rules of the meetings, but added that the closed nature of the talks had helped break major impasses.
"Progress to date has been a function of the frank, freewheeling nature of these discussions," he said, adding, "There hasn't been the fear that what I say today will wind up in the paper tomorrow."
The state has been in a position of power throughout the talks because state environmental and health officials must approve key provisions of the plan.
But all along, the challege for Mr. Pataki has been to balance the frustrations of upstate communities, which are the heart of his political base, with the needs of New York City, whose economic engine largely propels the state economy, officials in the Governor's office said.
The talks have been focused on three main areas, Mr. Caspe said. One is New York City's proposed revisions to its watershed regulations, which have had the force of state law since 1909 but have not been updated since 1953.
Another is a proposal by New York City to invest millions of dollars in the watershed towns to help them find ways to grow without further degrading water quality. The city is also being called on to honor past promises to maintain certain roads and bridges within the watersheds.
The third, and perhaps most contentious, topic, has been New York City's plan to buy up to 80,000 acres of land around its reservoirs to act as a pollution filter. Several participants in the talks said this is one of the issues that is closest to resolution.
Marc Moran, a senior assistant to the Westchester County Executive, Andrew P. O'Rourke, said that the land-purchase debate has been particularly complicated because Westchester, eager to preserve open space, has supported the city purchases, while towns west of the Hudson River have opposed them. The Coalition of Watershed Towns, representing dozens of communities in the Catskills, had been demanding the right to veto any land purchase.
Hopes of a comprehensive deal could still easily founder on efforts to work out the fine print, various participants said. Despite progress in some areas, said Jeffrey S. Baker, a lawyer for the Coalition of Watershed Towns, "We're going to need agreement on all of them to make any of them fly."

HEADLINE: Dr. Robert Hoppock, 93, Pioneer In Field of Vocational Guidance

BYLINE: By ROBERT McG. THOMAS Jr. 

 BODY:
Dr. Robert Hoppock, who had such a tough time finding his niche in life that he devoted his career to making it easier for others to find theirs, died on Aug. 5 at a nursing home in Vista, Calif. As the first professor of counselor education at New York University, he is widely regarded as a pioneer in the field.
Dr. Hoppock was 93. His daughter announced his death this week. 
 Trained guidance counselors are such a staple at high schools and colleges that it is easy to forget they are a comparatively new feature of the education landscape.
When Dr. Hoppock was growing up, they simply did not exist, not at his high school in Lambertville, N.J., or even at Wesleyan University, from which he obtained a degree in economics with no notion of what to do with it.
Among other things, he once recalled, there was no "Directory of Occupational Titles" and no "Occupational Outlook Handbook," voids he eventually helped fill through his own extensive research and voluminous writings, including the books "Job Satisfaction," and "Occupational Information."
In his own quest for a career, Dr. Hoppock was given so much bad advice, followed so many false leads and worked at so many jobs he loathed that when he finally stumbled onto something he enjoyed -- teaching -- and discovered the embryonic field of vocational guidance, he vowed to make it his life's work.
As he put it in a 1967 essay, "I decided that if other people had as much trouble as I had in learning what occupations were open to them, maybe there would be a place in the world for someone to make it a little easier for future generations to get this kind of information."
The field was so new and so undeveloped that when he finally got a job in 1927 teaching a ninth-grade course called vocational guidance in Rahway, N.J., he organized the New Jersey Vocational Guidance Association to provide a semblance of professionalism.
His work with the association led to a job as assistant to the director of the Carnegie Corporation's National Occupation Conference, an organization whose pioneering work in studying and forecasting employment trends in the 1930's has been largely taken over by the Bureau of Labor Statistics.
Dr. Hoppock, who received a master's degree in educational psychology and a doctorate in educational research from Columbia, became a major figure in the study of occupations.
It is a measure of his precocious social thinking that in 1937, a generation before Betty Friedan, he made headlines by observing: "There is no sound psychological reason why women should cook meals, wash dishes, launder clothes and clean house."
After helping to organize the N.Y.U. department of guidance in 1939 and becoming its first chairman, he made headlines again when he took his counselors-in-training on field trips to offices and factories so they could learn about the world of work firsthand.
Dr. Hoppock was a consultant to the Department of Labor and the United States Office of Education, as well as to major corporations and several state education departments and the school system in Manhasset, L.I., where he lived for 50 years.
He retired in 1972.
He is survived by a daughter, Margaret Joan Bedell, of Vista, and three grandchildren.

HEADLINE: Alchemist's Dream Come True

BYLINE: By BARNABY J. FEDER 

DATELINE: WEST LAFAYETTE, Ind.

 BODY:
When the Great Lakes Chemical Corporation bought control of the world's biggest maker of lead additives for gasoline six years ago, the product itself was almost an afterthought.
After all, leaded gasoline was banned in Japan, it was in the last stages of being phased out in the United States and it was scheduled for elimination from Western Europe. The lead content of gasoline was under attack all over the world not only because it fouls the catalytic converters that reduce pollutants in car exhaust, but also because it is suspected of contributing to brain damage in children and other ailments. 
 What Great Lakes really wanted from Octel Associates was the British company's capacity to produce bromine, a chemical that Octel used to make the additives but that Great Lakes sells in other products ranging from fire retardants to color stabilizers. To get the bromine, Great Lakes was willing to take on the last years of the production of lead additives -- as well as an ethical, and public relations, challenge.
It is a problem faced by many industries, including tobacco and asbestos producers and agrichemical and drug companies: under what conditions should legal products that are being phased out of the developed world to protect people's health or the earth's environment be sold to poorer nations?
For Great Lakes, that question has hung around longer and become more important to the company's image than it had anticipated. Far from petering out, demand for leaded gasoline, while shrinking, has remained far stronger than anyone predicted, especially in the third world. Meanwhile, every other major producer has stopped making the additives, known as tetraethyl lead, or TEL. That has left Great Lakes with an unexpected flood of profits and 90 percent of a market that no one else will enter because of the environmental problems associated with lead and the huge capital costs of building a new plant.
So far, Great Lakes has been able to deflect most critics by arguing that there are sound environmental and economic reasons for continuing to produce TEL. Meanwhile, the Octel cash cow has bankrolled a huge expansion that shows no sign of ending soon. Indeed, Great Lakes told Wall Street analysts early this year that it expects to more than double its size by the year 2000, to $5 billion in annual revenue, and to maintain healthy 15 percent operating profit margins while doing it.
"Octel was a good financial surprise," said David A. Hall, the senior vice president who oversees its operations for Great Lakes.
The latest indicator of just how good: Standard & Poor's this month raised its credit rating for Great Lakes to AA- from A+.
Wall Street had grown used to pleasant surprises during the years Great Lakes was led by the charismatic Emerson Kampen, who died this summer. The company grew from a chemical pipsqueak with $50 million in revenues when Mr. Kampen became chief executive in 1977 to a multinational with $1.8 billion in sales when health problems forced him to step aside in late 1993.
It was Mr. Kampen who in 1958 discovered the huge bromine-rich brine deposits in southern Arkansas that vaulted Great Lakes into the forefront of the bromine business, which had once been dominated by giants like Dow Chemical. The company processes bromine into a huge variety of industrial and consumer products. Its bromine compounds, for example, dominate the $600 million market for chemical additives that retard fires in plastics and textiles.
Mr. Kampen viewed Octel's unique process for extracting bromine from sea water in Wales as a beachhead for Great Lakes' further expansion into Europe. Those plans were quickly put on hold, though, when Great Lakes discovered the size of the TEL gold mine it was sitting on.
Octel has accounted for well over half Great Lakes' total operating profit every year even as its share of sales has declined. Last year, the contribution came to $259 million, or 59 percent, of Great Lakes' total operating profit of $439 million. In a recent research report, Mark Gulley of Morgan Stanley projected that Octel's share of profits from current operations would not fall below 50 percent before the turn of the century, despite an 8 percent annual decline in pounds of TEL sold.
The job of exploiting those profits to continue Great Lakes' growth record is now the primary challenge for Mr. Kampen's successor as chief executive, Robert B. McDonald.
The 58-year-old Mr. McDonald endorses Mr. Kampen's strategy of using a big chunk of Octel's profits for acquisitions. Some $375 million has been spent on 15 deals since 1989, including $90 million early last year to purchase an Italian producer of ultraviolet light-absorbing plastic additives. In 1993, about $72 million went to four acquisitions for Great Lakes' fast-growing water-treatment business.
"We are being treated as a vehicle to intelligently reinvest cash flow," said Marshall E. Bloom, chief executive of Bio-Lab Inc., a Decatur, Ga., subsidiary that makes recreational and industrial water-treatment chemicals.
Some of the diversification is within Octel itself, which now gets about 15 percent of its revenues from non-TEL additives.
The availability of so much cash is also a morale booster for Great Lakes executives. "It's a fun place for managers to work because of the cash flow," Mr. Gulley said. "Managers have a rich uncle to fund growth in their groups while their competitors have to self-finance."
Shareholders are also getting their due. The company has spent $386 million on stock repurchases since April of last year, helping to calm Wall Street's jitters about the management transition and a slowdown in earnings growth that largely reflected heavier-than-normal capital investments in existing businesses. After falling by a third from a peak of nearly $75 in late 1993, the price has climbed back to $67.
So far, Great Lakes has capitalized on Octel without running into much flak from environmentalists. That probably is due in part to its much lower profile as an industrial middleman than Octel's former owners, a consortium of oil companies including such giants as the British Petroleum Company, Texaco Inc., Mobil Inc. and the Royal Dutch/Shell Group. The last major oil company partner, Chevron, owns a 12 percent stake that Great Lakes hopes to buy soon.
But Great Lakes is also working hard to avoid confrontations. Unlike tobacco companies, Great Lakes readily concedes that its biggest profit spinner can be harmful and ought to disappear eventually. But it argues that calls by some environmental groups for a world-wide TEL ban as early as the end of the century are unrealistic. To start with, Great Lakes says, there are too few refineries equipped to produce unleaded gas and too many cars outside the industrialized world without catalytic converters.
Great Lakes argues that such cars get fewer miles per gallon and spew out increased amounts of cancer-causing pollutants like benzene if forced to run on lower-octane unleaded gasoline. Thus, leaded fuel may be an "economic and environmental bargain" in many developing countries for years to come, according to Mr. Hall, the senior vice president in charge of Octel.
Some critics, like Dr. Joel Schwartz, a former Environmental Protection Agency official who is now a professor at the Harvard University School of Public Health, argue that Great Lakes and the oil refiners who use TEL underestimate its environmental impact. And the Alliance to End Childhood Lead Poisoning, a Washington-based group that sponsored an international conference on leaded gasoline last May, says Octel's suggestions that burning unleaded fuel may create even worse problems amount to a "disinformation campaign."
Such accusations are ignored on Wall Street, where Great Lakes is seen as one of the chemical industry's environmental white hats. Many of its products are substitutes for more noxious chemicals made by others; its largest nonbromine business recycles agricultural wastes into a metal processing chemical.
But business ethics experts say that the biggest problem for a compnay like Great Lakes is that it faces overwhelming incentives to delude itself when it comes to handling a product like TEL. Thomas Donaldson, a professor of ethics at Georgetown University, said making sure that customers using hazardous products were fully informed about the consequences was the "bare minimum" of ethical corporate behavior. Both he and Dr. Schwartz made the point that technically backward third world countries that are overwhelmed with economic and environmental problems are unlikely to be able to make sophisticated judgments about something as arcane as leaded gas, especially when the refineries are often in the hands of governments or ruling elites whose financial incentives are to stay with the status quo.
Mr. Donaldson said Great Lakes should consider contributing some of Octel's profits toward subsidizing a more rapid transition away from tetraethyl lead. The model for such an action, he said, would be the substantial payments infant formula producers have made to programs promoting breast feeding as preferable to formula.

U.S. Bond Prices Recover After Losses Early in Day

BYLINE: By ROBERT HURTADO 

 BODY:
Prices of Treasury securities rose slightly yesterday as traders continued debating the prospects of an interest rate cut at next week's meeting of the policy-making panel of the Federal Reserve. Supply concerns lessened when the Treasury left unchanged the size of its auctions of two-year and five-year notes.
Bonds rebounded from early losses as the Fed tried to do some damage control regarding a Dow Jones news service report Tuesday that suggested that the Fed's vice chairman, Alan S. Blinder, would oppose cutting interest rates until the economy showed further signs of weakness. 
 The Fed's spokesman, Joe Coyne, said, "The quote used to back up the lead in the story was taken out of context." News that the Fed was taking issue with the report of Mr. Blinder's stance helped pare early losses in the 30-year bond, which had sagged after the data on housing construction in July showed more activity than had been expected.
The market, which had been nervous for days about the supply of Government debt and had been bracing for the Treasury's note sales next week, was relieved yesterday when the Treasury did not raise the amounts of the two-year and five-year auctions. It left the auctions at $17.75 billion of two-year notes and $11.5 billion of five-year notes.
Tony Crescenzi, head of government bond trading at Miller, Tabak, Hirsch & Company, a New York brokerage firm, said the early losses in bonds were pared further as talk emerged that the Fed was in the market buying short-term intermediate securities.
Looking ahead, the Fed's monetary policy panel, the Federal Open Market Committee, will meet on Tuesday to consider another cut in the Federal funds rate. The Fed cut the rate on July 6, the first easing in three years. Although most analysts do not expect another rate reduction, some say the possibility cannot be ruled out.
The 30-year bond rose 4/32 , to a price of 9931/32 , for a yield of 6.88 percent, down from 6.89 percent on Tuesday.
Bondholders initially took to the exits yesterday morning when the Commerce Department reported that houses were built at an annual rate of 1.38 million in July, up 6.7 percent from June. The general expectation among economists had been for an increase of slightly more than 3 percent.
"The revival of the housing sector indicates that consumer spending is likely to increase steadily in the second half of the year," said Ken McCarthy, founder of the Economic Intelligence Corporation, a market research and analysis firm. "Housing tends to lead consumer spending upward and has a huge multiplier. Stronger growth in consumer spending means more solid overall economic growth. This is the strongest evidence yet that the second half will be significantly stronger than the first half, with growth averaging 3 percent."
"The economy has revived nicely," he added, "and inflation is under control. What does this mean for the Fed? The Fed will wait before easing again late this year to make certain that growth continues along the 2.5 percent to 3 percent trend."
Elliott Platt, director of research at Donaldson, Lufkin & Jenrette, said, "The strength in the housing starts provides yet another reason not to cut rates at this time."
Still the market overcame the effects of the housing data yesterday and managed to close on an uptick. Discussing the reasons, Doug Burtnick, senior fixed-income analyst for Technical Data in Boston, said, "Institutional investors have a little more cash sitting around, and they're willing to put it to work." He added that the market benefited from the fact that the Treasury securities from last week's refunding had been mostly distributed.
Municipal bond yields were little changed as some investors sought out shorter maturities. Some dealers said that a lack of new investment money in municipal bond funds was affecting the market. If the funds are not growing, there are few reasons to buy, some fund managers said.
In one of the day's biggest offerings, Austin, Tex., sold $387 million in airport revenue bonds yesterday through a negotiated offering led by the Smith Barney Inc. unit of Travelers Inc. The bonds, which for some investors are subject to the Federal alternative minimum tax, are insured by the Municipal Bond Investors Assurance Corporation and are rated triple-A.
Underwriters priced the issue to yield a maximum 6.45 percent for a bond due in 2020; shorter-maturity issues were priced to yield from 5 percent in 2001 to 6.15 percent in 2011. Other longer-term bonds were offered at prices to yield 6.36 percent in 2015 and 6.43 percent in 2025.

A Capitalist Fantasy

BYLINE: By MAUREEN DOWD 

 BODY:
I step out of a silver Rolls-Royce, dripping in Harry Winston, teetering on Manolo Blahniks, sipping a 1988 Roederer Cristal from a Tiffany flute. I have come to Istanbul on the Orient Express in search of the perfect kilim. At the bazaar I inform Hasan, the tall, mustachioed carpet dealer, "Price is no object" . . .
The ringing phone snaps me back to reality. I am in my New York office, surrounded by a clutter of Maalox, Advil, Seldane, fat-free pretzels and three-month-old American Express bills. In my lap is a copy of Forbes FYI, the sleek supplement to Forbes magazine that tells the well heeled where to play and shop, where to find the best salmon-fishing camp in British Columbia ($3,462 a week), the best sterling silver shaving brush ($300) and the best library globe ($40,000). 
 You can easily imagine a layout in Forbes FYI on the ultimate grand tour for billionaires sated with the opera in Verona and quail-hunting in Florida: a thrill-packed jaunt to Iowa and New Hampshire that could be had for as little as $25 million.
Almost everyone seems to agree that Malcolm S. Forbes Jr., the 48-year-old head of the Forbes media empire, is loopy for thinking about pouring his own millions into a bid for the Republican nomination. He's Walter Mitty with a platinum card. And why not? The Presidency is the perfect gift for a man who has everything.
His late father, Malcolm Sr., owned the adjective "flamboyant" for years. He lived his magazine's motto, "Capitalist Tool," with his 151-foot yacht, his 68 motorcycles, his collection of Faberge eggs, his coast-to-coast hot-air ballooning trips and his friendship with Elizabeth Taylor. Besides the palace in Tangier -- he flew in 1,000 guests for his $2 million 70th birthday party there -- he had a chateau in Normandy and an island in Fiji.
Though Steve Forbes, as the eldest son is known, seemed far more sedate than his dad, it turns out that his shy Mittyesque exterior hides a wacky streak.
I went down to Mr. Forbes's Greenwich Village office to ask him about his notion of becoming a kinder, gentler Ross Perot, a man who treats himself to a Presidential race and pushes business experience rather than political experience. Unlike the Texas computer mogul, the New York magazine mogul cannot even claim to be self-made.
While he is seen as a smart businessman who assisted his neighbor Christie Whitman in devising the tax-cutting plan that helped her win the New Jersey State House, his friends worry that his bland personality, pro-growth message and flat tax do not make a compelling package. They fret that his head has been turned by the economist Jude Wanniski, who is still on the rebound from Jack Kemp.
Over coffee with Mr. Forbes, I got right down to substance. I asked if he still owned that island in Fiji.
"Yes, but unfortunately, I don't get there very often," he replied. "It's a small community, a couple of hundred people, called Lacaula."
It was difficult to imagine, with Presidential candidates always vying to make their pasts more appealingly humble, how a guy with an island in Fiji would fare.
Pierre (Pete) DuPont talked about his immigrant roots without mentioning that the immigrants were multimillionaires by the time he was born. George Bush desperately tried to conceal those giveaway preppy signals -- wearing striped watchbands, asking for "a splash" more coffee, having the most impressive ocean view in Kennebunkport -- behind a pork-rind facade. What if Bill Clinton brags on being a boy from Hope and Bob Dole reminisces about his farm days in Russell, Kan., and Steve Forbes has to say he's Richie Rich from hunt country?
And if this Princeton grad, who lives with his wife and five children in a horsy New Jersey community, simply admits that he's no man of the people, how does he avoid playing the capitalist fool? "I think what people would look for is, do you have the character, do you have the integrity, do you have the assets and qualifications that will enable you to not only occupy the office, but enable you to move ahead with what you talked about in the campaign," he said. "Is there a core?"
If Mr. Forbes proves he has a core, that would be a novelty in today's politics. Otherwise, he's just Huffington and puffington.

A mystery bankers love: How do credit cards stay so profitable?

BYLINE: By Peter Passell 

 BODY:
HAD any "pre-approved" offers for credit cards in the mail recently? If not, you must be a hermit or a notorious deadbeat: The average household received two solicitations a month in 1994.
The reason all those nice banks are lining up to lend you money is no mystery. The profit on credit card operations, according to research by Lawrence Ausubel, an economist at the University of Maryland, is almost five times the overall profit rate in banking. Last year, eight of the top nine commercial banks ranked by return on assets specialized in credit card loans. 
 In a free market, this isn't supposed to happen. If the business is immensely profitable -- and that profitability is no secret -- why hasn't wide-open competition forced banks, at best, to offer lower interest rates to consumers or, at worst, at least to dissipate their excess profits in ever greater spending for promotion?
Professor Ausubel's latest paper, presented last month to the National Bureau of Economic Research, buttresses his earlier finding that banks can charge uncompetitive rates on credit cards because consumers don't really believe that they will end up paying them. This, however, must be only part of the answer to the broader question of how competition can coexist with stunning profits in an industry offering a rather conventional service.
Mr. Ausubel first made waves inside his profession with a 1991 article in the American Economic Review that explained the high and "sticky" interest rates paid on credit card balances as a byproduct of consumer myopia. Credit card rates have since edged down, Mr. Ausubel says, and new cards are generally issued with variable rates. But the "spread" between what the banks pay for their own funds and the average rate they charge for credit cards -- typically, 10 percentage points -- has barely budged.
Equally striking, there is no erosion in the profitability of credit card operations. Indeed, notes Lawrence White, a former bank regulator who teaches economics at the Stern School of Business at New York University, credit cards generate much of the profit for banks now squeezed by competition from all sides.
New data support Mr. Ausubel's hypothesis that consumers do not expect to use their cards to borrow, and often do not even admit it when they do. Extrapolating from surveys, he discovered that Americans claimed they owed a total of $70 billion on their credit cards in 1992 when in fact they owed $182 billion.
Smart banks have learned to exploit this wishful thinking. While their interest rates remain uncompetitive compared with other loans, successful cards are now marketed with flashy extras -- below-market teaser rates, product discounts, insurance, frequent-flier miles, even cash rebates -- and rarely charge annual fees.
Robert Frank, an economist at Cornell University, notes that Mr. Ausubel's findings are consistent with other research on behavior in the face of temptation -- of impulsive consumption of food, alcohol and tobacco. "You know it's stupid," he explains, "but the pain comes later." It follows that borrowers cope with the guilt of compulsive shopping by forgetting the after-effect.
Still, what's more puzzling is that the excess gains are not burned up in the competition among card issuers to corral a bigger share of the highly profitable shopping addicts. Despite spending billions each year trying to lure new credit card customers and keep old ones, issuers still managed to earn 30 percent-plus returns on equity in the last decade. That is more than double the average return on investments by corporate America, with no greater risk.
Mr. Ausubel speculates that these persistent "supernormal" profits are a result of rapid innovation in marketing, much the way supernormal profits are the norm in markets dominated by rapidly changing technology -- electronics, computer software, pharmaceuticals and the like. Consumers sign up for cards that offer the cleverest gimmicks, and then pay excessive interest for years before being seduced by an even more clever gimmick. There is fierce competition. But the prize goes to the creator of the flavor of the month -- not to banks that deliver more service for less money.
This is not a pretty picture of free markets at work. Nor, for that matter, is it a particularly plausible one: Could the skills in marketing credit cards really be so specialized -- and so difficult to imitate -- that they account for most of the profit of one of America's most profitable industries?
If anything, there's a lesson for the economic profession itself in this tale. Much as they don't like to admit it, economists don't know as much as think they do about what makes markets tick. "At some point," Mr. White of New York University concedes, " you've just got to say, 'I don't understand this thing.' "

Mexican Recession Worse; Output Off 10% in Quarter

BYLINE: Reuters 

DATELINE: MEXICO CITY, Aug. 16

 BODY:
Mexico's economy plunged deeper into recession in the second quarter as the crisis set off by last December's peso devaluation continued, the Mexican Finance Ministry reported.
In a quarterly statement to Congress on Tuesday night, the ministry said that the gross domestic product -- essentially, the nation's output of goods and services -- fell 10.5 percent in the April-June quarter, compared with the similar period of 1994. 
 Economists had expected a sharp contraction, but the 10.5 percent drop was steeper than their estimates. Indeed, less than a month ago Finance Minister Guillermo Ortiz said that the second-quarter decline would be around 6 percent.
The depth of the recession, partly orchestrated by the Government as it slashed public spending and attacked inflation to stem the financial crisis, suggested to analysts that the economy may drop more this year than they had predicted.
The belt-tightening has already carried a wrenching toll in human terms. About a million people have lost their jobs and tens of thousands of small businesses have closed, broken by plummeting sales and unpayable debts.
But economists said the second quarter data also had a positive side. "It shows the political system and Zedillo has been able to do more than survive," said Gray Newman, economist at Interacciones Brokerage in Mexico City, referring to the Government of President Ernesto Zedillo. "They've managed over the course of one of the most serious contractions in modern Mexican history to maintain relative stability."
In the first quarter of the year, as the economy teetered until a United States-led international rescue effort assured Mexico of nearly $50 billion, the economy contracted just six-tenths of 1 percent.
For the first half of 1995, the Finance Ministry said, economic output fell at a 5.8 percent rate.
The ministry tried to put the best light on the data for the second quarter, noting that the economy in the similar period of 1994 had been very strong. And, the ministry said, the figures for the latest quarter may have distracted attention from a realization that the economy had bottomed out.
After the widespread loss of jobs in the early part of the year, the report said, unemployment in June was no worse than in May, suggesting that the jobless rate might now be stabilizing.
The Finance Ministry also noted that inflation had slowed, and that the devaluation and floating of the peso in December had helped Mexico swing from an $8.8 billion trade deficit in the first half of 1994 to a $3.9 billion surplus in this year's first half.
The economic report pushed down Mexican stock prices today, but the market rebounded from its lows. The main Mexico City stock index closed down 20.01 points, or eight-tenths of 1 percent. Earlier in the day, the index was down as much as 1.4 percent. The peso also weakened, closing here at 6.17 to the dollar, its lowest level since early July. Before the December devaluation, the peso traded in a semi-fixed range, selling at 3.46 to the dollar.

HEADLINE: Bradley Says He Won't Seek 4th Term

BYLINE: By CLIFFORD J. LEVY 

DATELINE: NEWARK, Aug. 16

 BODY:
Senator Bill Bradley of New Jersey announced today that he would not seek re-election next year to a fourth term, depriving the Democratic Party of one of its most respected thinkers at a time when the party's loss of Congress is forcing it to re-examine just what it stands for.
In a speech here, Mr. Bradley gave no reason for his decision, but he left the impression that he had grown weary of working in a political system that he called "broken." He castigated both major parties, accusing them of being more interested in feuding than in addressing the needs of the nation. 
 "Neither political party speaks to people where they live their lives," said Mr. Bradley, who was almost defeated in 1990 and faced another tough fight next year. "Both have moved away from my own concept of service and my own idea of what America can be."
Mr. Bradley's withdrawal sent tremors through the local and national political landscapes and raised questions about whether he wanted to run for President. Some politicians speculated that from the tone of his comments, Mr. Bradley, who has never been much of a party stalwart, might be mulling whether to abandon the Democrats altogether and become an independent.
Mr. Bradley, 52, who throughout his career has often been mentioned as a Presidential candidate, declined to answer questions after his speech, saying that he would do so at a news conference on Thursday.
But people who have talked to him in recent days said he would announce on Thursday that he had no plans to challenge President Clinton in the Democratic primary in 1996, though he would not rule out running as an independent.
Mr. Bradley's friends and advisers suggested that he himself was uncertain about his next steps and, that his goal at this point was to keep his options open. He hinted at that in his speech when he vowed that, even though he was giving up his seat, he would remain active.
"I will continue to speak out and call it like I see it," he said.
Though Mr. Bradley only alluded to his dissatisfaction in his speech, his friends said that in recent months he had often spoken of his frustration in trying to push his ideas in a Senate that is now run by Republicans.
Senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan, Democrat of New York, who serves with Mr. Bradley on the powerful Finance Committee, said the shift in the Senate to Republican control had often relegated Mr. Bradley to the sidelines on issues that he cared about deeply.
"That is not a very exciting way to live, and it is a not a very cerebral way to live," Mr. Moynihan said.
So Mr. Bradley, long considered one of the chamber's experts on matters like taxes and foreign policy, apparently did not want to spend six more years being shunted aside as a minority member. Mr. Bradley also has a strained relationship with both the Clinton Administration and the Democratic leadership in the Senate.
Mr. Bradley was apparently expressing these tensions today when he lashed out at both parties.
"The political debate has settled into two familiar ruts," he said. "The Republicans are infatuated with the 'magic' of the market and reflexively criticize government as the enemy of freedom, and the Democrats distrust the market, preach government as the answer to our problems and prefer the bureaucrat they know to the consumer they can't control."
By stepping aside, Mr. Bradley begins a new course in a life that has long been in the public spotlight. Before he reached the Senate, he distinguished himself as a scholar-athlete who attended Princeton University, earned a Rhodes scholarship and then helped lead the New York Knicks to two National Basketball Association championships.
Though he has a reputation as one of the Senate's best minds, he also has been attacked for neglecting the more nitty-gritty aspects of a politician's job, like obtaining money for local projects or maintaining services that help constituents navigate their way through the Federal bureaucracy.
Despite his denials, rumors have been swirling around Mr. Bradley for months that he might not run again. It was a surprise, though, that he would choose to withdraw so early, with nearly 18 months left in his term.
Leaders of both parties in New Jersey quickly began jostling for position after word of the announcement circulated. The Democrats, weakened in recent years by a revolt over taxes that has cost them the governor's office and control of the Legislature, now must regroup to defend the seat, which the National Republican Senatorial Committee had already focused on.
The prospect of a bruising race against Representative Dick Zimmer, the leading Republican candidate, might have influenced Mr. Bradley's decision. In 1990, flush with campaign cash and nationally known, Mr. Bradley barely eked out a victory against Christine Todd Whitman after he was criticized as aloof and refused to pass judgment on the unpopular tax increases advocated by Gov. Jim Florio. Mrs. Whitman later defeated Mr. Florio in 1993.
Nationally, Mr. Bradley's withdrawal further diminishes the Democrats' chances of regaining control of the Senate in 1996. In addition to Mr. Bradley, five other Democrats have said they will retire next year. If the Republicans, who have a 54-to-46 edge, can increase their majority to 60 seats, they will wield even more clout because they will able to block filibusters.
President Clinton, who is on vacation in Wyoming, telephoned Mr. Bradley this morning to express his regret over the Senator's decision.
"I will miss his leadership in our efforts to deal with the critical issues of race, crime and violence and America's opportunity in the post cold war era," Mr. Clinton said in a statement.
Mr. Bradley's wife, Ernestine Schlant Bradley, a German language and comparative literature professor at Montclair State College in New Jersey, had breast cancer a few years ago, and some politicians in New Jersey said he might have wanted to spend more time with her. But Mr. Bradley's staff said she had made a full recovery, adding that her health had not affected his decision.
Mr. Bradley has often said in recent years that the close call of the 1990 campaign was a shock to him, a liberating experience that has led him to be more candid about his feelings. One of his close friends said today that, by not running for re-election, Mr. Bradley sensed that he would have even more room to discuss issues that meant something to him.
That would also position him better for a possible campaign for President in 2000, said this friend, speaking on condition of anonymity.
"He really believes that for him now, the best platform is not the Senate, that it's better to be out with people," the friend said. "If he were going to make a step for 2000, he believes it would be much better and easier to do that from outside. He wants the freedom to move around."

Comments at Fed Point To No Change in Rates
The Federal Reserve's interest-rate policy committee appears likely to leave rates unchanged at its meeting next Tuesday. Senior Fed officials expressed satisfaction this week with the current economic outlook.
Lawrence B. Lindsey and Edward W. Kelley Jr., Fed governors, said in interviews that they were pleased with the economy's direction. Mr. Lindsey added, "We're in a situation where we're going to have exactly what the doctor ordered, which is slow, moderate growth." Analysts said they did not expect the Fed to push rates up before the committee meets in September. [Page D2.]
 
The yield on 30-year-Treasury bonds rose to 6.90 percent, from 6.88 percent on Wednesday, despite economic reports showing the economy growing at a moderate pace with inflation under control. [D4.]
 
Dell Earnings Exceed Forecasts
Continuing to cash in on a boom in personal computer sales, Dell Computer said that earnings more than doubled in the second quarter to $65.1 million, or $1.32 a share, surpassing analysts' expectations. Even more of a pleasant surprise were Dell's strong gross profit margins, which increased to 21.8 percent, compared with 21.4 percent in the first quarter of this year. [D4.]

HEADLINE: New Orleans Conjures Old Spirits Against Modern Woes

BYLINE: By RICK BRAGG 

DATELINE: NEW ORLEANS, Aug. 17

 BODY:
The voodoo priestess used a mix of gunpowder and old graveyard dirt to draw a magic symbol on a crossroads in the Bywater neighborhood, opening a spiritual door through which a fearsome deity could pass and save her community from the evil of crack cocaine.
For two hours on Wednesday night, as drums pounded along Piety Street and orange flames of fire-eaters and torch carriers danced in the dark, the white-gowned priestess, Sallie Ann Glassman, enticed Ogoun La Flambeau, a voodoo god of war and fire, to prowl among the rows of shotgun houses and punish the dope peddlers and other criminals. 
 She offered rum, cigars, incense and music, and called out to him in French, respectfully but firmly, since it is unwise to appear weak-willed in the presence of spirits. "Great gods cannot ride little horses," she said.
Sometime after 10 P.M., as a circle of sweat-slick dancers and voodoo drummers seemed about to collapse in the sticky heat, Ogoun showed himself to her, the priestess said.
"I can see him and feel him. He is here," said Ms. Glassman. His feet, she said, were on the street, and the rest of him rose up, high into the dark. "I can see him now, hovering over us," she said.
Even in New Orleans, where there is magic in many things and weirdness in most, this does not happen every day.
The ceremony was born in the frustration of residents in the racially and economically diverse neighborhood on the edge of the French Quarter, said Ms. Glassman and others who live here. They said the New Orleans Police Department had been ineffectual at best in dealing with blatant drug traffic, burglaries, prostitution, robberies and assaults.
"This is not frivolous," said James Smith, a writer who lives in Bywater, who came to lend his support to the ceremony.
"It has to work better than the legal system," in frightening away some of the criminals who make a living here, Mr. Smith said. "Because New Orleans is a very superstitious place."
Ms. Glassman, who was assaulted two months ago and whose home was burglarized two weeks ago, said the only avenue left for residents was an appeal to old spirits, called loas, that once held such sway in this old city.
"At night, the whole neighborhood is lit up with crack pipes," said Ms. Glassman. "I called it our thousand points of light."
In daylight, "people were exchanging drugs for money on my steps," she said. "I decided that what we needed was an urban loa."
She decided to call forth Ogoun, the baddest spirit in the voodoo otherworld. She does not want Ogoun to harm anyone, only to frighten them, badly enough to cease their evil.
But as Ms. Glassman invoked the spirits, it was clear that not all of the hundred or so onlookers had fear of Ogoun, or any voodoo god. Occasional taunts throughout the ritual, and the fact that most of the people who joined in the ceremony were whites, showed how the religion had slipped and shifted in the life of New Orleans.
Voodoo, a gumbo of African religions and Old World Catholicism, came to New Orleans as it came to Haiti and other places in the New World, in the holds of slave ships.
Two hundred years ago, voodoo drums echoed from Congo Square along the New Orleans riverfront, and priests and priestesses performed eerie rituals in the bayous outside town. Well into the 20th century, priests and priestesses held tremendous respect in the neighborhoods.
There are still shops where a dwindling number of voodoo believers can buy a charm, potion or a hex, still places to find a black cat bone to seal a lover's affection for eternity.
Believers still wander dark cemeteries, which people here call Cities of the Dead, and search for the graves of the mighty priestesses, called voodooiennes, to take a little dirt. The dust, called goofer dirt, is mixed with other ingredients to make their own magic more potent.
But voodoo no longer holds the influence it once did over the people of New Orleans, and many of its devotees seem to be white people -- nose and tongue piercers, middle-aged intellectuals and men with foot-long pony tails -- who enjoy the religion's drumming and cultural aspects.
Ms. Glassman herself is white and came here from Kennebunkport, Me. But Ms. Glassman, who works a second job at a New Orleans nightclub, says she has been a voodooienne here for more than 20 years and that voodoo is not fashion to her: She goes to the Mississippi River some mornings to feed the spirits honey and flowers, and spirits visit her in dreams.
"This is not going to make me popular with the crack dealers," she said of the ceremony, adding that she would not attempt it if she did not know the spirits would shield her. "These are bad people."
Others here do not feel the arms of the spirits wrapped around them.
All during the ceremony, young men, women and some children laughed and jeered and pantomimed the voodoo dance, hopping in and out of the sacred circle.
One young man spent an hour trying to provoke the dancers, but -- except when a fire-eater blew a fireball at him -- he was ignored. When a young man pulled his car to the intersection and blasted it with thundering gangsta rap, the voodoo drummers just pounded harder.
But the ceremony also showed the lingering respect, and fears, that this old religion still holds. From the four directions of the crossroad at Piety and Rampart streets, people stood in half-open doors and stared toward the ceremony.
Some said they simply did not want to get involved, but others, older ones, said they feared the ceremony itself. One middle-aged woman said it was dangerous to dabble in magic, and closed her door.
It is dangerous, said Ms. Glassman. Once one uncorks the stopper on the spirit world, they are at the mercy of the god they summon, she said.
"You can always regret something that you set in motion," she said. "This is a little precarious, like setting off an atom bomb. You hope Ogoun will play fair. But who knows what his morals are."
What she is counting on is that he is a fierce god, a warrior, a master of the forge who can hammer out a better community. That is what she asked as she touched a burning stick to the sacred symbol, or veve, she had drawn on the street, and watched the gunpowder burst into flame.
"Normally I'd use cornmeal to draw the veve," she said, but this ceremony needed a little theatrics.
At its foundation, what happened here was just a New Orleans variety of a community watch, said Dawn Green, a 22-year-old student at the University of New Orleans.
"It is a public prayer," said Tina Girourd, an artist.
Of the 100 who came, most were respectful, and watched quietly. It being New Orleans, some showed up with gin and tonics in their hands.
The New Orleans police also showed up, late.
It will be a while before Ms. Glassman knows how Ogoun will respond to Bywater's need.
She only knows he is here, hovering.

HEADLINE: Trade Deficit Grew in June As Exports Fell

BYLINE: By ROBERT D. HERSHEY Jr. 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Aug. 17

 BODY:
The nation's trade deficit widened in June as exports eased from record levels and consumers and businesses maintained a surprisingly brisk demand for imports, the Commerce Department reported today.
The $11.31 billion deficit brought the total for the first half of the year to $63.8 billion, or 28 percent more than the deficit in the comparable period of 1994. 
 Currency traders responded to the report by bidding down the recently buoyant dollar. It slipped to 97.25 yen, from 97.93 yen on Wednesday, and to 1.4747 marks, from 1.4800. [Page D13.]
Economists had expressed varying degrees of concern that the dollar's recent rise -- accelerated this week by coordinated purchases by the Treasury and the German and Japanese Governments -- would further expand the trade gap. But the Clinton Administration, boasting of export success, brushed aside such fears and attributed the mounting deficit to slow growth by America's trading partners, especially Japan.
"Our exports are growing dramatically," said Jeffrey E. Garten, Under Secretary of Commerce for international trade. The deficit, he added, "has nothing to do with a lack of competitiveness" and will shrink when European and Japanese economies rebound.
The Administration has invested much political capital in trade, including the fight to win ratification of the North American Free Trade Agreement, but it still anticipates charges by Republicans that it has allowed the deficit to balloon at the cost of American jobs. With this no doubt in mind, Mr. Garten distributed to reporters today a chart showing that the trade deficit now amounts to 1.5 percent of the gross domestic product, about half the proportion that prevailed in the late 1980's.
The deficit with Japan -- the amount by which American purchases of Japanese goods surpassed American sales to Japan -- declined for the third straight month in June, according to today's report. Still, analysts said they could not yet discern a trend. Among other things, the decline could reflect slack shipments of luxury cars after an early-spring surge intended to beat the threatened imposition of American tariffs; the punitive tariffs were averted by a last-minute agreement.
The deficit with Japan narrowed to $5.3 billion, from $5.5 billion, with imports of new cars from Japan falling nearly $400 million.
The deficit with Mexico, however, remained at $1.6 billion, bringing the total for the first half of the year to $8.6 billion, in sharp contrast with last year's $1.1 billion surplus. Mexico's economic crisis and peso devaluation last winter has led to higher American imports and left Mexico less able to buy exports from the United States.
And the deficit with China, a growing source of trade friction, climbed to $3 billion, from $2.8 billion. Figures for individual countries, unlike the totals, are not adjusted for recurring seasonal variation.
Over all, exports of goods and services fell 1.2 percent in June, to $64.48 billion. The largest factor was lower shipments of motor vehicles, parts and engines, mainly to Canada. For merchandise alone, exports moved down 1.6 percent despite a surge for advanced technology products. Exports of capital goods, however, climbed to a record.
Imports declined less than exports, by six-tenths of 1 percent, reflecting lower purchases of artwork, gem diamonds and motor vehicles and their components, the department said.
"A soft economy would typically lead to a decline in imports," said Larry J. Wipf, an economist at the Norwest Corporation in Minneapolis, referring to the meager American growth rate of five-tenths of 1 percent in the second quarter. He said the continued high level of imports might indicate that the economy was a bit stronger in late spring than had been thought.
Mickey Kantor, the United States trade representative, said in a telephone interview that the dollar's weakness in the first half of the year had little effect on trade flows, and he contended that the recent advance would prove similarly inconsequential.
"We don't think the strengthening dollar will have any effect one way or the other," Mr. Kantor said.
But some private analysts sharply disagreed. For example, William R. Cline, senior fellow at the Institute for International Economics, a nonpartisan research organization, said that assuming the higher levels held, diminished American competitiveness would help swell the deficit to perhaps $200 billion by 1997.
If the policy is intended to buoy the Japanese economy, a goal the Administration has specifically denied, the extra growth there could not generate enough additional purchases from the United States to make up for the general loss of American competitiveness from its stronger currency, he said.
The institute's director, C. Fred Bergsten, put the complaint more bluntly. "Politically, this is opting for Wall Street over Main Street," he said, meaning that Main Street is concerned with the realities of jobs and production.
In Detroit, Robert E. Lippens, international economist for the Chrysler Corporation, said that he would worry about the auto industry's competitive position should the dollar rise sharply, but that he was "not terribly concerned" about the increases so far.

HEADLINE: U.N. Documents Inequities for Women as World Forum Nears

BYLINE: By BARBARA CROSSETTE 

DATELINE: UNITED NATIONS, Aug. 17

 BODY:
The last two decades have seen advances in the education and health of women around the world, yet hundreds of millions of women in both rich and poor nations are still significantly undervalued economically, denied access to political power and kept down by crippling inequalities under the law, according to a report released today.
"We hear and we say that life is unfair, but what this report shows is that life is dramatically unfair to women," said James Gustave Speth, administrator of the United Nations Development Program, which commissioned the study. 
 Seventy percent of the world's poor are women, and women and children make up 80 percent of its refugees and a disproportionate number of the casualties in dozens of small-scale wars.
"Violence stalks women's lives, in peace and in war," the report says.
Violence in personal relationships is a universal fact, according to the report. Women's groups from every region of the world are demanding that some concrete action on this issue be taken in Beijing next month at the Fourth World Conference on Women, said Barbara Arnwine, executive director of the Lawyers' Committee for Civil Rights Under Law, based in Washington, D.C.
Workshops about violence at regional sessions preparing for the China conference have been packed to overflowing, said Ms. Arnwine, who will lead a delegation predominantly composed of African American women to the conference.
Madeleine K. Albright, the chief American representative at the United Nations and the leader of the United States' delegation to Beijing, said in an interview that protection against domestic violence and the human rights of women in general, along with their need for economic security, are among the issues she will emphasize at the conference.
While there has been a lot of disparate, anecdotal evidence available, the new study attempts to pull together "in a rigorously analytical way" as much quantitative information as possible to make international comparisons, Mr. Speth said in an interview.
"It is very apparent to everyone in our country offices around the world -- 135 of them -- that the advancement of women, the involvement of women in decision-making, is a critical developmental factor," said Mr. Speth, a founder and former president of the World Resources Institute who is now the highest-ranking American in the United Nations system.
The study is the sixth annual Human Development Report to be prepared by independent experts for the development agency. Each year the report, which ranks 174 nations on a range of social and economic factors, also chooses a different theme for special attention. This year it focuses on the status of women, and it was timed for release before the conference on women, which is held once in a decade.
"The key finding is that gender gaps in human capabilities -- education, health -- have been halved in the last two decades," Mr. Speth said. "There have been huge increases in the capacity of women, including in the Arab states. But when you go on beyond the preparatory phase of life, women overwhelmingly still lack access to economic and political opportunities. They are effectively shut out of the higher reaches of economic and political leadership and decision-making."
The report says that worldwide, women have only 14 percent of top managerial jobs, hold 10 percent of national legislative seats and 6 percent of cabinet-level positions. Only in the Nordic countries, led by Norway, have women reached the level of 40 percent or more in government ministries, in large part because of strong affirmative action policies, the study concludes.
The United States, which is given the world's second-highest overall human development ranking in this report, after Canada, falls to fifth place in a recalculation that focuses on income and health disparities between men and women. Sweden, Finland, Norway and Denmark all move to the top. If the focus is on women's access to political and economic power, the United States falls to eighth place.
Two areas of the report's findings are expected to draw special attention in Beijing: the economic undervaluation of women's work and the legal barriers women face.
On the economic value of women's work, Mr. Speth said that the report looked at 31 countries at various stages of development and concluded that "if you take into account both the uncompensated work women do and the wage discrimination against women, you come up with a figure of $11 trillion."
"The total world economy is about $23 trillion," Mr. Speth said.
In studying the way the laws of various countries treat women, the report's findings were somber.
Among the examples of legal discrimination mentioned were laws that prohibit women from traveling abroad without male permission. In Botswana, Chile, Lesotho, Namibia and Swaziland, women are under the legal guardianship of husbands and have no property rights.
"The starkest reflection of the low status accorded to women in societies everywhere is the discrimination against them in law," the report said. "Unless such legal barriers are removed, no progress can be made toward equal rights."

HEADLINE: Hedging Bets on Democracy, Casinos Offer Cash to Voters

BYLINE: By TIMOTHY EGAN 

DATELINE: SEATTLE, Aug. 17

 BODY:
In the evolution of democracy, a ballot proposal to allow unrestricted casino gambling in the state of Washington is unlikely to merit anything more than a footnote. But the way that the initiative is trying to sell itself to voters may give it a place in election history.
If Initiative 651 passes, the casino promoters have promised to pay every Washington resident who votes this fall an annual dividend of a share of 10 percent of the profits from slot machines -- an amount that could bring each voter $100 a year. In typical off-year elections in the state, about one million people vote. 
 To critics, the proposal amounts to an outright bribe, although on a mass scale. But supporters, after polling people on the depth of voter cynicism and distrust of government, say they are merely cutting out the middleman -- the tax collector -- and offering to give a chunk of their revenue right back to the people.
"The whole idea is absolute craziness," said Ralph Munro, Washington's Secretary of State, whose office certified the proposal for the Nov. 7 ballot.
The initiative is being sponsored by three American Indian tribes interested in expanding into casino gambling and is being bankrolled, in part, by slot machine manufacturers like Ballys, who are lending the tribes money for the campaign.
Under the initiative, the tribes would pay voters no matter which way they voted on the measure.
Offering a financial reward merely for casting a vote may be illegal in this state, Mr. Munro said. But the measure as it now stands will go on the ballot, though it may face a legal challenge later.
To some people, the proposal recalls the days of big-city party machines, when voters were induced to turn out by offers of free liquor, meals or more.
"The simple promise here is that if you vote for this initiative you will get paid off," said Chuck Sauvage, executive director of the state chapter of Common Cause, a group that monitors campaigns. "You go out and do your duty as a citizen, and you become a shareholder in casino gambling. This is unheard of."
Supporters compare the situation to that of Alaska, where every resident receives an annual dividend check -- now about $900 -- from state oil royalties. The difference, Mr. Sauvage said, is that the Washington dividend is held out as a bonus for voting.
Though early polls show the measure failing, gambling proponents are counting on a simple argument -- and a bit of old-fashioned greed -- to make their case.
"This is a way to cut out the middleman, to cement our financial relationship with the people of the state of Washington," said Herb Whitish, the chairman of the Shoalwater Bay tribe, who is a leader of the initiative.
"I don't view this as any kind of bribe," Mr. Whitish said. "We're just trying to share a resource with the people of the state."
The measure qualified for the ballot after supporters gathered more than 256,000 signatures in a campaign in which workers were paid up to $1 for every signature gathered. Critics said the paid-signature drive raised questions about the initiative process, which half of the states have, though such paid drives have become a reality in recent years as voters have become wary of signing petitions.
"It's bad enough we have people buying their way onto the ballot," Mr. Sauvage said. "But now with this initiative, you've got the logical extension, which is to buy the voters off directly."
The Washington proposal is the latest nuance in the expansion of Indian gambling nationwide, an industry made possible by passage of the Indian Gaming Act in 1988, and has grown to the point where patrons are spending $27 billion a year in tribal casinos.
Under the gaming act, tribes have been able to enter into compacts with states, allowing them to operate casinos on reservations with forms of gambling that are legal elsewhere in the state. Since most states allow charities to run blackjack card games and roulette wheels on certain nights, the tribes have followed suit, although with bigger operations and longer hours.
With a few exceptions, the result has been a bonanza for the tribes. The Tulalips' casino near Everett, about 30 miles north of Seattle, reported more than $10 million in profit last year. A new casino south of Seattle, run by the Muckleshoot tribe, expects to do $150 million a year in business.
Most casinos have used the money to build schools, roads and health clinics, or return a share of the profits directly to tribal members. In some states, a share of the profits is given to state government.
The most profitable casinos have slot machines, which typically provide up to 75 percent of the revenue, but Washington State does not allow such machines.
Three tribes making plans to open big resort and gambling casinos in Washington -- the Spokanes, the Puyallups and the Shoalwaters -- put together Initiative 651 in an effort to change state law to allow slot machines. Under their proposal, any tribe entering into a gambling compact with the state with slot machines must return 10 percent of the profits from slot machines to "all registered voters who voted in the most recent statewide election."
Tribal leaders are projecting enough profit to make a $100 million payout to state voters, although others say that estimate is too generous.
Opponents say the proposal would be the death knell for charitable gambling and open this state to the kind of deregulated casino operations that existed in Las Vegas, Nev., in the 1950's. But, they say, it is the dividend proposal that most troubles them.
"It's a payoff," said Stan Shore, a leader of the opposition to Initiative 651. "The tribes are simply trying to pay voters to look the other way."
Even within the three tribes involved, members have criticized the tribal leaders for allying themselves with slot machine makers and for throwing tribal money into the initiative campaign.
Some of the other tribes in the state oppose the initiative, including those who have seen a decline in crowds as gambling reaches a saturation point and say that allowing newer operations to use slot machines would dry up their revenues.
Mr. Whitish said those tribes could get in on the windfall by changing their compacts with the state. But then, he said, they would have to return 10 percent of the slot machine profit to the voters as well.
Either way, gambling is here to stay as a mainstay of tribal economies. Mr. Whitish called it the "second coming of the salmon."

Based on troop movements and warnings from two Iraqi defectors that President Saddam Hussein had considered attacking Kuwait and Saudi Arabia, the Pentagon said today that it was sending ships carrying equipment and supplies to the Persian Gulf, and could ultimately deploy more than 22,000 ground troops.
Although there is no indication that an Iraqi attack is imminent, two senior American military officials told reporters today that elite Iraqi troops around Baghdad have conducted "unusual training activities" in the last five weeks that caused concern among United States analysts. 
 Most Government experts here and in the Middle East say Iraq has neither the will nor the ability to launch an attack. Many Middle Eastern diplomats and even some senior American officers fear that the Administration may be overreacting to the troop movements in Iraq.
Sending American forces to defend the gulf against Saddam Hussein would be an opportunity to make President Clinton look firm in dealing with an international villain.
"Saddam Hussein is an easy whipping-boy," said one diplomat familiar with the Middle East. "It's a no-brainer for Clinton. He's got everything to gain and nothing to lose by acting tough."
But several factors have prompted the Administration to take precautionary steps, including the troop movements around Baghdad, the information provided by high-level Iraqis who defected to Jordan last week, Mr. Hussein's threats to make trouble if the United Nations does not lift sanctions against his country next month, and the memory of military confrontations with Iraq in 1991 and 1994. "We'd much rather be safe than sorry," said a senior Pentagon aide.
Pentagon officials have ordered 13 ships carrying tanks, trucks, ammunition and other supplies, enough for about 22,000 marines and soldiers, to the gulf region. That equipment will arrive within a week. Moreover, the military's Joint Staff has prepared orders to send troops to match up with the equipment, although they will not be issued unless Iraq's forces threaten its neighbors, senior military commanders said. Troops could be flown rapidly into the region.
"I don't think we're deeply worried about Saddam launching a military operation, but there's no harm in reminding him to think it's not a sensible thing to do," a senior Administration official said. "We don't want him to have any doubt in his mind."
The United States already has about 20,000 troops in the Persian Gulf and eastern Mediterranean, including two aircraft carriers, 2,000 marines engaged in a training exercise with Jordanian troops and more than 100 Air Force planes in Kuwait and Saudi Arabia.
Iraq is capable of sending elite Republican Guard armored units with more than 10,000 troops, now south of Baghdad, to the Kuwaiti border in about four days, as happened last fall. At that time, Washington dispatched 13,000 troops, ships armed with Tomahawk cruise missiles and scores of warplanes, and threatened much more, to force the Iraqi troops to withdraw north of the 32d parallel, which is about 160 miles north of the Kuwait border.
American officials this week repeated their longstanding threat to attack any Iraqi troops south of that line. "The difference between this year and last year is that we've declared the right to nail them below the 32d parallel," said a senior Defense Department official.
Administration officials suspect that Mr. Hussein is searching for a way to respond to the predicament he is in as a result of the defections of Lieut. Gen. Hussein Kamel and Col. Saddam Kamel -- President Hussein's two sons-in-law.
These officials say that President Hussein may have ordered the troop movements to divert the attention of his country -- and the world -- from the defections of the two high-ranking military officers. Another possible motive is to flex his muscles to scare his neighbors and win back some respect.
In the month before the defectors fled, Pentagon experts had been watching with growing concern as Iraqi aircraft, air defense, army, Republican Guard and special forces trained or prepared to train. A senior military official said today that concern increased after the defections.
"The problem with these exercises is that they decrease our warning time," said a senior Defense Department official. "The more efficiently they can mobilize, the less time that gives us."
In devising a plan to contain Iraqi military power, the Pentagon is trying to deal with the fact that it is far easier for Iraq to move forces to threaten its neighbor than it is for Washington to dispatch troops from 7,000 miles away.
The actions announced today are the latest in a series aimed at checking Mr. Hussein's military. After Mr. Hussein's two sons-in-law defected last week, Mr. Clinton promised to protect Jordan against any Iraqi reprisal. Senior military officials said today that there were no indications that Iraq's military was posing a direct threat to Jordan.
The Navy last week moved the aircraft carrier Theodore Roosevelt from the central Mediterranean to a position off the Israeli coast. The departure of a second carrier, the Abraham Lincoln, from the Persian Gulf was delayed until its relief arrived. The marines started their long-scheduled exercise with Jordanian troops.
Military officials today disclosed the American ship movements, the likelihood of an exercise with 5,000 Army troops in Kuwait soon, and increased flights over Iraq by U-2 spy planes.
Gen. J. H. Binford Peay 3d, the head of the United States Central Command, which oversees the region, flew to Kuwait today to meet with officials there. The general is expected to go to Saudi Arabia in next few days.
As the military stepped up its activity, the Administration announced that two senior American diplomats were in Amman to learn as much as possible about what the defectors have told King Hussein and Jordanian officials.
The two diplomats -- Assistant Secretary of State Robert Pelletreau and Mark Parris, the National Security Council's senior aide on the Middle East -- met with the King today in an effort to learn more about Mr. Hussein's military intentions and gather information to bolster American efforts to persuade the United Nations Security Council to prolong economic sanctions against Baghdad.
According to the State Department, the two officials once again urged King Hussein to sever economic ties with Iraq, and especially to stop importing oil from Iraq. But Administration officials acknowledge that Jordan is forced to depend on Iraq for oil because Kuwait and Saudi Arabia cut off trade with Jordan after it supported Baghdad during the Persian Gulf war.

HEADLINE: In the Shadow of Atlantic City, a Tribe Wants to Open a Casino

BYLINE: By JON NORDHEIMER 

DATELINE: WILDWOOD, N.J., Aug. 17

 BODY:
Acknowledging that they faced an uphill battle in hostile territory, leaders of an Indian tribe from Oklahoma signed an agreement with this seaside community today to operate a gambling casino virtually in the shadow of Atlantic City.
Whether they can win state and Federal approval to actually bring the project out of the planning stage is another matter. 
 Gov. Christine Todd Whitman indicated today that she did not look favorably on the project. "The Governor says she has concerns about gaming outside Atlantic City and in the past has expressed opposition to similar projects," said Jayne Rebovich, a spokeswoman.
Such talk did little to discourage those who gathered here today eager to claim their share of the riches that slot machines and blackjack tables can bring. Pacts between Indian tribes and cash-strapped governments have gained in appeal: Detroit would like to deed downtown land to the Chippewas for a gambling operation, and in New York State, the Oneidas want to open a casino at Monticello Raceway, 100 miles south of their homeland.
Here in Wildwood, the tribe and the community want state approval to deed 2.5 acres, now a municipal parking lot, to the Delaware tribe of western Oklahoma. According to the plan outlined today, the tribe would pay Wildwood $8 million a year out of casino profits.
Larry Snake, the tribal chairman, said the Delawares had been driven from New Jersey, their ancestral land, more than a century ago. Now, he added, 250 tribe members live on 10 acres near Anadarko, Okla., while 1,000 are scattered around the nation, a dozen of them in New Jersey.
Mr. Snake, 40, who runs a motorboat repair shop in Anadarko, said he had had no plans to run a casino until Wildwood merchants contacted him two months ago.
He said he had jumped at their proposal because it offered tribe members a road out of an economic backwater. "We can use the money to help pay for the health care, educational and cultural needs of our people," he said.
The casino issue will first be put to Wildwood voters in a referendum, so far unscheduled. The municipality, 26 blocks long, has only 5,000 year-round residents, but it sits on a five-mile barrier beach that on a holiday week like Labor Day may draw 250,000 visitors, mainly from Pennsylvania and Delaware.
Local merchants, who say Atlantic City has hurt more than helped them since the first casino opened there in 1979, were optimistic that the project would be approved -- at least at the local level.
"The people want it," said Giovanna Pullela, 67, a pizza-by-the-slice vendor on the boardwalk, "but there's too much politics at the state level for it to pass."
Her daughter, Janie O'Donnell, 38, added, "The problem is people come to Wildwood on vacation but spend all their money in Atlantic City."
If the necessary approvals were obtained, the tribe and the city would choose a management company to build and operate the casino. Persuading the state to transfer the deed will be left to Wildwood officials who know the political terrain, Mr. Snake said.
"This is their backyard, not mine," he added.
Mayor Fred Wager said the city had been thinking about ways to bring casino gambling to Wildwood for three years and had hired a consultant to shop around for a tribe that could claim New Jersey as its ancestral land.
"It seemed far-fetched at the time," said the consultant, Chuck Worthington, a former assemblyman from Atlantic County. "But the more we talked about it, it became clear the legal groundwork was there to make it work."
The problem, he added, was that two local Indian groups, the Lenni-Lenapes and Ramapoughs, were not officially recognized by the Interior Department. This disqualified them from Federal recognition, which could be the basis for claiming the right to operate a casino.
Actually, the Lenapes and the Delawares are the same people, said Mark M. Gould, the Lenni-Lenape tribal chairman, who was at the signing here today to give the project his blessing.
"The Delawares were the ones who were transported by the troops to Oklahoma," said Mr. Gould, wearing a long ponytail and a blue business suit and accompanied by others in traditional Indian dress. "The Lenni-Lenapes were the ones who stayed behind and hid in the woods." He said there were 1,500 on the Lenni-Lenape tribal rolls, most living in southern New Jersey, and most of mixed blood.
He noted that the casino agreement gave first choice of jobs to "native Americans." Casino backers estimate that the casino, if built, would provide 2,000 jobs on the grounds and 8,000 in related services.
Local officials have said that they want to insure a family market for the casino and that consequently they will not permit alcohol to be served on the premises. In a resort that already has more than 100 liquor licenses, the restriction was interpreted more as a sop to local businesses that did not want a tourist magnet such as a casino to monopolize spending. For much the same reason, the casino will not be able to provide accommodations for the public or high rollers.
A tricky legal question arises if the Governor blocks the deed transfer. The state could not prevent the building of a casino on a reservation if there were one in New Jersey, but whether it can stop one on land deeded to a tribe is a central question in a case now in Federal court in Oregon, Mr. Worthington said.

HEADLINE: Fed Appears Unlikely to Lower Rates

BYLINE: By KEITH BRADSHER 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Aug. 17

 BODY:
With the Federal Reserve's interest-rate policy committee set to meet on Tuesday, senior Fed officials have expressed satisfaction with the current economic outlook, as well as some uncertainty -- assessments that seem likely to lead them to leave the rate unchanged for now.
Lawrence B. Lindsey, a governor of the Federal Reserve Board, said the economy already appeared to be doing fairly well. "We're in a situation where we're going to have exactly what the doctor ordered, which is slow, moderate growth," he said. 
 Edward W. Kelley Jr., another governor, said he was "pleased that it would appear we have begun to grow again." But he added, "It is too early to judge the vigor that growth may have."
Mr. Kelley and Mr. Lindsey spoke in interviews at the beginning of this week, and neither specifically addressed interest rates. But several Government statistics released since then, like the sharp rise in housing starts announced on Wednesday, have shown signs of economic health. The figures might bolster the central bankers' reluctance to reduce the short-term interest rates under their control to stimulate the economy.
Most traders and financial analysts also appear to be expecting the central bank to leave interest rates unchanged at least until the next meeting of policy-making officials on Sept. 26. The rates for three-month Treasury bills are slightly below 5.75 percent, the current target of the Federal funds rate, which the Federal Reserve effectively controls and which banks charge each other for overnight loans.
"The Fed is probably still in an easing mode, but I think people are not expecting anything rapid-fire," said David C. Munro, an economist at High Frequency Economics, a New York consulting company.
To be sure, the Federal Reserve's short-term interest rates remain farther above the inflation rate than the historical average, leaving room for the central bank to repeat its decision on July 6 to shave the Federal funds rate by a quarter of a percentage point. And while the economy appears to have accelerated from the one-half of a percent growth that it recorded in the second quarter, it remains well below the 2.5 percent growth rate that some Fed officials use as their informal target.
Mr. Lindsey predicted the economy would grow at an annual pace of only 1.5 percent from the second quarter of this year through the third quarter of next year. Mr. Lindsey would not discuss the interest-rate implications of his forecast, but private analysts believe such a growth rate would give the Federal Reserve considerable room to reduce short-term rates further.
Another worry for Mr. Lindsey is the state of many Americans' personal finances, which will influence whether stores continue to sell their backlogs of goods and place fresh orders with factories and other producers. "I continue to be nervous about the amount of consumer debt that is being added on," Mr. Lindsey said.
But with more signs emerging that the economy has rebounded from its slowdown in April and May, the overall mood at the Federal Reserve seems to be satisfaction, with little perceived need to tinker with rates. Alan Greenspan, the Fed's chairman, seemed almost cheerful during his last discussion of monetary policy before Congress on July 19.
The main reason for the good mood at the Federal Reserve is that inflation appears to be under control after the central bank raised short-term interest rates seven times in 1994 and early this year in an effort to prevent a spurt of economic growth from feeding inflation. Consumer prices have risen at an annual rate of only 2.4 percent during the last three months -- extraordinarily low for an economy in the fifth year of an expansion.
Prices for industrial products like synthetic rubber and crude goods like steel scrap have leveled off after rising steeply for more than a year. Mr. Kelley said that could have a dampening effect on inflation in the future.
As a bank regulator, the Federal Reserve was also concerned about the health of the banking system, which appears to be sound. "From all we have been able to ascertain, loan quality continues to be quite good," Mr. Kelley said.
While some Wall Street economists have warned of the dangers for bond prices that lie in a possible collision of Congress and the President on budget policy this autumn, Federal Reserve officials seem less anxious. Even if the Government was to become immobilized, it would not pose a significant problem for the economy unless the problem was to last far longer than those of recent years, Mr. Lindsey said..
"Obviously, if it goes on for weeks and weeks, something will happen," he said. "I doubt the country will notice a shutdown of the government if it's a matter of days."
The dollar's strong rise in currency markets this summer, and particularly this month, has removed another worry for Federal Reserve officials. A falling dollar is a problem because it forces officials to consider whether to sacrifice domestic economic growth by raising interest rates to attract foreign investment and protect the dollar's value.
Most important, Federal Reserve officials see a growing public resistance to inflation, which may be the best weapon against price increases. Mr. Lindsey was particularly impressed that when American auto makers tried to increase prices this year, buyers cut back on purchases.
"It's a sign," he said, "that a low or no inflation psychology is beginning to take hold."

HEADLINE: Regulators to Rub Elbows With Contributors to Pataki

BYLINE: By JAMES DAO 

DATELINE: ALBANY, Aug. 17

 BODY:
The invitations for the political fund-raising event came with an offer and a price: Spend Friday afternoon at Saratoga Race Course with Gov. George E. Pataki, for either $250 or $1,000 per person.
But those invitations also carried a subtle prod for the corporate officials and horse-racing people being invited to contribute. Included on the printed roster of fund-raising chairmen were two senior government officials whose jobs are to regulate or grant benefits to many of the people on the guest list. 
 The two are Joseph Neglia, a member of the state's three-member Racing and Wagering Board, which regulates horse tracks and parimutuel betting, and Clarence D. Rappleyea Jr., the new chairman of the state Power Authority, which provides low-cost electricity to businesses.
The practice of having senior government officials solicit campaign donations from the very people they regulate was prohibited during the Cuomo administration because of the potential for ethical conflicts. And indeed, when Mr. Rappleyea, who started his Power Authority job this week, was questioned by a reporter today, he acknowledged the problem.
"I won't be doing this again," he said.
A spokeswoman for the Governor said the administration now recognized the problem. Asked about the invitations this afternoon, Zenia Mucha said: "No commissioner or board member will have their name on an invitation or serve on any fund-raising committee" again.
But she added that Friday's fund-raiser will go off as scheduled.
The involvement of the two officials has drawn sharp criticism from Democratic lawmakers and government watchdog groups, although it is not expressly prohibited under state ethics laws. The critics contend that fund-raising by officials who have regulatory powers pressespeople doing business with the state to contribute money.
"It creates the appearance, at best, that regulated industries are currying favor for future important decisions for them," said Blair Horner, legislative director for the New York Public Interest Research Group. "It clearly smacks of a conflict."
Both Mr. Neglia and Mr. Rappleyea said they had distributed tickets and made phone calls to encourage people to come to the event. Mr. Neglia said he had talked to friends about attending, some of whom are in the horse-racing business. Mr. Rappleyea said he had spoken only to loyal Republican contributors, none of whom have had business with the Power Authority. Both said they had done nothing to press people to contribute.
Mr. Rappleyea, whose annual state salary is $185,000, said he had been asked to be a co-chairman for the event several weeks before he knew that Mr. Pataki would name him to the Power Authority. Still, it has been widely known in Albany since the spring that Mr. Rapppleyea, formerly the Assembly minority leader, was being considered for the position.
In any case, he said, he would not put his name on future fund-raising invitations.
"I got caught in one of those time flips," he said.
Ms. Mucha, too, said Mr. Rappleyea's name had been added to the list while he was still Assembly minority leader. She said Mr. Neglia had been included because he is a longtime supporter of Mr. Pataki. She added that the practice would end there.
Mr. Neglia, whose annual state salary is $76,421, is listed on the invitation as a "general chair" of the event, a job that carries the responsibility of raising $10,000. Though originally appointed to the racing board by former Gov. Mario M. Cuomo, he is a Republican who supported Mr. Pataki in last year's race.
Asked whether some horse owners might attend the event to improve relations with him and his board, Mr. Neglia said: "I don't see it at all. I think it's just a reason to get together and meet with the Governor, to get the Governor to help the industry to thrive."
New York State law prohibits state officials from demanding contributions in exchange for government favors. But it does not otherwise restrict their fund-raising activities. By contrast, deputy mayors and commissioners in New York City are prohibited from soliciting campaign contributions for city candidates.
For state officials, "nothing is proscribed" under state law as regards political fund-raising, said Richard Rifkin, executive director of the State Ethics Commission. "There is a line somewhere, and I wish I could better define it, but I can't because the commission hasn't drawn it," he said.
State Senator Franz S. Leichter, a Manhattan Democrat, has proposed legislation to prevent top state officials from participating in campaign fund-raising. He said of the Saratoga event: "It's a way to put the arm on people in the industry. It's going to attract people who say, 'I better come if I'm going to have a good relationship with the Racing and Wagering Board."
The Democrats have also raised questions about the political activities of other Pataki administration officials with backgrounds in campaign fund-raising, including Economic Development Commissioner Charles A. Gargano, who helped raise more than $14 million for Mr. Pataki last year, and General Services Commissioner Peter W. Delaney, who did fund-raising for Westchester County Republicans.
The event Friday was timed to coincide with the 136th Traver's Stakes race on Saturday, which historically draws huge crowds of horse owners, corporate officials and well-heeled fans from around the state.
For a $250 contribution to Mr. Pataki's campaign account invitees can partake of an all-day buffet under white tents at the racetrack's paddock area. For $1,000, contributors will attend a more intimate evening reception with Mr. Pataki in a private room.
The event is just the latest in a string of large and small fund-raising gatherings this year for Mr. Pataki, who does not face re-election until 1998. As of July 11, the Governor had raised more than $1 million and had $937,891 on hand.
The list of chairmen for the Saratoga event also includes several corporate officials and lobbyists, including: Michael Smith, president of the New York State Bankers Association; Allan Dragone, president of the New York Racing Association; James Featherstonaugh, a lobbyist whose clients include soda companies and race tracks, and Kenneth Shapiro, a lobbyist whose clients include hospitals and health insurance companies.

HEADLINE: Initial Jobless Claims Up a Bit

BYLINE: Reuters 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Aug. 17

 BODY:
The number of Americans seeking first-time jobless benefits rose slightly last week, the Government reported today, but the closely watched four-week average of claims tumbled to the lowest level since March.
Initial claims for state unemployment pay rose by 6,000, to a seasonally adjusted 338,000 in the week ended last Saturday from a revised 332,000 the prior week, the Labor Department said. 
 The weekly total was just under Wall Street economists' forecasts for new applications of 340,000 in the week.
The four-week moving average for claims, viewed as a more reliable gauge of labor market conditions than the more volatile weekly figure, fell by 19,500 to 340,750 last week. It was the lowest since 340,250 in the week ended March 18.
The number of people receiving state jobless benefits in the week ended Aug. 5, the latest period for which those data are available, decreased by 20,000, to 2,599,000, from a revised 2,619,000 the prior week, the Labor Department said.

HEADLINE: CURRENCY MARKETS;
Dollar Ebbs vs. Mark and Yen On Profit Sales and Trade Data

BYLINE: By Bloomberg Business News 

 BODY:
The dollar retreated yesterday, weighed down by profit taking and by a report showing a wider than expected United States trade deficit.
Despite yesterday's decline, the dollar is up 3.8 percent against the Japanese yen and 2.7 percent against the German since Monday. It rose sharply after the central banks of the United States, Japan and Germany bought more than $1 billion in currency markets on Tuesday in a coordinated effort to lift its value. 
 The dollar fell yesterday after the Commerce Department reported that the trade deficit widened 2.4 percent, to $11.32 billion, in June. A larger trade deficit indicates that foreign exporters will have more dollars to convert to their domestic currencies.
"The dollar is coming off because some people thought the trade deficit would be a little smaller," said Earl Johnson, currency adviser at the Bank of Montreal/Harris Bank in Chicago. Economists had forecast a June deficit of $10.9 billion.
Preset orders to sell the dollar when it fell to 1.4730 marks and to 97.30 yen exacerbated the decline, currency traders said. The traders had purchased their dollars at lower levels and placed automatic orders with dealers to sell -- known as stop-loss orders -- if the dollar reached those thresholds.
"There were so many stop-losses," said Charles Spence, director of currency sales for Standard Chartered Bank. The selling of dollars, he said "just kept coming."
The dollar fell to lows of 1.4655 marks and 96.43 yen in afternoon trading in New York before rebounding. It settled at 97.25 yen, down from 97.93 yen on Wednesday, and at 1.4747 marks, down from 1.48. The British pound rose to $1.5460 from $1.5415.
Still, traders remain bullish on the dollar. Dollar-buying by the Federal Reserve and the Bank of Japan on July 7, and the coordinated action on Tuesday, have convinced many that the Governments of the world's most powerful economies are committed to strengthening the dollar.
"The dollar is well supported by psychology," Mr. Johnson of the Bank of Montreal said
Concern that central banks might start buying dollars on signs of weakness helped the dollar rebound from its lows yesterday, market participants said. "It takes a brave guy to sell dollars at levels where the central banks came in Tuesday," said Richard Koss, strategist for Maria F. Ramirez Inc., a money-management firm. The Fed began its purchases around 96.50 yen and 1.4580 marks that day, traders said.

HEADLINE: COMPANY REPORTS;
Deere Income Climbs 14.2%; Navistar Has Gain of 95%

BYLINE: By Reuters 

 BODY:
Two of the nation's largest heavy equipment makers posted higher earnings yesterday, but Wall Street was unimpressed, focusing more on signs that the companies' markets are weakening.
Deere & Company said its net income rose 14.2 percent in its fiscal third quarter. But its results were below analysts' expectations, and its stock fell $2.50, to $83.75. 
 And the Navistar International Corporation said its net income nearly doubled. But although those results exceeded analysts' estimates, its stock closed up only 37.5 cents, to $13.375.
Deere, the world's biggest farm equipment maker, reported net income of $180.1 million, or $2.07 a share, compared with $157.7 million, or $1.82 a share, in the 1994 quarter. Sales rose 17.4 percent, to $2.7 billion from $2.3 billion.
Yet its earnings were well below Wall Street expectations of about $2.20 a share.
Moreover, Deere said it expected its fourth-quarter earnings to fall short of last year's results because of moves planned for the quarter to cut inventories of service parts and dealer used goods.
But the Moline, Ill., company said it still projected record earnings for the 1996 fiscal year.
Deere "spent a lot of time trying to convince everyone that 1996 is going to be O.K.," said Blair Brumley, a Dain Bosworth analyst who participated in the company's conference call with analysts. "They're forecasting a strong farm economy and a soft landing, but I'm not prepared to buy that."
Meanwhile, Navistar reported its net income rose 95 percent in its third quarter ended July 31 to $39 million, or 43 cents ar share, from $20 million, or 17 cents a share. The results beat Wall Street's estimates of 34 cents a share.
The Chicago-based truck and diesel engine manufacturer said its revenues rose 21 percent, to $1.51 billion from $1.25 billion.
But analysts questioned whether demand was sustainable at levels seen during the most recent quarter.
William Cooke, an analyst with McDonald & Company, said there were signs the market for heavy trucks was deteriorating, noting that an independent industry research firm reported that cancellations exceeded new orders for large heavy- duty trucks during the first nine days of August.
"Navistar had a good quarter and will have a good fiscal year," Mr. Cooke said. "The concern is what's going to happen in 1996."
But Navistar said it remained positive, noting that although its industry was slowing down, it should continue to grow.
"We believe the drop in industry orders over the last few months was due to customers' uncertainty about the economy in 1996, and we expect to see good levels of retail sales next year," Navistar's chief executive, John Horne, said in a statement.
The company raised its 1995 fiscal year forecast for industrywide demand for medium and heavy trucks in the United States and Canada.

HEADLINE: America's Plan for Bosnian Peace

 BODY:
Croatian military gains and a newly energized American diplomacy have combined to create an opening for a negotiated Bosnian peace. The odds remain long, but the effort is worth making. Despite criticism yesterday by Senator Robert Dole, President Clinton is right to try.
In a lightning offensive two weeks ago, Croatian Government troops reshaped the Balkan battlefield. They evicted 50,000 rebel Serbian soldiers and 150,000 Serbian civilians from the Krajina region of western Croatia, bordering Bosnia. That left the larger part of Serbian holdings in Bosnia virtually surrounded by numerically superior Croatian and Bosnian troops. 
 The shift created a dangerous equation in which Croatia and Serbia, with the two strongest Balkan armies, could move on to partition Bosnia between them or clash in a full-scale war. But it also created at least a temporary opening for peace. The Clinton Administration has been quick to seize the opportunity, knowing that failure to achieve peace now could lead to American combat troops' fighting to protect a United Nations withdrawal by autumn.
American diplomats have crisscrossed Europe in recent days promoting a new version of the international peace plan that in effect awards 51 percent of Bosnian land to Muslim and Croat forces and 49 percent to Bosnian Serbs. Washington is pushing changes in the peace map that keep the 51-49 ratio but conform more closely to current battlefield realities, awarding the Serbs territory in eastern Bosnia in exchange for land around Sarajevo.
If the Bosnian Serbs reject the plan, Washington proposes that Western countries jointly lift the arms embargo on Bosnia, train Bosnian troops and hold off Serbian attacks with air strikes.
The first part of the plan, dealing with the map, has won general European approval and is now being negotiated with the Balkan countries themselves. The second part, dealing with possible enforcement, seems to have grudging support from Britain and France but is opposed by Russia.
If the use of external military pressure remains as doubtful as ever, internal military pressures on the Bosnian Serbs have sharply increased. Significantly, when Croatian troops swept through the Krajina region, Serbia's President, Slobodan Milosevic, held Yugoslavia's powerful army out of the battle. Apparently he now deems some rebel Serbian losses acceptable to win Yugoslavia relief from international economic sanctions.
If Mr. Milosevic throws his support behind the American plan, the Bosnian Serbs could find themselves in trouble if they persist in fighting. Left to their own resources, they can muster at most 135,000 troops against more than 300,000 available to the increasingly well armed Croatian-Bosnian alliance.
The Bosnian Government has accepted the principle of 51-49 partition for a long time. But it resists proposed changes to the map, particularly giving up its claim to Gorazde, still in Government hands. With the changed military balance, some in the Government may feel tempted to fight on for a better deal.
The United States should never lose sight of the fact that Bosnia is the main victim of this war. If the Bosnian Government rejects the new map, Washington should not try to bully it into acceptance. But Administration diplomats can argue in good conscience that Washington's proposal offers Bosnia a chance to avoid further killing and an alternative to growing military dependence on a Croatian ally that may one day try to swallow it.
After two and a half years of policy gyrations and humiliations culminating in a Congressional revolt last month over lifting the arms embargo on Bosnia, President Clinton has correctly concluded that the United States does better by actively shaping its own Balkan diplomatic initiatives than by deferring to Europe.
Even without American troops on the ground, Washington has more diplomatic influence than any other outside power. Now, at a critical moment, Mr. Clinton has decided to put that influence behind a serious peace plan. That is a welcome development.

The Pros and Cons Of Call-In Democracy

BYLINE: By MICHIKO KAKUTANI 

 BODY:

THE ELECTRONIC REPUBLIC
Reshaping Democracy in the Information Age
By Lawrence K. Grossman
290 pages. A 20th Century Fund Book/Viking.
$24.95.
Among Newt Gingrich's first acts as Speaker of the House this year was the unveiling of a vast new electronic archive named Thomas (after that great avatar of direct democracy, Thomas Jefferson), which would make every bill submitted to Congress and every speech made in the House or Senate immediately available to users of the Internet. "There is a pervasive cynicism in the culture of Washington," he declared. "What this is going to do is get information beyond the cynicism of the elite." 
 Disenchantment with Washington and populist efforts to make the government more responsive to the electorate's will are nothing new of course, as the expanding use of ballot initiatives, the growing popularity of term limits and the enhanced visibility of call-in talk shows all attest. In his timely new book, Lawrence K. Grossman -- the former head of PBS and the former president of NBC News -- argues that these trends will accelerate rapidly in the future, as advances in telecommunications technology enable more and more Americans "to participate directly in making the laws and policies by which they are governed."
Mr. Grossman's book, "The Electronic Republic," is partly a historical consideration of the pros and cons of direct (as opposed to representative) democracy, partly an assessment of the consequences that television and newer technology (like the Internet, E-mail, faxes and interactive computers) have already had on voters and partly a set of recommendations for making sensible use of this technology. Although many of Mr. Grossman's observations about the perils of television -- its taste for sensationalism, its emphasis on personality, its susceptibility to spin doctors and demagogues -- are terribly familiar, he does a nimble job of putting these matters in context with broader historical developments and using his own experience in the business to illuminate his points.
Because television appears to give its viewers "an unmediated, firsthand view of the world outside of their neighborhood," Mr. Grossman says, it has encouraged people "to come to their own conclusions about what should be done and which candidates to support" with little help from "political parties, journalists, experts or most other authority figures." Ross Perot -- whose 1992 Presidential campaign initially bypassed the mainstream press and the traditional two-party system -- took advantage of this development to make a big splash on the national political scene, and Bill Clinton, too, tried to incorporate this strategy into his campaign, with appearances on television and radio talk shows.
As Mr. Grossman sees it, the American people are rapidly becoming "the new fourth branch of government." Politicians are increasingly reluctant to take stands on important issues without first consulting with poll takers and professional spin doctors, and now govern in a perpetual campaign mode. As a result, Mr. Grossman argues, policy is harder to carry out: "The President's high public visibility narrows his policy options, limits his 'wiggle room' to negotiate and reduces the time he has to put his programs in place and bring the people on board."
"It is no accident," he writes, "that during the era of television's dominance we have had 'gridlock government,' the first Presidential resignation and three one-term Presidents so far. Only Ronald Reagan, a professional actor, has served two full terms. In contrast to earlier days, when Presidents could lead based on their own strong conviction of what had to be done, the tendency in the era of television is for a President to feel compelled to keep in step with public opinion as the people follow the major events on television day in and day out."
Unlike Federalists like Alexander Hamilton, who warned that "the people are turbulent and changing; they seldom judge and determine right," Mr. Grossman says that recent studies (like "The Rational Public," a 1992 analysis of national policy preferences by Benjamin I. Page and Robert Y. Shapiro) have convinced him that "public judgments have tended to be no worse than the judgments of the political elite." His worries about the rising power of public opinion have less to do, then, with the public's innate wisdom than with concerns about the sort of information it is routinely exposed to.
Mr. Grossman points out that the telecommunications industry is increasingly controlled by a shrinking number of global companies that can act as "gatekeepers to the flow of ideas and information," a development underscored by the recent announcement of Westinghouse's intent to acquire CBS and Disney's to purchase Capital Cities/ABC. Mr. Grossman also observes that wealthy politicians and special interest groups have an unfair advantage in buying influential television ad time and that " 'immediate reward news' -- stories involving corruption, accidents, disasters, crime, sexual deviance and social gossip -- has largely displaced 'delayed reward news' -- stories involving critically important economic, social and political issues."
So what is to be done about life in the emerging "electronic republic"? Echoing Mr. Gingrich, who suggested that the poorest Americans be given a tax credit to buy laptop computers, Mr. Grossman argues that Government might have to provide subsidies to insure that all citizens have access to the "basic telecommunications equipment they will need to participate in the public sphere." He suggests that noncommercial radio and television be "converted into a vigorous, independent, well-supported local and national interactive public telecommunications system" and that all political candidates accepting matching taxpayer campaign funds be required to participate in televised debates.
The reader may not agree with all of Mr. Grossman's suggestions, but he lays them out in strong, clear language, eschewing both the naive optimism about technology that has colored so much American thinking in the past and the doom-saying of many contemporary critics. His book not only illustrates Marshall McLuhan's belief that "as the speed of information increases," politics tends to move toward the "immediate involvement of the entire community in the central acts of decision," but also Toqueville's prescient observation that American democracy "is constantly in the process of democratizing itself further."

HEADLINE: INTERNATIONAL BUSINESS;
Drop in Yen's Value Heartens Japanese Exporters

BYLINE: By ANDREW POLLACK 

DATELINE: TOKYO, Friday, Aug. 18

 BODY:
A decade ago, Japan began coping with the effects of the Plaza Accord, an agreement reached by the major industrial nations that caused the yen's value against the dollar to double in only two years. The agreement, still seared in the nation's memory, made Japanese exports less competitive and began an exodus of factories to less expensive sites abroad.
So perhaps it is no surprise that Japan now feels as if a giant weight has been lifted from its shoulders by what some analysts are calling a reverse Plaza Accord -- the concerted intervention in the currency markets this week by the central banks of the United States, Japan and Germany that has helped weaken the yen and strengthen the dollar to its highest levels since February. 
 Analysts and executives said that if the dollar stabilized at around its current level of nearly 100 yen, Japan's meager corporate profits would expand, exports would rise and the nation's recovery from a four-year economic slump would resume -- a recovery sidelined by the dollar's sharp fall and the yen's rise earlier this year.
Such expectations have fueled a steep rally on the Tokyo stock market this week. Although stocks took a breather Thursday and this morning, with the key Nikkei average of 225 issues slipping 9.03 points and 117.21 points respectively, the average jumped 706.01 points, or 4.1 percent, on Wednesday -- the second-largest daily gain this year -- and 536.15 points, or 3.2 percent, on Tuesday. The index stands above 18,000 for the first time since February.
Spurred by the central banks' intervention on Tuesday, the dollar has traded as high as 99.05 yen in Tokyo, its best level since Feb. 10 and 24 percent above an intraday low of 79.80 yen reached on April 19. In late Tokyo trading, it was quoted at 97.88 yen. Weakened by the latest American trade data, the dollar settled at 97.25 yen in New York on Thursday.
A weaker yen helps Japanese companies two ways: by making their exports less expensive in terms of other currencies, and by increasing the number of yen produced when sales made in other currencies are converted into yen.
For many of Japan's big electronics, automobile and steel companies, the difference between 85 yen to the dollar and a stronger 98 yen to the dollar is the difference between loss and profit on their exports.
A recent survey by Nihon Keizai Shimbun, Japan's leading financial newspaper, found that the typical break-even rate for exports by large manufacturers is 95 yen to the dollar.
The dollar is hardly expected to return to its levels of 1985, when $1 could buy 264 yen. That was the year of the Plaza Accord -- named for the New York hotel where the deal to reduce the dollar's value was reached by the big economic powers. So the dollar's recent rebound has nowhere near the ramifications of that agreement, which quickly cut the value of the dollar -- reaching as low as 122 yen by 1987.
While the weaker yen is helpful to Japanese industry, analysts and executives cautioned that even if the dollar rose above 100 yen, which many consider possible in the near future, such a rise would not be a cure-all for the economy. Japanese financial institutions are still mired in bad debt. And many industries, particularly the auto makers, suffer from excess production capacity.
"It's not going to be the magic bullet," Jesper Koll, economist for J. P. Morgan in Tokyo, said of the dollar's rise. "It's not going to propel Japan toward 2.8 percent to 3 percent growth." He estimated that Japan's economy would grow only four-tenths of 1 percent in 1995 and 1.5 percent in 1996.
In addition, the current exchange rates look good only in comparison with the dollar's basement levels of earlier this year. In the middle of 1994, when the dollar first dropped below 100 yen, even that level was considered extremely troublesome for Japanese industry.
Last year, "when the yen hit 100, everybody screamed" because the Japanese currency was so strong, said Yukio Ozawa, deputy general manager for investor relations at the Sony Corporation. "Now the yen goes down to 98 or 99, and people are asking, 'What do you think about that cheap yen?' "
At 100 yen to the dollar, many Japanese exports would still be uncompetitive abroad. And foreign beef, cars and clothing would still have a price advantage over domestic products in the Japanese market, meaning that imports could continue to make inroads.
Nor are Japanese companies likely to alter their strategies of moving manufacturing offshore, though the pace might slow a little. At 100 yen to the dollar, Japanese wages are far higher than those in Southeast Asia. And the industrial migration is being driven not just by cost considerations but by a desire to more easily serve the emerging markets of Asia.
Japanese companies are not likely to sharply lower their export prices, even if they become convinced that the new currency rates are here to stay. Fearful of losing market share, they never raised their prices far enough to fully compensate for the yen's rise.
Still, the recent weakening of the yen could sharply improve the profit of Japan's export-focused auto and electronics companies, which can gain or lose millions of dollars in revenue and profit for each one yen shift in the exchange rate.
Sony, for instance, reported last week that operating profit in the most recent quarter fell 50 percent from a year earlier because of the yen's sharp rise. Had exchange rates remained constant, the company estimated, operating profit would instead have increased 85 percent.
Of course, a declining yen is not good for everyone. Companies that depend on imports, such as electric utilities, which buy imported oil in now more valuable dollars, will have to deal with rising costs.
For Japan Airlines, which began hiring foreign flight attendants and pilots because Japanese ones were too expensive, the high yen has made it difficult to compete with foreign airlines. But it has also meant that record numbers of Japanese are flying abroad on Japan Airlines because taking a vacation overseas has become less expensive than staying in Japan.
The profitability of exports varies widely by company and product. At Hitachi Ltd., for instance, equipment for electric power plants cannot be exported profitably at 100 yen to the dollar, but computer memory chips, now in short supply, were profitable at 80 yen.
Japanese companies have been working feverishly to cut costs, so that companies that could not make money last year at 100 yen to the dollar might be able to record profits in 1995. Indeed, Japanese companies, given enough time, have been remarkably adept at adjusting to an almost constant rise of the yen since 1970, when $1 bought 360 yen.
Ultimately, the fall of the yen could lead to a renewed rise in Japan's huge trade surplus by making Japanese exports more attractive. But Mr. Koll, the economist at J. P. Morgan, said he did not think the surplus would balloon again because the high yen had already carved a path into Japan for imports.

HEADLINE: 2 Associated With Clintons Face Charges

BYLINE: By STEPHEN LABATON 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Aug. 17

 BODY:
A Federal grand jury today indicted two Whitewater business partners of Bill and Hillary Rodham Clinton, as well as the Governor of Arkansas, on 21 counts of fraud, conspiracy and making false statements in obtaining millions of dollars of federally backed loans in the 1980's.
The indictment, handed up by a Federal grand jury in Little Rock, Ark., charged that the two partners, James B. McDougal and his former wife, Susan, had concocted a series of fraudulent loans from Madison Guaranty Savings and Loan, an Arkansas savings association at the center of the investigation into the Whitewater land venture. Madison, which was owned and operated by the McDougals, collapsed in 1989 at a cost to taxpayers of more than $60 million. 
Gov. Jim Guy Tucker of Arkansas, who was indicted in June on separate charges, was named in 11 new counts today. In the 1980's, Mr. Tucker was a lawyer and businessman who did legal work for Madison and borrowed money from it.
Neither President Clinton nor Mrs. Clinton were named in the indictment. In a statement issued in Little Rock, the independent counsel in the Whitewater inquiry, Kenneth W. Starr, noted that the indictment "does not charge criminal wrongdoing by President William Jefferson Clinton or First Lady Hillary Rodham Clinton." Prosecutors in the counsel's office declined to say whether there would be any further indictments, noting that the investigation was continuing.
Part of today's indictment involves a $300,000 federally backed loan made by a former municipal judge who has accused Mr. Clinton of improperly pressuring him twice into making the 1986 loan to Mrs. McDougal. The judge, David L. Hale, has already pleaded guilty on two felony counts in the case and has been cooperating with investigators.
Mr. Hale is expected to be one of the Government's most important witnesses against the McDougals and Mr. Tucker, and his account that Mr. Clinton pressed him to make the loan is likely to arise at any trial. Mr. Clinton has disputed Mr. Hale's version of events. The President has said he does not recall meeting with Mr. Hale, and he has denied putting any pressure on him.
The White House issued a statement after the indictment was released, noting what Mr. Starr said concerning the Clintons and adding, "We continue to cooperate fully and hope that the independent counsel will conclude his inquiry expeditiously."
The Clintons sold their interest in Whitewater to Mr. McDougal in 1992. In recently concluded House hearings on the subject, Republicans said the couple had been the beneficiaries of a corrupt scheme run by Arkansas insiders at taxpayers' expense.
Whatever the outcome of his investigation, Mr. Starr is expected to give the special court that appointed him a report about what prosecutors have discovered about the Clintons' financial dealings in Arkansas.
The inquiry is rooted in questions raised in the 1992 campaign about whether Mr. McDougal had improperly used money from his savings association to prop up Whitewater, a land development venture begun in the summer before Mr. Clinton was first elected Governor. The investment quickly turned sour.
The indictment today, however, focused not on Whitewater but on Madison and on a series of loans issued by Mr. Hale's company, Capital Management Services, including a $300,000 loan to Mrs. McDougal.
That loan, which was never repaid and had to be absorbed by the Federal Government, indirectly helped the Whitewater Development Company. It went to repay other debts that Mr. McDougal had drawn on to prop up the Whitewater Development Company, which had been hemorrhaging in the 1980's, investigators said.
The indictment is silent about what role, if any, Mr. Clinton played in securing the loan.
"In or about March and April 1986, defendant James B. McDougal, and others known to the grand jury, including David L. Hale, prepared paperwork and took other steps to arrange for defendant Susan H. McDougal to receive the proceeds from a false and fraudulent loan," the indictment said.
Mr. Hale's lending company was part of a program of the Small Business Administration designed to lend money to socially and economically disadvantaged borrowers. But he has said it became "a piggy bank" for a clique of Democratic insiders in Arkansas in the mid-1980's.
Mr. McDougal once told one of his lending officers that he considered Madison "a candy store," Federal records say. Mr. McDougal was acquitted in 1990 on bank fraud charges related to his control of Madison, but those involved transactions not in today's indictment.
Mr. McDougal said today that he would vigorously contest the charges. "I've been expecting it for a long time," he said in a brief telephone interview today. "I intend to defend myself vigorously and to prove myself innocent of any crimes whatsoever."
Mr. Tucker's spokeswoman, Max Parker, said he would have no comment about the new indictment. Bobby McDaniel, Mrs. McDougal's lawyer, said that his client had expected the indictment and that she intended to contest the charges.
Mr. McDougal was named in 19 counts and Mrs. McDougal was named in 8. Some of the counts named more than one defendant, and almost all carry maximum sentences of five years in prison each and fines of up to $250,000.
As described in the indictment, Madison and Capital Management were improperly used to reward the defendants or those who would help help them out. The defendants reaped the benefits, while the lending institutions, insured by the Federal government, bore all the risks.
The indictment said the financial dealings of the McDougals and Mr. Tucker had been concealed through a series of fraudulently structured transactions that hid the true owners of various assets.
It portrays the three as requiring a "continuous stream of loans and financing" of their investments and to pay off other business loans. To keep their dealings from being criticized by Federal examiners or to insure that they not appear to violate state or Federal regulations, the indictment said, the "defendants structured transactions and generated fraudulent paperwork."
The fraudulent transactions at issue in the indictment include eight loans of more than $3 million from Madison and Capital in the mid-1980's. One deal involves property in Little Rock, where various fronts were used "for the purpose of generating false profits, and providing cash benefits to defendant Jim Guy Tucker," the indictment said.
As Madison spun out of control, Mr. McDougal was particularly concerned about an examination of Madison in late 1985 and early 1986 and took steps to conceal the true condition of the institution from Federal examiners, the indictment said.

HEADLINE: Mrs. Clinton Should Sit Out Beijing Meeting;
Talk, Don't Shove

 BODY:
To the Editor:
Walter Russell Mead's "Danger of Bigger Trouble With the Chinese" (Op-Ed, Aug. 15) is one of the few balanced, thoughtful pieces on China in your paper in the last few months. 
 Recent China-bashing, led in Congress by a curious coalition of extreme right- and left-wingers and fueled by biased reporting and editorializing, has not only made the Beijing Government more defensive and xenophobic, but has also alienated an overwhelming majority of a new generation of Western-trained Chinese scholars and scientists.
It is high time United States political leaders recognize that the deterioration of United States-China relations is hurting the prospects of political liberalization in China and pushing this generation of Chinese elites to the embrace of nationalism. To most of us, calls for containment of China cannot help reinforce our suspicion of a deep-rooted Western unwillingness to accept China's rise to great-power status.
While my generation recognizes the imperative for China to liberalize its political and economic systems further, we know from experience that the most effective way of accomplishing this is through cooperation and dialogue, not threats and confrontation.

HEADLINE: A Coup for the King

BYLINE: By YOUSSEF M. IBRAHIM 

DATELINE: AMMAN, Jordan, Aug. 16

 BODY:
The defection of a top Iraqi military official to Jordan last week may tantalize the West with the possibility of Iraqi military secrets, but it has already handed numerous tangible rewards to King Hussein. Aside from expressions of good will from President Clinton and deep gratitude from Israel there are signs that Saudi Arabia and other Arab countries are poised to end their five-year boycott of Jordan.
The King -- who has run this country for 43 years, escaped two dozen assassination attempts and maneuvered skillfully through the byzantine world of Middle Eastern politics -- has played the defection of a caravan from Iraq's ruling family for all it's worth. Indeed, in opening the door to the Iraqi defectors, King Hussein seems to have let in all sorts of political and economic opportunities at virtually no risk. 
 By calling President Clinton immediately to inform him that he had granted political asylum to Lieut. Gen. Hussein Kamel, his wife, and other family members and aides, the King earned points with Washington whose economic support he sorely needs.
And in suggesting that Jordan may need protection in the highly unlikely event Iraq should attack in response to the defections, the Jordanian monarch handed Mr. Clinton a free chance to show, once more, how tough the American President can be on Iraq.
The fact that Iraq is falling apart economically and militarily and is in no position to attack anyone, let alone Jordan, which has become its lifeline to the world during Iraq's isolation under United Nations economic sanctions, matters very little for all parties concerned.
On Sunday, the King turned around to give Yediot Aharonot, Israel's largest circulation newspaper, his first public comment on the episode, including his account of persuading General Kamel of the need for Iraq and the whole Arab world to make peace with Israel. This unquestionably further endeared the King to Israel's Prime Minister, Yitzhak Rabin, whose lobbying in Washington has already brought Jordan economic relief from debts it owed the United States Government.
On Tuesday the Israeli Interior Minister, Moshe Shahal, said his country would do what was necessary to defend Jordan "with great pleasure."
King Hussein also received Prince Turki al-Faisal, the Saudi chief of intelligence, who flew in a hurry to Amman over the weekend to seek the monarch's permission to talk to General Kamel, who is both son-in-law and cousin to the Iraqi President and who was in charge of Iraq's war machine for several years. Permission was, of course, granted with royal dispatch, marking a new-found warmth in Jordanian-Saudi relations.
Only a month ago, the Saudis were responding with open contempt to Jordan's relentless effort to mend fences after its support of Iraq during the Gulf war. When the Jordanian Foreign Minister, Abdul Karim al-Kabariti, flew to Saudi Arabia to meet the Saudi Foreign Minister, Prince Saudi al-Faisal, the Prince pointedly told reporters at the airport that the Jordanian official was not invited but rather had asked if he might come.
This week it was announced in Amman that Mr. Kabariti flew back to Saudi Arabia, this time arrange what has been billed as "the first summit meeting" between King Fahd and King Hussein since the Persian Gulf war. Jordan has desperately been seeking to reopen the Arab Gulf markets for the goods and services it once sold to a now largely bankrupt Iraq.
Further "reconciliations," as the Arab press calls these episodes, are expected with the Emir of Kuwait and other Arab Gulf rulers who have also not been on speaking terms with the King since the Gulf war.
These maneuvers "prove King Hussein is still the political 'professional,' " Galal Dwedar, editor in chief of the Egyptian mass circulation daily Al Akhbar, wrote this week.
"His mistakes in the Gulf war have not prevented him from practicing this skill with great intelligence and determination to make up for his losses, and he has succeeded," Mr. Dwedar wrote in a front page editorial.
Back in 1990 and 1991 during the Gulf crisis, the King whose kingdom survives largely on the kindness of others, was Iraq's closest strategic, economic and political ally. At that time, the alliance brought Jordan tens of billions of dollars in financial aid from and trade with Iraq. But Iraq's defeat in the war left both countries isolated.
But today, the talk among average citizens in Jordan, not to mention foreign diplomats and the King's top advisers, is that Iraq is hardly capable of maintaining internal order, let alone either aiding or attacking Jordan.
"It is nice to be loved by the Americans," a former political adviser to the King said in a conversation, on condition of anonymity. "We need the American embrace to impress the Israelis and the Arabs. It helps in the quest to improve our image in the region, so what's wrong with that."
The catalyst of this conversion, General Kamel, continues to remain in hiding after a news conference on Saturday in which he vowed to try to overthrow his father-in-law, Saddam Hussein. Since he left with his wife, Raghad, and his brother, Col. Saddam Kamel, another military aide who is married to another of President Hussein's daughters, Rana, infighting in Iraq's extended first family appears to be worsening, if unconfirmed reports from the Iraqi opposition are true.
Jordanian officials say that, if anything, King Hussein is betting that the end is near for Saddam Hussein's Government and is preparing to reap any benefits of a fall by positioning himself now as a champion of reform in Iraq, despite the two countries' history as strategic allies.

HEADLINE: CHINA WAR GAMES VIEWED AS TACTIC TO PRESS TAIWAN

BYLINE: By PATRICK E. TYLER 

DATELINE: BEIJING, Aug. 18

 BODY:
With its second military exercise near Taiwan this summer under way, China is preparing an escalating series of naval, air and missile force maneuvers intended to bring Taiwan's political leadership to heel, American military officials and foreign diplomats say.
Plans for the new exercises over the coming weeks and months have broad support among Chinese military and civilian officials and represent a distinct turn away from a resumption of dialogue with Taiwan, which China believes is forsaking its adherence to the principle of "one China" and pursuing world recognition as an independent nation. 
 China is putting more emphasis on military options because its leaders have concluded -- wrongly in the view of many analysts -- that President Lee Teng-hui, who has pursued a more visible and independent global role for Taiwan, can be weakened politically by such a campaign.
"It's foolish, but that is where they are headed," said a China specialist who recently completed consultations in Taiwan, Beijing and Washington. "China is determined to remove Lee Teng-hui from power and they are going to ratchet up the military pressure until they accomplish that."
Western military analysts and diplomats fear that events could spiral out of control, leading to deliberate or accidental military conflict between China and Taiwan. This in turn would create dangerous political and military choices for the United States, which seeks good relations with both Taiwan and China but would find it difficult to abandon Taiwan.
At risk also is the economic integration between the economies of Taiwan and China, where Taiwanese businessmen have invested $20 billion in industries, part of a booming trading relationship that would be costly to unhinge.
On Tuesday, China opened its second round of military exercises off Taiwan with air and naval missile firings in the East China Sea as well as naval artillery tests. They were conducted in an area 80 to 100 miles north of Taiwan.
"The exercise this time is different," Taiwan's Defense Minister, Chiang Chung-ling, said in Taipei. "They have air and sea forces in joint combat exercises in addition to guided-missile tests and artillery firing."
In addition, more than 100 Chinese fishing boats were reported this week to be entering Taiwan waters off Matsu Island, just off the mainland province of Fujian. Such provocations in the past have drawn fire from Taiwan military forces.
China's neighbors already are nervous over the territorial of Beijing in the South China Sea and the buildup of its rapid-response military forces intended to fight small-scale wars away from its borders.
Prime Minister Li Peng of China, in a meeting on Thursday with Senator J. Bennett Johnston, a Louisiana Democrat, continued Beijing's hard line on Taiwan, referring to China's sovereignty over the island as a "core principle" involving China's "territorial integrity and the cause of reunification."
Details gleaned of Chinese military planning are being held closely by United States officials, but they have forced Pentagon planners to consider what military response American forces in the Pacific would make if an inadvertent or deliberate clash occurred between Chinese and Taiwanese forces, or if China sought to disrupt Taiwan's trade by blocking its sea lanes, American officials say.
"Accidents happen when armed forces are maneuvering near each other and they run the risk of war by inadvertent surprises," said CharlesW. Freeman Jr., who until last year was an Assistant Secretary of Defense in charge of Asian policy.
Open conflict in the Taiwan Strait would also force Japan and South Korea to weigh their own responses since American military units on their soil could become involved in resupplying Taiwan.
"Put simply," said John W. Lewis, a longtime China scholar at Stanford University who has consulted with Chinese military leaders here this summer, "the stakes for peace and stability in Asia are quite high."
"The danger is the risk of a full-blown military crisis that arises from escalating military bluster on both sides of the Taiwan Strait or from some accident or miscalculation among military forces that are no longer communicating well in an increasingly inflamed political environment."
Even as the threat of a military crisis increases, American officials are worried about other factors that could add to the tension.
*Continued Chinese military pressure is likely to lead to requests from Taiwan to its allies in Congress for major new arms sales, including submarines and ballistic missile defense systems.
*United States officials believe they may be only weeks or months away from proving irrefutably that China shipped M-11 ballistic missiles to Pakistan in violation of its commitment not to do so, thereby triggering a legal requirement for the Clinton Administration to impose new sanctions on China.
*The continued detention of Harry Wu, the Chinese-American human rights advocate, and increasing repression aimed at China's dissidents, is working against the restoration of normal communication and ambassadorial relations, which were effectively downgraded in June when ambassadors were called home from both capitals.
*If Mr. Lee becomes the first democratically elected President of Taiwan in elections next March, Clinton Administration officials believe they will face irresistible pressure from Congress to invite him to Washington, an act that would enrage Beijing further.
With concern deepening over possible military conflict in the Taiwan Strait, a number of China specialists and former Government officials from the Carter, Reagan and Bush Administrations are mobilizing efforts to urge Congress and the Clinton Administration to come to terms on a common strategy toward China and Taiwan.
Such efforts are being complicated by the growing ideological debate over China policy, as a number of members of Congress see irreconcilable differences with Beijing over its human rights record and weapons proliferation activities. Some have called for "containment" strategies and for elevated relations with Taipei.
"United States policy since 1972 has sought to build peace, stability and prosperity between China and Taiwan, and this policy has yielded tremendous results in nurturing economic and political reforms and in creating an environment for Beijing and Taipei to integrate their economies, set aside 45 years of enmity and negotiate their own future under the 'one-China' banner." said Professor Lewis, an informal adviser to Defense Secretary William J. Perry.
"This policy is now dangerously close to being reversed."
Yet at the same time, a growing number of Americans and members of Congress believe that the United States cannot morally ignore the democratic flowering on Taiwan, which only began to emerge a decade ago from a long period of political repression and human rights abuses.

HEADLINE: U.S. Action in Persian Gulf Is Said to Seek Iraqi's Ouster

BYLINE: By ERIC SCHMITT 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Aug. 18

 BODY:
American military preparations in the Persian Gulf and a high-level diplomatic mission to the Middle East are aimed at speeding the ouster of President Saddam Hussein as well as responding to recent Iraqi troop movements, Administration officials said today.
The Pentagon said today that it was moving up a scheduled training exercise in Kuwait to later this month. About 1,400 soldiers from the First Cavalry Division at Fort Hood, Tex., will deploy to Kuwait, where M1-A1 battle tanks and Bradley fighting vehicles are in place. 
 The American troops will join Kuwaiti forces for about three weeks of live-fire training in the desert. The exercise, which is conducted twice annually, had been scheduled for late October.
Administration officials said that the military precautions and a mission by two senior American diplomats to Jordan, Egypt and other Middle East countries are being undertaken in the hope of bringing pressure Mr. Hussein.
"If I were sitting in Baghdad that's what I'd be thinking," said one American official who follows Iraq.
But Administration officials said the United States has no preference for a successor to Mr. Hussein, and would have little influence even if it did. While the defection of the Iraqi leader's two sons-in-law to Jordan last week certainly damaged his political base, Mr. Hussein has faced political pressures many times before and survived.
"We're trying to speed the downfall of Saddam Hussein," said Phebe Marr, a Middle East specialist at the National Defense University. "But we can't go in there and do this. We're not in a position to pull strings. The only thing we can do is develop an atmosphere."
United States officials acknowledge they walk a fine line in their attempts to hasten Mr. Hussein's ouster without leading to the disintegration of Iraq.
One goal of the American delegation, which includes Assistant Secretary of State Robert Pelletreau and Mark Parris, the National Security Council's senior aide on the Middle East, will be to speed a reconciliation between Saudi Arabia and Jordan, a move that would make it easier for King Hussein to curtail economic links with Iraq.
American officials said today that the two diplomats had urged Jordan to stop accepting supplies of Iraqi oil that provides Baghdad with hard currency. It is unclear, however, whether the Jordanian leader will agree since Amman must rely on Iraqi oil shipments because of the King's rift with Saudi Arabia.
Kuwait and Saudi Arabia cut off trade with Jordan after the King supported Iraq in the Persian Gulf war.
After meeting with Jordanian officials earlier this week, the American delegation flew to Cairo today for talks with Egyptian officials. It is expected to travel to the Persian Gulf region this weekend.
The Pentagon's decision to move up the training exercise by more than a month came after Gen. J. H. Binford Peay 3d, the head of the United States Central Command, received approval from the Kuwaiti Prime Minister, Sheik Saad al-Abdulla al-Sabah, this week.
A senior military official said the exercise will start in the next 10 days at Camp Doha, a training site on the outskirts of Kuwait City. "It takes about a week to draw the equipment," he said. "We exercise for about three weeks. We take the equipment, wash it down, put it back from whence we got it in its storage facilities and redeploy. So the whole thing takes in the neighborhood of four to six weeks."
The exercise is one of several steps the Pentagon has ordered since the Iraqi defections. Others include sending ships with tanks and equipment for 22,000 marines and soldiers to the gulf and moving warships closer to the region.
American military officials have expressed growing concern since the defections that a series of "unusual training activities" involving Iraqi Army, air defense, special forces and Republican Guard units could presage an attack on Kuwait and Saudi Arabia.
Two Republican Guard units, the Hammurabi and Medina divisions, have been practicing mobilizing their garrisoned forces more effectively, something the forces did poorly last fall when more than 10,000 Iraqi troops menaced the Kuwaiti border before eventually withdrawing.
American intelligence officials said today there were only minor changes in the Iraqi troop movements within the last 24 hours.
In Baghdad today, the top United Nations weapons inspector said Iraq had revealed new details about its clandestine weapons program. The official, Rolf Ekeus, said sudden cooperation appeared to be linked to the defection of the country's leading weapons official.
Mr. Hussein earlier threatened to cut off all contact with the United Nations inspectors and send forces into Kuwait and Saudi Arabia if the United Nations did not lift its sanctions against Iraq when they come up for renewal next month.

HEADLINE: HOW EVENTS DREW U.S. INTO BALKANS

BYLINE: By STEPHEN ENGELBERG 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Aug. 18

 BODY:
Early on a hot July night President Bill Clinton was bent over the practice green in the backyard of the White House, missing putts and once again venting his frustration over Bosnia.
The Administration was already in the middle of a high-level review of its policy, and Mr. Clinton was impatient for some results. Looking ahead to September, and the likely withdrawal of United Nations peacekeeping forces, Mr. Clinton told a small group of aides: "The status quo is not acceptable. We've got to really dig in and think about this." 
 That episode, and a series of conversations in July between the President and his senior aides, signaled something new. After nearly three years of allowing the European allies to define the limits of American policy, Mr. Clinton was ready for a new approach that has suddenly transformed the United States into the acknowledged leader in shaping a settlement.
On Aug. 7, a day after Croatia's blitzkrieg offensive overwhelmed the Serbian army occupying Krajina, Mr. Clinton approved a new plan for Bosnia that offered enticements to the combatants if they signed a peace accord and threatened punishments for all sides if they chose to fight on.
Senior Administration officials said the more intense American involvement stems both from the political imperatives of the upcoming Presidential campaign and from the shifting balance of power in the Balkans. It marks a new personal engagement by Mr. Clinton on an issue that has seized his attention only episodically, but that aides say has come to bedevil him in recent months.
"The bottom line is: If the United States doesn't lead, it doesn't happen," said one official.
Prospects for the Administration's peace plan remain uncertain, but it has quickly become the only negotiation taken seriously by the parties. Bosnian officials in Sarajevo this week refused to meet with Carl Bildt, the European envoy. The President of Serbia, Slobodan Milosevic, has told diplomats that he will deal only with the Americans. Britain has praised the American plan, and even France, where President Jacques Chirac a few weeks ago stole the spotlight by demanding tougher action against the Serbs, has welcomed the American initiative.
Under the proposal, Serbia would get relief from crippling Western economic sanctions in exchange for recognizing Bosnia, Croatia and Macedonia. The Bosnian-Croatian federation, which controls only 30 percent of the country, would end up with about 50 percent of the territory and would receive reconstruction aid. If the Bosnian Serbs balked, the West would arm the Bosnian Government forces, launch air strikes, and permit soldiers from Islamic nations to replace the departing United Nations peacekeepers.
The Clinton Administration's new approach on Bosnia has ended three years in which Washington largely deferred to its European allies on how to cope with the conflict.
Time and again, the United States proposed tougher military steps. Most times, the European allies resisted, noting that the United States did not have peacekeeping troops in Bosnia facing retaliation from the Serbs. As long as the United States had no troops in Bosnia, a senior official said, Mr. Clinton was left in the uncomfortable position of "leading from behind."
Several factors have combined to change that dynamic. Croatia's recent victory over the Serbian rebels in Krajina sowed disarray in the Serbian ranks, and opened the door to a possible settlement. The prospect of spending yet another winter hunkered down in Bosnia made the Europeans less willing to continue their approach of "muddle through."
And Mr. Clinton's senior advisers have come to see the Bosnia issue as a political time bomb that could go off in the 1996 campaign. Some fear the Administration's entire foreign policy record will ultimately be judged on the outcome of the Bosnia crisis.
Senior Administration officials believe Mr. Clinton is likely to be forced to send American troops to Bosnia within the next year, either to help the United Nations force withdraw or to police a peace plan.
With that in mind, Administration officials have sought to forge a policy that puts the United States more in control of events. If American troops are going to Bosnia, the officials said, their deployment should be under circumstances and timing dictated by Washington, not the European allies or the Bosnian Serbs.
The nightmare scenario for the White House, several officials said, would be for the United Nations force to stagger through another winter and then ask for American help with its withdrawal next spring, just as the presidential campaign is heating up.
"I don't think the President relishes going into the 1996 election hostage to fortune in the Balkans, with the Bosnian Serbs able to bring us deeper into a war," one senior official said.
The White House also sees another pressing reason for action. Administration officials hope to show significant progress toward a settlement by early September -- before Congress returns from its summer recess and moves to override Mr. Clinton's veto of legislation lifting the embargo on arms sales to the Bosnian Government.
Senate Majority Leader Bob Dole, the measure's chief advocate, is a front-runner for the Republican presidential nomination and has vociferously criticized Mr. Clinton for vacillating on Bosnia. On Thursday Mr. Dole asked the Clinton Administration to abandon its peace efforts because he believed the plan was too generous to Serbia.
Administration officials said the new policy has its roots in late May, when the Bosnian Serbs seized foreign peacekeepers as hostages and prevented NATO from continuing what was meant to be a punishing campaign of air strikes begun on May 25. Soon after, aides say, Mr. Clinton began demanding a new approach that would force the combatants to the bargaining table.
"He saw that this was having real costs for us," said one senior official. "He said: I want for us to be more on top of this thing, more shaping of it. If we were going to be blamed for the failures, it should at least be for concrete decisions that we had taken."
In early July, Anthony Lake, the national security adviser, began a series of weekly breakfast meetings that included Madeleine K. Albright, the chief United States delegate to the United Nations; General John Shalikashvili, the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff; William J. Perry, the Defense Secretary, and Warren Christopher, the Secretary of State. The conversation, officials said, often focused on the "end game" to bring about a final settlement of the Bosnia conflict, a subject Mr. Lake had directed National Security officials to begin studying.
Ms. Albright's inclusion was significant. She had been the Administration's most consistent advocate of the United States pushing its European allies to adopt a more muscular policy in Bosnia.
As senior officials were beginning that review, there was more bad news from Bosnia. United Nations troops and NATO air power were unable to prevent the Serbs from overrunning Srebrenica, one of six United Nations-designated "safe areas," on July 11, deepening Mr. Clinton's anxiety over what one official termed "the situation of drift."
In response the allies gathered in London on July 21 and a new American attitude seemed evident. President Jacques Chirac of France had asked the United States to supply more than 100 helicopters for a nighttime operation to ferry thousands of French troops to Gorazde.
American officials countered with a proposal to threaten massive bombing against the Bosnian Serb troops attacking the encircled town, a plan accepted by the allies and later broadened to include all of the safe areas. Before that could be done, however, the safe area of Zepa fell to the Serbs on July 25.
When Croatia defied all predictions of Pentagon analysts and easily routed the Serbian rebels in the first days of August, Mr. Lake immediately asked the President's senior advisers for memos on what should be done next. All agreed on the value of a diplomatic initiative, though they differed significantly on the details. Mr. Perry suggested pushing for a cease-fire along the existing battlefronts, giving the Bosnian-Croatian federation only 30 percent of the territory. Mr. Lake, Ms. Albright and Mr. Christopher favored giving the Bosnians 51 percent.
According to the White House, the Administration's senior foreign policy advisers had met to discuss Bosnia 17 times in July and August. The President joined them in meetings on August 2, 7, and 8.
Hours later, Mr. Lake was on his way to Europe, leading a mission whose tenor illustrates the changed climate. Two years ago, Secretary of State Warren Christopher set out on a similar trip to consult the allies about a Clinton Administration proposal to arm the Bosnian Government and bomb the Serbs. The Europeans rebelled, and then darkly muttered about Mr. Clinton's failure to lead.
This time Mr. Lake did not ask -- he informed. An Administration official said that in his meetings in Bonn, Paris and London, Mr. Lake declared: "The President has made the following decisions. We want you to be with us."

HEADLINE: United Way Holds Steady In Donations

BYLINE: By KAREN W. ARENSON 

 BODY:
The United Way, which raises money for local charities through payroll checkoff plans, yesterday reported a 1 percent gain in contributions across the country, for a total of $3.08 billion for 1994. After adjusting for inflation of 2.6 percent, that represented a small decrease from the previous year.
Elaine Chao, president of United Way of America, called the figures a "very respectable showing," noting that they came during an overall decrease in contributions to human services. 
 Although charitable giving in the United States rose 3.6 percent last year, donations to human service charities fell 6 percent, according to "Giving USA," the annual report on private giving by the American Association of Fund-Raising Counsel's Trust for Philanthropy.
For United Way, total giving has still not returned to the $3.17 billion peak reached in 1991, before problems began to surface involving misuse of funds by William Aramony, the longtime president of United Way of America. The organization provides marketing, technical and other services to the independent local United Way fund-raising organizations. Mr. Aramony and two other high-level executives were convicted on fraud and tax charges in April and sentenced to jail terms.
United Way of America installed new executives in 1992 and imposed stiff ethical rules. But, as the 1994 figures show, it still faces challenges in figuring out how to increase giving at a time when Government financing for the social service agencies it supports is likely to be flat or decreasing.
"The plain-vanilla social services have a real problem," said Robert Bothwell, president of the National Committee for Responsive Philanthropy, a watchdog group in Washington. "They're not arousing people's passions. You can't simply go out and tell people to give to charity the way you could 25 years ago. That's why we've seen the rise of very, very targeted marketing to niche audiences by nonprofits."
Ms. Chao said that under a new strategic plan developed by McKinsey & Company, local United Way organizations have been trying to play more active roles in their communities beyond fund-raising. In Phoenix, for example, United Way officials coordinated a meeting of many agencies to figure out how they could improve education. United Way is also considering more fund-raising in small businesses and using direct marketing.
Fund-raising results varied sharply across the country. The biggest gains among the 2,000 independent United Way drives were in Darlington, S.C., which was up 122 percent last year, and Bentonville, Ark., which showed a 95 percent gain.
One of the biggest declines was in Frederick, Md., which showed an 82 percent drop. Osceola, Ark., showed a decline of 35 percent.
Among the 10 cities that raise the most money, Washington showed the biggest gain, with a 4.1 percent increase, to $75.8 million. St. Louis was up 2.7 percent, to $50.3 million, and Atlanta was up 2.2 percent, to $56.7 million. Contributions in San Francisco, Houston and Chicago were mainly flat.
Large cities showing decreases included Detroit, which fell 3.6 percent, to $59.5 million, and Los Angeles, which slipped 3.1 percent, to $57.2 million.
New York City fell 1.5 percent, to $69.7 million. The New York fund-raising drive showed a 5 percent increase in giving from companies based in New York City, but a 10 percent decrease from companies with multiple offices in New York, Connecticut and New Jersey, which are covered by the Tri-State United Way Campaign.
Ralph Dickerson Jr., president of United Way of New York City, said that the continued loss of jobs among large Fortune 500 companies where United Way has traditionally been strongest, continued to hurt fund-raising. But he said his group had had some "good success" getting into more medium-sized companies with 100 to 500 employees.
A continuing refrain among United Way leaders, Mr. Dickerson said, is: "It's tough out there. We all have to look for other fund-raising approaches."
"There's no question there are still questions over the past Aramony controversy," he said. "All of the wounds have not healed yet. But someone has got to help the social service agencies get through the tough times and cutbacks, and United Way has got to take that leadership position.

HEADLINE: World's Last Baby Seal Hunt Is Jobs for Namibians

BYLINE: By SUZANNE DALEY 

DATELINE: CAPE CROSS, Namibia, Aug. 15

 BODY:
Before the early-morning fog had lifted here, more than 200 seal pups were lined up in rows on the concrete quay behind Aldert Brink's tumble-down factory, some with eyes bulging, others with bloody snouts, the result of being clubbed to death.
Workers moved among the lifeless animals performing different tasks. First, the males' bellies were slit open and their penises were removed to be sold as aphrodisiacs in the Far East. Then, cuts were made around the fins and heads, readying the pups for the skinning machine. 
 The harvesting of seals began this week on Namibia's desolate coast, once again triggering fierce debate over the practice. The Namibian Government, which sets a limit on the number of seals killed, says that sealing -- like fishing -- is a legitimate industry in a poor country that can ill afford to sneer at jobs.
Sealing generates about $500,000 a year and employs about 100 people, Government officials say, in a country with a total working population of about 150,000. "In this country 100 jobs is a lot," said Dr. Burger W. Oelossen, an official of Namibia's Ministry of Fisheries and Marine Resources. "The money is .04 percent of our G.N.P., about the equivalent of $120 billion in the U.S. economy. It's not a trivial thing for us."
But animal rights groups argue that the killings are inhumane and unnecessary. They are particularly incensed by the market for seal genitals, which can fetch as much as $1,200 a pound in Hong Kong. And they say the killing itself -- the clubbing of the young seals and the shooting of the bulls -- is often cruelly bungled.
"To see the process would just bring tears to anyone's eyes," said David Barritt, the African coordinator for the International Fund for Animal Welfare. "The rules say that they are supposed to club them and then stab them in the heart within 20 seconds," he said, referring to Government regulations. "But they club them six, seven, nine times before they are stunned, and then they leave them on the sand while they go on to the next one. It's just horrible."
The sealers insist that clubbing is the most efficient and humane method of killing pups; the young seals' skulls are so soft that bullets would pass right through, hitting other animals and endangering the hunters.
This is the world's only remaining large-scale commercial seal hunt. The practice virtually ended in the 1980's after environmental groups focused attention on the brutality of such hunts in Canada, leading both the United States and the European Union to ban imports of baby seal skins.
But in Namibia, sealing goes on, as it has for nearly a century, with the Government setting quotas every year. This year, with an estimated colony of about 500,000 seals, the Government will allow 12,500 pups and 4,000 bulls to be killed.
Mr. Brink, a South African who lives at the factory at Cape Cross, just up the coast from the Henties Bay hamlet, is one of Namibia's two seal concessionaires.
Apart from the Asian market for genitals, he said, he sells pelts locally where they are made into shoes, wallets, handbags and other accessories, and in limited numbers to European destinations he would not identify for use in coats.
He rolls his eyes at the "greenies" -- environmentalists -- who would stop this business. He does not understand why seals should be considered any different from fish or cattle or chickens. Sure, he says, they have nice eyes and big eyelashes, but they are still animals, still predators.
"As long as the animal is being utilized and not endangered, then it is the same as every other animal," he said. "People have this tendency to humanize them, that's all."
The Namibian Government, however, has decided that no one may see the actual kill.
Only later in the year, when the bulls come down the coast to mate, will Mr. Brink shoot them. For now, he is after only the pups, which have extremely fragile skulls and can be knocked out with a single well-placed blow. Mr. Brink said his men shepherd several hundred seals away from the herd, form a human funnel the seals must pass through and then smash the heads of any pups they can reach.
Mr. Brink doesn't get too sentimental about the process. He said he has seen the mothers come back looking for their pups, but never "sitting there crying like they always say in the animal rights groups."
"I have seen a mother tear her pup to pieces -- in fighting -- and then get on with her life," he added. "Especially, the big bulls. If a big bull approaches a cow and a small pup is hindering him -- he will tear it to bits. It's the way of nature."
His 75-year-old factory -- its machinery coated black by a mix of coal dust and the grease and steam of boiling meat -- sits on the edge of a seal reserve where, along the surf, sometimes as far as the eye can see, seals nestle against each other, barking and cavorting.
When Mr. Brink takes his four-wheel drive truck out to the beach, he looks at the herds with a trained eye, spotting the runts that will not survive and the aging, wounded bulls. He rails against the fishermen for the many seals he sees that have pieces of net looped around their necks -- especially the young ones that will grow and strangle themselves, horribly slowly.
"What do they want with me," he asked. "Why don't they stop that?"
The seal factory here is separated from the nearest village by more than 30 miles of desert, and it is another 40 miles after that before a town of any size. But enough tourists come to see the seals that Mr. Brink has opened a small store here where he sells shoes, wallets, book covers and handbags made of seal pelts. A hand-painted sign at the entrance pleads his case: Stop Ignorance. Listen to the Other Side.
His guest book bears hundreds of signatures and most entries comment only on how much the seals stink, even from a great distance. Mr. Brink said he rarely meets angry visitors. On a recent morning, a handful of tourists stopped in, bought two pairs of shoes and chatted amiably before moving on.
Still, Mr. Brink was expecting trouble. He said he believed that animal rights activists would soon come to try to hide in the sand to photograph the killing. He would have the police take them away, as he did last year, she said.
A man with a weathered face and an easy smile, Mr. Brink is always on the look out for a new way to market seal products. He is experimenting with producing quality oil for cosmetics, and he would like to see more seal leather goods made. The leather, he says, will not stiffen if it gets wet.
But he thinks those who pay high prices for seal penises are foolish, if welcome to make him rich. He tried it once himself. Having heard the custom was to soak the dried genitals in rice wine for several months and then drink it, he instead bought a case of whisky and tried to make the potion there.
"Fastest way to waste a case of good whisky," Mr. Brink allowed. "Didn't do anything but turn the stuff just awful."

HEADLINE: Survey Finds 6 Million, Fewer Than Thought, in Temporary Jobs

BYLINE: By ROBERT D. HERSHEY Jr. 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Aug. 18

 BODY:
Six million Americans hold jobs they do not consider permanent, far fewer than experts expected, the first Government survey of its kind has found. These workers are markedly youthful and slightly more likely than workers over all to be female and black.
 Only a third of these so-called contingent workers, a group that includes students, were satisfied with their situation, while the rest said they would prefer permanent jobs, according to the survey, released today by the Bureau of Labor Statistics. And relatively few had their own health insurance. 
 But while the study confirmed that such workers are much more common in the United States than in Europe and other industrial countries, specialists said the results tended to undermine a popular conception that the number of workers with indeterminate job futures was growing rampantly.
 Some estimates have placed the share of contingent workers, who are not necessarily part-time employees, as high as 35 percent instead of the 4.9 percent found by the Bureau of Labor Statistics. Time magazine, for example, estimated in a prominent 1993 article entitled "The Temping of America" that contingent workers would make up half of the labor force by the year 2000.
 Speaking of the Labor Department survey, Mitchell S. Fromstein, chairman of Manpower Inc., the Milwaukee-based temporary-help company, said, "It sets to rest a lot of notions of a work force dominated by temporary and contingent workers." His company sent W-2 tax statements to 750,000 people last year. Mr. Fromstein said the Government figures, collected in February 1994 and analyzed over the last six months, closely matched those of his own company.
 But while others acknowledged the importance of the Federal effort to tally such workers, they insisted that even the broadest of the Federal survey's three definitions of contingent workers was too narrow and thus undercounted them.
 "Most labor market analysts will find these levels of contingent employment surprisingly low," said Eileen Appelbaum, associate research director of the Economic Policy Institute in Washington, a research group with a liberal orientation. She noted that the Government deemed workers contingent only if they expected their jobs to end within a year or, under the broadest definition, "some time in the future."
 The survey would have shown a considerably higher contingent work force had it included part-time workers who wanted full-time jobs, regardless of expectations about how long their employment might last, Ms. Appelbaum said. Still, she praised the Government's effort as "very important" and said she eagerly awaited a chance to examine the data in detail.
 Since this was the first survey of its kind, asking workers directly whether their jobs were intended for a limited period, it produced no information about trends. But Thomas Nardone, a supervisor of the project, said the bureau hoped to repeat the study at two-year intervals, a schedule similar to its survey on displaced workers -- those who have lost jobs -- that began in 1984.
 Underlying the debate over definitions is disagreement about the desirability of contingent employment. Audrey Freedman, a New York consultant and Manpower director who is credited with coining the phrase, stressed the role of such jobs in enhancing a worker's skills and giving businesses a flexibility that raises the nation's productivity.
 One happy contingent worker is Julie Leis, a 21-year-old Ohio University student, who is earning $11 an hour this summer working as a receptionist for Manpower itself in Washington.
 "I knew temporary jobs are the highest-paying jobs for a college student," said Ms. Leis, who previously worked at a travel agency, an insurance agency and a bank.
 Others, however, fret about possibly low wage levels, underemployment and a lack of health insurance and other benefits.
 Among the other findings, the report concluded that the educational attainment of adults in contingent jobs was quite similar to those with secure futures; about 29 percent of those in each group have college degrees. Somewhat fewer contingent workers, however, have high school diplomas.
 The proportion of contingent workers with health insurance from any source ranged from 57 to 65 percent, the study found. This was 17 to 25 points less than for secure workers, and the contingents were less likely to get their coverage from their employers.
 Over all, the ranks of contingent workers were estimated to range from 2.7 million to 6 million workers. The higher total would account for 4.9 percent of all those with jobs.
 The survey also concluded that 8.3 million workers were independent contractors, 2 million worked "on call," 1.2 million worked for temporary-help agencies and 652,000 worked for companies that provide services under contract at their customers' sites.
A person's employment could be both contingent and overlap into one of the alternate categories.
 The number working at temporary-help agencies was about one-half the total shown in the Labor Department's monthly report by business establishments. That suggested, Ms. Appelbaum said, that many temps lose track of whose employees they are.

HEADLINE: Relief for the Turboprop Blues;
Small Is Suddenly Beautiful for Short-Hop Travelers

BYLINE: By DAVID CAY JOHNSTON 

 BODY:
Until recently, whenever Scott Hansen, a Salt Lake City lawyer, had to visit clients in Boise, Idaho, he dreaded calling his travel agent. Of the eight daily flights, four were on 135-passenger Delta Air Lines jets but the four others were on much smaller turboprops flown by SkyWest Airlines, a Delta commuter affiliate.
 Of his last 75 flights, Mr. Hansen said, 45 required him to squeeze into the bumpy, low-flying turboprops. "There's no comparison," he said. "In the jet you have good seats, you board through a jetway and you can stand up when you walk down the aisle." 
 But some relief for travelers like Mr. Hansen is in sight. Several manufacturers from around the world are racing to deliver a new wave of what might be called junior jets, able to carry between 50 and 80 passengers. They are a vast improvement over the somewhat smaller short-hop turboprop planes, with their propeller-droning, often stomach-wrenching flights as they go right through the middle of the seemingly inevitable summer thunderstorm.
 Forget about all the attention focused on the competition between Boeing and Airbus for the next generation of jumbo jets. What will really make a big difference in the daily trials and tribulations of tens of thousands of bedraggled airline passengers are these small, often overlooked, regional jetliners.
 Already, junior jets have started to replace turboprops on some midlength routes like the Salt Lake City-Boise run. And they are increasingly being used to connect less traveled, more widespread cities where passengers were once condemned to go through a connecting airport, often from one turboprop to another.
 In Brazil yesterday, the newest junior jetliner took its first test flight after rolling out of its factory hangar in Sao Jose dos Campos, a 170-mile hop from Rio de Janerio. The Embraer-145 is a 50-seat regional jet built by Empresa Brasileira de Aeronautica S. A., as the company is formally known, to replace slightly smaller turboprops. That includes Embraer's own Brasilia, which is the most widely used turboprop in the United States. More than 200 are operated by American carriers today.
 The new plane, which costs $14.5 million, is basically a stretched Brasilia turboprop fitted with jet engines. Meanwhile, another 50-seat jet aircraft, the Canadair Regional Jet, has started to make inroads in the United States and elsewhere since it was introduced in 1993.
 That Canadian-built plane, a derivative of Bombardier Inc.'s Challenger corporate jet, is intended not so much to replace turboprops on short hops as to allow nonstop jet service between distant cities with limited economic ties, like Rapid City, S.D., and Salt Lake City, which are 508 air miles apart. Even so, SkyWest recently turned to Canadair to replace its Brasilia turboprop planes on the Salt Lake City-Boise run. Thirty-one Canadair Regional Jets currently operate in the United States.
 That's not all. Earlier this summer two Fokker 70's, a new Dutch jet with 79 seats, began service for America West Express, a unit of Mesa Air Group. They provide nonstop service from Phoenix to Des Moines and to Spokane, Wash., both long, thinly used markets that previously required at least one stop. Also flying in the United States are 16 four-engine British Aerospace BAe-146 jets and a few newer models of the same plane. Fokker is a unit of Daimler-Benz A. G.
 And at least one American plane maker, McDonnell Douglas, is trying to develop a shorter version of its smooth-flying MD-80. It has not yet decided whether to go ahead with construction.
 Over the next 20 years, airlines worldwide are expected to buy as many as 1,500 jets that carry fewer than 100 passengers, said Barbara Beyer, president of Avmark, an airline industry consulting firm in Arlington, Va.
 Still, the turboprop is not about to disappear. Bombardier, the Canadian plane maker, estimates that between 1993 and 2012 airlines worldwide will spend $91 billion to buy 8,107 regional aircraft with 15 to 90 seats. Most of these planes will be low-cost turboprops with 40 or more seats. Airline industry experts say that turboprops will continue to serve as the backbone of flights between small- and medium-sized cities like Concord, N.H., and Syracuse and nearby major airports, such as Boston and New York.
 For an increasing number of lucky fliers, though, the junior jets will provide a lot more speed and some added comfort over turboprops. And for thousands of others, there is the prospect of an end to the time-wasting change of planes.
 "After two hours a turboprop is a real pain," Miss Beyer said. "Essentially there are two kinds of markets that can be served by regional jets. Those that are more than 400 miles apart, but are not large enough to command larger jet equipment. And those markets that have been abandoned by the major carriers since deregulation of the airlines -- markets that had been jet markets and should be jet markets."
 For years, the big United States aircraft manufacturers -- Boeing and McDonnell Douglas -- resisted building smaller jets, arguing that the development costs would be too high to justify the expense of building jets that would inevitably sell for much less than their bigger bread-and-butter jet aircraft.
 "Then we hounded Canadair with the idea that they ought to turn their Challenger business jet into a regional airliner," Miss Beyer said. "And ultimately they did and now it is an absolute raving success."
 While off to a good start, it remains to be seen just how successful the Canadair will be. Bombardier has delivered 65 such Canadair jets and has orders for 37 more. It says it plans to bring out a lengthened version that can carry 75 passengers.
 Aircraft makers readily acknowledge that most passengers do not like turboprops, not just because of their noisy vibrations and cramped space, but also because they appear outdated and less safe. And the crash last October of a French-made ATR turboprop plane, which led the Federal Aviation Administration to ban the planes temporarily from flying in icy weather, only added to the safety fears surrounding turboprops. But the manufacturers insist that view is misguided.
 "People tend to look at propellers and think old-fashioned," said Colin Fisher, a spokesman for Bombardier, which also makes a 50-seat turboprop, the Dash 8. "But turboprop and jet technology were born in the same time frame, around the time of World War II."
 Whatever the manufacturers say, passengers recognize a clear difference. On a flight from Rochester to Cincinnati, a Canadair Regional Jet operated by Comair, another Delta commuter affliate, was exceptionally quiet and smooth, taking off quickly and flying above the turbulence. But the seats in junior jets do not vary that much in appearance and comfort from those typically found in most turboprops.
 The main reason more airlines do not rely on junior jets is because they are much more expensive to buy than turboprops. And even though they hold more seats, that is still a real burden, particularly for commuter operators without a lot of extra investment capital that are operating on paper-thin margins. The new Embraer regional jet, for example, will cost nearly double the $7.7 million price of its Brasilia turboprop. A Canadair Regional Jet costs even more -- $17 million to $22 million a copy.
 But the new Brazilian operating costs are expected to be comparable. Its new regional jet, Embraer says, should cost about $27 an hour per seat to fly, compared with $29 an hour for a Brasilia. And some airlines think the investment is worthwhile, in part because jets fly much faster than turboprops, allowing more flights each day. Delta Connection flights on a Saab 340 turboprop between Rochester and La Guardia Airport in New York City are scheduled for 85 minutes, compared with USAir's 64 minutes via a 737 jet, adding about one-third to the gate-to-gate time.
 Jets can also cruise higher, which means fewer cups of coffee ending up in passenger laps. "You can fly up quickly and get above the weather, which is especially attractive during thunderstorm season," said David A. Siebenburgen, president of Comair Holdings, the regional airline in Cincinnati that introduced the Canadair Regional Jet into service. "Our customers love them."
 Comair operates 64 turboprops and 23 Canadair Regional Jets, but within five years the company expects to operate fewer than 50 turboprops and at least 70 Canadair Regional Jets, Mr. Siebenburgen said.
 And even though the carrying costs are higher, SkyWest, based in Salt Lake City, sees advantages in the eight Canadair Regional Jets, all leased, that it now flies.
 "The reason we feel comfortable with the risk," said Bradford R. Rich, SkyWest's chief financial officer, "is that the plane fits into the longer, thinner markets we have. We believe it can expand our market area because of the high speed and comfort."
 As far as Canadair's new Brazilian competitor goes, it already has 18 firm orders for its regional jet, 5 of them from BWIA, a Caribbean airline. Embraer also says it has 16 options and 127 letters of intent.
 So far, however, no airline in the United States has ordered an EMB-145. But Michael Warwicke, Embraer's vice president for sales, is counting on a few orders to roll in once the airplane completes flight- worthiness testing. Long-suffering prop-jet passengers may want to start counting the days.

HEADLINE: Tragedy Forces Town To Face Its Divisions;
Breaching Barriers of Creed and Culture

BYLINE: By IVER PETERSON 

DATELINE: LAKEWOOD, N.J.

 BODY:
The suburbs have long been places where people are divided by barriers as concrete as walls and as subtle as class. They have also been places where institutions like the public school system, the Little League and the P.T.A. have helped to breach those barriers.
 But Lakewood, in central New Jersey, is a town divided by creed and culture, obstacles that are proving resistant to change. 
 On one side of this divide live Lakewood's 18,000 strictly Orthodox Jews, members of a yeshiva community that grew up in the last 40 years around Beth Medrash Govoha, the country's best-known religiously right-wing rabbinical college. For reasons of habit and cultural integrity, the yeshiva community lives apart, attends school apart and worships apart.
 The community is not withdrawn in politics, however. The Orthodox vote as a nearly solid bloc, making them the dominant political power in Lakewood, and a power that can only grow: leaders of the yeshiva community, which had about 400 members in 1968, expect their numbers to top 27,000 by the turn of the century.
 On the other side of this divide live the rest of Lakewood's 45,000 residents, a more conventional suburban mix of middle-class homeowners of many faiths and ethnic backgrounds, and a community of the poor that struggles with crime and joblessness on the streets east of downtown. What ties these groups together is criticism of the yeshiva community's social isolation and political domination.
 "Lakewood is a dying community in terms of diversity," said Michael Rush, the principal of South Toms River Elementary School and a leader in black civic affairs. "Minorities, and I mean blacks and Hispanic people, are treated unfairly in the political system, in the schools and in employment in Lakewood."
The yeshiva community's leaders acknowledge the problems, but caution against accepting the complaints at face value.
 "We are sympathetic to the concerns of the rest of the community," said Rabbi Moshe Weisberg, the yeshiva community's unofficial spokesman, "but we also feel that there are undercurrents of anti-Semitism and anti-Orthodox feeling in some of the things we hear."
 Into this atmosphere of mistrust came tragedy earlier this year, when Jasmine Kirkland, a 4-year-old black girl left momentarily unattended in a parked car, bolted into the street and was killed by a car driven by an Orthodox woman from Highland Park, N.J.
 Although there was at least one protest march after Jasmine's death, Lakewood experienced none of the turmoil that followed a 1991 accident with frightening parallels in Crown Heights, Brooklyn. There, the traffic death of 7-year-old Gavin Cato was followed by three nights of rioting by black youths and the murder of a yeshiva student member of the Lubavitcher Hasidic movement.
 What Jasmine's death brought out to people on both sides here was an awareness of the need for communication before the gulf in the community grows too great. And so about 30 community leaders, representing different ethnic and economic factions in Lakewood, sat down together last month at Georgian Court College, a Catholic women's school that adjoins the rabbinical college.
 "We have begun a dialogue because, really, we must be able to talk about our difference or we will simply move further apart," said Claribell Williams, a professor of history at Georgian Court, who moderated the invitation-only meeting.
 The talks are only a beginning, however, for if anything came of the first two meetings of the Lakewood Coalition, as it is known, it is that the anger here is more out in the open than before Jasmine died.
 Patricia Crews, Jasmine's aunt and a founding member of African Americans in Action, Lakewood's most militant black group, accused the police of ignoring traffic violations by Orthodox drivers while harassing black drivers for the smallest infractions. Suzanne Margolin, whose car struck Jasmine, was ticketed for reckless driving, but she did not face criminal charges.
 Mrs. Crews, an office worker, spoke in blunt ethnic terms of the movement of Orthodox families out of their traditional concentrations west of Madison Avenue into the more rundown areas to the east of the town's main highway.
 "See that house?" Mrs. Crews said, pointing to a newly refurbished, powder-blue clapboard home surrounded by older, more worn ones on Second Street, "that's a Jew house, and that one over there, that's a Jew house, too. It's getting to be all Jew houses back in there."
 If Mrs. Crews is angry about Jasmine's death, Rabbi Weisberg is angry over the imputation of guilt on his community.
 "The death of this unfortunate little girl was tragic, but it was not a part of our community," he said. "The woman who was driving the car was not from here, she was from Highland Park and she was only shopping in Lakewood. We thought it was an affront to our community that we should even be linked to it."
 Rabbi Weisberg also thinks the complaints about the yeshiva community's expansion are unfair.
 "We can't win," he said. "If we stick to ourselves, we are segregating ourselves. If we move into new places, we are taking over."
 State Senator Robert W. Singer, a Republican of Ocean County and former Mayor of Lakewood, said the yeshiva Jews are "clannish" to protect their cultural identity.
 "Their belief is that once you let down the gate, you have people leaving the society for an easier way of living outside," Mr. Singer said.
 Still, as much as the yeshiva community looks inward on most issues, it operates politically like any powerful bloc: involved and united. While members do not hold seats on the town Council, about 5,000 of them vote for a slate of candidates selected a few days before each election by Rabbi Yisroel Schenkolewski, the yeshiva community's acknowledged political leader. These votes helped elect a majority of the Council members and the school board members. Rabbi Schenkolewski is both chairman of the town zoning board and a member of the Ocean County Board of Elections, while Rabbi Meir Hertz is chairman of the Lakewood Housing Authority.
 "The right to vote is guaranteed by the Constitution," Rabbi Schenkolewski said in an interview with The New York Times in 1989, "and sometimes voting as a bloc can be very important. We come out very strong, and later, when we want something, we ask." The rabbi did not respond to requests for interviews for this article.
 The ability of the yeshiva community to dominate politics in Lakewood was demonstrated most recently in February, when the yeshiva leadership defeated an effort to control the conversion of family houses into yeshivas in residential neighborhoods. Currently, besides the rabbinical college, there are 19 elementary and high school yeshivas operating in Lakewood, enrolling about 3,500 children.
 A special committee of the Lakewood Town Council proposed new rules involving parking and open space for private schools that would have stopped yeshiva development and frozen most of the existing schools in place. "We would not even have been able to add a shed for a lawn mower," said Rabbi Weisberg.
 But the measure died after the yeshiva community signaled its opposition, a result that dismayed even some who generally sympathize with the yeshiva community.
 "The Sisters of Mercy have never had much to do with town government, but politics are now making it necessary for us to get involved," said Dr. Williams of Georgian Court, whose religious leadership favored the school zoning law. "The college owns a lot of property, and there have been problems with the yeshivas coming on to it with sheds and buildings, and we felt we had to do something."
 Still, Dr. Williams and the rest of the Lakewood Coalition will sit down together next month in hopes of finding new ways of smoothing Lakewood's differences.
 "Put this down," said David Schwartz, a tire dealer who represents the Lakewood Chamber of Commerce in the coalition. "Write down that while the rest of the world is fighting, in Lakewood, at least we are talking to each other."

HEADLINE: Robert S. Hirschfield, Professor, CUNY-TV Chief and Author, 66

BYLINE: By LAWRENCE VAN GELDER 

 BODY:
Robert S. Hirschfield, a political scientist, professor and author who was the dean of communications at the City University of New York, died yesterday at the Mount Sinai Medical Center. Dr. Hirschfield, who lived in Manhattan, was 66.
 His wife, Muriel, said the cause of death was heart failure. 
 For many years, until his retirement in 1993, Dr. Hirschfield directed CUNY-TV, the City University cable television channel, and was the producer and host of "Cityscope," a public affairs television program on WNYC-TV and CUNY-TV.
 Taking over the largely fallow CUNY-TV station in 1985 at the request of Joseph S. Murphy, then the Chancellor of the City University, Dr. Hirschfield revitalized it with productions from a variety of sources, including branches of the university. Before long, CUNY-TV had introduced 25 nonfiction series, dealing with the sciences, cultural affairs, politics, foreign languages and other subjects.
 "We are quintessential public-service television," Dr. Hirschfield said. "We have no other aim than to serve the general public."
 He was also the author of "The Power of the Presidency" (Aldine Publishing) and "The Constitution and the Court: The Development of the Basic Law Through Judicial Interpretation" (Random House). His articles and reviews appeared in publications like The New York Times, The Nation, Public Policy, The American Political Science Review and Parliamentary Affairs.
 After his retirement, Dr. Hirschfield became the editorial director of The Earth Times, a newspaper that focuses on economic development, the environment, human rights, population and trade.
 Dr. Hirschfield, who was born in St. Louis, received a bachelor of arts degree from Harvard, where he also earned a law degree and a master of arts. In 1958, the same year he became an instructor at Hunter College, he received his doctorate from New York University.
 He became a full professor in 1967 and in 1968 was named chairman of the political science department at Hunter in 1968.
 He served as co-chairman of the New York Stevenson-for-President Committee and was a member of the New York State Facilities Development Corporation and the New York City Commission on the Status of Women.
 In addition to his wife, Dr. Hirschfield is survived by their two children, Rebecca and David, also of Manhattan, and his brother, Stanley Hearn of Chicago.

HEADLINE: CURRENCY MARKETS;
Dollar Holds Steady as Traders Remain Wary of Central Banks

BYLINE: By Bloomberg Business News 

 BODY:
The dollar was steady yesterday, buoyed by expectations that the world's leading central banks could again intervene in the market.
 The dollar ended with solid gains for the week, up 4 percent against the Japanese yen and 2.6 percent against the German mark. The dollar has climbed sharply since the central banks of the United States, Japan and Germany bought more than $1 billion in the currency markets on Tuesday. That coordinated effort has left many investors wary about betting against further dollar gains. 
 "I think the central banks would be heard from in another big move down in dollar-yen," said Rick Porter, manager of corporate treasury services at Bank Brussels Lambert in New York.
 In New York late yesterday, the dollar rose to 97.61 yen from 97.25 on Thursday. The dollar rose to 1.4780 marks from 1.4747. The British pound slipped to $1.5375 from $1.5460.
 Currency traders next turn their attention to the outlook for interest rates in the United States and Germany. Both the Federal Reserve and the Bundesbank have monetary policy meetings next week.
 Many analysts expect that the Fed will leave interest rates unchanged when its policy-making committee meets on Tuesday.
 A number of traders expect the Bundesbank will pare the 14-day securities repurchase rate, an important money market rate, during its weekly money market transactions Wednesday.
 "I think they'll cut the repo rate by 5 basis points at least," said Mark Chandler, a senior analyst with Deutsche Bank in New York. "That'll spark speculation that they might cut the discount rate, but I don't think they will."
 The Bundesbank last trimmed the repurchase rate on Aug. 9, to 4.45 percent from 4.5 percent. At that time, many traders said the move signaled the first in a round of cuts that would culminate in a discount rate cut in late August or September.
 The German central bank has left the discount rate steady at 4 percent since March 30. Lower German rates tend to help the dollar by making German deposits less attractive. The Bundesbank's policy council meets Thursday.
 In other trading, the mark surged against the Swedish krona after Prime Minister Ingvar Carlsson of Sweden said that he would step down as leader of the Social Democrats in March 1996. Countries experiencing political change often see their currencies suffer.

HEADLINE: Bond Market 'Just Sitting On the Fence'

BYLINE: By Bloomberg Business News 

 BODY:
Treasury prices were little changed yesterday in lackluster trading.
 "Until we get something that says the economy is really slowing or really speeding up, we're going to be caught in this rut," said Mark Taborsky, who helps manage $280 million at Abacus Financial Group in Chicago. "The market's basically just sitting on the fence." 
 Even next week's meeting of the Federal Reserve's policy-making committee is unlikely to change the direction of the market significantly. Many analysts expect that the Fed will leave short-term interest rates unchanged.
 The price of the 30-year Treasury bond fell 2/32 , to 9923/32 , leaving its yield unchanged at 6.90 percent. The price of the two-year note was also little changed, for a yield of 6.09 percent, down from 6.10 percent on Thursday.
 The main economic news yesterday was the University of Michigan's preliminary August survey of consumer sentiment, which failed to give a clear picture of where the economy is heading, according to market participants who saw the report. The survey is released only to paying subcribers.
 "Consumers are saying that things have been pretty good, but they are concerned about what's going to happen in the future," said Sung Won Sohn, chief economist at the Norwest Corporation in Minneapolis.
 Michigan's overall index rose to 96.5, from 94.4 in July. Its index of future expectations sank to 84.4 from 87.7, while the index of current economic sentiment jumped to 115.4 from last month's final reading of 105.2.
 While many reports suggest that "the economy has improved some" since June, "people are now beginning to ask themselves" how much, said Fred Leiner, a market strategist at Prudential Securities in Chicago.
 Growth slowed to an annual pace of half of 1 percent in the second quarter from 2.7 percent in the year's first quarter and 5.1 percent late last year.
 Referring to bond yields, Martin Arthur, chief economist at Portman Asset Management, a London-based firm with $2 billion of bonds, said: "The most likely scenario is the economy is doing better and yields are going to be headed higher. We could get to 7.25 percent to 7.5 percent by year end."
 A resurgent economy could also drive Treasury yields higher by reducing the likelihood the Federal Reserve will reduce benchmark overnight bank loan rates anytime soon, analysts say.
 Ebbing expectations for rate reductions by the Fed have driven yields of two-year notes, among the securities most sensitive to the Fed's interest policy, up 35 basis points, to 6.09 percent from 5.74 percent on July 17. A basis point is one-hundredth of a percentage point.
 In the corporate market, SHL Systemhouse Inc. raised the size of its junk bond sale by 20 percent, to $120 million.
 SHL Systemhouse, a computer system and software company, sold $120 million of six-year callable notes.
 The new notes, which were sold as a part of a unit with equity warrants, were priced to yield 12.25 percent, or the low end of the expected range. That may bode well for American Rice Inc., a unit of Now American Rice, and Sinclair Broadcast Group Inc., which are gearing up to sell $400 million of junk bonds next week.
 "It's kind of a healthy time in the junk bond market," said Joan Batchelder, who manages $2 billion of high-yield bonds for Massachusetts Financial Services in Boston.

HEADLINE: INTERNATIONAL BUSINESS;
Vietnam's Oil-Rich Dreams Go Largely Unfulfilled

BYLINE: By EDWARD A. GARGAN 

DATELINE: HO CHI MINH CITY, Vietnam

 BODY:
One hint of oil's importance here, if not its potential, is the three offshore oil rigs engraved on the back of a piece of Vietnamese currency, the 5,000-dong bank note, worth about 45 cents.
 For Vietnam, and for the dozens of global oil companies that have descended on this country, the South China Sea once stirred dreams of great oil wealth. But it has not turned out that way. 
 Last year, with virtually all the oil still coming from fields operated by Vietsovpetro, a joint venture with Russia, Vietnam had oil exports worth $976 million, 27 percent of the country's export revenue. Still, the recent experience of oil companies here suggests that while there is some oil and natural gas, there are also a lot of dry holes.
 American companies left Vietnam in the mid-1970's, not long after the United States military departed, and did not return until President Clinton lifted a Federal embargo against doing business with Vietnam in February 1994. One of them was Mobil, which has done some drilling and concluded that about 10 trillion cubic feet of gas will be found offshore -- what Steven Hall, vice president of Mobil Vietnam Inc., described as "a significant" amount, but far less than the estimated reserves in Indonesia and Malaysia.
 Mr. Hall said that most estimates of Vietnam's potential oil reserves were between three billion and five billion barrels.
 "These numbers, too, are small compared to Indonesia and Malaysia," he said. "The meanest field in Indonesia operated by Caltex has 10 billion barrels," he said referring to Caltex Petroleum, a joint venture of the Chevron Corporation and Texaco Inc. "That's been operating since 1945," Mr. Hall noted. "But even with these smaller reserves, that doesn't mean they can't be profitably produced."
 At the moment, Mobil is cooperating with the Vietnamese Government to produce a natural gas master plan for the country. There are no gas pipelines or big power plants, the sort of expensive infrastructure that Vietnam will need to produce power for its expanding economy.
 British Petroleum, one of the first foreign companies into Vietnam, was awarded a license to begin drilling off Danang in 1989. "We drilled three wells, and are about to start a fourth," said a senior executive for the company, who spoke on the condition of anonymity. We did find hydrocarbons, but not in commercial quantities."
 But elsewhere, he said, "we had the fortune to find gas," adding, "We anticipate that our investment will have a commercial return."
 Last year, British Petroleum announced that it had discovered two trillion cubic feet of gas 230 miles offshore.
 "That's enough to keep Ho Chi Minh City in gas for 20 years," the B.P. executive said. "We're now studying the feasibility of building a pipeline to power stations near Ho Chi Minh City. It's not by global standards significant, or even particularly significant by Far East standards. However, in the Vietnam context, it is significant in that it provides a national resource to drive the country."
Vietnam has said that it expects to begin using its domestic gas reserves for power production by the end of 1998.
 All of the nation's oil is currently exported, most of it to Singapore, where it is refined. Vietnam then repurchases the oil it needs for its own use. It has no refineries of its own, although there are plans to build one.
 Last fall, Prime Minister Vo Van Kiet announced that a refinery would be built in central Vietnam, near Vung Dung Quat, roughly 370 miles north of Ho Chi Minh City, formerly Saigon, the old South Vietnamese capital. Most major oil companies insist that building the refinery there makes no economic sense -- long pipelines would be required to move the oil to power plants in the south, and Singapore's advanced refineries are not all that much farther away from Ho Chi Minh City. The decision appears instead to have been prompted by political considerations.
 Since the end of the war, Vietnamese leaders have worried about the disparities between the northern and southern regions of the nation. As a result, considerable effort has been expended to make major investment projects in the center of the country as a way of economically unifying north and south. Whether such a strategy can work, either economically or politically, is unclear.
 Still, foreign oil companies are prepared to invest substantial amounts in pursuit of gas and oil. Unlike most foreign investments, the oil industry's commitments run into the hundreds of millions of dollars -- indeed, a single drilling effort can cost $25 million.
 British Petroleum, according to its executive here, together with the Norwegian state oil company Statoil, will have invested $350 million by the end of the year. BHP Petroleum of Australia, a unit of Broken Hill Proprietary, has reportedly invested $300 million, and Shell Oil, part of the Royal Dutch/Shell Group, is said to have laid out $120 million so far. About 12 percent of all foreign investment in Vietnam to date has been made by oil companies.
 What worries some experts in the field, though, is the relative sparseness of the finds so far.
 Amy Myers Jaffe, senior editor at Petroleum Intelligence Weekly, said that many companies expected Vietnam to be a "hot spot" -- or, as she put it, an "elephant," and were disappointed. "Oil companies are always trying to think: 'Where can I get a billion barrels?' " she said. "Everyone is under pressure to find enormous fields. If you were a company and you were slow to go there, you probably saved yourself a lot of money because now we know the geology isn't what they expected."
 As a result, there has been, among some American companies, some tentativeness toward Vietnam. The Exxon Corporation, according to Ed Burdwell, a spokesman, "is interested" in Vietnam, but currently has no areas under contract. Similarly, Chevron, Tenneco and Texaco all have yet to get involved in oil exploration off Vietnam.
 "Vietnam goes through phases," said Marie Belsey, the country manager for British Gas, in Hanoi. "It's talked up and talked down. But nobody's walked away yet."

HEADLINE: 'Smart Buildings' Are Granted a Tax Exemption

BYLINE: By The New York Times 

DATELINE: ALBANY, August 18

 BODY:
Gov. George E. Pataki signed legislation today granting property tax exemptions to companies that construct so-called smart buildings, structures equipped with fiber optics, higher-capacity electrical lines and back-up power systems, in parts of Manhattan.
 The telecommunications-friendly measure was part of a broader law the Governor signed aimed at continuing a series of decades-old economic incentives for constructing and renovating buildings in New York City, particularly in midtown Manhattan. The incentives, mostly in the form of property tax exemptions, began in the late 1970's. 
 The entire package was endorsed strongly by Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani, as it was by his predecessors seeking to encourage businesses to settle in the city and to prevent them from moving elsewhere.
 In a statement, Mr. Pataki singled out the "smart building" component of the bill for praise. The bill calls for an eight-year tax exemption for these buildings, a full exemption for the first four years, phasing out over the second four.
"As the technology needs of businesses increase, this important feature of the bill will make New York City a more attractive place for companies to remain competitive," the Governor said.
 The bill continued a number of other tax abatements, which require a minimum investment equal to a percentage of building's value, and increased the length of the exemption for others. For areas north of 96th Street in Manhattan and in the four other boroughs, the length of the tax abatement for constructing or renovating commercial buildings was increased from 12 to 15 years.

Business Is Good on the Shore

BYLINE: By SUSAN JO KELLER 

DATELINE: TRENTON

 BODY:
The shore is having a good summer, hurricanes and all. Peter J. Calderone, the Labor Commissioner, said that an informal survey of economic activity through last month found shore businesses reporting more tourists, who evidently were spending more money than usual. And he said yesterday that restrictions on swimming because of Hurricane Felix were not necessarily bad as they had increased activities in areas like shopping and restaurants.

HEADLINE: THE MAN INSIDE BILL CLINTON'S FOREIGN POLICY

BYLINE: By Jason DeParle; Jason DeParle is a staff writer for the Magazine. His last article described the relationship between Representative Bob Torricelli and Bianca Jagger.

 BODY:
THE NEWS ARRIVED IN A NOTE MARKED urgent by a red dot. In a few hours, it would plunge the Bosnian war into a desperate new phase. But for the moment, the note brought a smile to the open, impish face of Anthony Lake for it told him that the warplanes were finally on the way. "They've turned the keys," he said to the other officials at the interrupted White House staff meeting. At long last, the United Nations was going to punish the Bosnian Serbs for their barbarous assaults on Sarajevo.
Lake walked down the hall to the Oval Office, where he offered the welcome news to President Clinton. The President congratulated him on the breakthrough, and Lake warned him not to specify in public which country had sent the planes. The Serbs, he warned, might take hostages. When the phone rang at 4:34 the next morning, May 26, Lake's fears were being realized. Gen. John Shalikashvili, the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, was calling. Lake had to delay their talk as he groped for the key to convert his home phone to a secure line. Yet the crux of the general's report was scarcely secret. Serbian commanders, enraged by the bombing, had fired the single deadliest shell of the war, killing 71 civilians in the town of Tuzla. They were about to take hundreds of U.N. hostages. And over the next few months, the killing -- or as Lake says, the "evil" -- that he had hoped to contain would rage out of control. 
 IT WASN'T SUPPOSED TO BE THIS hard, this job that Lake self-mockingly calls "national security adviser of the free world." Not in the aftermath of the cold war and the end of superpower rivalry. And not for William Anthony Kirsopp Lake, whose whole career was a preparation for the post. After three decades of striving to reconcile American power and principle, Lake came to office at a time that seemed uniquely blessed. The nation's enemies had collapsed. Its ideals had triumphed. And Lake had what appeared to be an unparalleled chance to pursue what he called "democracy's promise of a better, safer world."
Instead, he wakes up each day to an ambivalent President, a contentious Congress, a public tempted by isolationism and a world of perverse new crises. It is a heavy load and it falls on a man whose marriage is faltering, whose old friends are carping and whose health shows the strain of the relentless work -- but who still insists he is "having fun, every day." Arriving on a campus amid rumors that he would be hanged in effigy for his Bosnia policy, Lake scribbled a characteristically whimsical response: "No noose is good noose."
Yet there is a noose -- around Lake and the Administration's foreign policy more generally -- and it can be summarized in two words: Bosnia policy. The Administration has had its foreign policy successes, in Haiti and elsewhere. But the failures in Bosnia have overshadowed these developments in part because they represent the collision of the two great historical lessons of the last half-century. One is the lesson of Munich: that aggression in the heart of Europe must not be appeased. The other is the lesson of Vietnam: that foreign crusades can easily trap Americans in blood baths. One lesson says get in; one says stay out. Lake's failed attempts to reconcile them paint a disturbing picture of American power in the post-cold-war world.
For Lake, the events in Bosnia have also revived the conflict that has most troubled him throughout his unusual career. That is the conflict between ideals and interests -- and when it comes to Bosnia, most Americans have spent some time in its grip, appalled at the carnage and appalled as well at the risks of getting involved. The conflict between ideals and interests arises perpetually in American foreign policy, in places from Chechnya to China. And perhaps no one better personifies the competing traditions, of expansive idealism and constrained national interest, as Anthony Lake, who has given half his heart to each faith for more than 30 years.
To a job traditionally held by unambiguous embodiments of American power -- men like Henry Kissinger -- Lake brings the most puzzling resume. It reads like a story of twin brothers separated at birth. He served as Kissinger's young confidant; he resigned in protest and became head of a voluntary service program. He still gets a look of teen-age excitement when he talks about well digging in Kenya. But no one confuses him for a bureaucratic naif. "I mean this in a complimentary sense," says one of his White House colleagues, who compares Lake with the most Machiavellian figure of the Bush Administration. "He's the closest thing we have to Richard Darman in terms of bureaucratic gamesmanship."
Lake's awkward, self-mocking demeanor adds to the identity puzzle. Though he acts as the President's first contact with the gravitas world of generals, admirals, diplomats and spies, he makes no effort to appear Olympian. He jokes about the size of his ears and claims to revel in his anonymity. "One more potted plant imitation," he said one day as he took his place at a Presidential ceremony. Odd things can move him, as when he rushed to rescue a dangling modifier in the middle of a lunchtime conversation: "Whew -- almost a grammatical error on the record."
He is by design the most obscure member of the Clinton foreign policy team, surely the only national security adviser ever to stand beside the President in a New York Times photograph and be described as an "unidentified" man. Yet apart from the President and Vice President, Lake may also be the most powerful influence on foreign affairs.
Part of Lake's advantage is the edge that security advisers always hold, proximity to the President. Lake alone sees Clinton on a daily basis, and it is his job to broker the constant clashes between (and within) the defense, diplomacy and intelligence agencies. But Lake gains an additional edge from the colorless qualities of his would-be rivals, Warren Christopher, the Secretary of State, and William J. Perry, the Secretary of Defense. "There are very few times that Tony ultimately is reversed or changed or modified," says Leon Panetta, the White House chief of staff.
Given the rough ride of the past few years, that is not always a compliment. But Lake brought his struggles over ideals and interests to a happier resolution during the debates last year over Haiti. He had mostly delegated the issue during his first year in office, when the humiliations included an American military ship being chased away by a mob on a Port-au-Prince dock. By April 1994, the attempts to dislodge the island's military dictators had reached a dead end.
Lake convened a meeting in his office to discuss the numerous calls for tightened economic sanctions. Looking ahead, he told the group he thought the move would inflict great pain on average Haitians without driving the rulers from the island. If Clinton started down that road, he argued, the number of refugees would grow, and with it the pressure to finish the job militarily. No one else at his level was yet talking invasion, and Lake sent off those in attendance -- senior but not top representatives of the Defense and State Departments -- to start making that case to their principals. Lake began doing the same with Clinton.
"This was a decisive turning point," says one of those officials. "Tony forced the policy process to confront the full implications of the decision. This is the way policy ought to be done." By last fall, Lake found himself on a flatbed truck in the Port-au-Prince slum district of Cite Soleil, greeting a crowd that stretched to the horizon. "Bonjour," he began, and tens of thousands of exhilarating "bonjours" roared back.
But which, in the end, defines him: the success in Haiti or the lack of it in Bosnia? Lake's struggles over his own identity can be seen in the contorted label he assigned to his beliefs, then quickly abandoned, early in the Administration: "pragmatic neo-Wilsonian." Lake returned to the subject of his conflicting identities one night earlier this year, as he returned on a military jet from a follow-up trip to Haiti. "Can I trust you not to make me sound like a jerk," he began, "if I talk to you about something philosophical?"
For the next half hour, Lake reviewed the journey that took him from Kissinger's staff to the nonprofit world, from what he called the "hard stuff" of making decisions about the Vietnam War to the "soft stuff" of third-world development. "I left the 'hard stuff' for the 'soft stuff,' " he said. "I was in two different worlds. I could do them both." Though he was wrapped in a blanket, fighting the flu, Lake's face came alive as he struggled to make his point, one that seemed as personally important as it was difficult to express. "Now, I think, our society has come back to where we were in World War II, that there are evil forces out there, and there's not so much a distinction between the 'hard stuff' and the 'soft stuff,' between fighting terrorists and promoting small-scale development."
He capped his talk with an idiosyncratic metaphor that suggests the synthesis is not as smooth as he thinks. "I think Mother Teresa and Ronald Reagan were both trying to do the same thing -- one helping the helpless, one fighting the Evil Empire," he said. "One of the nice things about this job is you can do both at the same time and not see them as contradictory."
That, at least, is his hope.
ONE AFTERNOON AT THE END of May, Lake got on an airplane to Massachusetts -- and for a confused moment he thought he was back in Vietnam. He was describing the life he had led there as a Foreign Service officer three decades ago. Then, suddenly, he lost his train of thought. "I'm totally disoriented," he said, shaking his head and staring down at a sunny outline of the Jersey shore. "I thought for a moment that was the Vietnam coast."
It's never far away, that place where Lake first tried to do his share of good, only to see the effort go disastrously awry. Vietnam consumed him for the better part of a decade -- as an ambassador's aide in Saigon, a vice consul in Hue and a keeper of the war's top secrets inside the Nixon White House. He resists the idea that he took away anything so neat as lessons, but when talking about Bosnia, Lake sometimes offers them nonetheless. Don't forget, he said, that good intentions "can lead to a war of murderous naivete."
It didn't seem so complicated at the start, when Lake set off in 1963 with what he would later call "incredibly naive optimism." He was a New Frontier Democrat, fresh from Harvard and Cambridge universities, sure of his nation's purpose and power. "I wanted to go to Vietnam because it sounded interesting and exciting and because it was on the front lines of democracy," he said. "I believed we, the United States, could do anything if we worked hard enough and thought hard enough."
Lake could not have known the foreshadowing involved when he spent the flight to Saigon reading Graham Greene's novel "The Quiet American." It is the classic derision of a figure much like the 23-year-old Tony Lake -- an earnest, educated young man from New England who hopes to bring democracy to Vietnam. But in Greene's version the quest brings senseless death. "I remember thinking to myself, 'What does Graham Greene know?' " Lake says. "Because that's exactly what I believed."
Lake's ancestors had often gone forth in the world carrying torches. His mother's father, William Hard, was a muckraking journalist raised in India by missionary parents; his father's father, Kirsopp Lake, was a prominent British theologian who emigrated to teach at Harvard. Lake's younger sister, Lydia, says the history of service and distinction was captured in the portraits of relatives that lined the family's walls. "There's a tiny streak," she says, "where Tony feels the import of carrying on the family name: he's the last of the Kirsopp Lakes." Lake seemed wary when asked about the family past. "I know where you're going," he said accusingly, and then he finished the thought himself. "It's probably true to some degree -- some degree of missionary impulse. Dangerous stuff."
Lake's older sister, Anne Lake Prescott, insists that the moral clarity of the Second World War gave her brother two early and fundamental beliefs -- that evil exists and that organized resistance can defeat it. His father rushed to join the Navy; his mother organized victory gardens. When I protested that Lake was only 6 when the war ended, Prescott, who teaches literature at Barnard, clung to her point even tighter. "Yes, but that's when those synapses are formed," she says. She calls his voyage to Vietnam Lake's turn at "going out to fight the bad guys."
Lake recounted his Vietnam odyssey in an extraordinary article he wrote with his wife, Antonia, for The New York Times Magazine in 1975. It took the form of a long, intimate letter in alternating he-she passages. (She: "Remember the letters you wrote the year before we were married, about service, adventure and the chance to change the world?" He: "It was heady stuff. But, increasingly, the reality of the war intruded upon the romance.") It is a confessional piece of writing, all the more surprising given how little Lake is willing to reveal of his inner life today.
Part of it covers political insights, like those absorbed one day in 1964 on a battlefield littered with enemy dead. Among them was a young man with "a thin, scholarly face," a face that reminded Lake of his own. "If somebody like that was prepared to lay down his life," he decided, the enemy was powerfully motivated indeed. But Lake also found that the war had him personally "responding in ways I did not understand." He describes holding a gun as he rode with a military escort through an area that had recently been ambushed. "With the gun came the hope that someone would fire at us from the clumps of trees lining the road, so I could fire back," he wrote. "Usually doubtful that I could shoot another person, at that moment I was emotionally prepared to do so."
Lake had been telling Vietnam stories in a lighthearted fashion one day, but when I asked about that one, he suddenly grew uncomfortable. "It's a stupid story. You can quote me." Yet as he returned to the memory, 30 years later, it did not seem stupid at all; it appeared to embody the deep ambivalence of a man usually hoping, and often doubting, that power can be harnessed to moral ends. "It wasn't that I wanted to kill somebody," he said. "I think it was excitement. You know, there is nothing more powerful than a weapon that could take somebody else's life." Lake dropped his voice and started to mumble. "It was sort of a 'welcome to the human race moment,' " he said. "We are carnivores."
By the time Lake left Vietnam, the adventure in democracy building was well on its way to disaster. In January 1965, thousands of Buddhist demonstrators set fire to the American Government library in Hue, where Lake was vice consul. Lake braved the mob and tried to put out the fire, inspiring a Boston Herald article headlined, " 'Tough Tony' Lake Faces Down 3,000 Howling Buddhists." Asked why he did it, Lake even now sounds a bit like "The Quiet American." "They were burning books!" he said. His wife and young son were evacuated a month later, and Lake soon followed them home. He was troubled about the war but did not yet oppose it. "I still thought, somehow, we could find the clean colonel."
Instead, in time, he found Henry Kissinger. After two years of deepening disillusionment inside the State Department and two years of graduate school, Lake joined Kissinger's staff in June 1969. He immediately won an extraordinary measure of confidence, sitting in on the Paris peace talks when their existence was so secretive they were concealed from the Secretary of State. He had just turned 30.
Lake had signed on dazzled by Kissinger's intellect and convinced he would negotiate an end to the war. Kissinger orchestrated its escalation instead, pushing the invasion of Cambodia 10 months later, at which point Lake resigned in protest. But the two men -- pupil and teacher, idealist and realist -- stay linked by a complicated bond of mutual usefulness and fascination, even as Lake now holds Kissinger's old job. Lake was milling about during a state visit to Kiev this spring when an old Ukrainian veteran asked for his autograph. Watching Lake blush, someone in the entourage asked what he had signed. "Henry Kissinger," he said.
The grip of Lake's mixed feelings -- not just toward the man but also to the interest-driven world view that Kissinger embodies -- comes through in a story Lake tells about his graduate-school exams. He was asked to attack or defend a Kissinger statement of classic Realpolitik: that statesmen should concern themselves with the foreign policies of other countries, not how those countries treat their own citizens. Lake wrote an enthusiastic defense, "supporting Kissinger's proposition on logical grounds." That night, Lake went to see a film about Nazism in Europe and when he returned the next day for oral exams, he startled his professors by arguing the other side. "I totally threw them off," he says.
A quarter-century later, Lake is still benefiting from his resignation, which lent him a reputation for unusual conscience. "He chucked it all, for ethical reasons," says R. Nicholas Burns, now the State Department spokesman, who regards Lake as a kind of moral model. But Lake acknowledges that his tutelage in wartime Realpolitik had its moral gray zones. Soon after joining the staff, Lake learned that Kissinger was involved in wiretaps of other young aides. Though Lake says he found the practice "repellent," he decided not to confront Kissinger about the wiretap summaries flowing into the office safe. (And after he resigned, Lake was tapped, too; he sued Kissinger and eventually won a letter of apology.) "I was already arguing with him on Vietnam," Lake said. "I worried it would sound paranoid to go to him and say, 'What's in the safe?' "
Lake resigned, but did so in a muted way that diminished its public effect. Along with two colleagues, Roger Morris and William Watts, Lake argued that the invasion of Cambodia would destroy that country and escalate the violence at home -- prescient predictions given the savageries of Pol Pot and the explosion at Kent State. (Kissinger mocked them as "my bleeding heart friends.") But Lake said nothing in public, instead joining Morris in a letter to Kissinger expressing "our regard and respect for you." Morris has called the quiet resignation "the biggest failure of my life." But Lake says, "I would probably do the same thing again, because I thought you could have more influence that way."
The great adventure "on the front lines of democracy" had come to a bitter end. Lake's wife would write that the experience had soured her on power in general, but the future national security adviser had not given up. "I retain the belief that I found so attractive in the Kennedy years," he wrote in 1975, "that problems created by man can at least be ameliorated by man, and that we must try."
Lake was still trying two decades later on a snowy day in 1991 when he first met Bill Clinton. After leaving Kissinger, Lake had worked in Senator Edmund Muskie's 1972 Presidential campaign, finished his doctorate and served as director of International Voluntary Services, a private agency that sent volunteers across the third world. He went back into political battle on Jimmy Carter's campaign and reaped a choice reward: the State Department's Office of Policy Planning, which he directed from 1977 to 1981. Throughout the Reagan and Bush years, he taught international relations at Mount Holyoke College in western Massachusetts and raised cattle on his 130-acre farm in nearby Worthington.
Then one November afternoon, he took a drive to Boston, where his old State Department deputy, Samuel Berger, was waiting to introduce him to Clinton. They set off to find the candidate before a suburban fund-raising dinner but soon became hopelessly lost amid the snow and the cul-de-sacs. Arriving late, Lake had to wait through the dinner, then settle for a 10-minute car ride with the weary candidate; Clinton asked one question about arms control but mostly quizzed Lake on how the ailing economy was affecting his neighbors.
A journey of wrong turns and backed tracks, culminating in a truncated conversation with a leader not terribly interested in foreign affairs -- it might have seemed like an ominous metaphor. But Clinton used foreign policy adeptly as a candidate and much of the credit accrued to Lake, who soon became his leading unpaid adviser. As a domestic candidate, Clinton needed someone he could turn to and say, "Handle it," and Lake did, helping position Clinton as both more moral and more muscular than his tired Republican opponent, in places as diverse as Haiti, Bosnia and China.
Among those impressed was George Stephanopoulos, the campaign aide turned White House counselor. "The easiest way to say it is he's moral without being a moralist," he says. "There's this quote by Camus, something like perhaps we can't stop killing children but we can limit the number of children killed. It's always struck me that Tony's internalized that message. He's deeply moral and deeply realistic at the same time." Yet it is one of the curiosities about Lake that just as many who have worked with him closely find the moral talk skin-deep. "Tony always has his famous integrity to march out," says Michael Janeway, a colleague in the Carter State Department. "Tony is really an apparatchik. Perhaps the weightiest thing he's done is position himself well."
And immediately after the election Clinton found himself in a number of embarrassing retreats. After vowing that "I would never send those poor people back" to Haiti, Clinton announced before the inauguration that he would do just that. After demanding an urgent response in the Balkans, Clinton responded with tortured ambivalence and inaction. There was a poignancy in such developments for Lake, since he had co-written a 1984 book, "Our Own Worst Enemy," that warned candidates to watch their words. "What they say now," he wrote, "will be held against them."
The book's larger point was that American foreign policy was being poisoned by ideological fights at home, and he argued that public, partisan security advisers were among the problems. Indeed, Lake may have given more advance thought to what a national security adviser should and should not do than anyone who has held the post. Lake had seen two predecessors, Kissinger and Zbigniew Brzezinski, turn themselves into superstatesmen who eclipsed the Cabinet. In his view, this sacrificed the more important role of presenting Presidents with the full range of their advisers' views. He sought the quieter broker style exemplified by Bush's adviser, Brent Scowcroft.
Yet Lake acknowledges that there's no such thing as a pure broker and that his model "revolves around what can be a dilemma." He says his primary responsibility is to "make sure that the President is getting all points of view," but he also offers his own recommendations "because if you don't have views, you shouldn't be doing the job." And the dual roles, broker and adviser, "can come into tension, obviously." Lake said he erred on the side of plain broker during his first year, but he has since become quicker to assert his own views "because it helps move issues to a resolution." Recently, Lake has even moved into the role of public diplomat, after first insisting a security adviser should never usurp the position of the Secretary of State. On Aug. 9, Lake led a mission to Europe to seek a breakthrough on Bosnia amid mutterings that he was pulling an end run around the State Department.
More often than not, what moves Lake from broker to activist are issues that touch his internal compass, his sense of "evil." When Rwandan refugees poured into Zaire in July 1994, Lake personally marshaled the impressive American relief mission. He became the White House equivalent of a Central African desk officer, miring himself in the details of water bladders, cargo planes and local airport layout. (But he had been extremely cautious about any military involvement as the slaughters were taking place. In one country, the two Tony Lakes emerged, idealist and realist.)
A second, very different example of Lake's advocacy can be seen in his strong support for NATO's eastward expansion, against those counseling deference to Russian sensibilities. Lake can give long geopolitical arguments for the move, but he says it "absolutely" also connects to his early thoughts on evil as a child whose parents were caught up in World War II. "We don't have evil out there right now, but human nature has not changed." Lake cares enough about the word "evil" that he insisted last spring that the President use it on his visit to Babi Yar, the ravine outside Kiev where the Nazis machine-gunned more than 100,000 people, mostly Jews. Speech writers had substituted a euphemism about the "depravity" of man, but Lake does not think man is depraved; he thinks that most people are basically good, yet evil lurks among them. "If you can't use 'evil' at Babi Yar, when can you use it?" Lake said, savoring his small victory as the motorcade pulled away.
BUT THERE ARE ALWAYS MORE than enough evils to resist. The perpetual questions are: which ones and how? Neither Christopher nor Perry has succeeded in the role of a public spokesman, and Lake's occasional attempts to fill the vacuum play to his weaknesses as well; he is neither comfortable nor effective in the limelight. With the Clinton foreign policy under assault for lacking a central theme, Lake tried to offer one last September in remarks to the Council on Foreign Relations. Lake claimed to see a single international struggle taking shape, pitting the "face of a tolerant society" against a list of enemies that included "extreme nationalists and tribalists, terrorists, organized criminals, coup plotters, rogue states." America's job, he suggested, remained the same as it has always been -- to throw "ourselves with determination into the fight."
If only it were so simple. As the writer James Fallows noted in a subsequent radio commentary, Lake was impaled on an old dilemma. "Because the United States was founded on universal theories of liberty," it has always felt some stake in fighting foreign tyranny. But because American power has limits, "some tyranny, somewhere, must be ignored. The eternal question has been how and where to draw that line." The implication of Lake's speech, Fallows said, was "that we don't need lines at all -- everything that's bad, we'll be against."
The day-to-day limits start with the national mood -- what is often described as isolationism but might more accurately be called incoherence. On the one hand, the public continues to expect American dominance in the world; on the other hand, there is no public willingness to pay the price, either with blood or money. The point came home earlier this year when Lake joined Shalikashvili for a day at the battleground at Gettysburg. They toured Rodes's Hill and Little Round Top and the scene of Pickett's futile charge, walking across the fields where three days of fighting produced more than 40,000 casualties. Then, in the battlefield bookstore, they reflected on a Somali mission that had been labeled a disaster because it claimed the lives of 18 soldiers. "Something has broken down in the debate about the use of force," Shalikashvili said, in words especially noteworthy coming from the leader of the notoriously cautious Pentagon. "Eighteen people died so thousands and thousands could live. To me, that's glory." Lake nodded. Still, the deaths in Somalia affected him so deeply that he had offered to resign. And the deaths clearly played into his reluctance, seven months later, to send even foreign peace-keepers into Rwanda.
The public mood is one influence on foreign policy, but it can be altered by a second, more important force: Presidential leadership. While Lake often brings two minds to an issue -- that of the idealist and of the realist -- he serves a President notorious for often having many more minds than that. The Administration's foreign policy is derided almost everywhere for being ad hoc, episodic, unsteady, easily reversed. Kissinger says, "Almost everywhere the Administration gets engaged, it recoils before the consequences." Leslie Gelb, president of the Council on Foreign Relations, says Clinton "does not have strong convictions about foreign policy and doesn't spend much time on these issues." Robert Zoellick, an Under Secretary of State in the Bush Administration, says, "The attitude around the world about the constancy, credibility and commitment of our policies has slipped farther than at any time I can remember."
That is the bumper-sticker indictment, but as with most labels about Clinton, it captures only a partial truth. The most obvious exception, of course, is Haiti, where Clinton ousted the dictators in a risky move with what was at best thin public support. (Some Democratic allies in Congress went as far as warning him he could face impeachment if U.S. troops took high casualties.) "After you've been through Haiti with Clinton, it's very difficult to understand how people can say every day that he has no principles or convictions and proceeds by putting his finger in the air," says the author Taylor Branch, a Clinton friend who also served as an informal adviser to Haiti's exiled President, Jean-Bertrand Aristide.
And beyond Haiti there are at least two other areas of foreign policy success, where Clinton has set a course and clung to it. One involves international economics, where the President has repeatedly shown steady leadership despite political risks. Nafta, GATT, the planned free trade zones in Latin America and Asia -- these are subjects little understood by the public but ones to which Clinton brings his own orienting beliefs, his commitment to free trade.
The President has enjoyed a second, eclectic set of successes in areas as disparate as the Middle East peace process and the de-nuclearization of the former Soviet Union. What these seemingly disconnected matters have in common is that they flow from some previously established set of rules -- either specific negotiating tracks (as in the Middle East) or an obvious American interest (as in getting nuclear arms out of Ukraine). When the rules are more tightly defined, as they are here, Clinton's gifts of intelligence, energy and eloquence work on his behalf. But in areas with sharply colliding interests, Clinton's vast capacity to absorb information may actually work against him. Absorbing all points of view, he can be loath to settle on one.
Such was the case with Clinton's decision to extend China's most-favored-nation trade status, after lambasting Bush for doing the same. ("There is no more striking example of Mr. Bush's indifference toward democracy," Clinton said during the campaign.) Once in office, Clinton found himself caught between his conflicting pursuits of human rights and expanded trade. He needed to make a decision, but in effect he made two. In May 1993, he reiterated his threat to punish the Chinese, and subordinates pushed the rights agenda hard in subsequent months; then Clinton dropped his threats when the deadline arrived. Lacking even a fig leaf to cover his retreat, Clinton conceded that "serious human rights abuses continue." Even those who supported his final position, like Kenneth Lieberthal of the University of Michigan, found that he got there having inflicted the maximum collateral damage on himself. "If I was in Beijing, I'd love to be the person to make the case that you don't have to worry about what this President says because he'll cave in the end," he says.
Among those who quickly came to a similar conclusion were the Bosnian Serbs.
THE SLEEPING POWDER WORE off in the middle of the night, somewhere over the North Atlantic. Lake massaged his rubbery face and paced Air Force One in stocking feet, wishing that he had taken a larger dose. "I keep waking up," he said. It was May 8, and across the dimmed, quiet 747, Presidential aides were dozing in thick padded chairs. They were en route to the Moscow summit. But as he stretched and sipped a carton of milk, Lake had Sarajevo on his mind.
For months, Lake had joined those predicting that the spring thaw would renew the Bosnian war, and in recent days the expected had come true. The Bosnian Serbs had resumed their worst shelling in more than a year, in daily contempt for the ultimatums meant to protect the city. Lake was urging the United Nations to respond with air strikes but was meeting strong resistance from allies worried about the taking of hostages. "In our view, there's greater safety if the Serbs think we're serious," he said. "But in the French and the British view, that's easy for us to say, since we don't have troops on the ground." Lake would subsequently win the air strikes, only to join in abandoning them quickly when the Serbs took the U.N. hostages. And once again American policy in Bosnia seemed weak and conflicted.
Nothing casts a greater pall over the entire Clinton foreign policy. Bosnia is hard for everyone, not just for Lake. (Bush, touted for his foreign policy acumen, fared no better than Clinton.) But Bosnia policy is also hard along the very fault line that Lake has straddled throughout his life, forcing him, as he says, to weigh "ideals against the cost of intervention." He had hoped for a world in which "the hard" and "the soft," the interest-driven and the idealistic aspects of his mentality, might fuse into a united fight against evil. Instead, he finds himself each day straddling a painful divide. "It's an excruciating problem," he says.
Odd as it may now seem, Bosnia once gave the Clinton campaign a boost. As reports of concentration camps began to filter out in July 1992, Clinton condemned Bush's inaction and called for air strikes to aid the humanitarian effort. Marlin Fitzwater, the White House press secretary, leaped on Clinton for "reckless" statements, only to discover the Administration's Defense Secretary, Dick Cheney, was saying the same thing. "It was an important moment," Lake says, since it left Clinton looking more forceful, more competent and more humane.
But the event also signaled Lake's own ambivalence. He insisted on inserting a qualification into the Clinton statement, writing that American efforts "may not succeed at this stage, but at least we must do what we reasonably can." It is a striking hedge. And it sufficiently encompasses a quality about Lake (prudence or weakness, depending on one's point of view) that it has become an inner-office joke. Nancy Soderberg, one of his deputies, sometimes responds to assignments by joking, "I'll do what I reasonably can."
But what, on Bosnia, is that? If Lake was caught between conflicting impulses, Clinton raised indecision to an art form. By the time Clinton reached office, he was certainly no longer talking about helping the United Nations shoot its way into Sarajevo, as he had the previous June. But he continued to call himself "saddened," "sickened," "appalled" and "outraged" at the Serbian attacks, creating expectations that made his ultimate inaction seem all the more weak-kneed. "The U.S. should always seek an opportunity to stand up against -- at least speak out against -- inhumanity," he said at a photo session on April 20, 1993. As Elizabeth Drew noted in her book "On the Edge," this was exactly the elemental question: which would it be?
It is hard to imagine a clearer affront to the values Lake champions in his speeches -- to the "face of the tolerant society" -- than the rape, torture, execution, indiscriminate shelling and ethnic cleansing sanctioned by Bosnian Serb leaders who have been branded war criminals. The Western retreat does not equate with Munich; the Serbs, unlike the Nazis, are no threat to London or Paris. But the unpunished Serb advances do invite future problems, encouraging others to practice similar aggression. So the United States has not only ideals but interests at stake.
Nonetheless, Lake has insisted on "a clear red line against any American ground troops there," noting that "Bosnia's a much tougher neighborhood" than Haiti. Vietnam remains on his mind. "There are a lot of very practical lessons that come out of Vietnam," he said. "Think ahead. Don't make commitments that you can't meet. And just don't wander into something." Even if he wanted to dispatch American ground forces -- which he does not -- Lake said the move "would never be supported by the American people and the Congress in any case." The public wariness is real, but neither Lake nor Clinton has made a serious attempt to build public support, for ground troops or for any forceful use of American power in the Balkans. If the worst European crisis in 50 years does not move them to make the case, there are increasingly few places that do.
The refusal to consider ground forces gives the United States only so much leverage, and it has used that only weakly and sporadically. The failed attempt in May 1993 to sell the allies on the policy of "lift and strike" is but one case in point. After months of early debate, Clinton finally decided to promote a policy of lifting the United Nations arms embargo and threatening the Bosnian Serbs with air strikes if they tried to overrun the country while the Government was arming itself. But the allies were opposed. With their troops a part of the U.N. peace-keeping force, they feared the move would increase the violence and even spread the war.
Christopher's attempt to convince them otherwise proved famously ineffective. Christopher took a deferential approach, asking rather than insisting. And as Elizabeth Drew recounts, no sooner had he left for Europe than Clinton himself again seemed to be rethinking the whole idea. The President told Les Aspin, then the Secretary of Defense, that after reading Robert Kaplan's book "Balkan Ghosts," he was struck by the conflict's deep historical roots. Convinced that Clinton was already abandoning his own policy, Aspin called Lake and others to warn them that "he's not on board." The policy would have been hard to sell under the best conditions, but with such flagging conviction it was impossible.
In the two years since, Clinton has seemed to concentrate mainly on personal damage control, trying to keep his distance from a Bosnian quagmire that if sufficiently misplayed could imperil his Presidency. But a series of unhappy compromises now threatens to leave him with the the worst of both worlds -- a record of capitulation and the commitment of American troops. The weak United Nations mission is now on the verge of collapse. If it does withdraw, the United States, as the lead partner in NATO, is pledged to protect the U.N. forces on the way out. The extraction could last four months, cost $1 billion and involve as many as 25,000 American troops; they would be caught in the conflict just as Clinton cranks up his re-election campaign. To avoid this scenario, Lake and Clinton embarked on a last-ditch effort to save the U.N. mission, wringing an allied pledge to punish future Serbian attacks with widespread, unyielding air strikes -- even in the face of hostage-taking. "I'm telling you, this is different. This is very serious," Lake said, in the kind of I-mean-it tone national security advisers hope never to find themselves using.
Meanwhile Congress has repudiated Clinton and voted to lift the arms embargo without the allies' consent. If Clinton fails to sustain his veto, the move will be sure to spell the end of the peace-keeping force and the consequent entry of United States troops.
However this latest impasse turns out, Lake's words a year ago, at the Council on Foreign Relations, seem ever more ironic. "Rather than throw our hands up in despair at the complexities of the post-cold-war era . . ." he said, "we are helping to create a world where tolerance, freedom and democracy prevail."
THE CHILDHOOD HOME WHERE Lake's views took shape was a prosperous, self-consciously intellectual place, proud of its mild peculiarity. As a young man, Lake's father had dropped out of Harvard to work in a textile mill; he later rose to become head of research and development for Burlington Industries. Lake's mother edited books for Reader's Digest. The home was such that the Lake children did not think it unusual to find an aunt in the parlor explaining how Virgil used meter to reinforce meaning.
A crumbling family photo from the early 1950's captures the surface whimsy: his mother smilingly lofts a spyglass, his sister a flute and his father crosses a plunger and a tennis Continued on page 46
racket into a makeshift coat of arms. It is no surprise that the stiff, grinning teen-ager holding a model sailboat would become the kind of national security adviser who a) slipped away from a Presidential entourage to ride a motorbike around Corregidor, b) checked his rotisserie baseball standings from the palace in Kiev and c) roused his aides at 6:30 in the morning to skate on a frozen Ottawa canal. "I was always within the bounds of the conventional trying to be eccentric," he said.
Trying -- but the family still very much believed in conventional success. Lake left for prep school at Middlesex in Concord, Mass., in the ninth grade, and his idea of teen-age rebellion was to announce an interest in attending Stanford. "My father said it was a good idea, but he didn't know who was going to pay for it," he says. "I was always going to go to Harvard." Phrased another way, if Lake's early life instructed him to do good in the world, it also told him to do well. The two messages might be considered the internal analogues of Lake's politics, of his swings between idealism and Realpolitik. Though Lake pretends to have little personal ambition -- he joked in 1992 he was joining the Clinton Administration because "the price of beef is down" -- everyone describes him as an intensely competitive man. Strobe Talbott, the Deputy Secretary of State, sees Lake's love of squash as a metaphor for his mix of courtliness and a fierce desire to win. "Squash is the ultimate Tony Lake sport," he says. "There's a lot of disciplined violence."
Lake's professional drive brought early strains to his marriage. "Your work seemed consistently to have precedence over personal and family matters," his wife wrote in their 1975 Times Magazine article. Lake pleaded guilty: "I find it difficult to recall how readily I, too, assumed that my professsional career was more important." But the two stayed together for another 20 years before agreeing last January to separate. Lake will not discuss his marriage other than to say there are no plans for a divorce. But friends say the work may have played a role: he originally told his wife he would serve as security adviser for only two years. Then he decided to stay on.
For a top White House official, Lake does little socializing and ties to some of his old friends have grown strained as well. Neither Peter Tarnoff nor Richard Holbrooke, both senior State Department officials, would discuss Lake, though the three had been close friends since their time together in Vietnam. Holbrooke is a godfather of one of Lake's daughters. But he told intermediaries he would not be interviewed about Lake; he feared his remarks would take a negative turn.
In a professional sense, one relationship matters most -- the one with Bill Clinton -- and it's a source of constant speculation. Colleagues are often struck by the body language between the large, volcanic Clinton and Lake, whose diffident manner makes him seem smaller than he is. "Tony always gives you the impression that he's not that sure of his relationship with Bill Clinton," said a top official. "I can see it in meetings; he's nervous of it." But the official also added: "Because the President is not involved in foreign policy as much as other Presidents have been, Tony is in a unique position. He's the only one who sees the President every day. That puts him in a very strong position to be the interpreter."
I asked Clinton about his relationship with Lake in a hallway of Air Force One, as the President returned from the Moscow summit in May. "Let me tell you two things that I think are important," said Clinton, who quickly praised Lake's role as a broker who kept him informed of views from across the Government. "He gives me consistently good advice and he gives me advice that's different from his on the big questions. But secondly, he also manages to organize a system at the N.S.C. that has kept up the workload on the hundreds ofother things we have to deal with and doesn't let a lot fall through the cracks." Clinton's point was that in the post-cold-war world, he can never be sure where the next Chechnya or Rwanda will arise. "What's not important today may become very important tomorrow, so you have to manage the entire workload." By doing so, the President said, Lake had "served our country very well."
Then another thought hit Clinton, perhaps because Lake always seems to be beating back some medium-size ailment. He was carted from a Congressional breakfast in 1993 after collapsing from dehydration. He missed the G-7 summit this year while recovering from hernia surgery. He's had continued battles with bronchitis and even his tooth gave out on the day of the showdown with the Haitian dictators, forcing him to undergo emergency repairs at the White House. "I've worried about him several times because I think he works too hard, frankly," Clinton said. "And I've tried to run him off a few times. Not run him off from his job, but just literally get him to go home and get some sleep for the weekend."
CLINTON WAS NOT calling Lake soft, but Lake understands that his reputation for idealism is not an unalloyed blessing. Fairly or not, questions of toughness have often trailed him. As a schoolboy, Lake was younger and smaller than most of his classmates; then he sprouted and captained the squash team at Harvard and rode a motorcyle to the Nixon White House. Still, Kissinger once taunted him to make a memo more "manly" and colleagues found Lake in the White House basement, smashing his fist into a Coke machine in frustration. During our intermittent travels over six months, Lake repeatedly tried to temper his idealistic image with references to his more manipulative side, insisting with obvious sarcasm, for instance, that he would never tell a lie. Riding in the Presidential motorcade through Kiev, Lake suddenly and sourly recalled a 1976 article in The Washington Monthly, portraying him and Holbrooke as two young stars. "Dick Holbrooke was going to be the national security adviser and I was this squishy softy who was going to run the Peace Corps," he said. "It was awful."
But people who know him well have no doubts about Lake's gift for crafty maneuvering. Brainerd Taylor, one of Lake's Harvard roommates, still resents Lake's strategy for obtaining the suite's private bedroom, which they had shared during alternating terms. During his turn, Lake had the room painted "an absolutely bilious yellow," said Taylor, who as a future major in architecture was appalled. "He knew I would be absolutely unwilling to sleep in it. That was Tony to a T."
Lake claims no memory of that but he offers a story just like it -- about, of all things, how he outmaneuvered his draft board. Lake received his draft notice in mid-1962, as he was training to become a Foreign Service officer. "At the time, they were not sending draftees to Vietnam, so my choice was to go to Vietnam with the State Department or go to Fort Dix or somewhere with the Army," he said. Wanting to go to Vietnam, he asked the State Department to send a letter, telling the draft board that he had already been assigned to language training. But the board insisted on seeing him in person, and at the subsequent hearing in Torrington, Conn., one of the members asked him to speak Vietnamese. Rather than remind the panel that the course had not yet begun, Lake began counting to 10 in the Asian language he knew, Chinese. "And they said, 'O.K., you can go to Vietnam.' " It wasn't a direct lie, he observes now. "But I did mislead them in speaking Chinese. That's the only time in my life, ever" that he's done that, he said, "and if you believe that, I've got this property in Florida."
The moment was lighthearted and the story was funny. It was only later that an uneasiness set in: Bill Clinton's national security adviser was joking about manipulating his draft board. As if this President didn't have enough problems for having misled his. Unlike Clinton, of course, Lake did go to Vietnam and he did display physical courage under fire -- "Tough Tony" Lake. In his case, the urge to reveal the deception is as interesting as the episode itself. He was so eager to convey his craftiness, Lake forgot how the story might sound to some of the less-privileged soldiers he and Clinton may soon be dispatching to Bosnia.
Shalikashvili, for one, suspects that the lack of military experience must complicate Lake's decisions about the use of force. "My feeling is that he must always be conscious when it comes to making decisions on the use of military power -- that the President has not served and that he had not served," he said. The general went out of his way to say that "he deals with it very well" and that military experience would not necessarily push Lake's decisions in a particular direction. But he did say, "the decisions would probably be easier because he would then have been a member of the 'club,' if you will."
At times, Lake still seems as though he wants to join. On a trip to Massachusetts this spring, Lake gunned his rental car and playfully began dodging imaginary orange cones. He had just completed a Secret Service course in evasive driving. Roaring down I-91 toward Amherst, he recalled another recent adventure: tagging along on a simulated dogfight in an F-15. His plane was in the lead when the pilot pulled a supersonic about-face, stalling the fighter upside down. "It was the most ecstatic moment you could imagine," he said. "Then he gunned it, brought it around and blew the other guy away." Lake concluded the story by laughing at his own enthusiasms. "It was something every 14-year-old should do," he said.
The danger Lake did face as a 14-year-old was more terrestrial: his father's explosive temper. "He could really get going sometimes," Lake says. Gerard Lake was an ardent New Dealer, more passionate about politics than business, and he would become particularly vexed when arguing with his Republican wife. The prevailing family interpretation is that the clashes between his parents bred in Lake the skills of the future diplomat. He would shuttle between the two, defusing the moment with his diffidence and wit. But Lake sees an additional legacy in his own conflicts about anger. "It taught me to hold my temper," he says. "Especially when I was younger, I would become very polite, very icy and very nasty when I was angry."
A number of his colleagues have glimpsed the cold rage behind a trembling lip, but a more visible eruption occurred in Jakarta, after a prep session for a Clinton news conference. Lake was in the President's suite, briefing him on a list of matters that included esoteric developments on the island of Quemoy. Clinton, still in an unflattering batik shirt, was running late. Finally John Podesta, then Clinton's staff secretary, called the session to a close: there would be no time for Quemoy if the President was going to change into his suit. The meeting broke up in confusion and a furious Lake followed Podesta into the hall, warning him never again to show him such disrespect in front of Clinton. The argument continued down the hallway, where the quick-tempered Podesta called Lake a perfectionist who was wasting the President's time. Then Lake really exploded, grabbed Podesta and tried to shove him into the wall. ("Are you going to put in there that we then went off and had a nice lunch?" Lake asked.)
Another eruption involved the delicate subject of relations with the State Department. As senior policy makers in the Carter years, both Lake and Christopher had witnessed the brutal interagency battles between Brzezinski and Secretary of State Cyrus Vance. Lake and Christopher came into their current roles vowing to operate more cooperatively, and by historical standards they have. But tensions were on the rise last fall, fueled by press speculation that Clinton might replace Lake, Christopher or both. The suspicion boiled over in a suite at the Waldorf-Astoria, where the foreign policy team had gone to prepare for a meeting at the United Nations.
Lake summoned two of Christopher's top assistants, Tom Donilon, his chief of staff, and Michael McCurry, now the White House press secretary. Shaking with anger, he accused them of planting stories designed to make him look bad; incredulous, the two men accused Lake and his staff of doing the same to Christopher. The three exploded and spent 10 minutes denouncing each other in language that could have made the wallpaper peel. Acknowledging that further warfare could sink them all, they agreed to a truce. When talking on unsecured phones, McCurry and Donilon still sometimes refer to Lake as "our Waldorf friend." After learning that the story had spread, Lake raised the issue in mumbling embarrassment. "It did clear the air," he said.
As Bosnia policy fell apart at the end of May, the Waldorf peace was put to the test. A new round of finger pointing broke out after the failed air strikes and hostage incidents. Lake called Donilon in alarm, and the two went on a press offensive, ordering subordinates to eliminate any talk of discord. At a meeting the following day, Lake cleared the room of lower-ranking aides and apologized to Christopher and several other senior officials for excluding them from a military briefing in the Oval Office, the move that had especially incensed the State Department. "It was very forthright for him to say that perhaps he'd missed a call," Christopher says.
But whatever cease-fires were signed in Washington, the fighting in Bosnia was growing ever more horrific. My last extended conversation with Lake on Bosnia came in mid-June, about three weeks after air strikes. Though the violence was increasing in every direction, Lake was caught in what only can be described as wishful thinking. "One thing we can hope is that whole event will have led all the parties to take a look at what going over the edge could mean," he said. A few weeks later, the Serbs overran the so-called "safe areas" of Srebrenica and Zepa, sending tens of thousands of refugees pouring across the country and producing reports of mass executions; a few weeks after that, the Croats re-entered the spreading war.
IT WAS A SUNDAY IN JUNE. LAKE HAD BEEN under great stress and his hernia operation had not helped. A few days earlier, he had recalled the famous David Levine cartoon of Lyndon Johnson lifting his shirt to display a scar in the shape of Vietnam. His scar, Lake joked, would look like Bosnia. Now it was noon; he had been at his desk since 8:30 that morning, trying to use the quiet hours to puzzle out a new approach. At one point, his pain grew so strong he had to close his eyes and put the discussion on hold. "I'm not hearing you," he said. Like many others, I pointed out that the NATO bombings had not just failed but had done so in a completely predictable way. Hadn't Lake himself stood in the Oval Office talking of hostages? His temper momentarily flared. "Gee, you mean something that was done in Bosnia didn't achieve perfect success?" he said sarcastically. "If that's your criterion, then you stop trying anything."
It's true that Bosnia presents a menu of rotten choices and Lake is the one who has to choose. "Do you judge foreign policy makers on the basis of their intentions or on the consequences of their actions?" Lake said, framing the question himself. "In Vietnam, especially, the refuge was always taken in intentions: 'We are fighting for democracy; we are fighting for this; we are fighting for that -- therefore, don't blame us.' And that's much too low a standard. On the other hand, to hold foreign policy makers completely accountable is probably also unfair, because the consequences are so often uncertain. What we can ask -- absolutely -- is that they think about those consequences as hard as they can. And, secondly, that they do so in real terms, which is to say the impact on human lives. That we can ask."
With a little literary license, the Bosnian translation might go something like this: Don't credit him simply for meaning well or blame him for everything that goes wrong. Ask whether at a given moment, in a complicated world, his decisions had a reasonable chance of bridging American interests and ideals. Lake would not say whether he was meeting his own standards, but he did have a kind of tacit response. "I'm really worried that Bosnia will again come to be the definition of American foreign policy and obscure all the other things we've done much better."

Stylish Books and Koobs

BYLINE: By WILLIAM SAFIRE 

 BODY:
THE SUMMER IS RAPIDLY drawing to a close, and you haven't done the reading you were planning to do during the "dog days" to make you a better reader and writer. (That expression is rooted in the summertime rise of Sirius, the Dog Star.)
In these dog days, then, has your reader's eye been seduced by the easy thought-bite layout of news magazines and the colorful bezazz of active matrix computer screens? Do you now expect even your most solid tomes to be enlivened by charts and graphs, quotations set off in banks of type, every double-truck spread a red-light district of sidebars? 
 Welcome to the world of koobs. A koob (palindromists will spot a book spelled backward) is a presentation of prose in a way that battles boredom. It is book publishing's answer to the nervous new layout of wired news magazines, competing with zingy graphics on television and space-age simulation on active matrix color screens. It is Word for the windowless.
The Cambridge Encyclopedia of the English Language, by the British philologist David Crystal, bedazzles you with an eye-popping presentation of the cluck-clucking of the mother tongue. It may be the wave of future publishing: "Superb colour illustrations, charts and highlighted panels," burbles the publisher's brochure, "fascinating insights, anecdotes and examples on every page" (with booksellers offered a "stunning 3-D window display kit" with "poster to match dumpbin header"). If you like fireworks with your information, this is a worthwhile language book, though the sizzle drives the price of the steak up to $49.95.
A lower-key book-as-magazine technique is seen in "The Four Seasons," a delicious history of the New York restaurant by John Mariani with Alex von Bidder (Crown, $35). Photographs are stripped across pages throughout, not bunched in the middle. An occasional light sepia page with darker brown print breaks up the run of white pages and signals a stop for recipes. Page margins are treated as a place for art (as in the American Heritage Dictionary) -- a George Lang menu for the 1964 World's Fair is fascinating -- and the only off-putting touch to a reader is that the columns of text are too wide, tiring the reader's eye. But the book is meant for diners.
Economics, long the dismal science, can also present itself as a lively art. In "The New Illustrated Guide to the American Economy," second edition, by Herbert Stein and Murray Foss (AEI Press, $14.95 paperback), every statistic comes to life on colored graphs; almost every page has a "bank" with a key fact in purple, green or gold type. The data are accurate, the prose is authoritative and the publisher's purpose of bringing clarity and interest to a complicated and often dull subject cannot be faulted. But I am reminded of the joke of the old ethicist who gussies himself up in a mod outfit and is suddenly afflicted with an avalanche of troubles; he looks heavenward and asks, "God, how can you do this to me?" and a voice from above booms back: "Is that you, Herb? I didn't recognize you."
To define soft landing, used by every stockbroker today, I called Herb Stein. The phrase first landed, gently, in space flight, referring in 1958 to the putting-down of an unmanned vehicle on the moon, and was applied first in 1973 to a reduction in the rate of growth that does not result in recession. "It's not a good analogy," says Stein. "The opposite of the airplane metaphor is a bumpy landing. But if the economy didn't have a soft landing, it wouldn't have a bumpy landing -- it would be as if the plane were to go beneath the runway."
Let us turn from koobs to other new products that are unillustrated, are printed in black type on white pages and fail to feature oversize pages or eye-catching inserts. These are still called books -- the 1375 term is still in use -- by writers, not "content providers." They offer no help to readers suffering from contraction of the attention span other than the style and power of their prose.
George V. Higgins, author of "The Friends of Eddie Coyle," turned professionally helpful with "On Writing: Advice for Those Who Write to Publish (or Would Like To)." The work slipped past notice here in hard-cover, but the Boston University professor's practical and punchy advice -- studded with examples of his own and other authors' styles -- is now available in paperback (Holt, $9.95).
"You cannot write well without data," Higgins posits. "That is why so many of the most interesting fiction writers prove on scrutiny to be reporters who have gone straight." He believes that daily deadline pressure is the best training for writers who need to learn the bank robber's rule: "Get in. Get the money. Get out."
The value of such firsthand experience, in the hands of a reporter able to transmogrify it into fiction, can be illustrated in a novel coming out this month: "The Last Debate" (Random House, $23). The author is Jim Lehrer, the PBS broadcaster who moderated the most recent Presidential debate. His premise in his ninth work of fiction is: what if the media abandoned objectivity in a debate to save the country from a dangerous candidate? We're journalistic friends who enjoy each other's fiction: his unobtrusive writing style is cinematic, each scene drawing the reader forward toward the plot's exciting denouement, but the work has an ethical depth that can come only from a person who has experienced the pressures and pleasures of the politico-media symbiosis.
"Everything should be made as simple as possible, but not simpler" is the Albert Einstein observation quoted in "Style: Toward Clarity and Grace," by Joseph M. Williams (University of Chicago Press, $9.95 paperback). (And why doesn't Chicago put the price of the book on the book anymore? Bar codes are for cryptographer-bartenders.) In a section written with Gregory G. Colomb, Professor Williams asks, "Where's the point?" and answers it with a lucid lesson in marching a topic to a conclusion.
The example I'd choose for style in making points is "Loyalty: An Essay on the Morality of Relationships," by George P. Fletcher (Oxford, $11.95 paperback). Loyalty is "an expression of the historical self," "a recognition of duty" and sometimes "a deeper, romantic unity sustained by rituals expressed in patriotism, religious devotion and erotic love." Style in writing is not just elegance in phrasing; it should marshal argument and prose to move or persuade.
Style even has its place in technical manuals. When I finished this piece, I clicked on the gizmo for the modem and got a blank screen. Ron Skarzenski, the Washington bureau's main modem man, came to allay my panic and noticed Newton's Telecom Dictionary, eighth edition (Flatiron, $24.95 paperback), in my stack of never-to-read books: "Can I borrow it? It explains everything about transmission in a way I can understand."
That's another definition of style, and (only if this copy makes it through) an endorsement for a book.

AUTOBIOGRAPHY OF A FACE
By Lucy Grealy. Harper Perennial, $12.
When the author was a child, physicians removed a rare cancer from her jaw -- and half the bone with it. She explains how she reconstructed her shattered sense of self in the years before plastic surgery could restore her face. "It's a young woman's first book, the story of her own life, and both book and life are unforgettable," A. G. Mojtabai said here last year. 

QUICKSAND
By Junichiro Tanizaki. Translated by Howard Hibbett. Vintage International, $11.
First published in serial form in Japan in 1928-30, this novel treats erotic love as a form of worship -- a religion that sometimes demands the ultimate sacrifice. Mitsuko, a beautiful and devious art student, becomes the lover of both a woman and her husband. She finally persuades them to enter into a suicide pact, which has unexpected consequences. In 1994 our reviewer, Ian Buruma, called the book "a fascinating read" and a story that "transcends culture." Vintage International has also reissued a volume of two novellas by Tanizaki, THE REED CUTTER and CAPTAIN SHIGEMOTO'S MOTHER, translated by Anthony H. Chambers ($11). They also revolve around all-consuming love. "In both stories, the author has become the consummate connoisseur of Japanese tradition," Mr. Buruma said in the same review.
OF LONG MEMORY: Mississippi and the Murder
of Medgar Evers
By Adam Nossiter. Addison-Wesley, $12.
The author, a reporter for The New York Times, shows how the first political assassination of the 1960's, intended to squelch the civil rights movement, actually galvanized it. He "chronicles the long journey from 1964 to 1994 through profiles of black and white figures who eventually forced Mississippi to confront its moral and legal duties," William Ferris wrote here last year. Evers's life and death also figure in LOCAL PEOPLE: The Struggle for Civil Rights in Mississippi, by John Dittmer (Illini/University of Illinois, $14.95). The author evokes leaders like Robert Moses, a voting organizer from Harlem, and men and women from diverse communities in Mississippi who helped earn the state its current place in history. He gives "a gripping portrait of largely forgotten civil rights workers who forged racial change in the face of violence and murder," Mr. Ferris said in the same review. The environment they had to fight is examined in BEHIND THE MASK OF CHIVALRY: The Making of the Second Ku Klux Klan, by Nancy MacLean (Oxford University, $13.95). The author sees the Klan's revival in the years after World War I as primarily rooted in economics, with lower-middle-class have-nots focusing their resentment on blacks and immigrants. "This is a big book about a small place," Jacquelyn Dowd Hall said in the Book Review in 1994. "Its dark vision of the American heartland is bound to stir lively debate." WHITE TERROR: The Ku Klux Klan Conspiracy and Southern Reconstruction, by Allen W. Trelease (Louisiana State University, $17.95), traces the origins of the Klan, noting that it infiltrated both law enforcement and the judicial system in the Southern states following the Civil War. In 1971 our reviewer, C. Vann Woodward, called "Mr. Trelease's excellent book" the "fullest narrative history of the subject we are likely to have."
CAL
By Bernard Mac Laverty. Norton, $11.
 This haunting novel explores the pain and divided loyalties of contemporary Ireland through a single life: that of Cal, a teen-age boy in Ulster who becomes both an unwilling participant in an I.R.A. murder and the anguished lover of the dead man's wife. "Its meditation on human suffering and responsibility carries the complexity and amplitude of the very finest novels," Michael Gorra said here in 1983.
GUEST OF A SINNER
By James Wilcox. Harper Perennial, $12.
Eric Thorsen, a musician, wages war against his elderly neighbor, whose apartment reeks of 22 cats. Along the way, both his life and his living quarters change. This novel's characters "would be exactly like everyone else if James Wilcox hadn't made them so much funnier," Eric Kraft said in the Book Review in 1993.
ONE OF US: Richard Nixon and the American Dream
By Tom Wicker. Random House, $16.
A former columnist for The New York Times renders a portrait of the former President that is the opposite of the conventional wisdom: Nixon, he concludes, was often an able man in domestic matters but largely a failure in foreign affairs. In 1991 our reviewer, Godfrey Hodgson, wrote, "Mr. Wicker's knowledge, insight and fairness have enabled him to transcend the scuffle between the friends and the foes of Richard Nixon." A similar argument is advanced in NIXON RECONSIDERED, by Joan Hoff (Basic Books, $16), which states that Nixon, not Henry Kissinger, engineered much of his Administration's foreign policy. "What sets this book apart is its exhaustive research and . . . provocative intellectual framework," Richard Norton Smith said here last year.
SARATOGA BACKTALK
By Stephen Dobyns. Penguin, $5.95.
In his Saratoga Springs mystery of last year, the author allows Victor Plotz, usually a sidekick, to investigate a horse owner's murder. "His snappy sense of humor gets this brash sleuth through his first case in high style," Marilyn Stasio wrote in these pages in 1994.
DREAMS LIKE THUNDER
By Diane Simmons. Story Line Press, $14.95.
In 1959 a 10-year-old girl discovers that her Oregon pioneer heritage may be less noble than she imagined. The author "has the measure of her setting as well as her rural characters," Karen Mathieson said in the Book Review in 1992. LAUREL GRAEBER

HEADLINE: Americans Despair Of Popular Culture

BYLINE: By ELIZABETH KOLBERT 

 BODY:
AMERICANS HAVE A STARKLY NEGATIVE VIEW of popular culture, and blame television more than any other single factor for teen-age sex and violence. By a large margin, they favor measures like ratings that would give parents more information about what their children are watching and listening to. But by almost as large a margin, they say they believe that such measures would not actually succeed in preventing children from viewing or hearing material that is inappropriate.
These are among the findings of a New York Times poll examining Americans' attitudes about the influence of popular culture. The results of the poll suggest that Americans are deeply ambivalent about their own diversions. Although the average adult in the United States watches television for more than four hours a day, a little more than half of the adults polled could not think of a single good thing to say about television, or about movies or popular music. In contrast, 9 out of 10 of those polled could think of something bad to say about popular culture, with a large proportion mentioning too much sex, violence and vulgar language and a smaller percentage pointing to bias and just plain stupidity. 
 Many Americans say they believe there is a direct connection between the fictional world young people are exposed to and the way they behave in real life. Half of those surveyed said they believed portrayals of sex and violence on television, in movies and in music lyrics contribute "a lot" to whether teen-agers become sexually active or violent. A quarter said they believed such portrayals contribute "some." Only a fifth said they believed that the portrayals of sex and violence in popular culture had "little" or "no" influence on teen-agers' behavior.
"I think it has a bad influence," said Robert Bowden, a 50-year-old father of five from Cottage Grove, Tenn., in a follow-up telephone interview after the poll was completed. "That's your future generation. It's what we've made them. Two parents are working all the time. They can't be with the family like they used to. They don't know what's going on while they're not home."
Asked to name for themselves what is most to blame for teen-age violence, 21 percent of those polled volunteered "television." Six percent blamed "the media" more generally, while 4 percent cited movies. Altogether, 33 percent of those polled named some aspect of popular culture, making it the most often cited cause; and 33 percent cited some aspect of family life, including lack of parental discipline and family breakdown. Smaller percentages cited causes like "drugs," "boredom" and "economics."
The poll suggests that politicians who denounce the sex and violence in popular culture -- as Senator Bob Dole did in May in his much-publicized Presidential campaign speech attacking Hollywood -- have hit on a theme that resonates deeply with the American public.
At the same time, the poll suggests that these politicians should not expect to get too much credit for their attacks. Only one out of five respondents said that politicians who criticize popular culture were "sincere," while three out of five said such politicians were simply speaking out "for political gain."
THE POLL, CONDUCTED JULY 23 through July 26, surveyed 1,209 adults. Of those, 411 (34 percent) were parents who have children ages 2 through 17 living with them. The poll -- which has a margin of sampling error of plus or minus 3 percentage points over all, and plus or minus 5 percentage points for those with children living at home -- found little difference between the opinions of parents and those of adults in general.
Questions about the influence of popular culture on society and about what, if anything, should be done to combat it have occupied psychological researchers and social scientists for years. Increasingly, as polls have shown growing public concern about such questions, they have become a matter of political debate as well.
The New York Times poll, the first by the newspaper measuring attitudes about pop culture, suggests that while Americans are deeply concerned about the impact of popular culture, they are also concerned about Government intrusion into the entertainment industry and skeptical that measures that are currently being debated in Washington will really make much difference.
Asked, for example, whether television shows should have ratings as movies now do, 84 percent of those polled said yes. But when they were asked whether those ratings should be required by the Federal Government, the proportion answering yes was only 39 percent. And when they were asked whether ratings would "succeed in keeping children from seeing inappropriate material," the proportion saying yes dropped to just 30 percent. Roughly the same pattern emerged from questions about rating music recordings and video games.
The one form of ratings that exists -- movie ratings -- received mixed reviews in the poll. Fifty-two percent of those polled said that the movie rating system, established voluntarily by the movie industry in 1968, did "a good job in informing people about how much sex and violence to expect," while 43 percent said it did not. Only 20 percent said that the rating system actually succeeds in keeping children away from inappropriate movies, while 76 percent said it did not.
Raymond Dieter, a 46-year-old father of four from Essexville, Mich., said in a follow-up interview that he tried to monitor what his children watch and listen to, and that ratings for television shows and music recordings "would help some." But, he added, "kids are always going to want to watch what we don't want them to."
A majority of the parents polled said they had forbidden their children from watching specific movies or television shows because of content. Eighty-four percent of the parents said they had forbidden their children from watching a specific television show at some point; 64 percent said they had done so in the last six months. Sixty-four percent said they had forbidden their children from seeing a specific movie, 42 percent in the last six months.
The television show that was most frequently mentioned as forbidden was MTV's "Beavis and Butt-head," followed by Fox's "Mighty Morphin Power Rangers." No one movie was singled out by parents as off limits; movies ranging from the science-fiction thriller "Species" to the goofy comedy "Dumb and Dumber" each received a few mentions.
Less than half of the parents polled, 42 percent, said they had forbidden their children from listening to a specific musical recording, 29 percent in the last six months. The category of music most frequently mentioned as forbidden was rap.
ALTHOUGH AMERICANS SEEM eager to exert more control over what their children are exposed to, on the issue of the so-called V-chip, by which televisions could be programmed to block out shows with certain ratings, they also seem concerned about the possibility of too much Government intrusion into the entertainment industry. Both houses of Congress have recently voted to require all new television sets to carry V-chips (the "V" stands for violence). Proponents of V-chips, including President Clinton, say they would provide parents with a powerful new tool to help restrict what their children watch. Opponents of the chips, including Senator Dole and most of the television industry, argue that they would lead to an indirect form of censorship.
Asked whether the Government should require the installation of V-chips, or whether that would "involve too much Government regulation," 31 percent of those polled said the chips should be required while 60 percent said such a requirement would involve too much regulation.
Kelly Stenquist, 32, a mother of three from Sandy, Utah, said in a follow-up interview that she had originally been in favor of the V-chip but reconsidered after her husband argued that the television industry could use the existence of the chip to justify putting even more violent or salacious shows on in prime time. "It's kind of scary," she said. "I'm kind of torn."
Members of the entertainment industry, as well as many more-disinterested observers of popular culture, argue that the concerns about mass entertainment's impact are overstated and that no clear-cut connection has ever been demonstrated between, say, the violence children see on television and in movies and the crimes they commit on the streets. And, indeed, many of the studies on the topic have failed to come up with a strong statistical correlation between what children watch and what they do.
Among social scientists, however, there is a broad consensus that there is at least an indirect relationship between popular culture and behavior. And as many have pointed out, the television industry at least implicitly believes this to be the case. Otherwise, how can television executives make the case to advertisers that buying air time will boost their sales?
Most of the parents interviewed as a follow-up to the poll said that they saw direct evidence of the connection between popular culture and behavior, noting that their children imitated behavior and language they picked up from television, movies and the radio.
"It's the way they talk and the way they view life in general," said 41-year-old Denise O'Hara of Roswell, Ga., the mother of two teen-age boys. "They say 'I'm going to kill you' like it's O.K., like it's nothing. They don't understand that you kill someone, that's it, they're gone. It's like 'Oh, cool, oh neat, watching this is great.' "
Even though they sometimes prevent their children from watching specific television programs or movies, most of the parents interviewed also said they felt powerless to prevent their children from seeing and hearing all inappropriate entertainment.
Dave Hull, a 40-year-old father of two from Lakeworth, Fla., was another person who pointed out that because both parents in many families are working these days, it is becoming more and more difficult to keep children from being exposed to whatever is on the air or in the cinemas. "Parents are not around," said Mr. Hull, who works days as a cook and whose wife works nights as a security guard. "So kids are going to get a hold of what they want no matter what. I don't see how you can keep them away."
As for ratings for television shows, videos and musical recordings, Mr. Hull said he wasn't sure they would be "worth the money or the bureaucracy." "Something should be done," he said. "But there's no easy answer."
Mark Mellman, a political pollster who has studied Americans' attitudes toward popular culture, said that concern about the influence of the entertainment industry has been rising precisely because many people feel that parents no longer spend enough time with their kids.
"Behind every major issues, like crime or welfare, people look at it and see declining values as key," he said. "The family is the place where good values should be taught. But because of economic circumstances, both parents are working just to provide necessities, and people have less time to inculcate values. So people see TV, movies and other kids inculcating values, and they're the wrong values."
One reason Americans seem so skeptical about regulatory solutions to the problem, he said, is that there is no way for the Government to make parents less busy. "There's not some chip that can give people more time," he said. "That's a much more difficult problem to get your hands around."

HEADLINE: The Lure of an Irish Time Warp

BYLINE: By CAROLINE SEEBOHM; CAROLINE SEEBOHM's "At Home With Books," about private libraries, will be published in November (Carol Southern Books).

 BODY:
I WAS never a believer in Ireland. The blarney about peat bogs, misty mountains and smiling Irish eyes did not convince. But during a recent visit, I realized that this country has a much more specific appeal than cliches about the Emerald Isle. Its landscapes, villages and coastlines have somehow avoided the corrosive ugliness brought on by modern civilization, and in particular by tourism. Nowhere is this more true than in West Cork. Its difficulty of access and uncertainty of weather have preserved its beauty in a magical time warp.
Not that the area is maintained like America's "historic" towns -- in aspic, with costumes. Drive from Bantry to Skibbereen, the two towns that anchor the west-east borders of this part of County Cork, and you will see scrubby fields dotted with sheep and goats, donkey carts carrying families to market, crumbling Georgian houses, ruined barns, and the usual flotsam and jetsam of a small rural area trying to make ends meet.
But thanks to generous subsidies from the European Union (Ireland, like Greece and Portugal, other less economically successful nations, has been a major beneficiary of this otherwise contentious alliance), life is on an upswing in West Cork. The stucco facades of the village houses are freshly painted in their traditional bright purple, pink, yellow and blue, colors you would expect to see around the Mediterranean or Caribbean rather than the moody Atlantic. The food shops are filled with a wide range of fresh produce, and the coves are punctuated with fancy sailing yachts as well as thriving fishing boats. An occasional Mercedes or BMW glides through town; the restaurants are crowded. West Cork has become a mecca for artists and artisans, and the West Cork Arts Center in Skibbereen is a showcase for local talent.
Enhancing this sense of well-being is one of nature's many gifts to the region. Although roughly on the latitude of Goose Bay, Labrador, West Cork is caressed by the warm air of the Gulf Stream throughout the year. It rarely snows here and rains often, causing the gardens to flourish with unseemly abandon. Semitropical plants such as palms, calla lilies, rosemary and abutilon jockey for position along the country roads, with wild fuchsia tumbling down the hedges in a rosy cascade, causing as much distraction to the unwary motorist as the flock of sheep moseying its way home after a day's grazing. This priceless quirk of climate, combined with the fickle northern light, make the region as affecting visually as the landscapes of Corot. It is not surprising that a few shrewd seekers after paradise have settled here, including such movie people as Jeremy Irons and David Puttnam, whose houses eye each other warily across Roaring Water Bay.
As one drives southwest from Cork airport, the small town of Rosscarbery is the first landmark of the West Cork region. A nearby site of druidic standing stones at Drombeg, a miniature Stonehenge, indicates that an ancient population once lived here. The road continues on into Glandore, the Cannes of West Cork. Charmingly situated on a cliff overlooking the harbor, Glandore's pubs and color-washed houses exude a serene glow in the soft Irish light. Sitting with a pint at the Glandore Inn, with a view of the church to our right, and in front of us running down to the water a public garden planted with lavender, petunias, salvia and flowering shrubs, my friend and I could understand why the Irish have always had a season ticket to Parnassus. Glandore is on one side of a long fjord, and facing it on the other side is a town called Union Hall (named for the Act of Union between Britain and Ireland in 1801), less glamorous than Glandore, more a serious fishing harbor. It is worth driving over the fjord on the one-lane bridge from one town to the other. We enjoyed a little detour north to Leap (pronounced lepp), where the water winds gently between small mountains like a child of the Rhine.
Skibbereen, like its name, is a cheerful Irish jig of a place and the heart of West Cork, with more bright-painted houses, bustling streets, and several antique and pottery shops. Six miles south of Skibbereen is the village of Casletownshend, which my companion had visited as a schoolboy 35 years earlier. Nothing had changed. Like many villages in Cornwall, England, it slopes steeply down to the sea. Castletownshend was given to the Townshend family by Charles II in the late 17th century, and one wall of the Episcopal Church of St. Barrahane's has an inscription that invites competition with the Lord Himself in its detailing of the saintliness of this powerful Protestant family. Castletownshend is also famous as the home of Edith Somerville and her cousin Violet Martin, the two women who chronicled the hilarious adventures of "The Irish R.M." (an Englishman who served as resident magistrate) in their turn-of-the-century novels under the gender-free names Somerville and Ross. After visiting here on an unusually hot day, we drove to a sandy cove off the road between Castletownshend and Tregumna, where we swam (the water was Maine-cold) and explored the excellent climbing rocks.
A few minutes south of Skibbereen on Lake Abisdealy is one of the more unusual gardens to find in this undeveloped spot. The Liss Ard project is the brainchild of Claudia and Veith Meister-Turske (she is Swiss, he is German), who moved here a few years ago. Claudia told us of their New Age dream of creating a public wildlife garden, with park land, waterfalls, hills, sounds of water, arboretums and three sculptured "experiences" (the Crater, the Pyramid and the Sky Garden), designed by the California artist James Turrell and not yet completed. Local observers have remarked that this part of Ireland is already in effect a public park, with waterfalls, hills, wildlife and so forth, so why make the tremendous effort of time and money (they planted 10,000 trees and shrubs in six weeks) in an attempt to recreate what is already there? Bizarre in conception (Ireland was the only place in western Europe where the couple could acquire enough land) and wildly difficult to pull off, the Liss Ard Experience is at the moment a garden in progress.
Four miles southwest of Skibbereen is Lough (pronounced Loch, as in Loch Lomond) Hyne, the only inland sea lake in northern Europe. Surrounded by spectacular undulating hills, this lake is a marine biologist's playpen, owing to the unusual organisms that haunt its salty waters. (We found we would need scuba equipment, however, to share in the fun.) Among its curiosities is an asymmetrical tidal cycle; it takes four hours to rise and eight and a half to fall. A short hop from Lough Hyne is Baltimore, another ravishing coastal town, eight miles from Skibbereen. Baltimore, with picturesque cottages, and hanging baskets of fuchsia, geraniums and daisies ornamenting its narrow streets, is the home of a French sailing school, thus ensuring a wonderful anomaly: authentic French cooking in the heart of a remote Irish fishing village.
On the road from Skibbereen to Baltimore are Creagh (pronounced kree) Gardens, created by Gwendoline and Peter Harold-Barry earlier this century on the grounds of their Georgian house, and now kept up by their heirs. The gardens would have pleased the great English 18th-century garden designer Capability Brown, whose penchant for "natural" landscapes is faithfully reproduced here. Reflecting the wild beauty of the estuary on which they are situated, the extensive gardens rise, Nereid-like, from the water toward the more formal (and less successful) plantings close to the house.
From Baltimore to Bantry we caught other breathtaking views, in particular around the little hill town of Ballydehob, with its 12-arch viaduct overlooking Roaring Water Bay, and on down to Mizen Head and Fastnet Rock. As a child in England I used to hear on the radio daily weather forecasts from Fastnet, and imagined "Fastnet" as some mysterious web of divination. How thrilled I was finally to find its source, the Fastnet Lighthouse, which has been giving its soulful warnings to ships navigating the stormy Atlantic since the middle of the 19th century.
Bantry, the final destination of our tour, cast a different kind of spell upon us. About 25 minutes by car from Skibbereen, the town sits on a hill above a huge deep-water bay surrounded by a frieze of mountains, rocks and meadows. Dominating the town is Bantry House, which gazes down at this lush Irish panorama with a ramshackle serenity. One of Ireland's most famous stately homes, it combines the majesty of the best 18th-century architecture and landscaping with a spirited touch of Irish eccentricity.
Bantry House has witnessed much history. In December 1795, a French fleet of roughly 50 warships, carrying almost 15,000 French troops, sailed from Brest to Bantry to support the United Irish leader Wolfe Tone in his fight to free Ireland from British rule. The French got as far as Bere Island, at the mouth of Bantry Bay, before terrible storms and inefficient communications caused the fleet to turn back. In the Bantry House stableblock there is an exhibition about this failed invasion, with ships' models and printed extracts from Wolfe Tone's journals. Richard White, then owner of Bantry House and a prominent member of the Protestant Ascendancy (English who were given land grants in Ireland) was named Earl of Bantry for his loyalty to the crown during this uprising. His heirs have lived at the house ever since. The entrance is guarded by several poetical characters who speak Irish amongst themselves. The front hall is a dazzling space with large black and white tiles on the floor, leading to a staircase and various rooms, some on different levels, all oddly decorated with family furniture and paintings, including a portrait of the present owner blowing his own horn (literally). The main drawing room has vast floor-to-ceiling windows framed brilliantly in long panels of mirror, reflecting the views of the balustraded park and bay and mountains beyond.
The dining room has two gigantic built-in sideboards, the like of which I have never seen even in the grandest English stately homes. Through the long windows is a view of a columned portico and a sunken rose garden. The library has French doors that look out on the Italian garden, which consists of a central tree-encircled fountain with shells stuck onto its sides, and a stone staircase that rises up as far as the eye can see. In the library is a grand piano with the following notice on it: "If you are an experienced pianist and would like to play please tell us at the desk. Piano is tuned to concert pitch (440)."
Upstairs the atmosphere gets increasingly peculiar. In the East Bow Bedroom a closet door swings open to reveal a past owner's party dresses, a collection of Regency velvet jackets and silk chemises, all falling apart. The upstairs landing is strangely touching, with ancient peeling leather doors and dusty mementos. But the overall feeling of the house is not so much elegant decay as wild romanticism. What one remembers are the astonishing colors of the rooms -- a sensuous rose for the drawing room, an exuberant blue for the dining room -- and the huge mirrored windows that pay lyrical obeisance to the natural wonders of the land and seascape outside. Mostly unrestored both inside and out (although work is now proceeding with funds wheedled out of the Irish Government), Bantry House is a perfect metaphor for the bafflingly beautiful and original character of this part of Ireland.
 
 
 
Making your way among the villages
Getting There
 The nearest airports are Cork (about an hour and a quarter from Skibbereen) and Shannon (over two and a half hours away). The main roads are fairly good, but when you travel between the small coastal villages, banish any thought of speed.
 The dialing code for Ireland is 353. Prices are calculated at the rate of 1.6 Irish pounds to the dollar.
 
Where to Stay
Rates are per person in a double room, and all include breakfast.
Liss Ard Lake Lodge, on a lake just outside Skibbereen, like its gardens, is an unexpected hotel to find in Ireland, in that it is designed in a kind of Zen minimalist style much favored in California. The 10 lakefront bedrooms are stunningly luxurious but austere, with all-white linens and furnishings, meditation lofts, video players, stereo equipment, spa bathrooms, and nothing else to detract from the natural beauty of the surroundings. Rates range from $80 to $192. Telephone 28-22365; fax 28-22839.
 Ballylickey Manor House, overlooking Bantry Bay, 27-50071, fax 27-50124, is a splendid former shooting lodge with cottages, a pool and gardens, in a park with private trout and salmon fishing. Rates: from $72 to $131.
 The 42-room West Cork Hotel on Ilen Road in Skibbereen, 28-21277, fax 28-22333, is well situated on the river at the edge of town, but it is less elegant and less comfortable than the two already mentioned. Rates: $48.
 If you prefer a more "authentic" Irish experience, there are many bed-and-breakfasts throughout West Cork, and they are clean and cheap. The Skibbereen Tourist Office will book one for a fee of $1.60 locally and $3.20 for the rest of Ireland. (By the way, in Ireland, if you see a sign advertising a bedroom "ensuite" it means it comes with a private bathroom.)
 
Where to Eat
Two musts for all visitors to West Cork (or any part of Ireland): Irish soda bread (basically flour, milk, baking soda and salt), which is sometimes light and fluffy, sometimes as rich and nutty as a carrot cake; and at least one half-pint of Guinness, a meal in itself, which tastes entirely different in its home country from the weakened stuff (even on draft) sent abroad.
 Blair's Cove Restaurant, Durrus, seven miles south of Bantry, 27-61127, is in the stable of a restored Georgian house and serves (dinner only) good fish and shellfish, as do most of the restaurants and pubs in West Cork. Prices range from $16 to $40.
 Liss Ard Lake Lodge has a restaurant suited to its owners' ecologically conscious vision, with food that is entirely free of cholesterol. They offer an impressive but light and healthy six-course dinner. An example: consomme, warm oysters with cucumber sauce, a vegetable tempura, fresh duck, sorbets and fruits flavored with anise and rosewater. All ingredients are fresh, pasta is home made, and the meticulously planned menu changes daily. A six-course dinner costs $53 a person.
 Mary Ann's Restaurant, Castletownshend, 28-36146, has delicious crabmeat, scallops and mussels, and won the Egon Ronay award last year for the best Irish soda bread. Eat in the simple outside cafe if weather permits. Prices start at around 8 Irish pounds a person. Five-course dinner: $32.
 The Rectory, Glandore, is in a Georgian country house, with lovely views over the harbor. Local produce is available daily. Dinner ranges from $32 to $48.
 Chez Youen, on the quai in Baltimore, is a genuine French bistro with French chefs cooking French food. After a diet of crabmeat salads, this is the place for a change of pace. It even promises to have fresh lobster all year round (not Maine lobster, needless to say; what Americans would probably call crayfish). Prices range from $20 for lunch to $50 for dinner.
 Many restaurants and pubs offer traditional Irish music on weekends.

HEADLINE: I.B.M. Planning a Scaled-Down New Headquarters

BYLINE: By MARY McALEER VIZARD 

 BODY:
I.B.M. is moving forward with plans to abandon its palatial headquarters in Armonk in favor of something next door that is smaller but more serviceable by contemporary standards. Preliminary plans indicate that the building will be as high-tech as the company itself.
"Our current facility is simply no longer suited to serve as headquarters of the world's leading information technology company," said Louis V. Gerstner Jr., I.B.M.'s chairman and chief executive officer, in a letter to I.B.M. employees. He went on to point out that the 30-year-old headquarters would have to be totally renovated and rewired to meet today's needs. "The bottom line is that a new building would cost about the same as overhauling our current building." 
 I.B.M.'s headquarters has been in Armonk, in Westchester County, since 1963, when it built a 420,000-square-foot building, typical of corporate headquarters of that vintage. Faced in concrete and steel, the building sits high on a hill, surrounded by 368 campuslike acres.
Inside, it is characterized by vast dramatic corridors and "lots of wasted space," said Tom Beerman, I.B.M.'s manager of corporate issues.
"With the present building, we can't get cable TV hookups, much less fiber-optic cable," Mr. Beerman said. "Our new building will be much more in keeping with the business we're in."
I.B.M. plans to sell or lease its current headquarters, as well as 133.5 acres of surrounding property, once the new building is ready for occupancy.
In June the company took its first steps in getting the necessary approvals to construct a new headquarters. It chose to stay in Armonk, building a 283,500-square-foot building on 211 acres of its land, adjacent to the site of the current building and near the company's Management Development Center.
"We decided to build on land we already own just up the street," Mr. Gerstner said. "We'd like to create a campus-like atmosphere where we can host customers, train employees from around the world and teleconference whenever necessary."
The company hired the architectural firm Kohn Pedersen Fox Associates of Manhattan and the environmental engineering firm Ronald A. Freeman Associates of Mount Kisco, in Westchester, to come up with a conceptual plan for the new building. It was presented in a draft environmental impact statement, in June, before the planning board of the town of North Castle.
While the design is still in the early stages, the building is expected to be covered in reflective glass and metal, "light, not shiny," according to Greg Clement, a partner with Kohn Pedersen Fox. "It's a modern aesthetic, not traditional. It's meant to express the technical aspect of I.B.M.."
The interior will have a "more open office arrangement," according to Mr. Beerman, with movable dividers. Mr. Beerman said that one of Mr. Gerstner's major complaints about the current building is that it has too many offices and at the same time too little space for accommodating customer meetings. "We want to create a place that's inviting to customers to come in and work for the day, and have access to our facilities."
The current headquarters has 700 to 800 employees, Mr. Beerman said; the new building would have 500 to 600. The rest are to be moved to other locations.
Tomorrow, I.B.M. is expected to submit its final environmental impact statement, the first step in getting site plan approval for the project. It also seeks a special use permit to construct a helipad that will operate until 9 P.M.
Mr. Beerman said the construction of the new headquarters was expected to cost from $60 million to $70 million and take two years to complete.
WHEN word got out that I.B.M. was considering its options on a new headquarters, the Connecticut Department of Economic Development offered the company an incentive package, according to Jack Lombardi, supervisor of the Town of North Castle.
"In the big scheme of things, we could have gone anywhere," said Mr. Beerman. The deciding factor, he added, was a phone call Gov. George E. Pataki placed to Mr. Gerstner shortly after being sworn in.
"The Governor called to indicate a change in attitude in state government," Mr. Beerman said. "He said that he wanted the state to support long-term residents like I.B.M. That phone call made New York the first choice; there was not a second choice."
I.B.M. employs more than 25,000 people in New York and plans to spend about $245 million on capital investment in the state during 1995, according to Mr. Gerstner. In announcing the company's decision to remain in the state, Mr. Gerstner said, "This level of investment would have been difficult to maintain if we didn't believe the state was serious about improving New York's business environment."
The computer company and the state worked out a multifaceted agreement that grants I.B.M. tax abatements and incentives. Technically I.B.M. will convey the site for the new building to either the Westchester County Industrial Development Agency or the New York Urban Development Corporation. This would render it exempt from real estate taxes. "That's necessary so the company can be eligible for tax benefits, low-interest financing and other incentives," said Roland A. Baroni, attorney for the Town of North Castle.
I.B.M. agreed to a 20-year schedule of payments in lieu of taxes, Mr. Baroni said. It will pay a minimum of $2,597,000 a year for the new building lot, and a minimum of $750,000 a year for the existing headquarters. Taxes on the new building lot will increase 3 percent annually in years 11 through 20. "It's basically equivalent to what they're paying now," Mr. Baroni said. "In these deals, the local government needs to be assured of its tax revenue, otherwise it would never approve of the project."
In addition, the company will donate approximately 23 acres of its campus to the Town of North Castle, for use as parkland by town residents. The property now has several softball fields, a running track, tennis courts, a basketball court, a soccer field, playground, picnic area, children's playground and a field house with locker and shower facilities.
"Several years ago, we approached I.B.M. about it because we noticed it wasn't well-utilized by the employees," Mr. Lombardi said. "And no town, especially at this time of year, has enough ballfields. So now that they're subdividing their property anyway, it seemed like the perfect opportunity."
ON the same day the Governor announced that I.B.M. was staying in New York, he outlined the state's plan to buy or lease portions of vacant I.B.M. properties to consolidate the state's data center operations.
Under the agreement, the state will purchase approximately one million square feet of space in Kingston and 325,000 square feet in Endicott, in Broome County, for about $13 million.
In addition, the state will occupy around 75,000 square feet at a vacant plant in East Fishkill, in Dutchess County, and pay operating and maintenance costs only.
"This is a good deal for the state," said Charles A. Gargano, commissioner of the New York State Office of Economic Development. "We're purchasing these buildings at a very attractive price and it's space we need anyway and would otherwise have to lease or build at market rates."
Michael H. Siegel, executive director of the Westchester/Fairfield offices of the Edward S. Gordon Company, in White Plains, said that I.B.M. was being "very astute in not marketing the old building while it's focused on the design of its new headquarters."
"This way," he said, "a prospective purchaser will know what and where I.B.M.'s headquarters will be, and precisely how it will impact their business."
Despite the building's "boxy, stodgy appearance," Mr. Siegel said, "its quality and maintenance have been kept up and it's beautifully sited." Mr. Siegel also said that the vast interior space could be "reconfigured, but it would be most suitable to a large user."
The building's most outstanding feature, brokers say, is an atrium designed by I. M. Pei.
"Except for the atrium, it's plain vanilla, well, maybe French vanilla," said John H. Rostenberg, a principal with Rostenberg-Doren, a commercial broker in Purchase and Stamford. "I think there'll be a market for it. The building will have to be completely gutted before any new use."

HEADLINE: Commercial Property/CDL Hotels International;
Buyer of Major Hotels Remains a Bit of an Unknown

BYLINE: By CLAUDIA H. DEUTSCH 

 BODY:
IN Singapore, where members of the Kwek family have been prominent real estate magnates for decades, or in Hong Kong, where their companies are traded on the stock exchange, or among investment bankers anywhere, CDL Hotels International is a well-known entity.
But in the New York hotel community, it has been generating Lone Ranger-style "who was that masked man?" double takes. In less than two years, this group of Singaporeans galloped in and whoosh, they swooped up the Millenium Hotel, the Hotel Macklowe and most recently, the Plaza Hotel. If the Sultan of Brunei had not bid $202 million for the Helmsley Palace in 1993, CDL would have had that one too -- its bid of $180 million was the fallback bid. 
 Yet calls around town to other hoteliers, asking how this new presence on the New York hotel scene will affect competition, turned up uniform head-scratching.
"They are somewhat of an unknown in the marketplace," said Thomas Huffsmith, vice president of La Salle Partners' hotel investment and advisory group.
"They are investors more than hoteliers," explained Douglas P. Hercher, a director of Jones Lang Wootton USA, a real estate firm involved in the Plaza sale. "They identified the hotel market as attractive and underpriced, but outsiders run their properties."
Indeed, Hilton runs the Millenium, and Fairmont Hotels runs the Plaza (Donald J. Trump remains on the management committee, but is concentrating on developing luxury condominiums on three Plaza floors). Nonetheless, CDL Hotels is unlikely to remain an enigma for long. In April it formed CDL-USA Management to set strategy and tactics for its three hotels in New York and three in London. Come October, it will change the Hotel Macklowe's name to the Broadway Millennium -- spelled correctly, as opposed to the downtown hotel's poetic-license single 'n'.
The move is a harbinger of Millenniums to come. Eduoard A. Gremlich, CDL-USA's chief executive, says the company will probably slap the Millennium name on the Gloucester in London. It is negotiating for a package of 15 hotels in Europe that would probably carry the Millennium name. It is looking for hotels in Australia. Mr. Gremlich says that Kwek Leng Beng, the chairman of City Developments Limited, CDL's parent company, wants to own 100 hotels in 10 years, most of them in the Millennium -- four-star business hotel -- category.
"The Kweks won't buy anything whose cash flow does not service debt," Mr. Gremlich said. "But the more hotels they buy the more excited they get."
They are in good position to buy more. City Developments owns vast tracts of land in Singapore, and its stock issues have generally been warmly welcomed by investors. CDL Hotels is not doing badly either: Its 1994 annual report showed a market capitalization -- the number of shares outstanding times the price per share -- of about $800 million, and well over $100 million in cash.
"THERE'S a huge supply of hotel rooms in the United States that could be converted to the Millennium brand," Mr. Huffsmith said. "A buyer who walks in with cash and can close immediately usually wins the asset."
That certainly describes CDL's recent pattern. "They bid against a lot of American chains for the Millenium and the Macklowe, and they came up higher every time," said Frank Dougherty, senior vice president of Hospitality Valuation Services, a Mineola, L.I., consulting firm.
"They have no bureaucracy," said Susan G. Ricci, a consultant who was the Millenium's managing director when Mr. Kwek toured the hotel. "They respond immediately if they like what they see."
In New York, CDL is likely to be a fierce competitor, and not just because of its deep pockets. Unlike other foreign investors who have had problems here -- the Asian owners of the Peninsula were without a liquor license for several months, while the French owners of the Novotel are embroiled in union battles -- CDL's hotels come with entrenched and savvy management.
But, since they are taking over existing hotels, they are not adding new rooms to the mix. In fact, the Millennium chain may even benefit its New York competitors.
"It will market its New York hotels in many other countries, and that may bring more visitors to the city in general," said Joseph E. Spinnato, president of the Hotel Association of New York City.
Indeed, CDL Hotels' presence overseas is growing almost geometrically. Although CDL generally prefers buying to building ("The hotel that you think costs $200 million to build really winds up costing $300 million because of debt service," Mr. Gremlich explained), it is building hotels in Singapore and elsewhere, on land that it already owns.
Nor is it locked into the concept of Millennium-class hotels. Investment bankers say it is looking to establish a chain of low-price hotels in China. Elsewhere, several of its new hotels will be geared toward package tours, because they are in locations that would not attract wealthy tourists or business people. The 21 hotels it owns in New Zealand are tourist-class hotels; the two it is now building there will be Millenniums.
And then, of course, there is the Plaza, which fits into no niche whatsoever. "Every hotel chain has a diamond," Mr. Spinnato said. "Hilton has the Waldorf, Sheraton has the St. Regis, CDL now has the Plaza."
Actually, CDL went halfsies on the Plaza with Prince Alwalid bin Talal bin Abdulaziz Saud of Saudi Arabia, who also owns half of Fairmont.
"CDL is building a relationship as well as sharing risk," said one investment banker, who noted that CDL wants to interest the Prince in other ventures, such as diesel factories in China.
Even though it does not fit the strategic profile, in a sense the Plaza has had a greater impact on CDL's corporate structure than any of its other acquisitions. The company had retained a retired hotelier to check up on the Millenium and the Macklowe, but he balked at adding the Plaza to his routine. Nor was CDL comfortable with so casual an approach to managing a hotel that had cost $325 million.
So last spring CDL formed three management companies, set up along geographic lines. One handles 23 hotels in New Zealand (counting two under construction) and one in Australia; another covers four hotels in Singapore (plus one under construction and one planned), two in Malaysia, and one each in Hong Kong, Manila and Taiwan; and the third is CDL-USA, to handle the three New York properties and the Gloucester, Bailey's and the Chelsea in London.
CDL is establishing a list of minimum standards for CDL hotels that it will soon distribute to its new management companies. Mr. Gremlich says he already has asked the management of some of the hotels to come up with quick-action plans to fix such problems as underperforming food and beverage operations. "If problems are not fixed, we will terminate contracts," he said.
IN fact, CDL, which already manages 28 of its 37 hotels itself, wants eventually to manage all of them, and may even go into the third-party management business. And, it is exploring the feasibility of a central reservations system to handle all its hotels worldwide. "There is a good chance we won't renew the contracts of other management companies," Mr. Gremlich said.
Not all consultants think this is a wise approach. "They don't own enough to get the economies of scale or marketing power that they can get with an established chain like Hilton," Mr. Dougherty said.
Nonetheless, CDL has come a long way in the 50 years since Kwek Hong Png, Kwek Leng Beng's father, emigrated to Singapore from China and, with money earned from various construction jobs, began buying land. He soon brought his three brothers over, and together, the Kweks began building a residential construction and development empire in Singapore and Malaysia.
Their company, Hong Leong Investment Holdings, formed City Developments Limited, which lent money to people who wanted to buy the homes the Kweks built, and which served as buyer of land or buildings that the brothers felt were undervalued.
Inevitably, the definition of undervalued properties encompassed hotels. So, in 1989, the Kweks formed CDL Hotels International. Last year, when Kwek Hong Png died, Kwek Leng Beng, his eldest son, became chairman of all the companies.
Those who know him say that Mr. Kwek will continue to prove a formidable force in the hotel world.
"Kwek may not have Donald Trump's flamboyant personality, but he is a true risk taker," Mr. Hercher said. "Anyone who can buy $1 billion worth of hotels in New York and London in less than two years is in his own way bigger than life."

HEADLINE: The View From: New London;
Where to Find a Dragon Named Bud

BYLINE: By CAROLYN BATTISTA 

 BODY:
WE didn't brush last night or this morning," said David Yoselevsky, who with six other youngsters had forgone dental hygiene for the sake of science.
"We're doing an experiment," said Tom Woudenberg, the fifth to eighth graders' instructor in the program "Be a Microbe Hunter in the Invisible Jungle" at the new Science Center of Eastern Connecticut in New London. After not brushing since the previous morning, each youngster placed drops of saliva on one side of a prepared plate. Then each brushed and put some saliva on the other side of the plate, in order to compare bacterial growth. (Everybody did have a toothbrush.) 
 Meanwhile other experiments were under way. Lane Campbell showed a row of plastic tubes in which different bacteria were growing at different levels. "They're bacteria skyscrapers," Lane said. She and other microbe enthusiasts eagerly lifted the lids from their skyscrapers, offering visitors whiffs of the stinky stuff inside.
On a tour of the building, which went up in the 1970's on land leased from Connecticut College, the youngsters checked out exhibits -- saltwater tank with crabs, a diorama of a marsh, a beehive and a glass tank housing Bud, an Australian water dragon. "He eats cat food and occasionally earthworms, for a treat," noted one fan.
Later they all visited a nearby pond in the Connecticut College Arboretum.
Other programs for youngsters on the new center's summer schedule included "Science Sampler for Girls" and "Whodunit? Be a Detective!" In the latter, youngsters analyzed fingerprints, fibers and more to solve a mock crime. For adults there were evening trips, including one to a shellfish hatchery.
The center opened in June, after dozens of volunteers spent nearly six months -- including some chilly hours -- readying the then-unoccupied building. "We had the heat off; people were freezing," said David Fairman, director of operations, who kept costs down as the new institution got going.
The volunteers tackled painting, vaccuuming landscaping and more. "Every time an arcane question came up, a wizard appeared," said Mr. Fairman, who was worrying about the faded background of the diorama when a volunteer said, "I have a neighbor who paints clouds." Foundations and businesses contributed money, scientific equipment and sets of keys. Someone donated Bud.
In recent years, the area had seemed in danger of losing a long-established institution, not gaining a brand new one. In 1993 the Thames Science Center, the original occupant of the building, moved its main office, and most of its programs, to Newport, R.I. That center had operated in New London for decades, first in a smaller building and then in the 9,000-square-foot structure surrounded by the arboretum. During the 1980's the Thames Science Center grew considerably, largely with Federal grants, and the center's work was widely praised.
But by the 1990's, the grant money dwindled. The local economy faltered, reducing financial support. Jane A. Holdsworth, director of the Thames Science Center, said that the move to Newport, a city with lots of tourist traffic, would save the day. Admission fees in Newport would support not only the center there but also operations in New London, she said.
Some longtime supporters of the center were critical of Ms. Holdworth's management style, including what they called her over-reliance on grants. Many were dismayed by the move to Newport, which was accompanied by shorter hours and fewer programs in New London, along with no phone number except a Rhode Island one.
"Many people who'd supported the center, and that includes in a financial way, felt they were supporting something that would serve the area in which we live," said Marion Bulmer, an East Lyme resident who is vice president of the new center's board.
Ms. Bulmer and Richard Goodwin, a retired Connecticut College botany professor who had helped establish the Thames Science Center (and the Nature Conservancy) were part of a group that increasingly questioned the direction the Thames Center was taking.
In the spring of 1994, the group -- about a dozen people, mostly former trustees -- asked the Connecticut Attorney General, Richard Blumenthal, to rule on the legality of the move to Rhode Island.
"I personally interceded," Mr. Blumenthal said, "because a facility was opened in Newport and the organization was curtailing its operations in New London, in direct contradiction to its charter. It was violating its charter." He threatened to sue the center. The move to Newport, he said, "was so clearly in violation of the law that we were very emphatic about what had to be done. The bulk of the programs and assets had to remain in New London."
Negotiations produced an agreement to split into two organizations. The Thames Science Center took its name, some personal property, programs and computers to Newport, and maintains a satellite in Norwich. The Science Center of Eastern Connecticut took over the building in New London. "We achieved everything that could be achieved through these negotiations," Mr. Blumenthal said. "Our objective was to assure that the assets of a regional science center would be used to accomplish its mission -- providing educational programs and exhibits to the people of eastern Connecticut."
The agreement became official last December. "We're creating a new center for science in this area that we live in and care a lot about," Mrs. Bulmer said. The Science Center of Eastern Connecticut signed a new long-term lease with Connecticut College (at $1 a year), wrote a relationship with the college into its bylaws and set to work fixing up exhibits and building up membership.
The new center intends to make use of its particular resources, including good laboratories. Richard L. Hinman, president of the board, said: "They're true labs, which many museums don't have. We'll build programs around the labs, probably leaning toward the life sciences, including biotechnology."
Connecticut College faculty, staff and students are working with the new center and several programs will involve the arboretum. "We anticipate programs that reflect being in the middle of this 430-acre natural resource," said Glenn D. Dreyer, director of the arboretum and a member of the center's board. Plans include directing center visitors to the arboretum's plant collections and woodland trails.
The center fits into national and local developments, Dr. Hinman said. He mentioned statistics showing that science museums around the country are better attended than major sports events and said that increasingly, those museums aim to provide what he calls "hands-on, minds-on" experiences, as does the new center. It's not enough to have "kids press buttons, then run around to the next thing," he said. "They need to learn something." A senior vice president at Pfizer Central Research in Groton until retiring a few years ago, Dr. Hinman is now a part-time coordinator of Pfizer's work with schools.
Locally, Dr. Hinman noted, the Children's Museum of Southeastern Connecticut opened in Niantic in 1992, the Mystic Marinelife Aquarium is expanding and OceanQuest, a marine science education complex, is planned for New London. "We can develop this area as as a mecca for science education," he said.
The Science Center of Eastern Connecticut (33 Gallows Lane, New London, 442-0391) is open Tuesday through Saturday from 10 A.M. to 4 P.M. The center charges admission to its programs, but until fall will not charge admission to its exhibits. The Connecticut College Arboretum does not charge admission.

HEADLINE: POSTINGS: Harlem River Rail Plan Backed by Court;
Bronx Project Moves Forward

 BODY:
An innovative rail facility-cum-paper mill project is on track again in the South Bronx after an appeals court reversed a lower court ruling that had halted the redevelopment of the Harlem River Rail Yards as a multi-use rail facility and industrial park.
"We will bid out infrastructure costs and contracts this fall," said Anthony M. Riccio Jr., the project director for Hudson River Yards Ventures, part of the Galesi Group, which is leasing the site. "Rail service should commence by the end of this year. Lease negotiations that had been put on hold will now proceed in earnest." 
 The $300 million project is the culmination of years of effort by the New York State Department of Transportation to develop the old 96-acre rail yard near the Third Avenue Bridge as a freight rail facility and distribution center. It will also have a mill to transform New York City waste paper into pulp for recycled paper.
Last year, Judge Jerry Crispino of State Supreme Court in the Bronx stopped the project when he ruled in favor of local groups that objected to the rail yards being used for any industrial or commercial development other than handling truck trailers. His decision was overturned by the Appellate Division this month.
The project is expected to provide more than 800 jobs.
The State Department of Transportation was represented by David Paget of Manhattan. The coalition of neighborhood advocacy groups opposed to the project was represented by John McHugh of Manhattan.

HEADLINE: Who Will Watch the Baby?

BYLINE: By BARBARA STEWART 

 BODY:
AFTER the cooing of friends and family have faded and the baby gifts are unwrapped and put away, new parents must face the challenge they could never quite fathom before the birth: they have to figure out how to take care of the child when they're not home.
Mothers or fathers who don't want to stay home full time, or can't afford to -- the majority in suburban New Jersey -- have the weighty task of finding loving, responsible, intelligent and not-too-costly help. Love may be beyond price, but child care certainly is not. 
 In the old days, perhaps, aunts and grandmothers were always at hand. In Sweden -- in fact, like many countries in Europe -- the government provides day care for children too young for school. And true, New Jersey, along with the Federal Government, provides some money for child care for needy people. But help from the state is rare and scant. For the vast majority, it's up to parents to hunt for, choose and pay for a baby-sitter, a nanny, a small nursery in a home or a bigger center.
This can be a full-time job for weeks or months, as prospective mothers and fathers match high expectations for the health, safety and education of their baby against a child-care marketplace that offers choice, but little in the way of guidance. Basically, parents must rely on instinct. Their instinct tells them they want a day-care center with the warmth of a down comforter, or a babysitter-nanny who is smart, loving, discreet, with the nurturing ways of a teacher, the hygiene of a nurse, the manners of a concierge -- and content with $200 or $400 a week.
"Child care is a mixed bag, a patchwork of relatives and whatever they can put together," said Pat Mennuti, executive director of Community Coordinated Child Care of Union County, a nonprofit center that distributes lists of care givers and centers. "Parents are on their own. It's difficult to find it and difficult to afford it. It always comes up. This nation just does not put a priority on childcare."
Certainly, in the minds of many if not most parents, the ideal day-care centers are their homes and the ideal care givers themselves. Staying home with the children is an option for two kinds of families: those with enough money to skip a second income and those with practically no money and therefore no choice -- in other words, welfare mothers. Others need a day-care center or a care giver at home, who may live with the family.
New Jersey has 4,400 registered family day-care homes, in which five or fewer children are cared for at a private house. The state doesn't require such homes to be registered; it is estimated there are at least three times as many such informal nurseries. There are 15,400 licensed day-care centers, which may range in size from six to hundreds of children. The cost of day-care ranges widely, from $75 a week to $300. In addition, a few corporations have their own, on-site day care programs.
As for the state's statistics on care for the young, that's about it. There are no figures for the vast numbers of homemakers, nannies, au pairs or helpful grandmothers. The employment of care givers for young children is practically as much of an underground economy as the sale of marijuana. And reporting the care giver's salary to the Internal Revenue Service is about as common as donating to the Federal Government to alleviate the national debt.
Hiring somebody to live in one's house to care for one's children may seem the most luxurious choice -- it's definitely the most expensive. Less expensive are au pairs, who are usually Europeans, about 19 or 20 years old, with a year's visa -- young people in search of the cultural experience of living the the United States. An au pair can be paid as little as $100. But -- as a mother from Hamilton Square points out -- au pairs, who are here to see sights and meet people, often prefer big cities to suburbs (though some easily get the hang of commuting by bus or train).
For care giving at home in the suburbs, then, that leaves nannies -- full time babysitters who either live in or live out. A nanny may be somebody with degrees in early childhood education and a philosophy of child care arising from years of experience. Or, a nanny may be simply somebody who wants a job. There are no educational or experience requirements or licensing. One can find a nanny through an agency, through a newspaper ad, or -- most commonly -- through word of mouth from parents or other nannies, particularly those from outside the country with friends and relatives eager to live in the United States.
"Nannies," said the mother of a 9-month old, "know nannies. There's a nanny network."
This mother's first name is Cheryl but, because her nanny is an illegal immigrant, does not want to reveal her full name. In this, she is typical. The percentage of undocumented nannies is "huge," said Claire Grimes, publisher of the Irish Echo, the the newspaper acknowledged to be the leader in classified ads for child-care jobs. The highest number of nannies are from the Carribbean, Ireland and Poland, according to Ms. Grimes and a number of parents.
"Quite frankly I would never use a nanny from America," said Cheryl. "I use people from the islands." Americans who are nannies, she said, "haven't figured out what they what to be." Nannies from the Carribbean "have more patience. They're more laid back. There's great emphasis there on family and mothering." Besides, she said, finding a nanny through word of mouth can save the $1,500 or so a placement agency charges.
"Eighty percent of all nannies in this country are illegals or au pairs," said Bob Mark, president of a placement agency called America's Nannies in Paramus. "They are stealing a lot of jobs from American women and some men. People claim there aren't enough good-quality Americans. I see plenty of good solid Americans who want these jobs. This illegal thing is a major problem."
Kathy Lawler, a Morristown lawyer married to a lawyer, is looking for a legal nanny. Because of the trouble it could cause at the couple's workplaces, she said she has not and would not hire an illegal immigrant. Nor would she hire a legal immigrant without a green card, or legal working papers. These strictures greatly narrow the range of affectionate, competent, not-too-expensive nannies, she said. "Slim pickings" as she put its. Of 14 people advertising for child-care help recently in the Irish Echo, Ms. Lawler was one of two requiring green cards. Nine of the others say they don't ask and don't want to know.
Nancy and Darryl Horvath briefly hired a Polish woman to care for their triplets, who are almost a year old. They were not pleased. "She had broken English," said Ms. Horvath. "Darryl would be going, 'What'd she say?' "
The Horvaths' current nanny is Dixie Kahl, 28, an ebullient woman from a family from "where everyone worked" in Storm Lake, Iowa. Mrs. Horvath is a secretary who quickly dropped the idea of caring for three babies alone. Mr. Horvath designs kitchens. Their income, while substantial, is lower than that of many who employ a live-in nanny. But the cost of day care for three babies could be as high as $35,000 a year.
Like nearly all nannies, Ms. Kahl had her pick of employers, chosing the Horvaths from among five offers. Like nearly all live-in nannies in the suburbs, she has her own bedroom, phone, television and use of a car. Many suburban nannies have suites, and frequently parents pay for college courses, especially in childhood education.
Ms. Kahl has two days off a week. Although the work time, at least 10 hours a day, may tend to slide into the personal time, she says she likes the babies, the parents and the job.
Still, as a stand-in mother, the work is endless, the three babies wildly demanding, and an eight-hour day unheard-of. Often nannies, rather than parents, are the ones who get up nights to soothe screaming babies or frightened toddlers. Some nannies who go on family vacations find themselves caring for the children all day and returning to a parent's complaint: Time off? You just had a vacation! There are tales of nannies -- or more commonly, the younger, presumably more naive, lower-paid au pairs -- being exploited, working far too many hours without time off, expected to do heavy housework.
But many parents parents insist they are far more solicitous of their nannies' happiness than their own employers are of theirs. The reason is simple: the parents, in their jobs and at their salaries, are almost certainly more easily replaced.
"It used to be that a happy mommy was a happy family," said Ann-Marie Moakler, a Macy's buyer. "Now it's a happy nanny is a happy family. The key to child care is keeping the nanny happy."
And the keys to keeping the nanny happy seem to be a combination of wealth, good will, consideration, appreciation and financial planning. Mary Alice Williams, the television producer and NYNEX spokeswoman, said of her nanny, Alaina, her third in six years, "We didn't want someone to just take care of the children. We wanted somebody to love them." Having a nanny she continued, "is a little like getting married. You have to love them."
Alaina -- as private, said Ms. Williams, as she herself is public and who therefore wanted to go by middle name -- certainly has no bereft Jane Eyre story. She accepted the offer of Ms. Williams and her husband, Mark, who makes rock music videos, from 32 others. She's paid $500 a week, gets health insurance, a pension plan, a car. When she has time to take college courses towards her graphics arts degree, the Williamses pay.
In return, Ms. Williams said she watches with satisfaction the art projects and affection Alaina elicits from her two daughters, ages 2 and 5. The price, well beyond that of most families, is well worth it, she said.
"Having children is not a private hobby," she said. "Care givers should be well-paid and well-valued. It's in the nation's interest to have children raised with love and courtesy and a love of learning."
Well, yes. It's well-known that corporations are, slowly, acknowledging the existence and needs of their employees' children, with flexible hours, extended maternity leaves and so on. Johnson & Johnson and AT&T, among others in New Jersey, offer on-site daycare.
Parents rely on their instincts and the advice of other parents to judge the right person to care for their children. The most non-profit groups and government agencies do is give out advice and lists of au pair, babysitting and nanny-placement agencies. "It's a very labor-intensive job to find child care," said Ms. Mennuti, of Community Coordinated Child Care of Union County. The parents' judgment and money, along with the children, live with the result.
"You get an idea of what they're like and their ideals," said Ms. Moakler, whose children are 2 and 5. "You know if the kids want to kiss the nanny goodnight and if they cry hysterically when you leave. You ask your neighbors. Even the best nannies you're paranoid about. But if they keep passing the tests . . ."
Another mother of triplets, who runs a small business, said she got 60 calls to a single Irish Echo ad, 40 of whom had false references or claims of experience, a handful of whom she interviewed, one of whom she picked. "She's lovely and I hope it works out," she said of the new nanny, a Jamaican with no green card. "She handled the babies best. She was gentle, calm, soothing. But I'm nervous. I'm going on instincts. We'll see."
Which, it's uniformly agreed, is frightening and should not be the way of a civilized culture. News stories of nanny disasters and tales of the murderous nanny are passed around. Nobody knows her personally, but they heard from someone who heard from someone, like tales of the hook-handed killer teen-agers frighten themselves with.
"The parents' role is absolutely the last word," said Winne Comfort, spokeswoman for the state Division of Youth and Family Services. "I always tell parents, there is no government agent who can decide if this person can care for your children for you. It's very much a personal choice and very much up to the parents."
Arlene Restaino-Kelly said her three children -- ages 16, 12 and 8 -- had 6 nannies and au pairs in 10 years. "It was very hard," she said. "But it was good for my family, the different personalities." Ms. Restaino-Kelly, a single parent who is director of childhood student center at Kean College, said the coming and going was mitigated by the frequent presence of lots of relatives.
Child care for suburban working parents in New Jersey, she said, is "inconsistent, piecemeal, hard to put together" unregulated, with a quality that varies immensely, depending largely on wages, with parents patching together the best they can afford. "After all, if we all had our druthers, wouldn't we want to stay home with our children?" she said. "Isn't that what we want, enough money to stay home? But we have to work and we should have the right to have child-care options."

Michael Lind's critique of my book "The Freedom Revolution" (July 23) would be more compelling if he had done a little research. While I can understand why a liberal might not enjoy my work, he should have kept his objections within the realm of ideology rather than challenging the accuracy of my data. 
 Mr. Lind dedicates more than two paragraphs to my data on upward and downward income mobility, charging, "Mr. Armey, a former professor of economics, has bungled his math." Had Mr. Lind bothered to call me about the validity of the conclusions, he would have learned that they were based on extensive Treasury Department analysis of tax return data.
What the Treasury study reveals is that a person who was in the bottom fifth (quintile) of earners in 1979 was more likely to end up in the top fifth in 1988 than to have remained in the bottom. When you think about it in real-life terms, this is not so remarkable. A recently graduated 23-year-old might find herself earning $15,000 in 1979, and later, as an executive with 10 years of work experience, earning $75,000 in 1988.
Interestingly, another study of income mobility, by the liberal-leaning Urban Institute, confirms that there was remarkable upward mobility during the 1980's. The notion that "the poor were literally getting poorer over the last decade or two, and that the incomes of the rich were skyrocketing," the Urban Institute said, "is simply not true."
Since the data do not conform to Mr. Lind's belief that America is a caste society where people are born either rich or poor and remain that way through their lifetimes, he dismisses them as "tortured."
I'm not surprised that The New York Times would have a liberal review a conservative's book. I am surprised, however, that your newspaper would allow him to review it in such a sloppy manner.
 
(Representative) DICK ARMEY
Washington
 
Michael Lind replies:
The above is the second of two letters that Dick Armey sent to The New York Times, attacking me for being "sloppy" in my criticism of his misleading statements about social mobility. In the first, dated July 27, Mr. Armey attributed his data on social mobility to "a time-series study conducted by Isabel Sawhill, a noted liberal economist at the left-leaning Urban Institute." In the second letter, sent on Aug. 2, he attributes the very same numbers to a study by George Bush's Treasury Department; the Sawhill study, in the second letter, is identified only as an unnamed "study of income mobility by the liberal-leaning Urban Institute." The two letters are otherwise virtually identical. Rather sloppy, I'd say.
Perhaps Mr. Armey's confusion about his own sources arose from the absence of any citations for the alleged facts in his book. Without the scholarly apparatus that even books for a popular audience ordinarily possess, Mr. Armey is quite right that a skeptical reader could not have identified his sources without phoning the author. If I had phoned Mr. Armey before Aug. 2, however, he would have cited the wrong study as support for his claims.
At any rate, the Treasury data that Mr. Armey now cites do not support his argument that America is not a "society where people are born either rich or poor and remain that way through their lifetimes." On the contrary, the June 1, 1992, Treasury study he refers to sheds no light whatsoever on the question of income mobility between generations. That study tracks individuals who paid taxes in all 10 years from 1979 to 1989, without identifying their social origins; because only about half of all households paid taxes in each of those 10 years, the sample is skewed toward the affluent. Even more important, the Treasury study is useless as evidence of social mobility because, absurdly, it treats the movement of high school, college and graduate school students into the work force as movement out of "poverty" (the median age of the lowest quintile in the study is 22). What the Treasury study shows, at most, is the obvious fact that middle-class Americans tend to make substantially more in their 30's than when they first graduate from college or high school. What, however, does this tell us about the likelihood that any American will rise above the class of his or her parents -- poor, middle class, or rich? Absolutely nothing.
Nor does the 1992 Urban Institute study that Mr. Armey vaguely alludes to in his second letter tell us anything about social mobility between generations. Conservatives like to cite this study because it purports to show that between 1977 and 1986, families in the bottom quintile experienced a rise in income of 77 percent, while families in the top quintile experienced a mere 5 percent increase. This does not, however, prove that Ronald Reagan (or rather Jimmy Carter and Mr. Reagan) did more for the poor than for the rich. Give $7,700 to someone making $10,000 a year and his income will increase by a whopping 77 percent to a still low $17,700. Give exactly the same amount -- $7,700 -- to someone making $154,000 a year, and his income will increase by a mere 5 percent to $161,700. In this scenario, the disproportionate benefit to the poor individual is merely a function of the depth of his initial poverty.
As it happens, there are studies that, unlike the Treasury and Urban Institute studies, do examine Mr. Armey's subject -- intergenerational social mobility in the United States. Gary Solon, a University of Michigan economist, has calculated that when relatively optimistic assumptions are made, a child whose father is in the bottom 5 percent of income is roughly eight times more likely to remain poor or near poor than to rise into the top quintile; one whose father is at the 15th percentile is about four times more likely to remain in the bottom quintile than to rise to the top. Mr. Armey to the contrary, Americans who are born poor tend to spend all their lives near the bottom of the income ladder, just as most middle-class and rich Americans end their lives in the same broad income class into which they were born. The data confirm what common sense suggests and Mr. Armey denies: rags-to-rags and riches-to-riches are much more typical than rags-to-riches or riches-to-rags. What is more, another University of Michigan economist, Joel Slemrod, has found that generational mobility was no greater in the 1980's than in the 1960's.
Mr. Armey has tried to pass off the familiar phenomenon of rising earnings with age after the "poverty" of college or high school as proof of an extraordinary degree of social mobility between generations (which, in reality, remains rather low). In my review, I remarked on the extraordinary intellectual dishonesty manifested throughout "The Freedom Revolution." If only I had known.

HEALTH CARE
Who Can Heal New York?
Here's the question: Is there a place in the brave new world of managed health care for municipal hospitals like New York's? Can they possibly survive? The answer, from a mayoral advisory panel, was a resounding no. The panel, saying the hospitals delivered inefficient, low-quality care, called last week for abolition of the whole system. The obvious question, from a 43-year-old Bellevue patient with AIDS, was this: "Where will the poor people go for medical care?" The mayor's panel, though, insisted that the poor will get better care at revamped hospitals or at private medical centers.
 
LAWSUITS
Promises, Costly Promises
It happens all the time: some big company, on the prowl for bargain labor, closes one plant and opens another elsewhere. As long as it goes by the book and gives 60 days' notice, the company's nose is clean. Or so Maytag thought when, in 1991, it shut a vending-machine plant in West Virginia and opened one in South Carolina. Workers say Maytag assured them this would never happen, and the workers -- first one, then a class-action parade -- decided this was a legal promise and sued. And last week Maytag settled the case by agreeing to pay $16.5 million -- it was "risk avoidance," mind you; the company remained pure as a new-laundered sheet. Lawyers, bless their billable souls, will devour $5 million of that, but that still leaves a tidy sum for 800 workers.
 
ENTERTAINMENT
Rocking Hollywood's Boat
Think of Hollywood as a huge rowboat, managing a delicate balance even under its heavy load of ego and money -- mighty agents on one side, mighty studios on the other. Then, without warning, a giant among giants leaps from one side to the other, sending everyone else scampering for equilibrium. That's basically what happened last week when Michael Ovitz, agent to the gods and just about everyone else, decided that, well, working for a studio might not be that bad. MCA hadn't worked out, so the buzz (sorry, but Hollywoodspeak is de rigueur) was that nothing would shake him from Creative Artists. But then Disney came calling -- its new jewel, ABC, in hand -- and Mr. Ovitz couldn't resist, even though he'll play second fiddle to Michael Eisner, Disney's chairman. You can bet he'll be a loud second fiddle.
 
GUIDING NATURE
Writing E-Mail in the Sand
Beaches are big business -- people go to unholy lengths to sit on them and fry, and pay unholy prices for shelter and hot dogs nearby. But only God can make a beach -- well, God and the Army Corps of Engineers. The big difference: when engineers do it, it costs hundreds of millions of dollars. And when God then washes away man's sand, there's hell to pay -- and more sand to cart in. Take, say, New Jersey. Man built beaches recently at vast expense -- Federal money that miraculously flowed freely -- but (of all the nerve!) water barged in and took much of it away. And so the debate heats up, with some insisting that, yes, man can shape the earth, but other heretical souls (they probably don't even like running barefoot on the sand) talking about pouring tax dollars into the ocean.
 
REGULATION
A Tobacco-Country Judge
The battle is joined. The F.D.A. wants to regulate the sale and promotion of cigarettes -- because it wants fewer teen-agers to start smoking. The tobacco industry doesn't like that idea, possibly because if people don't get the habit young, they usually don't get it. So the industry sued, and by all signs got just the arbiter it would want last week -- a North Carolina judge who had ruled pro-tobacco in a suit involving the E.P.A. and had, as a lawyer, defended an R.J. Reynolds heir. Why North Carolina? It's "the only jurisdiction that makes any sense," Reynolds said. But the head of an anti-smoking group said, "Among Southern lawyers, it's called home cooking, helping out the friends and neighbors."
 
ROCKEFELLER CENTER
What Price Location Now?
What next? Just when you thought you'd figured out who owns Rockefeller Center -- no simple matter, in case you've missed it all; the overlapping trusts and groups and holding companies create a dazzling financial maze -- here come two more investors battling for a piece of it. First was Sam Zell of Chicago, who, like others drawn to the fabled towers, is all gaga about "location, location, location," a rule he learned "when my daddy put me on his knee." (Well, at least his daddy didn't say, "Plastics.") And the very next day this bankruptcy-smudged landmark got a rival offer, from Tishman Speyer Properties of New York. Don't even ask what the ownership chart might look like now; the family tree of British royalty is a sapling in comparison.
 
THE FED
A Rate Cut? Probably Not
Oh, yes -- interest rates. Is the Federal Reserve going to give borrowers another break, as it did a month or so ago, when it cut rates slightly after that endless string of increases? The Fed gathers on Tuesday, but people who think they know such things expect no more rate cuts just yet. True, official rates still hover farther than usual above inflation -- which the Fed is slapping itself gleefully on the back for taming. But Fed officials seem to think things are going just fine, with a sharp rise in housing starts last week just the latest bit of strength. Or perhaps it's just too hot for them to think about anything so strenuous as tinkering with those all-powerful rates. Maybe in September.
 
EQUALITY
Women of Value
Life is unfair: Any 12-year-old denied extra dessert or a new computer will tell you that. But for the world's women, life is truly unfair -- as a United Nations report out last week made vividly and statistically clear. Among the findings: 70 percent of the world's poor are women, and women hold just 14 percent of top managerial jobs. Not that women don't do their fair share of the world's work -- far from it. One of the study's more intriguing findings is the extreme economic undervaluation of women's work. They pull their weight; they just don't get paid for it.
 
WORK FORCE
Employees, by Another Name
No one wants employees anymore. Employees want pesky things like health benefits. (Health benefits?) They want companies to be loyal to them. (A quaint idea.) You have to pay payroll taxes so they can get stuff like Social Security. It's all such a nuisance! More and more, companies prefer "independent contractors" -- not too independent, mind you -- and the ranks of such semi-employees have soared with all the layoffs lately. But there are rules about who can be called a contractor -- rules, no doubt, often stretched to, and past, the limit -- and last week Texas A&M University admitted that it had illegally paid 400 farm workers as contractors, cheating the Government out of $86,000 in payroll taxes. The Republicans, meanwhile, have a solution: they're pushing a bill that would liberalize the use of contractors.

HEADLINE: INVESTING IT;
Knowing When to Say 'Sell'

BYLINE: By REED ABELSON 

 BODY:
THERE are theories galore about the best time to buy a stock -- when earnings are growing rapidly or the stock is trading below book value, even one that relates to which team wins the Super Bowl. And you can't pick up a personal-finance magazine these days without being bombarded with the 10 -- or 15, or 20 -- mutual funds that are absolutely, positively hot, right now!
But wait a second. When it comes to selling -- which goes hand in hand with buying -- there is almost total silence. For all sorts of reasons, investors don't like to think about selling, and many on Wall Street are more than happy to oblige by ignoring it, too. Often, the best the financial pundits have to offer is vague and contradictory conventional wisdom: Don't sell winning investments, but be sure to take profits. 
 Sometimes, though, you must sell -- for tuition, a house, a wedding, retirement. And this year's rip-snorting bull market has nearly everyone wondering if now is the time to cash in at least some investments, before it's too late.
All too often, though, the silence that surrounds selling makes the act haphazard at best. A stock drops, investors panic and sell when they should hold. Investors get attached to particular stocks -- or want to avoid capital-gains taxes -- and hold when they should sell.
But panic selling and blind devotion can be hazardous to net worth. Whether buying or selling, put emotion aside, get a plan and stick with it, the experts say. While there's no guarantee that you still won't make a mistake, your odds of getting out at the right time are a lot better.
Which is why plenty of astute professionals pay a great deal of attention to selling. Most pros try to follow general rules, and they tend to agree that if you wouldn't buy a stock at its current price, it's probably time to unload it. Some sell when a stock rises a certain percentage. Others pick a target value and sell when the stock nears that level.
Take Robert Sanborn, manager of the Oakmark Fund, among the top mutual funds recently. Mr. Sanborn sells a stock as soon as it hits 90 percent of the value he places on it, an estimate that he continually updates based on his appraisal of the company's underlying business.
Other successful investors, whatever their specific strategies, share a faith in rules that govern sell decisions.
"The sell discipline is probably more important than the buy discipline," agreed Paul Greenwood, a senior research analyst at the Frank Russell Company, the Tacoma, Wash., pension fund consultants who follow more than 1,700 portfolio managers. "If there's a common thread among the best managers, it's a strong sell discipline."
 
Panic Selling
 But such discipline is in short supply, and the psychological forces surrounding selling are strong. People are reluctant to engage in the kind of soul searching that goes on when buying, and it's not hard to see why. When people buy a stock or mutual fund, they are usually full of optimism -- about a company's prospects or a manager's stock-picking abilities.
When it comes time to sell, the opposite is true. "There's a whole attitude of defeat associated with selling," noted Eugene Lerner, a former finance professor who now runs Disciplined Investment Advisors, an Evanston, Ill., money management firm. "It's an act of rejection."
Because people tend to identify themselves so closely with their investments, they become unable to sell under any circumstance. "People use the market to validate their self-esteem," Mr. Geist explained. If a stock or mutual fund goes up, they're so busy patting themselves on the back for being smart that they miss signs of trouble. If the investment goes down, they don't want to admit to having made a mistake.
Many individual investors, and even some pros, sell only in a panic. They are whipsawed by the market, selling only when their stocks or funds are down. During last year's bond market debacle, bond fund investors rushed for the exits just as prices were touching bottom, according to a study by the David L. Babson Company, the Cambridge, Mass., investment management firm. By the time these investors thought it was safe to venture back, prices had already rebounded. "This was a classic mistake of buying high and selling low," noted H. Bradlee Perry, Babson's former chairman, who now serves as a consultant to the company.
The same was true during the long and gruesome bear stock market of 1973 and 1974, said Robert Bacarella, manager of the Monetta Fund. When he studied which money managers best survived that grizzly downturn, he discovered that those with strict selling rules avoided bailing out at the market's low.
Some people sell as soon as they are faced with a loss, even if their stock or fund would probably have recovered. "They're feeling terrible about themselves so they get out as soon as the stock drops," explained Richard Geist, a Waban, Mass., psychologist who studies the psychology of investing. Mr. Geist said one patient panicked whenever his stocks fell because those losses stirred up childhood feelings of deprivation. "He would just sell immediately and feel much better," Mr. Geist said.
Investors who sell because they are disappointed with short-term results are often acting impulsively. Ken Gregory, editor of the No-Load Fund Analyst newsletter in Orinda, Calif., said that can happen with decisions about fund investments. "Every manager has a bad year," he said. "If a fund manager has an off year, there's an assumption the manager has lost it."
For example, Mr. Gregory said, investors would have been mistaken if they had grown impatient with Michael Price's Mutual Beacon or Mutual Qualified funds after three dismal years. If they had sold during those years, when the stocks Mr. Price likes to buy were out of favor, they would have missed the fund's spectacular 20-percent-plus gains in 1992 and 1993.
 
Blind Devotion
 Other investors hold on even when there are good reasons to unload. People who inherit a stock or fund may find it difficult to sell because the investment represents a tie to a loved one.
Lewis Altfest, a financial planner in Manhattan, recalls a widow who came into his office three years after her husband died, refusing to sell any stocks he had chosen. Kathleen Delany, who lives in Rockford, Ill., has held onto the Ford stock her father, an investment banker, gave her for more than 40 years -- "out of respect for my father's expertise and honesty and basic economic philosophy," she said.
One solution, said Frederick Raffety, a financial planner at Robert Lawrenz Consulting Services in Rockford, may be to donate at least some of the investment to charity. "The concept that it's doing good and is something that the parent would approve makes it palatable," he said.
People also refuse to sell because they become too enamored of an investment. "I don't think there's anybody alive who hasn't been so in love with an individual stock who wasn't blind to terrible problems at the company," said Kenneth Jessen, an engineer in Loveland, Colo.
Richard Strong, who heads his own mutual fund company in Milwaukee, recalled hanging on to shares of Home Shopping Network, despite nagging doubts about the quality of the company's management. "I kept waiting for management to evolve," he said. When he finally did sell the stock, it was trading at roughly half its high.
Anytime you forget why you bought a stock, you're likely to regret it. Phillip Moery, an economics professor in Gainesville, Ga., learned that lesson after buying Checkers Drive-In Restaurants stock in early 1994 at around $12 after hearing a rumor that the company would be acquired. "The takeover didn't occur," he said. "I should have gotten out at that point, but I didn't." The stock fell to $2.25.
Greed will almost always get investors in trouble. "If the only reason not to sell is that the market is going to the moon, it may be time to rotate into other industries," Mr. Altfest said.
And then there are taxes -- which no investors like to pay. "One of the most common mistakes is to worry too much about the tax impact," Mr. Raffety said. "When faced with a large capital gain, they become paralyzed and hold onto it."
But by refusing to sell, they end up with a stock that is well past its prime. "We've had a lot of people delay, waiting" for capital-gains taxes to fall, said Joseph Toce Jr., a partner at Arthur Andersen in New York. "Instead, their capital gains went away."
 
Rules for Selling
 Knowing how easily emotions can lead to bad decisions, many managers, like Mr. Sanborn, construct rules about when to get out. These rules, which usually vary with a manager's investment style, focus on factors surrounding the price movement of a stock, its market value or company fundamentals. Monetta's Mr. Bacarella, for example, takes the gain if a stock moves up 30 percent, even when he thinks it will keep rising. He then waits a month to re-evaluate the stock.
"It's very healthy for the fund," he said, noting that he may buy a stock two or three times if it keeps going up. "You don't fall asleep here."
Mr. Bacarella employs the same strategy to limit his losses. Because stocks tend to move in groups, he will first compare a losing equity with other stocks in the industry. If they're all down, he doesn't sell. But if any stock drops 30 percent or more, he sells without question. "I always take the stance that I'm the last person to know" if there's something wrong, he said.
Eugene Lerner of Disciplined Investment Advisors focuses on company fundamentals because he believes the market isn't precise in determining a stock's value. Since he buys only stocks whose earnings are increasing, he sells whenever earnings have declined over the previous 12 months by 5 percent or more. He reasons that a company will do nearly anything to report earnings growth -- whether it's selling an asset or manipulating its accounting -- so falling profits are a sure sign that a company's in trouble.
By following these rules, managers are less likely to let greed or fear dictate their decisions. Mr. Sanborn says he has never regretted selling too soon. If a company announces it is going to be taken over, he doesn't wait around for a higher bid. He has seen too many takeovers fail at the last minute, leaving investors who wanted to eke out that last bit of profit with much less of a profit. Mr. Bacarella is using his 30 percent rule to sell some technology holdings, making his portfolio less vulnerable to a downturn there.
Although most managers use some variation of those rules, investors can employ a variety of selling techniques. Some determine a target price based on a stock's price-to-earnings multiple as compared with its earnings growth rate. Others sell when Wall Street lowers its estimates about how much the company will make in the coming year.
Investors can also sell based on an asset-allocation strategy. Portfolio managers, for example, will limit the percentage any one stock or industry group can constitute of their holdings. Because the market has had such a good run, investors may find that equity holdings are now too large a part of their portfolio.
What's also important to remember is that investors don't have to make all-or-nothing decisions. Mr. Strong manages to have his cake and sell it too by taking profits on only some of his shares in a particular stock and giving the rest a chance to keep rising.
As for a mutual fund, investors should track performance against other funds that buy similar stocks. "What investors don't sell or take a long time to sell are funds that are consistently below average by a little," said John Rekenthaler, editor of the Morningstar Investor newsletter, published by the Chicago mutual fund research firm. "There's no reason to settle for average if there are 7,000 funds." He also recommends that investors watch closely for any changes in a fund's investment style, portfolio manager and expenses.
What makes the sell decision so hard is the dearth of advice. Wall Street analysts resort to euphemisms like "hold" or "market performer" rather than just telling investors to sell a stock. Financial magazines and newspapers rarely publish articles on the topic.
The few sell strategies that are discussed are hardly proven successes, and managers don't rely on any one technique. "None of them individually seem to be valid enough to hang a hat on," said John Markese, president of the American Association of Individual Investors in Chicago. But that doesn't mean investors shouldn't constantly reassess whether their investments are sound. "What I tell people simply is if you would not buy a stock today, it's a sell candidate," Mr. Markese said.
Having nearly any sell strategy in place can save investors lots of grief. "People assume once you buy a stock that you don't have to do anything more," Mr. Geist said. But that's one of the worst assumptions you can make.
Take the case of Anne Carey, who teaches political science at a college in Birmingham, Ala. "I don't do a lot of selling," she said. Without a firm idea of when to cash out of international bond funds she bought a few years ago, she was slow to act. By the time she got around to selling, all the funds had gone down significantly in value. "I think I wasn't watching them," she said. "I wasn't paying enough attention."

GRAPHIC: Photos: The Art of the Sell: Three Strategies -- VALUE: Some investors try to uncover bargains in the market by comparing a stock's price to its underlying value. A natural strategy for these "value" investors is to cash out when a stock's price approaches its assessed worth. Robert Sanborn, above, manager of the Oakmark Fund, sells a stock as soon as it reaches 90 percent of its value, which he calculates by studying the underlying business. Other measures, such as a specific price-to-earnings multiple, can be used to decide if a stock is fully valued. PRICE: Some investors rely on the price movement of a stock to determine whether to sell. Robert Bacarella, right, the manager of the Monetta Fund, sells a stock after it rises 30 percent, and before he buys the same stock again, he waits at least 30 days. Mr. Bacarella uses the same strategy to limit his losses. If a stock drops 30 percent, he automatically unloads it. FUNDAMENTALS: Some investors study company fundamentals, like profitability, and for them a suitable sell strategy is to monitor those fundamentals for signs of trouble. Eugene Lerner, president of Disciplined Investment Advisors, sells whenever a company reports that its earnings have decreased by 5 percent or more over the last 12 months. Other investors who focus on fundamentals will sell if a company's sales growth is slowing. (Steve Kagan for The New York Times)(pg. 4)

HEADLINE: MARKET WATCH;
Will Japan's Surplus Disappear?

BYLINE: By FLOYD NORRIS 

 BODY:
The Japanese trade surplus has been one of the wonders of the modern world. Now it may be coming to an end.
The persistent surplus has been supported by two pillars, both now crumbling. On the export side, there was the determination of Japanese manufacturers to keep production in the home country. If it was moved, what would be done with all those workers who were supposed to get lifetime employment? And on the import side, there were all those informal barriers that American companies like to complain about. 
 Last week brought the news that Japan's imports are still soaring. Through July, expressed in dollar terms, they are up more than 25 percent. And this is happening when the Japanese economy is stumbling along, a period when one might expect import demand to stagnate.
What's going on? Import barriers are starting to fall, and more and more foreign goods are getting into the country, and finding eager buyers. The leading beneficiaries of this are other Asian countries, who are busy selling consumer goods to Japan. Those Asian countries are, in turn, importing capital equipment from Japan, a trend that is -- temporarily -- holding up Japanese export figures. Ed Guay, Cigna's chief economist, tells of seeing a Japanese consumer electronics plant taken apart, with each piece labeled so that it could be sent overseas and reassembled.
The overvalued yen, which is finally in retreat, is behind much of this. And the decisions by manufacturers are not going to be reversed, even if the dollar keeps rising. Bob Barbera, the chief economist at Capital Investments International, hauls out "hysteresis," a word from physics, to explain what is likely to happen. That word refers to the perseverance of an effect even after its cause is removed. The high yen has sufficiently scared Japan Inc., he says, forecasting that with all the changes, Japan's trade surplus will be gone by late next year.
That is, it should be noted, not the conventional wisdom, which holds that Japan will run trade surpluses forever. For the surpluses to end, it will be necessary for import barriers to continue to erode, something that is far from certain.
The experience of Japan -- in the wake of allowing the yen to soar so far -- may be reminiscent of what happened here a decade ago. Then, a ridiculously overvalued buck drove out of business -- or out of the country -- some companies that might have held on otherwise.
After the Japanese surpluses vanish, Japan will be revealed as another high-cost area, able to compete with brains and innovation, not the brawn of hourly labor that can be hired more cheaply somewhere else.
Unfortunately, Japan's decline as an export machine will not solve this country's problems. The American trade deficit is growing with the Mexicos and Chinas of the world. Some of that can be traced to Mexico's current economic woes, but a lot of it reflects the fact that it is impossible for a high-wage economy to compete with a low-wage one in a product that both can make with similar quality. It is that reality that has put a damper on wages in recent years, and that trend is likely to endure.
Don't be surprised if the next round of world trade talks has Japan, Europe and the United States as allies on most issues, opposing the developing countries, most of which will be pursuing export-oriented strategies. If so, this year's car wars with Japan will seem like a quaint memory.

Meatloaf and the 50's Style In New Village Eating Place
E. J.'s Luncheonettes have proved to be popular gathering spots for young singles on the Upper East Side and Upper West Side. Now, the owners hope that a new outlet in the West Village, at 432 Avenue of the Americas, between Ninth and 10th Streets, will become a mecca for neighborhood residents. 
 "We found another strong residential community to open our neighborhood restaurant," said Howard Eisenberg, one of five partners who own the 50's-style diners, and the manager of the newest one, which opened on July 27.
E. J.'s serves large portions of diner food (an array of breakfast items as well as home-style meatloaf, skinless fried chicken, roast turkey platters, grilled fresh fish and salads) at prices ranging from $3 for two eggs, toast and home fries to $14 for New York strip steak.
 
Low-Interest Loans for Owners Of Historic Homes in Queens
The New York Landmarks Conservancy has $1.5 million in low-interest loans available for owners of historic residences in Queens.
"It's a five-borough program that has been going on for at least six years," said Joshua Schaff, a conservancy spokesman, "but residents in Queens have not been taking advantage."
The borough's historic districts are Ridgewood, Hunters Point, Jackson Heights, Richmond Hill, Steinway, Old Astoria and Kew Gardens. The loans, which carry interest rates that start at 3 percent, can be used for exterior restoration and repairs.
There are no income limits for applicants, Mr. Schaff said, although it is hoped that the bulk of the money will be lent to low-income and middle-income residents of the historic districts.
 
Cluster of Italian Restaurants Growing on West 44th Street
An Italian restaurant, L'Allegria, opened recently on the northwest corner of 44th Street and Ninth Avenue, in what is becoming a small outpost of Italian cuisine.
L'Allegria, in 2,500 square feet of space, serves fare like a salad of arugula, radicchio and endive ($4) and lombata di vitello alla griglia (grilled veal chop, $14.50). The pastas (all $7.50) range from fettuccine with sausage, artichokes and tomatoes to linguini alla vongole (with tiny clams).
Nicola Coladonato, the owner and chef, sold his other restaurant, Mangia e Bevi, at 53d Street and Ninth Avenue, three months ago.
Opposite L'Allegria on West 44th Street, 44 Southwest also serves moderately priced Italian cuisine. This establishment has been on the southwest corner of 44th and Ninth for four years; five weeks ago, it put up a large maroon awning that says, "44 Southwest Italian Continental."
Just a few yards east across Ninth Avenue, a brick-oven pizzeria, Don Giovanni, is scheduled to open in about three weeks, at 358 West 44th Street.

HEADLINE: NEIGHBORHOOD REPORT: HARLEM;
The Pathmark Wars, Part Three

BYLINE: By JENNIFER KINGSON BLOOM 

 BODY:
Starting last year, the battleground was 125th Street: local retailers fought tooth and nail -- without success -- to stop Pathmark from building a superstore. Then the scene shifted to Springfield Gardens, Queens: last week the City Council approved a plan for a Pathmark store, but angry local store owners have not given up their fight.
Now Pathmark has returned to Harlem with a proposal to build a store on 145th Street between Bradhurst and Eighth Avenues -- and local supermarket owners are up in arms. They have hired the same consultant who led the struggle against the 125th Street market, and they are trying to persuade city officials that one of their number should be allowed to put up a market on the site, not Pathmark. 
 A Pathmark spokesman, Stan Sorkin, said the company is "in the initial stages of trying to get the site approved." Most of the land, a rubbly lot with four long-condemned brick buildings in one corner, is owned by the city. Asked why his company wants a second store in Harlem, Mr. Sorkin said: "We are interested in sites in New York City that meet the criteria of population, disposable income and size of property."
A spokeswoman for the Department of Housing Preservation and Development said that Pathmark officials had met with the agency. And members of Community Board 10 said they will debate Pathmark's request for a zoning change next month. The board has questioned Pathmark on such topics as traffic and parking. "Because of what happened with 125th Street, it's going to draw a lot of attention," said Barbara Askins, chairwoman of the board.
Richard Lipsky, the consultant who organized supermarket owners against the East Harlem Pathmark proposal, said: "Now that we have been told in no uncertain terms that Pathmark is going into 125th Street, we think it would be fair for one of the independent stores to go in there, like a C-town or a Bravo."
Councilwoman C. Virginia Fields, who represents north Harlem and has met with Mr. Lipsky, said she hoped to avoid another long battle over a Pathmark by including the business community and local developers in the early planning stages. "We are going to work this one out," Ms. Fields said. (For a roll call of the City Council's Pathmark vote in Queens, see page 7.)
One of the attractions of the 145th Street site for a supermarket developer is the Bradhurst project, under which the city is renovating 2,200 abandoned apartments in the neighborhood for low- and moderate-income residents. The 145th site itself is among the locations scheduled to be redeveloped under another urban renewal plan.
On 145th Street, some residents were enthusiastic about the idea of a new Pathmark. "That's good for the neighborhood," said Sallh Mohammed, who owns a small convenience store across the street from the proposed site. An assistant, Raul Mojica, agreed. "We don't need another C-town," he said. JENNIFER KINGSON BLOOM

HEADLINE: MAKING IT WORK;
Reading the Hidden City

BYLINE: By MICHAEL COOPER 

 BODY:
TO Hope Cooke, New York is a palimpsest. The word, from the Greek, describes a parchment that has been inscribed and erased several times, still bearing hints of old, faded messages. As the city builds and rebuilds itself, barely legible remnants of its past are left behind. Those remnants -- the faded signs, anomalous buildings and crooked streets -- are the clues that Ms. Cooke, a self-described urban historian, tries to decipher.
Ms. Cooke herself is something of a palimpsest. In her 55 years she has been a debutante, a princess, a queen, a mother, a walking tour guide, a teacher and an author. 
 "I've learned that it's really important to be terribly attentive to where I am, wherever it is, because if you get numb to space, numb to habitat, you don't live wisely or well" said Ms. Cooke, whose discoveries of New York's spaces was published this spring in her "Seeing New York: History Walks for Armchair and Footloose Travelers" (Temple University Press).
Raised by wealthy relatives on the Upper East Side, she graduated from Sarah Lawrence College in 1963 and instantly became the heroine of a national fairy tale when she married the Crown Prince of the tiny Himalayan kingdom of Sikkim. Eventually, she became Sikkim's Queen. But the characters in this fairy tale did not live happily ever after. After 10 years, Ms. Cooke's marriage shattered. Then came uprisings, with thousands of Sikkimese protesting the monarchy and besieging the palace. After the tumult, Sikkim was annexed by India.
Ms. Cooke returned to New York, a city that because of her privileged but highly circumscribed childhood, she hardly knew. "When I was little, I thought the Grand Central building at the end of Park Avenue was the end of the earth," she recalls. "The place where ships fell off."
Back from Sikkim -- a single mother with two children to raise -- she found herself fighting a powerful sense of dislocation. "I needed grounding for my feet," she recalled over lunch in the backyard of her Brooklyn brownstone. "I needed roots, I needed to learn about my surroundings."
So she began exploring the city, walking widely and reading broadly. She studied the waves of immigration that shaped the Lower East Side: from the Canarsie Indians to the Irish, to the Jews of Eastern Europe, to the Chinese. "Going around the Lower East Side," she said, "you often get some old union organizer who can tell you about pre-reform labor, reform and the rollbacks of reform. In Chatham Square you can see steam coming out of every vent," a sure marker of illegal sweatshops.
One neighborhood she finds especially fascinating is downtown Flushing, which she thinks of as a miniature pan-Asia. Chinese and Korean merchants sell red-bean popsicles and ginseng root on Main Street, just steps from Taiwanese banks. On Union Street, intricate Japanese kimonos are offered, while just east on Bowne Street, Hindus worship at the Gujarati Temple only yards from the Sikh Gurdwara, another place of worship.
In "Seeing New York," she maps 14 walking tours ranging over Manhattan, Brooklyn and Queens -- from Victorian Brooklyn Heights to Dominican Washington Heights.
"In lower Manhattan, to recreate the early colonial era when you're face to face with banks, you have to become quite a good story teller," she said. "It's more like radio than television." It is easier when the subject is Brownstone Brooklyn, with block after block of intact Civil War-era houses.
One of her favorite neighborhoods is Brooklyn Heights, not far from the home she shares with her husband, Michael Wallace, a history professor at John Jay College of Criminal Justice. She revels in the Heights' "seeming fixity, the lush environs of longer durations and reposeful streets."
One that has her worried is Ladies Mile, the stretch of Avenue of the Americas from 14th to 23d Streets. At the turn of the century it was city's premiere shopping area for elegant women, with famous emporiums like B. Altman and Siegel-Cooper. But most closed or moved uptown, and the neighborhood declined. Recently, the old buildings have been renovated to house new stores, many of them giants like Bed, Bath and Beyond and Today's Man. Ms. Cooke worries, though, that few of these have their roots in the city. Most are indistinguishable from their suburban mall branches, a fact she finds especially distressing, and the bulk of their profits go elsewhere. "We've written off the notion of New York as a production town," she said, adding that the city has also lost more than 100,000 retailing jobs since 1965. "It's a little scary if you write off consumption as well."
Since returning from Sikkim two decades ago, she has never tired of scouring the city. "I began to see the connections between things," she said. "If you learn about the struggle over Tompkins Square, from the 1830's on, the present struggle over Tompkins Square makes more sense."
A flashpoint of that struggle -- among squatters, the poor, young professionals, the police and anarchists -- was the 1988 clash over a curfew for Tompkins Square Park. Ms. Cooke said worse riots erupted in 1874, when 10,000 unemployed workers battled mounted police officers.
Even before that, she notes, the neighborhood was divided between the rich who lived in town houses on the park's north side and who scorned tenement dwellers to the south, calling their homes "rag pickers' row."
Ms. Cooke enjoys the nitty-gritty of neighborhood disputes that have shaped the city: for example, how the battle between the Pierponts and the Hickses over how to develop Brooklyn in the 19th century helped define the borough's present downtown.
"That is always the illumination: to find the context," she said in her slightly whispery voice, which still retains a light Scottish accent she inherited from a nanny. "Once you bring past to present, that turns into an epiphany."
 
CITYSCAPE
Cooke's Tour
 
In 22 years of walking the city's streets and researching their history, Hope Cooke has found some favorite nooks and crannies:
 
Minetta Brook An underground stream that runs beneath Greenwich Village and that can be seen in a glass tube in the lobby of 2 Fifth Avenue.
 
Stuyvesant Street Cutting diagonally from Ninth to 10th Streets in the East Village, it is the city's only street on a true east-west axis. It was mapped to the compass points by Peter Stuyvesant's great-grandson, Petrus, before the city laid its own grid to conform to the shape of Manhattan Island.
 
Secret Tunnel This once connected the old Police Headquarters, at 240 Centre Street, to a walnut-paneled tavern on Grand Street in Little Italy.

HEADLINE: Debt Trap

 BODY:
To the Editor:
The example of Providian Bancorp makes a most effective case for reimposition of usury restrictions in the credit card market ("Merchants of Debt," Spending It, July 2). 
 Providian and other credit card issuers understand that American society is so overwhelmed by consumerism that the average family is desperate for any additional source of credit. Many of Providian's customers will be paying off their loans at interest rates close to 20 percent for the rest of their lives.
Why should credit card issuers face usury restrictions when people freely choose to enter in debt?
First, the realities of modern life place pressures on the American family that our grandparents never would have dreamed of. We are marketed to incessantly, and our list of needs grows faster than our paychecks.
Furthermore, our bonds of community and family have been stretched so thin that when illness, job loss or divorce occur, many people can only turn to their credit cards. Easy credit at high rates of interest is the American version of a social welfare safety net.
Second, though our cultural traditions have long taught us that the practice of lending money at astronomical rates is abhorrent, usury has become acceptable as good business. Does an activity deserve sanction simply because it generates a big profit? We have become so beholden to the language of "choice" and the concept of free markets that we are increasingly unable as a society to set limits on behavior.
Controls on interest rates would mean that many people would not get credit or would have substantially less, but most consumers would be better off in the long run if they learned to live within their means. The issue that we all seem to be avoiding is that there are many middle-class Americans who cannot survive on what they earn, no matter how hard they work.

HEADLINE: How an Economic Miracle Can Ruin New Jersey

 BODY:
To the Editor:
Your July 23 article ("The Day the Jobs Got Up and Moved Away") discusses the loss of employment in Mercer County and elsewhere in the state. But in fact a kind of economic miracle is happening in New Jersey.
According to a recent Rutgers University study, the state will recover all the jobs it has lost in the 1990 recession within two years. What makes this more remarkable is that it happens as the state throws off the yoke of manufacturing, mining and construction. Service-sector jobs have climbed 17 percent in the first five months of this year alone. 
 Our annual merchandise trade deficit is $150 billion. It will inexorably rise as we amplify the industries and technology of Japan and the Pacific rim. Of course, that will go on only as long as our country can continue to borrow money, sliding into greater and greater debt. The "good news" about our state's economy is actually bad news for our future.

HEADLINE: The Comfort Zones Of the Young, Black Professional

BYLINE: By MONTE WILLIAMS 

 BODY:
A STEPHANIE MILLS song washes over the room's exposed brick walls as clusters of denim-clad people strain to be heard over the din. Every bar stool is occupied, every corner clogged, forcing people headed upstairs to the dining room to navigate the crush.
The Shark Bar on a typical Friday night. 
 Standing at the far end of the softly lit bar is Michael Shanks, 34, a municipal bond accountant. "I haven't missed a Friday night in four months," Mr. Shanks said of the Upper West Side restaurant, a mecca for young black professionals. "I feel a sense of warmth here. I feel at home around my people." He paused, grasping for the right words. "I feel fulfilled."
For many middle-class blacks, the bars, restaurants and cafes that cater to them are more than places to meet friends before catching the latest release at the multiplex, more than spots to find next weekend's date or a future spouse. Jazz spots, salons and the dozens of black reading groups that are popping up throughout the city are more than social venues.
They are havens from the mainstream world that many young African-Americans and their parents fought so hard to enter. For some successful blacks, seeing people like themselves, walking examples of civil rights progress, helps to sustain them in an outside world from which they often feel alienated.
Such settings represent "a retreat to a comfortable and nurturing place," said Ellis Cose, author of "The Rage of a Privileged Class" (HarperCollins, 1994), which argues that although the ranks of the black middle class have grown rapidly in the past two decades, its members are frustrated by glass ceilings in corporations, racial slights from strangers and discrimination in housing and other walks of life.
The city's rising black middle class is substantial, even if its presence is often obscured by the focus on underclass poverty and crime. In 1990, 18 percent of working, non-Hispanic blacks in the city between the ages of 25 and 65 held managerial or professional jobs, according to Andrew A. Beveridge, a Queens College sociologist who conducted an analysis of the 1990 census for The New York Times. Another 28.7 percent held technical, sales and administrative support positions. And 30 percent were living in households with incomes of $50,000 or more, many of them in Queens, where the median household income of blacks exceeds that of whites.
Despite such inroads, for many blacks, the workplace is a source of racial unease. "One of the things that struck me as I was researching 'Rage' was that blacks kept saying how hard they had to work to make white people comfortable around them at work," Mr. Cose said. "They had to present a face that was not their natural face. A lot of black men, for instance, told me they had to be more meek than normal. If they were assertive or loud at all, people would perceive them as somehow stereotypical or perhaps even violent."
It should surprise no one, then, that many young upwardly mobile blacks -- sometimes called buppies (a label rejected by some because it connotes intraracial stratification) -- choose to spend happy hour with other blacks. And it's not just happy hour. There are black ski and scuba-diving groups and black bulletin boards on the Internet and mega-parties like the "Summer Sizzler at the Roxy," a July bash that drew more than 3,500 men and women from 10 black professional groups.
Of course, affluent blacks and whites do not lead completely bifurcated post-work lives. "It's not as segregated as you might think," said Nelson George, the cultural critic, adding that at most predominately black establishments, there will be at least a smattering of whites. "These are people who hang out with black friends at these places or are just down with blacks."
Still, says Lawrence Otis Graham, a black, Harvard-educated lawyer and a frequent commentator on race relations, when black professionals get together, they often choose to do so in "places that are accustomed to serving a large black clientele."
Why is that? Mr. Graham, the author of "Member of the Club: Reflections on Life in a Racially Polarized World" (HarperCollins, 1995), asserts that based on his experience, blacks not in the company of whites run the risk of being ignored or treated rudely or seated next to the bathroom or kitchen in many of the city's top restaurants.
But Earl Caldwell, the former Daily News columnist, has another explanation for the popularity of places like B. Smith's and the Shark Bar. They represent something "exotic" to younger blacks raised in the era of integration, he said. "The music is different, the language is different," he said. "Isn't it just more exciting?"
For Alison N. King, 34, a television producer and consultant, being a member of a black salon offers a gratifying sense of community as well as a venue for intellectual discourse. "It's good to know that there are others like yourself out there," said Ms. King, a member of the Brooklyn Black Belt Salon Brunch, which brings together Fort Greene and Clinton Hill artists and professionals to schmooze and discuss everything from fashion and literature to affirmative action. "Often, you think you're the only one out there with certain thoughts and experiences."
Not that successful blacks are a homogenous lot. There exists, says Mr. George, "an internal gamesmanship" based on educational and social pedigree. Second- and third-generation members of the black middle class -- those who vacationed on Martha's Vineyard as children, attended debutante balls as teen-agers and, later, graduated from exclusive colleges and universities -- may not fully welcome the newly arrived.
"You get a certain vibe from some of the Harvard and Yale blacks," said Mr. George, author of "Buppies, B-Boys, Baps and Bohos: Notes on a Post-Soul Black Culture" (HarperCollins, 1993). "But then there is also a cockiness among the up-by-the-bootstraps buppies. Those who came up from the streets will pull rank on the people who have the pedigree. They won't claim to be more authentically black, but they'll say I had to go through so much more than you, so therefore I am stronger."
For many decades, Manhattan has been the primary after-hours playground for black professionals. In the 60's, lawyers, doctors and politicians sipped cocktails at Frank's Restaurant, the Flash Inn, Jock's Place and the Red Rooster, Harlem restaurants and bars that closed as accommodations opened up to blacks downtown. In the 70's and 80's, the Cellar and Mikel's, now defunct rhythm and blues and jazz clubs on the Upper West Side, were the haunts.
Manhattan remains the social nexus for black professionals, although Fort Greene, often called the home of the new black renaissance, continues to grow in popularity and is now drawing black revelers from beyond Brooklyn's borders.
From a salon to soul food restaurants, herewith a look at a few of the places the city's black professionals find one another and themselves.
 
SALONS, POETRY READINGS,
BOOK DISCUSSION GROUPS
 The topic was media coverage of African-Americans. There were three featured panelists, but Ann Tripp, the 98.7 KISS-FM radio reporter, owned the floor at this Sunday afternoon assembly of the Brooklyn Black Belt Salon Brunch. "Why is it that every time there is a story about affirmative action in the news, blacks are called upon to defend it?" she asked. "Why don't they find white women, Asians, Latinos to defend it? They've benefited from it!"
A 30ish woman offered an "Amen." Someone else encouraged Ms. Tripp to "Tell it!" And so she continued. She noted in stories about Adarand Constructors v. Pena, the recent Supreme Court decision that imposed strict constitutional limits on affirmative action, she saw only blacks interviewed on the news. "The name was Pena, folks. He was not a black man."
Ms. Tripp also fumed about what she called excessive media coverage of black male celebrities accused of crimes, from Mike Tyson to Michael Jackson, and now O. J. Simpson.
"If you black women would turn off the O. J. trial," she said, "you could put CNBC out of business. I don't know why you're watching it. O. J. would rather die than date you."
Over lobsters, crab cakes and salads at the Chesapeake Oyster Grill in Fort Greene, the largely female crowd, ranging in age from post-grad to sub-50, blasted the news media for bias. In the past, entertainment and literature as well as art, politics and community affairs have been discussed.
The salon was born five years ago after three record publicists shared a cab from Manhattan to Fort Greene only to discover that they lived within blocks of one another.
"We realized that we lived so close together, but we had never been to one another's house," said Jacqueline Rhinehart, 37, national director of publicity for Arista Records. "We wondered, 'Well, who else lives in the hood?' "
The initial gathering was small. But eight people soon mushroomed into 60, and the salon moved from informal potlucks in individual homes to large brunches in local black-owned restaurants. Now 1,000 names appear on the salon's mailing list.
Entertainment is included in the $10 fee. (A poet and comedian appeared at the Oyster Grill.) The brunches draw an average of 100 people. But salon organizers say they do not make a profit.
"This gives us an opportunity to learn more about each other, share viewpoints and make new friends," said Gwendolyn Quinn, 34, a salon organizer. "If you know and respect your neighbors, I think it makes for a much healthier environment, socially and economically."
Though African-American salons are rare, black reading groups have been growing rapidly, according to the owners of several black bookstores.
With 85 members, the Literary Society may be the largest black reading group in the city. Founded by Lana Turner, a Harlem real estate broker, in 1982, this group of lawyers, educators, social workers and doctors meet monthly. They assemble in one another's homes and, so, feel blessed that only 20 to 25 people show up at most meetings. The group is not looking for new recruits. "When you have 25 clear-thinking, articulate people at a meeting and everyone wants to talk, it gets difficult," Ms. Turner said.
Women outnumber men, 7 to 1. Why this is is subject to debate. But Ms. Turner said, laughing, "The three or four who show up do carry the banner for their gender."
At a recent meeting of the Brooklyn-based Awareness Book Club, David Lamb, a 29-year-old Park Slope resident, found himself doing just that -- carrying the banner for black men.
Bell Hooks's book "Ain't I a Woman?" (South End Press, 1981) was on the agenda. There was consensus on some points, among them that white feminists tend to romanticize black women's "strength" and that black women are often asked to choose between black nationalism and feminism.
But Mr. Lamb, a lawyer who recently self-published a novel ("Do Platanos Go With Collard Greens?") took issue with the author's contention that slavery, while wretched for both sexes, was worse for women because not only did they endure savage beatings, but they were sometimes sexually exploited by slave owners and overseers.
"I think it's dangerous to get into who suffered more," Mr. Lamb said. "Black men were sexually exploited too. They were used to breed. They were bucks." Sometimes, he said, "They were forced to have sex with their own mothers and sisters." A momentary hush blanketed the room.
Seven months ago, when a friend told Mr. Lamb about the reading group, he jumped at the chance to become a member. "I'm the only black male attorney at my law firm," he said. "And that's a lonely position to be in. At the book club, there's camaraderie with other blacks. It's a way of renewing your spirit."
There's no shortage of spirit at the Brooklyn Moon Cafe in Fort Greene. Bohemians -- and buppies with "boho" souls -- clog the small, seven-month-old coffee house on Friday nights, when the main course is open-mike poetry.
Those not early enough to get a bistro table sit side by side in folding chairs. A few pile onto slightly frayed Victorian sofas. But many are left standing, not a few outside peering over the baseball caps, dreadlocks and braids of those who beat them in.
David Larrick Smith, 24, owner of an in-line skating school, is a regular.
"People up there are expressing the frustrations of the race," he said, nodding to the front of the room where twentysomething poets and would-be bards recited original verse about love, racism, revolution, O. J. and black women's thighs. "You hear other people express how you feel, and you want to scream, 'I can relate!' There's a healing process that takes place."
Recently, Brad Walrond, 24, a director of a youth program, recited a poem that captures the essence of the place: "People of Color Affirming Each Other."
It is so beautiful to see people of color affirming each other
I'm not waiting for ivory-tainted fame to come a'knocking at my door
I feel famous now cause I can hear the glorious sound of ebony talking back to me, saying, 'Go on baby, Go on.'
The raucous, patented laughter and spirited applause
Jovial injunction and adulation that resound in a mighty chorus
of a circle that cannot be broken . . .
"There's a need to be nurtured by your own," Mr. Walrond later said. Booing is verboten at Brooklyn Moon.
 
MUSIC, CLUBS
AND RESTAURANTS
 Dance clubs may be on the wane. But sometimes the dancing happens anyway.
Tuesday is funk night at Cafe Wha?. The dimly lit cellar in the West Village that draws predominantly white crowds most evenings attracts black professionals in their 20's and 30's who come to lose themselves in the retro-funk of the Slam Clinic, which plays old favorites by groups like the Ohio Players, Parliament-Funkadelic, and Earth Wind & Fire. Clubgoers are transported to a 70's basement house party, a place, in the words of the emcee, William Stephenson, "where your Afro shriveled all up" from dance-induced perspiration.
There is no dance floor, so clubgoers make do, moving with abandon in the narrow aisles, forcing waitresses to snake between shimmying hips, bobbing heads and flailing arms (the latter almost touch the wires that traverse the low ceilings). Surprisingly, management encourages the dancing.
"The more they dance, the more they drink," Mr. Stephenson explained. "It's that simple."
There is no dancing on Sunday at Chaz & Wilson, a cavernous Upper West Side supper club, when the R & B band, Ron Grant & Friends, shares the stage with budding performers during open mike night. Located on the northwest corner of 79th and Amsterdam, the usually predominantly white restaurant becomes a de facto Ebony Fashion Fair. Beautiful women with aerobicized bodies sport elegant silk pants suits, gold lame halters and dresses that are either very long or very, very short.
"I date black women exclusively," said a 33-year-old engineer, who insisted on anonymity. "Why would I go to a white club?" The celebrities are another draw. Salt, of Salt-N-Pepa fame, and Kevin Willis, of the Miami Heat, were recently spotted. Knicks players are said to be regulars.
There are a growing number of restaurants that draw largely black crowds, most of them owned, or co-owned, by blacks. Places like Kwanzaa, Pepper's and Mekka have opened in the last few years but B. Smith's and the Shark Bar have continued to attract legions of black professionals from across the city and neighboring suburbs for nine and four years respectively.
Sam Allen, 34, a real estate broker, is a Shark Bar partisan. "The crowd is professional, but they're down to earth, not snobbish and pretentious like the crowd at B. Smith's," he said.
Herbert Moreira-Brown, 40, a public school teacher, explained his enduring affection for B. Smith's. "We treat one another as individuals," he said, looking at the throng of people, overwhelming black and male and handsomely suited, at the bar. "I don't feel like I have to prove myself here the way I do when I walk into a white restaurant. Here, I'm not a black man, I'm a man."
 
 
 
Cyber-Hangouts With a Distinctly Urban Feel
 Sign on to New York Online, the nation's largest black-owned computer bulletin board system, and arguably its hippest, and suddenly a transit token materializes on the screen, followed by a digitized jazz trumpet riff. It doesn't take a techie to realize this is a cyberspace community with a decidedly urban flavor.
The subway is a metaphor for New York Online, a service focusing on the arts, created as a bridge between people of different cultures and races, the same way the subway connects people in the city's diverse precincts "who might not otherwise meet," explained Omar Wasow, 24. Mr. Wasow, with fellow Stanford grad, Peta Hoyes, 25, founded the company in a Fort Greene brownstone a year and a half ago.
But it is also a way for tristate black professionals to connect through black-themed chat rooms, to discuss, say, the recent Whitney Museum exhibit on African-American men or reactions to the movie "Panther" or black conservatives. Forty percent of New York Online's 1,100 users are black, 50 percent female, and most between the ages of 18 and 35.
There are at least 100 black-owned or black-oriented bulletin board systems on the Internet, according to Essence magazine, which, along with Shade, Vibe, Paper and Out, are published on New York Online.
John Knight Smith, 28, talks politics with other African-Americans and keeps abreast of upcoming black social and professional events using New York Online's black chat rooms, Society and Black Talk, as well as America Online's Ebony Room.
Users sometimes get together off-line, said Mr. Smith, a Park Slope marketing coordinator and married father of three, who recently attended an "Ebony Room" party aboard the Mystique yacht as it cruised around Manhattan.
"Sometimes people meet just to satisfy a sense of curiosity," Mr. Smith said. "There's also a lot of networking at these events. People bring their portfolios and hand out product and service information. There's a lot of talent out there."
Meeting off-line has advantages, Mr. Smith added. Online services like America Online, which reach a mass audience, leave users vulnerable to race-baiting from outsiders.
"Sometimes people with a screen name like 'hateblacks' will come into the Ebony Room just to be disruptive," Mr. Smith said. "Others will come in and say, 'I don't understand why you need this room.' Anybody with a computer has access."

HEADLINE: No Cheap Shots at Mexico, Please

BYLINE: By George W. Bush; George W. Bush is Governor of Texas.

DATELINE: AUSTIN, Tex.

 BODY:
Remember who your friends are. Always good advice in life. And now, words to keep in mind as the rhetoric of the 1996 election begins. Mexico currently wears the bright red bulls-eye in the ongoing political crossfire.
 The issues of the 1996 campaign will be emotional. There should be lively debate and discussion. But discussion about immigration and Mexico can turn ugly and destructive very quickly, severely damaging a positive and beneficial relationship. So when it comes to the debates over trade, immigration and other border concerns, the candidates must not try to build themselves up by tearing our friends down. 
 I have a unique interest in the subject of United States-Mexico relations. My state shares a 1,248-mile border with Mexico. The cultural, historical and economic ties between Texas and Mexico run deep. Texas is a richer place because of this relationship.
 Thanks in great part to the North American Free Trade Agreement, more than $20 billion worth of goods enter Mexico through Texas. The Texas economy directly benefits from Mexican trade. Trade means jobs. Trade means wealth to our state.
 But Texas is not the only beneficiary of the economic benefits of the trade agreement. Other governors know the growing importance of trade between their states and Mexico. Across our country, Mexico is proving to be a strong economic friend.
 Our economic bond with Mexico carries with it some very positive long-term results. An isolated United States will not be able to compete successfully in a world economy where Europe and Asia are united into common-market partnerships. The trade agreement wisely affords our country the opportunity to join forces with Canada and our neighbors to the south -- first Mexico, then Chile, then other emerging capitalist countries in Latin America. Within a united alliance, America will be economically stronger. We must not allow isolationist rhetoric or bad trade policy to alienate our trading partners.
 Not only will free trade help us, it provides a much-needed boost for Mexico. As capitalism takes hold in that country, wages will begin to climb. As wages begin to climb, Mexico will strengthen its middle class. Then, and only then, will the problem of illegal immigration subside. Most people who cross the border are hoping to make a living and provide for their families. The more economic opportunity and growth inside of Mexico, the less of an incentive to enter our country illegally.
 The United States has immigration laws in place. I strongly support them. Every nation has a right and responsibility to secure its borders. The Government simply must do a better job of enforcing ours. All of my fellow border governors have called for more equipment and more personnel.
 We must expand projects such as Operation Hold the Line, a highly successful program in El Paso, Tex. Under this innovative operation, Border Patrol officers regularly patrol known crossing points so that illegal immigrants are deterred or apprehended before they disappear into our communities. Even though it has been successful, it has not been carried out at other high-traffic corridors along the border.
 Despite the problems faced by the United States and Mexico, solutions will be forged in the fire of friendship and respect, not in the heated sparks of emotionally charged words.
 Our trade policy, coupled with the way we treat our neighbors, must be viewed as an integral component of the immigration debate. Growing economies and an expanding middle class in Mexico create a more attractive market for American products and services. They also make for more manageable southern borders.
 The United States and Mexico are linked through history and geography. The free trade agreement has linked us through economics, job creation and competition. If problems arise, they are best solved through friendship, not angry rhetoric. Friends help each other and bring out the best in one another. Friends can solve problems together. Indeed, the United States and Mexico remain friends. Now, more than ever, it is truly time for the candidates to remember who our friends are.

How an American Industry Gets Away With Slave Labor

BYLINE: By ALAN FINDER 

 BODY:
JUST 10 days after about 70 illegal immigrants from Thailand were freed from a prison-like California garment factory, where they had worked in virtual slavery, Federal labor officials notified more than a dozen large retailers last week that goods from the sweatshop may have ended up in their stores.
 Labor Secretary Robert B. Reich said the retailers had been asked to attend a meeting in Washington next month to discuss ways of preventing apparel made by slave labor from being sold in American stores. The invitation came amid a widening investigation of the garment shop in El Monte, Calif., and debate about the many other, more traditional sweatshops that still fail to pay minimum wage or overtime and often ignore health and safety laws. 
 In an interview, Mr. Reich elaborated on what the Government, retailers and garment manufacturers can do to curb abusive labor practices. ALAN FINDER
 
Q. Do stores know from whom they have purchased apparel or under what conditions it has been been produced?
 
A. The garment "food chain" is fairly complicated. Manufacturers often subcontract with cutting and sewing shops. The retailers contract with the manufacturers. Retailers increasingly specify what kinds of garments and the particular designs they need. Manufacturers using just-in-time inventory techniques deal with a whole set of subcontractors. It's often difficult for retailers to know precisely where a garment is cut or sewn.
 
Q. Was the women's garment industry fragmented this way so manufacturers could avoid responsibility for working conditions in shops? Or were economic conditions behind the creation of these complex networks?
 
A. We see the same pattern in many other industries. Increasingly, industries are fragmenting into networks of contractors and specialized subcontractors. The old model of a large, vertically integrated mass-production enterprise is becoming outmoded simply because consumers can now have goods tailored to their particular needs. Technology permits a wider array of enterprises to create niche markets and to supply one another with specialized services.
 
Q. Do you think consumers care whether clothing that they buy was made in a sweatshop or a factory that was abiding by all the labor laws?
 
A. Undoubtedly consumers are interested first and foremost in price and quality. But most American consumers probably don't want to buy clothes made by slave laborers in the United States.
 
Q. What can the Government do to make consumers more aware and force retailers and manufacturers to be more vigilant?
 
A. The Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938 authorizes the Department of Labor to bar interstate shipments of goods made in violation of the act, such as in sweatshops. That power was used rarely in the past. But it has proved to be an important instrument to get an industry to take responsibility for preventing these kinds of abuses. By barring shipments or threatening to bar them, we've managed to make significant progress. The numbers of workers who have been identified as working in sweatshop conditions and whose employers have been fined has grown by 50 percent over the last 2 1/2 years.
 Now in this instance we traced the invoices to several national retail chains, Mays department stores and so on. There's no evidence that these retailers knew that the garments that they bought were cut and sewn by slave laborers in the United States, but I don't think it's too much to ask them to take greater responsibility for helping prevent these kinds of abuses in the future.
 
Q. You're planning to meet with a number of these national retailers. What do you want them to do?
 
A. Let me give you an example. In June, we got the agreement of many brand-name manufacturers operating in Los Angeles County, representing about a third of the garment industry in Los Angeles, to voluntarily audit their cutting and sewing contractors for compliance with labor laws. This was a direct result of our enforcement efforts. Obviously the manufacturers did not want to run the risk of having their shipments impounded. By the same token I would expect that retailers don't want to run the risk of not having their orders filled because the garments they ordered were produced by sweatshops.
 Retailers are also concerned about their public images. They want to be good corporate citizens, I assume. The national retailers and brand-name manufacturers working together can police this industry because they are directly in the food chain.
 
Q. The number of Federal labor investigators declined by about 20 percent in the last six years. Do you have enough resources to crack down on sweatshops?
 
A. No. We've done a great deal with relatively few resources, because we've enlisted the help of manufacturers and we've used the legal authority in the Fair Labor Standards Act, which had rarely been used before. But obviously the industry has got to start taking a greater responsibility. There are nearly one million employees in the industry who are cutting and sewing garments. Almost 80 percent are women. In Los Angeles County alone there are 100,000 cutters and sewers in 4,000 separate cutting and sewing shops. It's extremely difficult for Federal inspectors to root out sweatshops. Manufacturers, however, know whom they are contracting with. Retailers are able to follow the invoice trail and assert some pressure on manufacturers and their subcontractors.
 
Q. American manufacturers are often competing with foreign manufacturers who pay much lower labor rates. Is it reasonable to expect American companies to remain competitive, or should we consider abolishing laws like the minimum wage and allow the international marketplace to determine labor rates here?
 
A. The garment industry in the United States is alive and well despite foreign competition. That's because there is an increasing demand for quick turnaround. Fashions change quickly, retailers want certain models, patterns, designs, immediately. It's often difficult for retailers to get the quick turnaround from foreign-sourced manufacturers.
 The amount of money we're talking about here, the difference between a sweatshop and a legitimate cutting and sewing operation, is relatively small considering the cost of the final garment. Remember, retailers are often marking up 60 to 100 percent.
 
Q. Are you reasonably optimistic that the American garment industry will do a better job of policing itself?
 
A. The cutting and sewing end of the garment industry in the United States has had a sad history of worker abuses for more than a century. Immigrants, some of them legal, some illegal, crowded together in unsafe, unsanitary conditions working for very little money have characterized cutting and sewing shops since the turn of the century. Sometimes there's a calamity like the Triangle Shirtwaist Factory fire in New York at the turn of the century, in which hundreds are killed. Laws are then enacted. But enforcement is always difficult.
 Unscrupulous employers and vulnerable workers in fly-by-night operations that can move from one location to another within days or hours make a difficult target for enforcement. The question is whether national brand-name manufacturers who contract with these small enterprises and large national retailers can have an impact. I'm cautiously optimistic.

Bradley's Exit Is Not Just the Democrats' Problem

BYLINE: By MICHAEL WINES 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON

 BODY:
TAKEN alone, Senator Bill Bradley's decision to leave Congress, perhaps for an independent run for the White House, is just a straw in the wind, an isolated instance of a respected man's disenchantment with his party and politics. The problem is, Mr. Bradley is anything but alone. American politics in the '90's is becoming a haystack caught in a whirlwind, the inchoate product of party alliances shattering and reforming, old orders crumbling, voters clutching here, then there for an ideology to cling to.
 So Mr. Bradley's departure is more than just a straw. It foreshadows the end of the Democratic Party as Americans know it today -- if not now, within a matter of years. Whether it signals a greater upheaval in the entire system is a matter of some dispute. 
 For Democrats, the signs of decay are irrefutable. Mr. Bradley, who is 52, is the sixth Senate Democrat to announce his retirement this year, a modern record. One and possibly two more retirees, Senators Caliborne Pell of Rhode Island and Sam Nunn of Georgia, are in the wings. Two other Democratic senators defected to the Republican cause earlier this year. Should Democrats lose even four races in the next election -- a not unreasonable prospect -- they will claim but 42 Senate seats, the lowest number since Calvin Coolidge took office more than 70 years ago.

 
 
Realignment
 Three Democrats already have defected to the Republicans this year in the House, and more are widely anticipated, especially in the conservative South. The Democratic share of House seats, already the lowest since 1947, could also dip to Coolidge levels if Republicans pick up even nine seats in 1996.
 "The Democratic Party has essentially run out of options," said Walter Dean Burnham, a scholar of political parties at the University of Texas. "This is part of a realignment sequence, one of those rare events most of us see maybe twice in a lifetime. It entails a collapse of their credibility, as far as I can judge."
 Unfortunately for Democrats, however, the numbers are more like digits on a thermometer, merely a way to gauge a worsening fever. The true collapse has occurred in the party's ideology, the core belief that Government has a duty and the means to lift the oppressed and better the working man.
 It has guided the party for 60 years, and Democrats by and large still believe in it. But a deficit-hobbled Government no longer has the means to deliver endless benefits. And voters, seeing the results of Democratic efforts to tame crime and eradicate poverty and its ills, are rejecting it outright.
 Bill Daley, of the Democratic Daley family that used to dominate Illinois politics, is blistering in his assessment. "Whatever we thought the Democratic Party was, that's over," he said, "and I don't know what the next phase of it is.
 "The only message we've got is the same one we had in November: the Republicans are going to cut Social Security and Medicare. People look at it and say, 'Forget it. We don't buy that. The sky isn't falling.' "
 Sick as the Democrats are, the greater worry is whether what ails them is a disease of their party or the system. For the Republicans share some of their rivals' most ominous symptoms.
 Both political parties claim to represent that vast, mostly moderate body of middle-class voters who tend to determine elections, but both have been moving away from the center for years. The uncertain economy, the growing cynicism of sound-bite politics and the explosion of press coverage probably promote that drift; so, oddly, has both parties' commitment to civil rights. The well-intended redrawing of state and Congressional districts to create black and Hispanic seats has had unintended consequences: their mostly Democratic minority voters must be carved out of surrounding districts, leaving those districts more conservative and more Republican. Most of the new minority seats, meanwhile, are lopsidedly liberal and Democratic. Both trends have helped to kill off conservative Democrats in the South and on the fringes of big cities, and they have been a boon to Republicans.
How long the boon lasts is another matter. The new Republican hierarchy was largely installed by the moderate middle, but it is anchored by a solid right wing of populists and Christian stalwarts in the House and, increasingly, the Senate. Democrats proved unable to hold the extreme and the center; Republicans will have no easier time of it.
 Beyond that, it's not clear whether the Republican ascendancy means that the voters were hungry for their policies or just fed up with a broken Democratic regime. If the latter, then the new majority may soon get its own comeuppance.
 Republicans have made good on some pledges to shrink Government and upend the Washington aristocracy. But already polls hint at disaffection with their progress. Angry voters who fueled Ross Perot's independent candidacy in 1992 are now fuming over the party's failure to enact term limits and a balanced-budget amendment. The Republicans' open attempts to extract political money from big business and lobbyists rankle voters who expected the new Congress to change the town's greased-palm culture.
 More than a few experts believe the Republicans will amount to a political flavor-of-the-month unless they deliver the goods to the electorate, and quick.

 
 
Party Power
"The system is now saying that something must be done, that neither political party is being responsive or is viewed as responsible," said Kenneth M. Duberstein, former chief of staff to President Ronald Reagan. "The best analogy I can give you is a remote control device: people are clicking off politicians, the President, the speaker, the majority leader. In '92 they clicked off George Bush. In '94, they said they were clicking off Bill Clinton and the Democrats. The next channel we may turn to is an independent channel."
 It is true that an unusually thick flock of mavericks is mulling independent runs for the White House -- Lowell Weicker, Jesse Jackson, Colin Powell, Mr. Perot, and Mr. Bradley of New Jersey -- and that most of them are eyeing the restless center. The odds are against them. No third-party movement has survived without a leader in the White House, and not since Abraham Lincoln stopped leading the Whigs and took the new Republican Party to victory in 1860 has that occurred.
 Whatever storms they face, Republicans are united by a small-government, pro-business ideology. Even the splintered Democrats retain an organization, access to money and a proud tradition that make a powerful franchise.
 And political parties, like people, are capable of astonishing change. Republicans had ruled politics for 30 years, and Democrats were a husk of a party, too feeble even to repudiate the Ku Klux Klan, only eight years before Franklin D. Roosevelt founded a political dynasty in 1932. Democrats could well retain the White House next year. If Republican budget cuts and social crusades turn out to be missteps, they could surge back to power in the House, too.
 At least that is the optimistic Democratic view. In this decade of political windstorms, most experts believe the party has two options: either build a strong new house, based on new ideas, or hunker down in the cellar, committed liberals all, for a long, dark wait. The departure of the centrist Mr. Bradley could speed that day.
 "Few people remember it," the Democratic strategist David Doak said last week, "but Ronald Reagan's conservative revolution, the one that runs through Newt Gingrich now, began in the debacle of Barry Goldwater's loss in 1964."

The Rich Idioms of Russian: Verbal Soul Food of a Culture

BYLINE: By MICHAEL SPECTER 

DATELINE: MOSCOW

 BODY:
OF all the horrors confronting Russian society political and economic instability, a lingering war, an average life expectancy for men so low it's hard to believe (57 years) -- worrying about the current state of Russian conversational language might seem a little, well, petty.
 But that would be taking the short view. 
 "There is nothing more important than the language," said Sophia Lubensky, a professor of Slavic Language and Literature at the State University of New York at Albany. "Czars come and go. Presidents come and go. There are wars, there are famines. Language lives through it all."
 Mrs. Lubensky, a Russian emigre, has just produced the "Russian-English Dictionary of Idioms" (Random House) the first book in decades to try to translate the ideas of Russian idioms -- and not just the words -- into English. And while it is rich in the dark phrases of the 18th century, and not terribly up on the current slang one hears on the streets of Moscow, a careful tour of this volume can tell a reader as much about what matters to Russians as the results of any election or emergency meeting of the International Monetary Fund.

 
 
God, Food and Soul
 The book is full of the language of God, food and the soul. Not surprising perhaps for a country that always seems to be have something bad in its mouth (vodka is heavily linked to the soul in the Russian imagination; no doubt so are cigarettes, though there are no idioms here to prove it.)
 For instance, a Russian could pretty much convey the entire range of human emotion with reference only to kasha, the grain dish. Nobody around here would argue with this notion, for example: "Kashu maslom ne isportish," which means literally you cannot spoil kasha with too much butter. What it really means, of course, is you can't have too much of a good thing -- and in Russia a good thing is usually, well, food soaked in butter.
 Then again, there are limits. If things go too well for too long a guy can simply "s zhiru besitsya," which means go mad from eating so much fat, or have it so cushy that he gets soft. "Bolno zhirno budet," sick with fat, painfully fat or it's a lot of fat, means, basically, who does this guy think he is? Is his diet so rich that he can treat everyone like a vassal? And if somebody does mess up pretty badly (Boris Yeltsin in Chechnya for example) then the only thing to do is: "raskhlyobyvat kashu," which literally means eat up the kasha, but really means clean up his disgusting mess.
 Russians don't speak with marbles in their mouth, they speak with kasha in their mouth (kasha vo rtu). They're not green behind the ears; they have "malo kashi yel," which means they have eaten too little kasha in their lives to be worth much.
 Even some of today's best-known idioms are food-based. When Prime Minister Viktor S. Chernomyrdin was being challenged not long ago about the war in Chechnya he erupted: "Veshat lapshu na ushi," which means don't try hanging noodles on my ears, buddy, or, as Americans might say it, that's a lot of bull. Mikhail S. Gorbachev spat the same phrase at a member of Parliament who was trying to explain why he participated in the failed 1991 coup.
 Food matters, of course, but not as much as the Lord. Russians often express their most fundamental feelings with reference to God, even if God is nothing they actively believe in.
 In addition to the many idioms that translate easily into English (God knows how much I have suffered; God knows what I have done; God be merciful) there are some phrases that mean far more to Russians than they do in America: "Radi boga" (for God's sake) is possibly the most commonly repeated phrase in the Russian language -- except for a few profanities that translate quite well, but not in this newspaper. Instead of filling empty airspace with the all-purpose words well, um, and you know -- all part of the America's national speech impediment -- Russians are capable of repeating the phrase radi boga 20 times in five minutes.
 God's name is invoked in every imaginable way. If somebody is a complete loser he is "ni bogu svechka ni chyortu kocherga" -- neither a candle to God nor a rod to the devil, i.e., useless. If it's time to stand up and be a man then you say, "Ne bogi gorshki obzhigayut" -- It's not God who bakes all the clay pots, or anybody can do this work if he really tries.
 But not even God can compare with the soul. No word has more significance in the Russian language than dusha, or soul. A good human being has a "dusha naraspashku" -- an unbuttoned soul, but really an open heart. But a bad guy -- and this has been said of everyone from Dostoyevsky's Raskolnikov in "Crime and Punishment" to Gen. Dzhokhar Dudayev, the Chechen rebel leader -- is a person who would "naplevat v dushu," or spit in your soul.
 Russian souls are also always being engraved upon, trampled upon, put aside, unburdened and burdened. People worm their way into your soul, they rip their soul in two, and of course, they are often caught selling the damn thing.

 
 
Window on Culture

 "Without this type of idiomatic expression people simply could not communicate," said Yevgeny N. Shiryaev, deputy director of the Russian Academy of Sciences Institute of Russian Language and an expert on the development of common speech. "Words would not add up properly. And of course the type of idioms we often rely on -- earthy, physical phrases -- tell a lot about our culture."
 That's no doubt because the Russian people are so practical. After all, "Snyavshi golovu, po volosam ne plachut" -- or, once your head has been cut off, there's no use crying about your hair. Now doesn't that make "there's no use crying over spilt milk" seem a little pathetic?

More on the Wealth of Nations

BYLINE: By KEITH BRADSHER 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON

 BODY:
WALK through the Freer Gallery on Washington's Mall these days and you will run across an exhibit showing the advances in Japanese art that came 400 years ago with the development of a merchant class. Walk a little farther, and there is a remarkable exhibit of Whistler's century-old paintings, testimony to what wealthy patrons can give to society.
 But while high concentrations of wealth may have served culture, a growing body of research suggests that big gulfs between the affluent and the poor tend to result in more social unrest, slower economic growth and investment and lower standards of living. 
 The conventional wisdom used to be that the disparity between rich and poor was a price of economic growth, particularly for poor countries pursuing industrialization. Differences in income were perceived as necessary to provide an incentive for people to strive. And without those people who earn considerably more than they need for life's daily necessities, a society may not have enough savings to pay for new factories, equipment and the other underpinnings of an industrialized economy.
 But that conventional wisdom has been challenged in recent years as economists have noted that countries with relatively equal distributions of income have achieved higher rates of economic growth than those with considerable economic inequality. In the more unequal nations, economists argue, more people lack access to the education and training that would enable them to contribute to economic growth.
 These concerns were underlined by a study released last week by a nonprofit research institute in Luxembourg that found poor children in the United States to be poorer than the children in 15 other Western industrialized nations. Only in Ireland and Israel were the poor children worse off.
 The study followed several academic papers released last spring that say the United States has the most unequal distribution of income and wealth of any Western industrialized country. While many middle-class families have become very affluent as the economy has expanded over the last 15 years, many other families are sinking financially, so that the ranks of the middle class are thinning. The result has been alarm among many economists.
 "I don't know what the right level of inequality is," said Timothy M. Smeeding, one of the authors of this week's study on child poverty. "I think the American level is too great."
 Especially provocative is a study by Alberto Alesina at Harvard University and Roberto Perotti at Columbia University that is scheduled for publication soon. After examining statistical patterns in 70 countries, the two economists concluded that high income inequality creates social unrest and pressures for heavy taxes on the rich and, in turn, economic uncertainty that discourages investment. With lower investment, economic growth suffers.

 
 
More for Fewer
 A separate study this summer by Professor Perotti alone concludes that more equal societies also tend to have fewer children and invest more in education -- two trends that foster economic growth. Both studies strongly reflect the experience of poor countries, but also include affluent countries like the United States.
 Yet the ways in which equality are achieved seem to be at least as important as the actual gap between rich and poor. East Asian countries that have had relatively equal distributions of wealth dating from before their industrialization have fared far better economically than countries like Russia that leveled their differences by force.
 Nor is there any consensus among economists about the extent to which economic inequality may justify extra government taxes and spending to redistribute wealth.
 "The ways we have gone about reducing income inequality have had serious inefficiencies," said Robert H. Haveman, an economics professor at the University of Wisconsin at Madison, who cited welfare payments and taxes that may reduce incentives for many people to work.
 Even the popular wisdom that economic inequality is good for art is coming under question. While Spanish painters like Velazquez produced magnificent works while serving as court painters in Madrid during the 17th century, painters like Vermeer flourished at roughly the same time in Holland, where there was a larger middle class and painters could support themselves by selling to many clients.
 As governments have expanded into an ever broader range of activities in this century, the existence of a wealthy class has become even less important for art. When the Depression laid low many wealthy American families, for instance, President Roosevelt's Public Works of Art Project financed a wide range of high-quality art.
 One painting from the period, showing an apparently unemployed worker selling apples for a nickel apiece on a quiet wharf, now hangs in the office of Treasury Secretary Robert E. Rubin, who has nicknamed it "the Reagan Economy." Over lunch last week, Mr. Rubin argued that rising economic inequality was a threat to the nation's social fabric and economic growth, and even the arts.

 
 
On Art and Law
 Mr. Rubin would maintain Federal spending on education and the National Endowment for the Arts, which Republicans in Congress are trying to curtail. "If you had a better educated lower half of the American income class," Mr. Rubin said, "then you'd have a much broader market for the arts."
 The long, slow fall in the nation's median wage, Mr. Rubin said, has led to more crime and fostered political extremism as many Americans feel a dwindling stake in the economic system. Partly as a result, the nation has up to three times as many private security guards as police officers.
 The answer, he contended, lies in maintaining spending on education to produce skilled workers who can compete in the global economy. The economic troubles of a broad section of American society "are a very serious threat to our social fabric," Mr. Rubin said. "It feeds the violation of law, and that is a very big productivity cost on the country."

Misunderstanding Social Security

BYLINE: By ROBERT D. HERSHEY Jr. 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON

 BODY:
PAYING out $15,000 in benefits every second, America's Social Security system is not only the biggest Federal budget item, but probably the most misunderstood.
 Now, even the American Association of Retired Persons seems to sense that the myths and shibboleths surrounding Social Security, a program signed into law 60 years ago last week, need to be scrutinized. In a recent survey, the association found that confidence in Social Security had fallen to 36 percent from 45 percent a decade ago -- indicating, the association said, the need for Americans to begin "to wrestle with the question of what serves their long-term economic security best." 
 Social Security's protectors, often playing on ill-founded fears, have helped make the program into an icon whose problems politicians have long discussed only in platitudes or behind closed doors. Now, legislation introduced by Senators Alan K. Simpson, a Wyoming Republican, and J. Robert Kerrey, a Nebraska Democrat, proposes ambitious remedies, including allowing workers to divert some of their Social Security taxes to a private retirement account. Still, the obstacles are formidable; perpetuation of myths has made the system highly resistant to change. Following are some of the main misperceptions about Social Security.

MYTH -- The system is bankrupt.
 
REALITY -- Social Security is now running surpluses and will continue to do so for many years. But projections show that the system will begin spending more than it takes in by 2013 and will be unable to pay full benefits by 2029. The projected gap results from the nation's declining birth rate, leaving too few workers to support the retirement of the baby boom generation and those that follow, and the rise in the average life span.
 
MYTH -- Social Security is designed to provide retirement benefits equal to what you put into the system during your working life.
 
REALITY -- Actually, retirement checks are only loosely tied to how much you paid into the system. And the program's benefits are much broader.
 Social Security redistributes the nation's wealth to protect Americans if they become disabled or otherwise unable to work and protects their spouses and children should they die prematurely. It relieves much of the burden of caring for aged parents and even pays a small death benefit of $255.
 "The myth we have to grapple with most is the idea that this is a personal investment program into which one puts money, earns interest and gets it all back," said Shirley S. Chater, commissioner of the Social Security Administration, which earlier this year was spun off from the Department of Health and Human Services to become an independent agency. Rather, she said, "it was meant to be a social insurance program."
 If Social Security is considered "your own personal shoe box in Baltimore," as former Commissioner Dorcas R. Hardy puts it, people naturally become indignant when somebody proposes that benefits be pared to keep the program solvent.
 The agency's own efforts to instill confidence in the system contribute to the myth. An increasing proportion of prospective retirees automatically receive what the agency calls a personal earnings and benefit estimate. Listing every penny in taxes -- often called contributions -- a worker ever paid into the system as well as the benefits he or she can expect to get under various circumstances, these statements seem to tie taxes closely to benefits.
 Another factor in the misunderstanding is that Social Security's creators in the 1930's sold it as an insurance system that implied a return for one's work -- most people need 10 years to qualify for benefits -- and for the money paid by the worker and his employer. These earmarked taxes, however, were not called taxes. They were called "premiums" and "contributions," terminology that makes it seem that benefits are one's due, which the Government has no right to alter.
 
COROLLARY MYTH -- Retirees get nothing they haven't "earned."
 
REALITY -- The average beneficiary (collecting $858 a month for an individual retiring last January at age 65) will get back all the money he or she contributed, with an allowance for interest, in 3 1/2 years or so. This retiree, given a normal life expectancy, will collect nearly a decade's worth of benefits "free." Earlier retirees, including millions still living, did even better. Ida May Fuller of Ludlow, Vt., who got the first monthly check in 1940, collected more than $20,000 in benefits after paying $22 in taxes. No one has ever contributed more than $48,000, the highest level paid by someone retiring today.
 Mistakenly believing that they're getting no more than they're owed, recipients often resent the suggestion, however correct, that their benefits include a portion that is a gift, or to use the pejorative, welfare.
 
MYTH -- Social Security should provide for a comfortable retirement.
 
REALITY -- From its inception, policymakers have regarded Social Security as only part of a three-legged stool for retirement. The other legs are personal savings and employer pensions.
 
 
MYTH -- Social Security is a giant fund that the Government taps, and when it's depleted benefits would have to stop.
 
REALITY -- The program is not a fund but a legislative mechanism that takes money from today's 139 million covered workers and transfers it to today's 37.3 million retirees and survivors. Various Social Security trust funds do exist, ostensive repositories for taxes the system collects above its current outlays, but this money is being spent for other things, and so the funds get Government I.O.U.'s.
 This arrangement can be changed by Congress, of course. But even without changes in the law, Social Security would not go bankrupt in any particular year. In 2030 the system would still have enough money to pay 75 to 80 percent of promised benefits, assuming the Government meets its commitments to pay off the I.O.U.'s.
 
MYTH -- Social Security taxes are regressive, putting more burden on the poor than on the rich, so it would be unfair for higher taxes to be part of the solution.
 
REALITY -- Considered by themselves, Social Security taxes are regressive since the rate is the same 6.20 percent for everybody and the earnings against which the tax is applied are limited by a ceiling, which this year is $61,200. But this regressive feature is largely offset by the fact that the system's benefits are progressive, replacing in retirement a higher proportion of middle-class and poor people's incomes than those of the rich.

HEADLINE: Korean Rice Aid Is Largely Feeding Tensions

BYLINE: By NICHOLAS D. KRISTOF 

DATELINE: SEOUL, South Korea, Aug. 19

 BODY:
Just a month or two ago, sacks of rice seemed to be achieving what spies, politicians and tanks could not: an easing of tensions and diminished risk of war on the Korean Peninsula.
But rice diplomacy, based on a donation of 150,000 tons of rice by South Korea to North Korea, has proven to be as much of a minefield as those that mark the tense border between the two countries. Instead of creating trust and warmth, the gift has led to a climate in which both sides now seem more irritated with each other than ever. 
 Rather than expressing gratitude for the rice, North Korea last week seized one of the South Korean relief ships on charges of spying. The ship and its crew were released early this week, but a furor has erupted in South Korea over whether it is appropriate to supply assistance to a neighbor that not only looks a gift horse in mouth, but also tries to extract its teeth.
"Our people are angered because we have been slapped when we are helping them," Park Chung Soo, a member of the South Korean governing party in the National Assembly, said of the North Koreans. "Our people's pride and our nation's prestige have been shattered."
All the political parties, even the governing party, have criticized the handling of the rice shipments, and some legislators have called for the resignation of the Cabinet Minister who supervised them.
One casualty of the chill in relations is a major peace proposal that South Korea's President, Kim Young Sam, had discussed with President Clinton during Mr. Kim's trip to Washington last month. Mr. Kim had planned to make the proposal this week, but instead he has shelved the proposal indefinitely.
South Korean officials said the speech would have called for a formal peace to replace the armstice that ended the Korean War in 1953. Under the plan, the two Koreas would sign the peace accord along with the United States and China as guarantors of the agreement.
It is unclear how much of a step forward this formula would have been because North Korea would surely have rejected it. Indeed, North Korea this week pre-emptively blasted vague reports about President Kim's possible peace proposal.
"This deserves no consideration because it is not helpful at all toward preservation of genuine peace on the Korean Peninsula," the North Korean Central News Agency said in a statement. It added that any such South Korean proposal would be "a trick to hinder the establishment" of North Korea's own ideas for peace.
Deputy Prime Minister Rha Woong Bae of South Korea told the National Assembly this week that despite the problems with the rice deliveries, Seoul would provide the remaining 65,000 tons of the 150,000 tons of rice it agreed to give to North Korea.
"I believe the rice aid project, which started out of love for our brethren, will contribute to South and North Korean reconciliation and mutual confidence when it is completed as scheduled," Mr. Rha said. But he added that until North Korea freed a fishing boat it seized in May, South Korea would not consider any additional shipments after its promised 150,000 tons was delivered.
The Joongang Daily News, a Seoul newspaper, commented: "North Korea accepts our rice for free but takes every chance to wound us. Now that we can see the North Korean way of thinking, we no longer need harbor romantic delusions or provide unilateral hospitality to North Korea."
The rice diplomacy was remarkable in that it arose after North Korea made a startling admission of a grain shortage in May by asking Japan for food aid. Many foreigners had deduced that North Korea had food shortages from such evidence as a North Korean propaganda campaign urging people to "eat two meals a day," but requests for foreign assistance were a humiliating admission of North Korea's own economic difficulties.
North Korea wanted Japanese rice, but South Korea insisted that Japan not give any assistance unless South Korea was also allowed to provide aid. So both South Korea and Japan have donated rice to North Korea, but the North Koreans have accepted the South Korean assistance only with distaste.
As arrangements for the rice donations were being made, North Korea fired on and seized the South Korean fishing boat that it said had entered North Korean waters. The fishing boat and its crew still have not been released.
Then the first South Korean boat taking rice to North Korea was forced to lower its flag and raise a North Korean flag. And last week, the South Korean ship Venus was detained when a crew member took photographs of the port as the ship was unloading donated rice. South Korea expressed regret, and North Korea released the ship and its crew after a week.
Another source of tension has been accusations that a South Korean minister who disappeared last month in China and reappeared in North Korea was kidnapped. South Korea says the minister, Ahn Seung Un, was abducted, while North Korea insists that he went voluntarily and has shown him on television, although South Koreans note that the images show him looking a bit glum.

HEADLINE: Flying Blind -- A special report;
Aging Control System Brings Chaos to Air Travel

BYLINE: By MATTHEW L. WALD 

 BODY:
At least 11 times in the last year, air traffic control centers have stumbled or broken down completely, robbing controllers of the tools they use to keep airplanes separated and on course, sometimes leaving them completely deaf, mute and blind. The main problem, everyone agrees, is that some computers that help controllers track airplanes are at least 25 years old and long past due for replacement, but updated technology has been delayed because contractors have not been able to write the software for new equipment.
Even though the Federal Aviation Administration is facing a difficult stretch, until new systems are designed, tested and installed it is doing something surprising with maintenance: cutting back. It is also letting equipment go unattended on night shifts, eliminating training for technicians and cutting back on hiring, so that in some busy air traffic control centers half the technicians are eligible to retire. 
 Even if the surge in failures of traffic control computers never results in a crash -- and none has so far -- each new breakdown delays anywhere from dozens to hundreds of flights, which the airlines say costs them millions and costs passengers even more.
In this rough period, the short-term outlook is dismal. Many of the technicians who can retire are likely to do so this year or next because Congress is planning to cut the retirement benefits of those who retire later. Lawmakers have already cut the pay of some of them by eliminating some cost-of-living increases that other Federal employees get.
For 35 years, the F.A.A. has exerted control over all commercial airliners from takeoff to landing. Planes are tracked by tower controllers with binoculars and local radar, by controllers in Terminal Radar Approach Controls, called Tracons, which may serve several airports, and by controllers in the 20 Air Route Traffic Control Centers around the nation. The Tracons and the centers share data from nationwide radar installations and talk to the planes over a network of radio transmitters and receivers. The centers also handle oceanic traffic, which they cannot see, via radio.
There are very few new technicians in training, but even hiring more would not help because some vital pieces of equipment are so old that they are operated nowhere else in the world and the F.A.A. stopped training technicians to maintain and repair them years ago.
Some breakdowns, like failures of the equipment to alert controllers to potential collisions, are obvious to pilots only because they are told to wait on the ground, or to increase spacing in the sky, while the controllers reduce the traffic to a level the degraded equipment can handle. Sometimes it is obvious because there is no controller's voice at the other end of the radio; in that case, pilots may switch frequencies to try to reach the controller they just left. Occasionally they reach a controller elsewhere and ask permission for an altitude or heading change only to be told that the controller has no authority to instruct them.
The last line of defense for passenger planes is their on-board collision-avoidance systems. Two American Airlines pilots relied on that system a few months ago when faulty equipment in San Juan, P.R., led a controller to direct them toward a head-on collision.
At the same time, the breakdowns may have growing safety consequences because they are becoming more serious and stranger; there are "ghost targets" of planes on the screen that are not really in the sky, planes that do not show up at all and frequent flickers and blinks.
The air traffic controllers say that in at least one incident recently, the equipment led them to believe that it was carrying out certain automatic functions when in fact it was malfunctioning. The equipment was, in effect, lying to them about its condition.
The F.A.A. denies that this happened, but its version of what went wrong strikes Federal safety investigators as equally ominous. The F.A.A. suggests that the problem may have been confusion among the controllers about how to manage when only some equipment was working -- confusion that may itself be a safety problem.
The National Transportation Safety Board is sufficiently concerned about the recent rash of failures to have sent investigators to Aurora, Ill., and other centers to explore the issue. Safety board officials said they would comment on their concerns and findings when the investigation is complete early next month.
 
The Resources
Equipment Ages As Staffs Shrink
 Often the problem is old equipment failing, but the F.A.A. has also got into trouble as it modernizes, with new equipment, evidently with bugs, breaking down. That has resulted in several power failures and the collapse last week of a Voice Switching Control System in Seattle, the first installation of this technology. The system is the prototype that is supposed to replace old, less reliable connections between the centers and their radio antennas, which are spread out over the territories that the centers control.
The F.A.A. counts 11 failures since a 75-minute power failure last Sept. 14 at the Chicago Air Route Traffic Control Center in Aurora, one of the 20 high-altitude and intercity control centers around the nation; the list includes two power failures at another center in Ronkonkoma, L.I., and one earlier this month at the Oakland center in Fremont, Calif., along with four major computer breakdowns in the Chicago center and others in Fort Worth and Washington. The unions representing the technicians and the controllers also cite major failures at air traffic control offices in Miami, Los Angeles, San Juan and elsewhere.
Each failure has unique aspects, but most share a common component: electronic equipment that is 30 years old and was supposed to have been replaced years ago, before crippling breakdowns became endemic to the system.
F.A.A. officials acknowledge that they have had problems, but they defend their system.
Discussing the Aurora center's performance reliability, Martin G. Duffy, manager of the F.A.A. Chicago Systems Management Office, said, "We are as close to 99-point-whatever as we can get." Drawing a diagram of the center's computer system for a visitor and explaining what went wrong, he pounded the blackboard for emphasis, asserting, "We moved 8,600 airplanes that day through this airspace."
Union officials say they are proud of not doing any worse with equipment so old that no spare parts are commercially available and neither the manufacturer nor third-party vendors will service it.
Jack Johnson, the president of the Professional Airways Systems Specialists, the Washington-based union that represents the technicians, said that inadequate maintenance was responsible for the growing number of failures and the long periods of time it takes to rectify them.
The Oakland blackout, he pointed out, occurred just after 7 A.M. when a transformer blew. Transformers usually smoke before they fail; a technician on duty would literally have smelled trouble coming, he said. But there is no longer a technician on the midnight shift at Oakland, a situation that is now common throughout the F.A.A.'s system.
Short staffing was also acknowledged by the F.A.A. as a reason that recovery was so slow from a power failure in New York in May.
Mr. Johnson's position has a self-serving element: his union is shrinking, down to 6,000 technicians today from 11,600 in 1981, even though the number of systems that the technicians are responsible for maintaining has risen to 31,000 from 19,000. But Mr. Johnson probably does not have to worry about layoffs, given the rate at which his members can retire.
"We have cut 5,000 jobs in the last five years," said George Donohue, an assistant administrator for technology acquisition with the F.A.A. "We cut them because we had to cut them," he said.
While the F.A.A.'s operating budgets have been flat, Mr. Donohue said, "flat means negative 3 percent a year; people forget about inflation. The Civil Service increases salaries based on the cost of living, and the work force goes down."
The agency wants to reduce its work force by 19 percent in the next five years. But it anticipates 18 percent growth in the amount of traffic handled in that period, Mr. Donohue said.
At the New York Center, in Ronkonkoma, which has had 16 "significant outages" in which one or more major systems failed between May 1993 and last June, there are 67 technicians and support personnel, down from 108 in 1991. The F.A.A. plans to hire 12 more, but 16 are eligible to retire.
"You can have all the air traffic controllers in the world in a center," said Henry G. Brown, the technicians union's representative at Ronkonkoma, "and if you don't have a technician to keep them going, they can all go home."
Airlines and elected officials are also increasingly concerned about equipment; the airlines recently asked the F.A.A. to employ "utmost haste" to replace the part that has failed most often recently -- the I.B.M. 9020e, a refrigerator-sized computer with wiring that looks like cobwebs and is nearly as frail -- with an interim fix by 1997, even before long-term improvements can be made in 1999. The F.A.A. recently agreed.
The F.A.A. acknowledges many problems, including with the 9020e. A recent internal study of the New York Center found that the 9020e computer -- a section of the system that takes radar data and flight-plan data from the mainframe computer and delivers it to controllers' screens -- had failures 90 times between January 1992 and June 1993.
The 9020e has many redundant parts, so a failure does not always mean a breakdown. But the failures were so frequent that the complex ran without some of its backup parts 56 percent of the time during that period, the study found. That left the system one failure away from breakdown -- akin to driving a car with a flat spare tire. Moreover, the study suggested that this probably represented conditions around the country.
But F.A.A. officials continue to assert that even a breakdown is safe because it generally deprives controllers only of "enhancements," like the ability of the computers to predict and point out conflicting flight paths. They can run the system safely without these tools, managers assert, if they reduce the amount of traffic in the sky.
The amount of down time for the 9020e -- which failed in the Chicago Center on July 23 and again on July 24 -- doubled between the beginning of 1990 and the end of 1994, the study found.
Mr. Johnson, the technicians union president, estimated that half the technicians were already eligible to retire or would be within three years. Hiring rates are very low, and new employees get inadequate training. For example, the last training session for the part that failed in Chicago, the I.B.M. 9020e, was in 1991. The F.A.A. plans another session this fall at its academy in Oklahoma City, but technicians in Chicago say they are so short-staffed they wonder how they will spare anyone for training.
To find spare parts for the system, the F.A.A. has cannibalized one of the two 9020 models it keeps in Oklahoma City; only one survives for testing and training.
"It's really strange that we continue to keep doing this," Mr. Johnson said of the cuts in the technician work force and the resulting cuts in maintenance.
F.A.A. executives defend the trims in the work force, which has meant that parts that break tend to not get fixed. The agency dedicates lots of time to each piece of equipment when it is new, said Stanley Rivers, deputy director of the Airways Facilities Service of the F.A.A., which maintains the nation's network of radar equipment, radio beacons, control towers and air-traffic-control centers. After a break-in period, he said, careful records are kept about how often each part needs service, and work is scaled back accordingly.
"We really can't afford to have technicians do things that are not necessary or are redundant," Mr. Rivers said. In addition, he said, there is a good reason for servicing the 1960's computers less.
"One of things you're going to confront, particularly with older systems, with experienced technicians, is the need to not overstress the hardware," he said. Cables are brittle, vacuum tubes do not stand too much handling, circuit boards can break when flexed, and transistors can fail under the strain of testing, he said. "As the system matures, you learn that some of that can become destructive after a while," he added.
Mr. Rivers and others acknowledge that the agency started to pare its work force years ago in anticipation of getting replacement equipment: modern computers with low-maintenance microchips that can alert users when something goes wrong. But the F.A.A. is still dealing with equipment with vacuum tubes, dense webs of wiring, thousands of circuit boards and other components that are as extinct outside the F.A.A. as punch-card readers and core memories.
Mr. Rivers also played down concerns about the possibility of mass retirements. Only 30 to 40 percent of the technicians will be eligible within the next three years, he said, and "typically, they don't retire the day that they're eligible." Generally, only 13 percent of the work force retires in any given year, he said.
Union members, though, say that a Congressional plan would change the rules in a way that would accelerate the retirements.
Both the House and Senate have passed budget resolutions that could prompt more technicians to retire. The bills have a new formula for figuring benefits, based on the employee's five highest-paid years. The current formula uses the three highest-paid. Since most employees' wages increase each year, the effect is to average in some lower-wage years, thus cutting retirement benefits for people who choose to delay their retirements until the new rules take effect.
What is more, the count of how many technicians are eligible to retire is a national average, but retirements could be much higher at some centers. The case of Chicago is instructive.
At the Air Route Traffic Control Center in Aurora, an outer suburb about 40 miles west of O'Hare and Midway Airports, the center has 55 technicians; 24 are eligible to retire immediately and 5 more will be eligible in less than three years. The last time someone was hired was three years ago, and it generally takes three to five years for a new technician to be fully qualified.
 
The Gaps
Repair Capability Is on the Decline
 In a pinch, technicians can be reassigned from other Airways Facilities offices, but the equipment -- and, therefore, the skills required to maintain and repair it -- differs from post to post.
For the 9020e, the computer that failed repeatedly at Aurora, there have been no training courses since September 1991. On the two nights in July after the most recent breakdown, Peter Pecharich, a specialist on that computer, worked through the small hours of the morning, the only hours when traffic is light enough to allow maintenance to be done. Another technician there, one transferred recently from Alaska, was supposed to go to the F.A.A. Academy in Oklahoma City for a training course on the 9020e in July, so he would be qualified to do the work, but the course was canceled. The F.A.A. is now planning to hold an abbreviated course in October.
At age 55, Mr. Pecharich will be eligible to retire in a few months, and he said he would like to leave. Congress is considering raising the retirement contributions from many Federal workers, including F.A.A. technicians, and cutting benefits; Mr. Pecharich said he would like to get out before that happened.
William L. Casey, 62, is a veteran of nearly 40 years in the F.A.A. and is renowned among co-workers for pinpointing the source of problems. "Each piece of equipment is going to have its own character," he said.
But Mr. Casey, in the unofficial technician uniform -- plaid shirt over a white T-shirt, pocket stuffed with pens and glasses -- said he planned to retire in October. When Mr. Casey considers what he would receive in pension benefits, he said, he is coming out ahead by only about $6 an hour staying on the job. Mr. Casey said that there was no point waiting for his benefits to decline and that he was tired of wheeling huge, antiquated pieces of equipment to the shop. He added, "Some of the oldest people in the facility are doing the hardest work."
The declining work force means numerous "open watches," or times when no one is on duty in areas that were staffed 24 hours a day when the equipment was younger. The reduction in the number of technicians has become so acute that the other big union at the centers, the National Air Traffic Controllers Association, has complained about it.
The result is that less repair work gets done. Wanda Geist, the technicians union shop steward at Aurora (and the newest employee -- she was hired three years ago) gave an example of that, citing the electronic modules, in computers, called "vector generators," which allow the controller to see a line showing the route a plane is supposed to take for the next few minutes. Formerly, when one of the modules broke, Ms. Geist said, it would be swapped for a working spare. Now, she said, there are six spares, "none of them ready to go into the system."
"A couple have been repaired," she said, "but we have not had the down time to test them."
 
The Hardware
Is the Equipment Still Trustworthy?
 As reliability declines, the controllers say, a new problem is developing with the equipment's integrity, the faithfulness with which it reports its condition. Integrity is central to the F.A.A.'s repeated assurances to the public that only efficiency, not safety, has been compromised by recent failures. The agency says that when something has broken, the people who manage the system have quickly held planes on the ground and increased the spacing of planes in flight, slowing traffic down to a level that the degraded computers can handle.
But a failure on May 17 at Aurora casts some doubt on integrity, the controllers said. They gave this account:
When the screens began to flicker about 8:30 A.M., the controllers' equipment, which has been shaky for years, did something new: it lied to them about what functions were still operating. The green circular screens at which they sit indicated that a large portion of the automatic system was continuing to assist them in controlling airplanes -- specifically, helping them in "handing off" planes from one controller to another -- when in fact it was dead.
"I didn't know I had to call up another controller to hand off a plane," said Michael J. Hannigan, a controller, who usually performs that task with a trackball mouse and the click of a button. For seven minutes, he and other controllers say, the system was telling them it was all right to use the mouse, pointing and clicking, to alert another controller, in Aurora or different centers, that a plane was being handed off to that controller, when in fact the computer switching was not working. The switch had to be made by telephone.
The controllers also found that they had lost the ability to sit at their terminals and type in new flight plan information.
The equipment was telling them that the 9020e computer had failed. In that condition, data from the nine radar dishes around the region continue to flow into the center, and the data can get to the controllers' screens on two alternate routes. One is a backup bypass called the Direct Access Radar Channel, called DARC, and the other is through the main computer, called the host. The backup through the host computer provides more information than DARC, but still provides less than what the controller usually sees.
The system told the controllers that they were operating with the DARC and host backup systems, called DARC-host mode, which would mean that they had lost safety enhancements like the ability to predict conflicting paths but retained the automatic-handoff function. In fact, the system lied: they were actually in a more degraded condition, with only DARC functioning.
But Denis C. Burke, the Air Traffic Manager of the Chicago Air Route Traffic Control Center, said that the system had actually been in DARC-host mode for about a minute, before slipping another notch, into DARC-only mode. The problem, he said, was that the controllers became confused because they had first seen a banner at the top of their screens indicating DARC-host mode. "Then they looked back down at their traffic," he said, "and the system went into DARC alone. But the brain still told them: 'DARC-host.' "
Until the recent onset of multiple failures of the 9020e's, Mr. Burke said, "we had 99.6 percent reliability; the controllers were not exposed to this."
At the National Transportation Safety Board, investigators say that the problem may well be confusion among the controllers about operating in unfamiliar configurations that change rapidly. But that offers little solace, they say, since either possibility -- lying equipment or operator confusion -- is a safety concern.

Charts/Diagrams: "OVERVIEW: Old Technology Leads To Breakdowns In Air Traffic Control"
 The age of the equipment at the nation's 20 traffic control centers has been cited as a major factor in a recent rash of breakdowns in the system that both watching and directs all commercial aircraft across the United States. Not only are many of the vital components more than 10 years old, but even when they are replaced, it is often with technology from decades past. Diagram shows the primary components of the control system at the Chicago air traffic control center, which is located in Aurora, Ill. (pg. 32)
 
 
"The Handoff"
 From takeoff to landing, commercial airliners are monitored and directed by a series of controllers who hand off responsibility for planes to each other as the aircraft pass in and out of their jurisdictions.
 
Control center
 Directs planes after they reach high altitudes. Can hand off and receive planes to and from Tracons and other control centers.
 
Tracon
 Terminal Radar Approach Control. Directs planes that are at low altitudes and around airports.
 
Airport tower
 Controllers use both binoculars and radar screens to direct planes in and out of the airport. (pg. 1)

HEADLINE: Laos Struggles to Retain Its Culture

BYLINE: By HENRY KAMM 

DATELINE: VIENTIANE, Laos

 BODY:
"We have 1,200 kilometers of frontier with Thailand, and what we hear and see comes from them," said Dara Kanlagna, an official of the Culture Ministry in Laos.
"The younger generation all accept this," she said. "With the market economy that we have now, people have more money. They buy tape recorders instead of things they need. They feel this is modernization. The farmers take their transistor radios to the field with them." 
 Well known as a novelist in a country where half of the population is illiterate, Mrs. Dara Kanlagna is trying to preserve the sources of culture and revive it for Laotians, particularly the young, as an alternative to the pervasive Thai influence.
Aided by the Toyota Foundation in 1988 and now by German Government grants, which average about $200,000 a year, Mrs. Dara Kanlagna has inspired and is directing an effort to preserve the old manuscripts that enshrine Laotian literature and do not exist in print.
Virtually all such manuscripts are stored in the pagodas of this deeply Buddhist nation of 4.5 million people. Because Buddhism penetrates all aspects of Laotian life despite 20 years of Communism, it is not only sacred texts that repose in monasteries.
There are treatises on law, observations on nature, folk tales, poetry and traditional two-line verses about life and love. Texts on traditional medicine and the "magic" in which even sophisticated Laotians put faith are kept in temples and in the houses of practitioners.
In Mrs. Dara Kanlagna's youth -- before she attended Southern Illinois University in the 1960's -- the manuscripts held the place now captured by Thai mass culture. Monks not only studied them, but also read them to the people in monasteries. Before the coming of public education, which has not taken full hold, monks were the teachers and transmitters of traditional culture.
"They had no entertainment but listening to the monks," said Mrs. Dara Kanlagna, who speaks fluent English. "That's why Lao people are so illiterate. Our tradition is oral. But when modernization came, people began to think that this tradition is too old-fashioned. We want to tell them that it is still important. The physical preservation of the manuscripts would help to raise people's consciousness of the need for their own culture to survive."
The manuscripts were handwritten by monks on strips of the hard leaves of a special palm. The "books" are a bit wider and longer than an ordinary ruler and are bound with string slipped through holes and covered with slats of wood, often carved and painted.
The earliest surviving manuscripts, dating to the 16th century, are found largely in Luang Prabang, the royal capital until Laos became a "People's Democratic Republic" in 1975, Mrs. Dara Kanlagna said, but most are copies made early this century.
With the help of a dozen or so young ministry employees, she has gone through the libraries of nearly 300 pagodas in the provinces along the Mekong River, the main artery of Laotian civilization. Her account of how they gain access to the manuscripts attests to the survival of village democracy despite the rigid national one-party system.
"We cooperate closely with the monks and the old people," she said. "We sleep in the villages. We really get down to the roots. The villagers are very suspicious that we might take the manuscripts away with us. The abbots have to listen to the villagers, because it's they who contributed the manuscripts. They have authority over them. The monk may be happy to cooperate, but we have to convince the people. Sometimes the talks last day and night."
Obtaining permission, though, is not the only preliminary step.
"We treat the manuscripts with great respect," Mr. Dara Kanlagna said. "We hold a ceremony to ask the Lord Buddha to forgive us that we touch and wipe the holy words. Usually only monks touch the manuscripts. In some places women are not allowed to touch them."
To draw children into this culture, Mrs. Dara Kanlagna often rounds up all the schoolchildren in a village to help with the cleaning, which consists only of dusting the leaves and wiping them with alcohol.
" 'What are these?' they ask, and I tell them: 'They are books. We had more books then than we have now.' "
After the suppression of Buddhism in the early Communist years, Mrs. Dara Kanlagna said, no restrictions on religious education or on youths' becoming monks are enforced today.
"Now the Government understands," she said. "In the yellow robe the boys behave much better than left alone in the city."
Mrs. Dara Kanlagna said that the cleaning added perhaps 50 years of life to the manuscripts but that it could do nothing to halt their inevitable crumbling. With the villagers' permission, she borrows the most important ones for microfilming in Vientiane, the capital.
"That is the best part of the German project," she said, pointing to the microfilm equipment in her crowded office.
"At least on microfilm we preserve them," she added, as if to console herself over the transitory nature of what has become her life's work. "That's not so bad."

HEADLINE: Robert C. Frasure, 53, Envoy On Bosnia Mission, Is Killed

BYLINE: By STEVEN GREENHOUSE 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Aug. 19

 BODY:
Robert C. Frasure, the Deputy Assistant Secretary of State for European and Canadian Affairs, died today when the vehicle he was in riding in plunged down a hillside outside Sarajevo in Bosnia. He was 53.
Mr. Frasure was part of a team of American diplomats who were traveling to Sarajevo to talk with the Bosnian Government about a new peace plan being pursued by the Clinton Administration. 
 For much of May, Mr. Frasure, a career diplomat, held marathon one-on-one negotiations in Belgrade with President Slobodan Milosevic of Serbia. Mr. Frasure tried to persuade the Serbian leader to recognize Bosnia's territorial integrity in exchange for having economic sanctions against Serbia suspended.
In recent months, Mr. Frasure flew to Europe once or twice a month in his role as the main American representative to the so-called contact group of nations -- the United States, Russia, Britain, France and Germany -- which has been tryiing to broker an end to the Balkan war.
State Department officials say that Richard Holbrooke, the Assistant Secretary of State for European and Canadian Affairs, relied on Mr. Frasure for much of the most delicate diplomacy regarding the war in Bosnia.
Before becoming Deputy Assistant Secretary of State in July 1994, Mr. Frasure was Ambassador to Estonia. In September 1991, as the charge d'affaires in Estonia, he oversaw the re-establishment of an American diplomatic presence in that Baltic country after it declared independence from the Soviet Union.
Mr. Frasure was born in Morgantown, W.Va., on April 20, 1942. His father taught at West Virginia University and his mother was a public school teacher.
He received a bachelor's degree from West Virginia University and later attended the London School of Economics. He received a Ph.D. from Duke University.
After joining the Foreign Service in 1974, he served in more than half a dozen overseas posts, including Geneva, Bonn, Lagos, London, Pretoria and Addis Ababa.
In 1990 and 1991, he served on the staff of the National Security Council in the Bush Administration. In June 1991, President Bush awarded him the Presidential Medal for Exceptional Service for his role in the downfall of the Mengistu regime in Ethiopia and the rescue of more than 15,000 Ethiopian Jews who were airlifted to Israel.
Mr. Frasure, who lived in Falls Church, Va., is survived by his wife, Katharina Witting, and two daughters, Sarah and Virginia.

HEADLINE: G.O.P. Revises A Budget Rule To Help Banks

BYLINE: By ADAM CLYMER 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Aug. 19

 BODY:
After complaints from banks that have seen their share of student loans drop sharply, Republicans have changed the accounting rules to make it easier for Congress to kill off the banks' competition -- a Federal program that makes direct loans from the Treasury.
The Republican-led House of Representatives has also voted to reduce the amount the Department of Education can spend supervising the system of Federal guarantees for banks that make student loans -- a program that has frequently had management problems. The Senate has yet to act on the House proposal. 
 Under current law, the direct-loan program is expected to provide $13.8 billion in student loans in the year beginning Oct. 1, while federally guaranteed bank loans will provide $15.3 billion. In 1993, the year before the direct program was created with strong support from President Clinton, bank loans made up all $19.2 billion in Federal student loans.
The direct loans have proved popular with students because the money comes through faster, and with university administrators, who have found them to be simpler to administer. Banks, however, have long treasured the guaranteed loan program, which offers profits with much less risk than they have on other loans.
A big boost for the direct-loan program, enacted in the 1993 budget reconciliation bill, was a rule that required the Congressional Budget Office and the Office of Management and Budget to exclude Federal administrative expenses when calculating the effects of loan programs on the Federal budget. Both sides agree that gave direct loans an unfair advantage in any budget-making comparison, since more Federal money is spent on administering the direct-loan program than on the guarantee program.
Seizing on that, Republican opponents of the direct-loan program put a very unusual directive into this year's budget resolution. It ordered the Congressional Budget Office to include administrative expenses of the direct-loan program, which are estimated at $441 million for next year, in its budget calculations -- but not the Government's outlays to administer the guaranteed loan program, which are estimated at $270 million next year.
When the Budget Office followed orders last month the Republicans hailed the figures as a reason for "scrapping the direct-lending program," in the words of Representative Howard P. McKeon, the California Republican who heads the subcommittee on higher education.
But the Clinton Administration, Senate Democrats and many supporters of direct loans cried foul.
Senator Edward M. Kennedy, Democrat of Massachusetts, accused Republicans of "cooking the books." Marshall Smith, Under Secretary of Education, accused them of "a venal assault on student aid" and "putting bankers first."
Mr. Kennedy and White House officials said that if the administrative costs of both programs were counted, the direct loans in total would again prove to be cheaper for the Government.
Even one supporter of the changes, John E. Dean, a consultant to the Consumer Bankers Association, agreed that $160 million in Federal payments to assist the 40 agencies around the country that administer the guaranteed-loan program meet their administrative costs should be included, although he argued that the other $110 million in supervisory costs should not be counted because much of it was unnecessary. These agencies have often been criticized in the past, and in 1990, one of the largest, the Higher Education Assistance Foundation, went broke while carrying $9 billion in loans.
And a conservative Republican economist now serving on the Federal Reserve Board has sought to halt the changes for the loan program. The Fed governor, Lawrence Lindsey, criticized the step as "making the change the industry proposes without looking at other changes."
In a letter to Senator Spencer Abraham, Republican of Michigan, Mr. Lindsey wrote that "As long as it is necessary to provide a profit to induce lenders to guarantee student loans, direct lending will be cheaper." Mr. Lindsey is in charge of consumer finance at the Fed, and in an interview on Wednesday, he said bankers had "selected the change that makes them look good."
He also said the argument that university officials make about the direct system as simpler for them was "a compelling argument for the advantage of direct loans to the economy."
In Seattle, for example, Eric Godfrey, assistant vice president of the University of Washington and director of financial aid, said the university was very pleased with the direct-loan program. "We would characterize our first year in the program as being very close to an unqualified success," he said.
The debate does not involve interest rates, which are set by the Federal Government for both programs.
But Mr. Godfrey said the direct-loan program was simple for students to understand and much easier for the university to deal with than the 700 banks and 40 or so state guarantee agencies it used to work with. Students had $13 million in their hands in the first week of school last year, compared with $3 million in the first week of the 1993-1994 school year, when the university last used the guarantee program.
Just as Mr. McKeon would like to see the direct program abolished, the Clinton Administration urged Congress to move quickly to eliminate the guarantee program entirely, saying the direct program was cheaper and better.
But others argue students are best served by the competition. That has been, for example, a strongly held view of Senator Nancy Landon Kassebaum, the Kansas Republican who heads the Senate Committee on Labor and Human Resources. Even one guarantee agency official, Sheryl Hagemeir, vice president of the American Student Loan Association, said, "We welcome the competition," and said universities that wanted the direct-loan program should be allowed to join it, but not required to, as they could be under existing law.
Terry Hartle, vice president for government relations of the American Council on Education, said dropping either program would be worse for students because competition had forced banks to do a better job of providing services, and continuing the guarantee program would keep the direct program on its toes. He also said the House Appropriations Committee's proposal to eliminate most of the $110 million spent on supervision of guarantee agencies was "a very risky thing to do."
One past director of the Congressional Budget Office, Robert Reischauer, said the sort of instruction the Republicans had issued to the Budget Office about accounting for administrative costs was very unusual. He found it comparable to a Congressional habit of preferring the lower estimates of politically popular loans to Israel from the White House over the more expensive estimates from the less-political Congressional Budget Office. But Mr. Reischauer said the change made sense, even though it should have gone further and included the costs on guaranteed loans. "If you are going to do it, do it right," he said.
Mr. Reischauer, who left the job at the beginning of this year, was preceded by Rudolph Penner, who has recently worked as consultant to the student loan industry. He agreed Friday that it was very unusual for the Budget Office to be ordered how to make its calculations on a program. But in this case, he said, "it has put the whole thing on a better basis." He also said it was difficult to decide just which administrative costs should be included in estimates for the guarantee program.
One argument House Republicans make for killing the direct program is that doing so would enable them to make less severe cuts in other student loan programs, like interest subsidies.
Another clear Republican motive is to attack a popular program created by President Clinton. A July 27 "Dear Colleague" letter from Mr. McKeon and Representative Bill Goodling of Pennsylvania, chairman of the House Committee on Economic and Educational Opportunities, began by denouncing "the President's fundamental belief that the Federal Government can run the student loan program better than the private sector."
And they complained of the Department of Education's use of its money to advertise direct loans as "President Clinton's New Direct Student Loan Program." That proved, they said, that the President "has chosen to make the program an important component of his re-election campaign."

HEADLINE: Bill to Ease Cuba Suits Faces a Veto By Clinton

BYLINE: By STEVEN GREENHOUSE 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Aug 19

 BODY:
Clinton Administration officials are warning that the President could veto a bill devised to tighten the trade embargo against Cuba because it includes a provision that would entangle the Castro Government and its successors in new claims for property expropriated in 1959.
That provision would allow tens of thousands of Cuban-Americans to file lawsuits in American courts demanding billions of dollars in compensation from the Cuban Government and foreign companies using expropriated assets, even though these people were not American citizens when their property was lost. 
 The bill's sponsors -- Jesse Helms, the North Carolina Republican who heads the Senate Foreign Relations committee and Representative Dan Burton, an Indiana Republican -- say the provision is vital to discourage investment in Cuba at a time when President Fidel Castro is desperately courting overseas investors to keep his foundering economy afloat.
Administration officials say the provision would violate international law, create numerous lawsuits, sour relations between Washington and any post-Castro Government and make it hard for a post-Castro Cuba to privatize property because of pending lawsuits.
Aides to President Clinton also contend that the measure would give Mr. Castro political ammunition to tell his people that Washington is doing the handiwork of rich corporations eager to take back property that the 1959 revolution seized to create a fairer distribution of wealth.
A senior Administration official said: "We strongly object to key provisions in the bill, especially the claims provision. But we are working with Congress to try to make some compromises."
The Helms-Burton bill, known as the Cuban Liberty and Democratic Solidarity Act, would conflict with traditional rules of international law, under which people who were Cuban citizens when their property was nationalized would only be allowed to resolve the issue with the Cuban Government.
Aides to Mr. Helms and Mr. Burton asserted that the lawmakers would retain the expropriation provision.
"The purpose of this provision is to cut off the lifeblood of foreign money to Castro and thereby speed the fall of the Castro regime," one aide said.
The bill's sponsors envision lawsuits in which Bacardi, for example, whose rum distilleries were nationalized, might sue Pernod Ricard, a French liquor company that distributes rum made in those distilleries. They hope the threat of such lawsuits will scare foreigners away from doing business in Cuba.
The Administration argues that the provision will undermine the chances that a post-Castro Cuba could create a stable democracy. One senior Administraton official said: "A post-Castro Government will need to resolve the foreign property question and give people confidence there is respect for property in Cuba. This bill virtually guarantees that no government, no matter how well intentioned, will ever get out from under the numerous lawsuits."
The House International Relations Committee approved the bill, 28 to 9, and the full House is expected to take up the measure in September or October. While Republican lawmakers say they are confident the bill will pass both houses, Administration officials say it could run into problems in the Senate.
The White House, working closely with companies in the United States and in foreign countries, has quietly persuaded Congress to retract other parts of the legislation. One would have prohibited importing sugar or sweetened products from countries with companies that buy sugar from Cuba. Instead, the bill requires foreign companies to certify that none of the sugar in shipments to the United States comes from Cuba.
The other would have required aid to Russia to be cut back if Moscow furnishes goods to Cuba at a below-market price or pays Cuba for operating an intelligence facility in Lourdes, Cuba. Russia uses the facility to help monitor American compliance with arms-control treaties.
Many of the 5,911 American companies and individuals that already have filed claims against Cuba -- totaling an estimated $6 billion -- oppose the confiscation provision. Robert Muse, a Washington-based lawyer for Amstar, whose sugar mills were confiscated, said the bill would make it harder for those who were American citizens in 1959 to get full payment for their claims from a post-Castro Cuban Government.
"Cuba doesn't have infinite resources to meet its claims from U.S. claimants," Mr. Muse said. "Each time you allow another Cuban-American claimant into the system, it's one more bucket taken from the finite well of Cuba's ability to pay."

HEADLINE: U.S. Politics Delays Treaty On Poison Gas

BYLINE: By BARBARA CROSSETTE 

DATELINE: UNITED NATIONS, Aug. 18

 BODY:
Hopes that an international treaty banning chemical weapons would be ratified this year have been set back because of a partisan political standoff in Congress over reorganizing the State Department.
As a result, the commission set up to put monitoring operations in place and hire inspectors under one of the toughest control systems in any international treaty "is very quickly losing steam," said H. Martin Lancaster. Mr. Lancaster, a former Congressman from North Carolina, was named this spring by President Clinton as a special adviser on the treaty, known as the Chemical Weapons Convention. 
 "It really is critical that the treaty be ratified this year," Mr. Lancaster said in an interview Thursday in New York, adding that Britian and Russia, the two other major powers whose ratification was crucial, have scheduled legislative action on the convention this fall. "A lot of other countries will simply wait until we ratify to take action."
Failure of the United States to act, he said, "will weaken our position of leadership in the world." The United States regained momentum in arms control only this month when President Clinton called for a permanent ban on all nuclear testing.
Mr. Lancaster, a Democrat who was defeated in a Republican sweep of North Carolina last November, was for six years the House of Representatives observer to the chemical weapons talks at the United Nations Conference on Disarmament in Geneva. The treaty, adopted in 1992, has been signed by 159 nations, but only 32 have ratified it. It needs 65 ratifications to take effect.
The treaty, negotiated and signed by President Bush, would ban the development, production, purchase, deployment, stockpiling or use of chemical arms. It would also require all nations to destroy any such weapons in their arsenals.
The United States has chemical weapons or equipment for their use stored in eight states or territories, according to the General Accounting Office. In 1991, President Bush vowed that the chemical weapons would never be used, pending approval of the treaty, the first pact to allow short-notice inspections that would make it difficult to conceal work on chemical arms.
Ratification of the treaty is being held up because action on a bill reorganizing the State Department -- and in the process abolishing the independent Arms Control and Disarmament Agency -- has been blocked by Democrats in the Senate.
On Aug. 1, Senator Jesse Helms, the North Carolina Republican who is chairman of the Foreign Relations Committee, said he would hold up ratification of all treaties and foreign appointments in retaliation.
Both the chemical weapons treaty and the second strategic arms treaty with Russia, known as Start II, are now in limbo, signed but still unratified by the Senate, as a result. Talks are said to be taking place between the White House and Congress, now in recess, on a compromise that would give the Senate some of what it wants in folding independent agencies, including the Agency for International Development and the United States Information Agency, into the State Department.
If an agreement is reached in coming weeks, however, the Start II treaty will be the first to be considered, Mr. Lancaster said.
"Even if we pass that hurdle we still have another significant hurdle, and that's going to be just getting time on the schedule," said Mr. Lancaster, who will be lobbying the Senate for the President on the issue.
President Clinton has often mentioned the need to adopt the chemical weapons treaty, most recently after the poison gas attack in a Tokyo subway earlier this year. In the Security Council, the Administration has been vigilant about possible chemical weapons production in Iraq and other countries.
But the President, who vowed when taking office to make ratification of the chemical treaty a priority, did not push it through a willing Senate before the November 1994 elections. Mr. Lancaster said that there was wide agreement on the treaty's ratification and that Republicans could take pride of authorship.
"This treaty probably bears the personal stamp of George Bush more than almost anything in his Administration," he said. "He went to Geneva in 1985 and as part of a speech offered a draft of a treaty that was little changed from his proposal. He then really pushed to have it concluded. In fact, it was signed just days before he left office."

Fruit Of the Loom

BYLINE: By THOMAS L. FRIEDMAN 

 BODY:
When Henry Kissinger and China's Zhou Enlai were first meeting in the 1970's to forge the strategic alignment between their two countries, Mr. Kissinger used to joke that he was constantly being badgered by U.S. businessmen who had dreams of selling "one billion pairs of underwear" to the Chinese. Ha, ha, ha, the two grand strategists would laugh in those big overstuffed chairs. What a joke! America selling things to Communist China, or, funnier yet, Communist China selling things to America. What a knee-slapper!
 It's worth recalling how funny this seemed at the time to remind ourselves what the original U.S.-China relationship was about. It was about one thing: the Soviet Union. It was about the U.S. and China forging a strategic partnership to counterbalance the dangerous Russian Bear. It was not about one billion pairs of underwear. 
 And that explains why there is so much tension today in the relationship between the U.S. and China: They've lost the Soviet Union. They've lost their common enemy. They've lost the main reason for the U.S. to overlook its historical revulsion at China's Communist system, authoritarian Government and abusive human rights practices.
 Sure, a nuclear-armed Russia is still a potential threat to both Washington and Beijing. Sure, a rich Japan that could go nuclear with the turn of a screw needs to be balanced by China. But neither today's Russia nor today's Japan poses the sort of immediate, all-consuming threat that Moscow posed to Washington and Beijing in 1971.
 Lately, there has been a lot of fatuous analysis contending that if only Beijing and Washington communicated more they could work out their differences. I don't think so. The fact is, they have lost their common enemy, and without the Soviet Union disguising or cushioning their differences they must increasingly look at each other face to face, government to government. The more they do that, the more neither side likes what it sees.
 What Washington and Beijing need ideally is a new common strategy, based on shared objectives, not a shared enemy. The Clinton team, after stumbling around in its China policy for two years, has come up with what it thinks is such a strategy. It is based on the assumption that China is the most important emerging power in the world today, and that without Beijing's cooperation it will be impossible to maintain the stability of Asia or deal with fundamental global problems. (China, for its part, needs the U.S. market to maintain its economic growth.) Therefore, the Administration's strategy is to engage China at all levels in an effort to get Beijing to play by the rules of the world system -- whether they are rules for nuclear testing, weapons proliferation, free trade, environmental protection or human rights.
 But there is one problem with this strategy: China's aging, authoritarian leadership doesn't seem much interested in it. What the U.S. sees as a policy of engaging China to make this huge rising power a responsible member of the international community, the Chinese regime sees as a policy of containment. We tell China it can host the Olympics or join the World Trade Organization, but only when it meets certain world standards of behavior.
 We see China as the 800-pound gorilla that needs to be house-broken. China sees itself as the 800-pound gorilla that should be able to sit wherever it wants. It's not obvious that China can, or wants to, play by our rules. Indeed, China just may be too big, and its leadership too brutish, to ever fall into line.
 We keep groping for some "normal" U.S.-China relationship that we are trying to get back to. But it's gone. That doesn't mean we have to return to the name-calling acrimony of the 1950's -- we must not -- or that we can't try to cooperate on crucial issues when our interests coincide -- we must.
 But to think we can return to the strategic harmony of the 1970's is an illusion. China and the U.S. can have strategic harmony when they have a shared enemy, but not when they try to work together on the basis of shared values. There are too few of those. The best we can do is manage our differences, and try to make China's emergence as a power less bumpy rather than more. But bumpy it will be.
 For now, trade is the strongest bond holding the U.S.-China relationship together. But Kissinger and Zhou were right from the start: This is a relationship that can't be built on underwear alone.

He Who Has Pulpit Preaches

BYLINE: By WILLIAM C. RHODEN 

 BODY:
BEFORE Mike Tyson ever laid a glove on Peter McNeeley last night, the former heavyweight champion from the Brownsville section of Brooklyn unleashed a two-fisted attack on the news media last week.
Tyson, who served three years in prison for a rape conviction, called one writer an assassin and referred to members of the media, in so many words, as vultures feeding on the misfortunes of others. 
 The same day Tyson unleashed his verbal attack in Las Vegas, Nev., Gene Atkins, a tightly wound but congenial defensive back for the Miami Dolphins, expressed his displeasure in more concrete way in Florida: He floored a reporter with a body slam.
Atkins objected to a column that Jason Cole had written three days earlier in The Fort Lauderdale Sun-Sentinel. The column was about Atkins's renegotiated contract and quoted an unnamed Dolphin teammate wondering why Atkins, a newcomer to the team, had received special treatment.
Tyson's outburst and Atkins's body block reflects a growing tension in sports between "them" -- athletes, coaches and agents -- and "us" -- the journalists who cover them.
My concern is not over the loss of access, not about confrontation. It's whether there is any merit in the mounting charges of unfairness, bias and whatever-it-takes journalism.
Outside the mainstream there is a heated, multifaceted debate about Tyson among African-Americans, among women, among nearly everyone. Some against him, but many backing him.
Yet the prevailing representation casts Tyson as a demon and calls for him to repent. There have been similar, though less strident, calls for Darryl Strawberry of the Yankees to apologize.
To whom? For what? And who sits in judgment?
The majority of journalists who cover baseball, football, basketball and boxing find themselves in an unusual Wonderland in which black and Hispanic males are the innovators, the celebrities to be dealt with largely on their own terms.
Instead, the media insist on their terms, on ascribing mainstream values to an industry that is largely made of people who come from the working class at best and often from economically deprived backgrounds.
Much of the animus between "them" and "us" stems from an inability to equitably reconcile those two worlds. The rest of it comes from an overwhelming, nonnegotiable need to get The Story. By any means necessary.
In her book "The Journalist and The Murder" (Knopf, 1990), Janet Malcolm writes, harshly, but perceptively: "Every journalist who is not too stupid or too full of himself to notice what is going on knows that what he does is morally indefensible. He is a kind of confidence man, preying on people's vanity, ignorance, or loneliness, gaining their trust and betraying them without remorse."
Alice McDermott, the writer, simply cautioned, "A good writer sells out everybody he knows sooner or later."
As a result of the knockdown, Atkins, who apologized, will surely now be cast as a surly ingrate.
But was he angry about seeing his salary plastered in the newspaper? Could he have actually been concerned about the safety of his family? Doesn't he have the right to privacy?
Sports journalists rarely engage in formal discussions of these issues -- too busy meeting deadlines, traipsing from one event to the next. We are thousands of nomads, traveling in small bands, each with its own set of rules and regulations. Some of us shoot and ask questions later, some of us never shoot, some of us never ask.
What is troubling about the tension is not simply the obliteration of privacy but the underlying rationale for treading on privacy. In sports, we often reduce athletes to objects who -- as objects -- forfeit their right to privacy.
And because they use their bodies and physical skills to make a living, their work is deemed less important. Thus their performances, their skills, can be mocked and derided in clever, entertaining ways.
In any event, the athlete has no commensurate vehicle through which to rebut. Deion Sanders has his buckets of water; Bret Saberhagen has his solution of bleach and water. Tyson limits access to selected members of the media.
Sometime soon, athletes might exploit the information superhighway by making their case directly to fans via the Internet, effectively circumventing mainstream media outlets. But meanwhile, the gap in understanding between "them" and "us" widens. Neither side understands the other, both are stuck in a mode of muscle-flexing.
But while the dispute has become more intense and more hostile, it's not new.
As Yogi Berra, the former Yankee, complained in the mid-60's, "Why do I have to talk to all these guys who make $6,000 a year when I make $40,000 a year?"

HEADLINE: MUTUAL FUNDS: FUNDS WATCH;
A Squeeze In Junk Bonds

BYLINE: By CAROLE GOULD 

 BODY:
JUNK bonds are generally not attractive, with the exception of emerging-market debt, Susan Belden wrote recently in the No-Load Fund Analyst, a newsletter published in Orinda, Calif.
The yield for unrated -- hence, junk -- bonds has been running three to four percentage points above that for 10-year Treasury notes, to account for their greater risk. Junk-bond yields now average about 10 percent, and 10-year Treasury yields are about 6.5 percent. 
 But that spread is not particularly big by standards of the last decade. It is greater than in the early 1980's, before the leveraged-buyout boom, but lower than in the subsequent crash in the junk-bond market, when spreads exceeded nine percentage points. Given the risk of a recession or at least some slowdown in economic growth, junk bonds are not very appealing now, Ms. Belden concluded.
But bonds of emerging markets -- also in the junk category -- have yields of more than 14 percent. Latin American issues could be very volatile in the short term, Ms. Belden said, but there is considerable potential for attractive long-term returns.
For long-term investors who can ride out declines in the market, she recommends the Scudder Emerging Markets Income Fund.
 
Too Little, Too Late?
A majority of employed Americans believe that they will be forced to continue working after they reach retirement age, according to findings of a recent poll by Roper Starch Worldwide for Kemper Financial Services. The main reasons cited: They are not saving enough, and Social Security will not make up for the shortfall.
 The poll, of 2,086 Americans, offered hints for younger workers. When asked to give advice to younger generations about saving for retirement, many retirees suggested that they start saving early and take advantage of company retirement plans.
 Among all respondents, the preferred retirement saving choices were 401(k) plans, 52 percent; savings accounts, 44 percent; mutual funds, 40 percent; life insurance, 39 percent, and Keogh plans or individual retirement accounts, 39 percent. Respondents could list more than one choice.

HEADLINE: The World;
A Global Guage of Greased Palms

BYLINE: By Barbara Crossette 

 BODY:
A German engineer sent to eastern India to help set up a factory a few years ago was honored when officials visited his home and admired his stereo and other imported items. But what they wanted to talk about was money: illegal "commissions" to insure that the project would start. He turned them down and went home to Europe to report to his company. In his absence, his house was stripped of valuables worth about what he had refused to pony up in bribes.
 At the World Bank and in boardrooms everywhere, such stories are legion. Several years ago, Peter Eigen, a former World Bank director in Africa and Latin America, decided enough was enough. He united business leaders, politicians and academics from different countries around a common purpose: curbing the increasingly rampant corruption stunting the development of poor countries. 
 In May 1993 Transparency International, a Berlin-based watchdog organization, was born of that initiative. It has been working on two fronts: helping interested citizens set up national chapters of Transparency International -- there are now more than 40 -- and compiling an annual international corruption index. The first was released this summer.
 The 1995 index is a "poll of polls," drawing on seven published surveys, which were analyzed by Johann Graf Lambsdorff, an economist at Gottingen University in Germany. It is comprehensive on Asia, where, paradoxically, Transparency International has not found many takers for its workshops or affiliation, and very short on Africa, where corruption also flourishes but many corporations do not venture and so risk analysts do not follow. Local groups there will help the organization compile future surveys, says Karen Hussman, a program officer at Transparency International's Berlin headquarters.
 For browsers, the list has a surprise or two. Singapore, for example, is perceived internationally to be a lot less corrupt than the United States. The iron hand of Lee Kuan Yew, better known for destroying political opponents, has come down hard on the corrupt because, Mr. Lee says, the tiny country with no natural resources has to rely on its good name to remain a banking and technology center.
 Mid-ranking Hong Kong, on the edge of notoriously corrupt Southeast Asia, has been watched over by a British colonial police force and a court system not easily bought. In 1997, however, the colony reverts to China, which figures on the 1995 list as the second-most corrupt country. Future indexes will bear watching. BARBARA CROSSETTE

HEADLINE: Middle Class Works Overtime to Stay Afloat;
Income Gap Children

 BODY:
To the Editor:
 I was happy to see "Rich Nation, Poor Children" (editorial, Aug. 15), on the plight of poor children in America, a plight worse than that in 15 of 17 other industrial countries. 
 You do not mention a crucial finding of the Luxembourg Income Study: the income gap between poor families with children and affluent families with children. That gap is greater by far in the United States than in any other country studied.
 All these statistics are generated by income only. They do not take into account health insurance or any other facet of the social safety net that is so secure in Europe and so lacking (and getting more so) here. The income gap, which the party in power seems determined to widen further, is more significant than comparison of figures. Switzerland, for instance, has very high incomes among its well-off population, but its poorer families have relatively high incomes too.
 Israel and Ireland, whose poor children live in families with incomes even lower than our own poor, have much smaller gaps between rich and poor.
 Those who do not believe that capitalism and democracy are best served by a growing population of the uneducated, ill fed and ill clothed must speak out. Those of us favored by society have the power to change things. We cannot let ourselves off the hook.

What the Song Means

 BODY:
To the Editor:
 David Frum (Op-Ed, Aug. 14) offers as an example of 1950's "hostility to the new mass middle class" that "Pete Seeger complained in one of his songs that they lived in 'boxes made of ticky tacky,' and people who flew over them on their way to Europe emphatically agreed." 
 The song was written by Malvina Reynolds, not Pete Seeger, but neither songwriter deserves to be dragged into guilt by association.
 Ms. Reynolds's song satirizes the conformity urged on Americans during post-World War II expansion. Only by twisting its meaning beyond recognition can it be equaled with hostility to the middle class itself.
 Mr. Frum attempts to reduce criticism of the increasing gap between rich and poor in America to a matter of snobbery. By this method, political issues disappear, and all that is left is personal.

HEADLINE: NEIGHBORHOOD REPORT: HARLEM;
The Pathmark Wars, Part Three

BYLINE: By JENNIFER KINGSON BLOOM

 BODY:
Starting last year, the battleground was 125th Street: local retailers fought tooth and nail -- without success -- to stop Pathmark from building a superstore. Then the scene shifted to Springfield Gardens, Queens: last week the City Council approved a plan for a Pathmark store, but angry local store owners have not given up their fight.
Now Pathmark has returned to Harlem with a proposal to build a store on 145th Street between Bradhurst and Eighth Avenues -- and local supermarket owners are up in arms. They have hired the same consultant who led the struggle against the 125th Street market, and they are trying to persuade city officials that one of their number should be allowed to put up a market on the site, not Pathmark. 
 A Pathmark spokesman, Stan Sorkin, said the company is "in the initial stages of trying to get the site approved." Most of the land, a rubbly lot with four long-condemned brick buildings in one corner, is owned by the city. Asked why his company wants a second store in Harlem, Mr. Sorkin said: "We are interested in sites in New York City that meet the criteria of population, disposable income and size of property."
A spokeswoman for the Department of Housing Preservation and Development said that Pathmark officials had met with the agency. And members of Community Board 10 said they will debate Pathmark's request for a zoning change next month. The board has questioned Pathmark on such topics as traffic and parking. "Because of what happened with 125th Street, it's going to draw a lot of attention," said Barbara Askins, chairwoman of the board.
Richard Lipsky, the consultant who organized supermarket owners against the East Harlem Pathmark proposal, said: "Now that we have been told in no uncertain terms that Pathmark is going into 125th Street, we think it would be fair for one of the independent stores to go in there, like a C-town or a Bravo."
Councilwoman C. Virginia Fields, who represents north Harlem and has met with Mr. Lipsky, said she hoped to avoid another long battle over a Pathmark by including the business community and local developers in the early planning stages. "We are going to work this one out," Ms. Fields said. (For a roll call of the City Council's Pathmark vote in Queens, see page 21.)
One of the attractions of the 145th Street site for a supermarket developer is the Bradhurst project, under which the city is renovating 2,200 abandoned apartments in the neighborhood for low- and moderate-income residents. The 145th site itself is among the locations scheduled to be redeveloped under another urban renewal plan.
On 145th Street, some residents were enthusiastic about the idea of a new Pathmark. "That's good for the neighborhood," said Sallh Mohammed, who owns a small convenience store across the street from the proposed site. An assistant, Raul Mojica, agreed. "We don't need another C-town," he said. JENNIFER KINGSON BLOOM

HEADLINE: MAKING IT WORK;
Reading the Hidden City

BYLINE: By MICHAEL COOPER

 BODY:
TO Hope Cooke, New York is a palimpsest. The word, from the Greek, describes a parchment that has been inscribed and erased several times, still bearing hints of old, faded messages. As the city builds and rebuilds itself, barely legible remnants of its past are left behind. Those remnants -- the faded signs, anomalous buildings and crooked streets -- are the clues that Ms. Cooke, a self-described urban historian, tries to decipher.
 Ms. Cooke herself is something of a palimpsest. In her 55 years she has been a debutante, a princess, a queen, a mother, a walking tour guide, a teacher and an author. 
I've learned that it's really important to be terribly attentive to where I am, wherever it is, because if you get numb to space, numb to habitat, you don't live wisely or well" said Ms. Cooke, whose discoveries of New York's spaces was published this spring in her "Seeing New York: History Walks for Armchair and Footloose Travelers" (Temple University Press).
 Raised by wealthy relatives on the Upper East Side, she graduated from Sarah Lawrence College in 1963 and instantly became the heroine of a national fairy tale when she married the Crown Prince of the tiny Himalayan kingdom of Sikkim. Eventually, she became Sikkim's Queen. But the characters in this fairy tale did not live happily ever after. After 10 years, Ms. Cooke's marriage shattered. Then came uprisings, with thousands of Sikkimese protesting the monarchy and besieging the palace. After the tumult, Sikkim was annexed by India.
 Ms. Cooke returned to New York, a city that because of her privileged but highly circumscribed childhood, she hardly knew. "When I was little, I thought the Grand Central building at the end of Park Avenue was the end of the earth," she recalls. "The place where ships fell off."
 Back from Sikkim -- a single mother with two children to raise -- she found herself fighting a powerful sense of dislocation. "I needed grounding for my feet," she recalled over lunch in the backyard of her Brooklyn brownstone. "I needed roots, I needed to learn about my surroundings."
 So she began exploring the city, walking widely and reading broadly. She studied the waves of immigration that shaped the Lower East Side: from the Canarsie Indians to the Irish, to the Jews of Eastern Europe, to the Chinese. "Going around the Lower East Side," she said, "you often get some old union organizer who can tell you about pre-reform labor, reform and the rollbacks of reform. In Chatham Square you can see steam coming out of every vent," a sure marker of illegal sweatshops.
 One neighborhood she finds especially fascinating is downtown Flushing, which she thinks of as a miniature pan-Asia. Chinese and Korean merchants sell red-bean popsicles and ginseng root on Main Street, just steps from Taiwanese banks. On Union Street, intricate Japanese kimonos are offered, while just east on Bowne Street, Hindus worship at the Gujarati Temple only yards from the Sikh Gurdwara, another place of worship.
 In "Seeing New York," she maps 14 walking tours ranging over Manhattan, Brooklyn and Queens -- from Victorian Brooklyn Heights to Dominican Washington Heights.
 "In lower Manhattan, to recreate the early colonial era when you're face to face with banks, you have to become quite a good story teller," she said. "It's more like radio than television." It is easier when the subject is Brownstone Brooklyn, with block after block of intact Civil War-era houses.
 One of her favorite neighborhoods is Brooklyn Heights, not far from the home she shares with her husband, Michael Wallace, a history professor at John Jay College of Criminal Justice. She revels in the Heights' "seeming fixity, the lush environs of longer durations and reposeful streets."
 One that has her worried is Ladies Mile, the stretch of Avenue of the Americas from 14th to 23d Streets. At the turn of the century it was city's premiere shopping area for elegant women, with famous emporiums like B. Altman and Siegel-Cooper. But most closed or moved uptown, and the neighborhood declined. Recently, the old buildings have been renovated to house new stores, many of them giants like Bed, Bath and Beyond and Today's Man. Ms. Cooke worries, though, that few of these have their roots in the city. Most are indistinguishable from their suburban mall branches, a fact she finds especially distressing, and the bulk of their profits go elsewhere. "We've written off the notion of New York as a production town," she said, adding that the city has also lost more than 100,000 retailing jobs since 1965. "It's a little scary if you write off consumption as well."
 Since returning from Sikkim two decades ago, she has never tired of scouring the city. "I began to see the connections between things," she said. "If you learn about the struggle over Tompkins Square, from the 1830's on, the present struggle over Tompkins Square makes more sense."
 A flashpoint of that struggle -- among squatters, the poor, young professionals, the police and anarchists -- was the 1988 clash over a curfew for Tompkins Square Park. Ms. Cooke said worse riots erupted in 1874, when 10,000 unemployed workers battled mounted police officers.
 Even before that, she notes, the neighborhood was divided between the rich who lived in town houses on the park's north side and who scorned tenement dwellers to the south, calling their homes "rag pickers' row."
 Ms. Cooke enjoys the nitty-gritty of neighborhood disputes that have shaped the city: for example, how the battle between the Pierponts and the Hickses over how to develop Brooklyn in the 19th century helped define the borough's present downtown.
 "That is always the illumination: to find the context," she said in her slightly whispery voice, which still retains a light Scottish accent she inherited from a nanny. "Once you bring past to present, that turns into an epiphany."
 
CITYSCAPE
 
Cooke's Tour
In 22 years of walking the city's streets and researching their history, Hope Cooke has found some favorite nooks and crannies:
Minetta Brook An underground stream that runs beneath Greenwich Village and that can be seen in a glass tube in the lobby of 2 Fifth Avenue.
Stuyvesant Street Cutting diagonally from Ninth to 10th Streets in the East Village, it is the city's only street on a true east-west axis. It was mapped to the compass points by Peter Stuyvesant's great-grandson, Petrus, before the city laid its own grid to conform to the shape of Manhattan Island.
Secret Tunnel This once connected the old Police Headquarters, at 240 Centre Street, to a walnut-paneled tavern on Grand Street in Little Italy.

HEADLINE: The Comfort Zones Of the Young, Black Professional

BYLINE: By MONTE WILLIAMS

 BODY:
A STEPHANIE MILLS song washes over the room's exposed brick walls as clusters of denim-clad people strain to be heard over the din. Every bar stool is occupied, every corner clogged, forcing people headed upstairs to the dining room to navigate the crush.
 The Shark Bar on a typical Friday night. 
Standing at the far end of the softly lit bar is Michael Shanks, 34, a municipal bond accountant. "I haven't missed a Friday night in four months," Mr. Shanks said of the Upper West Side restaurant, a mecca for young black professionals. "I feel a sense of warmth here. I feel at home around my people." He paused, grasping for the right words. "I feel fulfilled."
 For many middle-class blacks, the bars, restaurants and cafes that cater to them are more than places to meet friends before catching the latest release at the multiplex, more than spots to find next weekend's date or a future spouse. Jazz spots, salons and the dozens of black reading groups that are popping up throughout the city are more than social venues.
 They are havens from the mainstream world that many young African-Americans and their parents fought so hard to enter. For some successful blacks, seeing people like themselves, walking examples of civil rights progress, helps to sustain them in an outside world from which they often feel alienated.
 Such settings represent "a retreat to a comfortable and nurturing place," said Ellis Cose, author of "The Rage of a Privileged Class" (HarperCollins, 1994), which argues that although the ranks of the black middle class have grown rapidly in the past two decades, its members are frustrated by glass ceilings in corporations, racial slights from strangers and discrimination in housing and other walks of life.
 The city's rising black middle class is substantial, even if its presence is often obscured by the focus on underclass poverty and crime. In 1990, 18 percent of working, non-Hispanic blacks in the city between the ages of 25 and 65 held managerial or professional jobs, according to Andrew A. Beveridge, a Queens College sociologist who conducted an analysis of the 1990 census for The New York Times. Another 28.7 percent held technical, sales and administrative support positions. And 30 percent were living in households with incomes of $50,000 or more, many of them in Queens, where the median household income of blacks exceeds that of whites.
 Despite such inroads, for many blacks, the workplace is a source of racial unease. "One of the things that struck me as I was researching 'Rage' was that blacks kept saying how hard they had to work to make white people comfortable around them at work," Mr. Cose said. "They had to present a face that was not their natural face. A lot of black men, for instance, told me they had to be more meek than normal. If they were assertive or loud at all, people would perceive them as somehow stereotypical or perhaps even violent."
 It should surprise no one, then, that many young upwardly mobile blacks --sometimes called buppies (a label rejected by some because it connotes intraracial stratification) -- choose to spend happy hour with other blacks. And it's not just happy hour. There are black ski and scuba-diving groups and black bulletin boards on the Internet and mega-parties like the "Summer Sizzler at the Roxy," a July bash that drew more than 3,500 men and women from 10 black professional groups.
 Of course, affluent blacks and whites do not lead completely bifurcated post-work lives. "It's not as segregated as you might think," said Nelson George, the cultural critic, adding that at most predominately black establishments, there will be at least a smattering of whites. "These are people who hang out with black friends at these places or are just down with blacks."
 Still, says Lawrence Otis Graham, a black, Harvard-educated lawyer and a frequent commentator on race relations, when black professionals get together, they often choose to do so in "places that are accustomed to serving a large black clientele."
 Why is that? Mr. Graham, the author of "Member of the Club: Reflections on Life in a Racially Polarized World" (HarperCollins, 1995), asserts that based on his experience, blacks not in the company of whites run the risk of being ignored or treated rudely or seated next to the bathroom or kitchen in many of the city's top restaurants.
 But Earl Caldwell, the former Daily News columnist, has another explanation for the popularity of places like B. Smith's and the Shark Bar. They represent something "exotic" to younger blacks raised in the era of integration, he said. "The music is different, the language is different," he said. "Isn't it just more exciting?"
 For Alison N. King, 34, a television producer and consultant, being a member of a black salon offers a gratifying sense of community as well as a venue for intellectual discourse. "It's good to know that there are others like yourself out there," said Ms. King, a member of the Brooklyn Black Belt Salon Brunch, which brings together Fort Greene and Clinton Hill artists and professionals to schmooze and discuss everything from fashion and literature to affirmative action. "Often, you think you're the only one out there with certain thoughts and experiences."
 Not that successful blacks are a homogenous lot. There exists, says Mr. George, "an internal gamesmanship" based on educational and social pedigree. Second- and third-generation members of the black middle class -- those who vacationed on Martha's Vineyard as children, attended debutante balls as teen-agers and, later, graduated from exclusive colleges and universities -- may not fully welcome the newly arrived.
 "You get a certain vibe from some of the Harvard and Yale blacks," said Mr. George, author of "Buppies, B-Boys, Baps and Bohos: Notes on a Post-Soul Black Culture" (HarperCollins, 1993). "But then there is also a cockiness among the up-by-the-bootstraps buppies. Those who came up from the streets will pull rank on the people who have the pedigree. They won't claim to be more authentically black, but they'll say I had to go through so much more than you, so therefore I am stronger."
 For many decades, Manhattan has been the primary after-hours playground for black professionals. In the 60's, lawyers, doctors and politicians sipped cocktails at Frank's Restaurant, the Flash Inn, Jock's Place and the Red Rooster, Harlem restaurants and bars that closed as accommodations opened up to blacks downtown. In the 70's and 80's, the Cellar and Mikel's, now defunct rhythm and blues and jazz clubs on the Upper West Side, were the haunts.
 Manhattan remains the social nexus for black professionals, although Fort Greene, often called the home of the new black renaissance, continues to grow in popularity and is now drawing black revelers from beyond Brooklyn's borders.
 From a salon to soul food restaurants, herewith a look at a few of the places the city's black professionals find one another and themselves.
 
SALONS, POETRY READINGS, BOOK DISCUSSION GROUPS
 The topic was media coverage of African-Americans. There were three featured panelists, but Ann Tripp, the 98.7 KISS-FM radio reporter, owned the floor at this Sunday afternoon assembly of the Brooklyn Black Belt Salon Brunch. "Why is it that every time there is a story about affirmative action in the news, blacks are called upon to defend it?" she asked. "Why don't they find white women, Asians, Latinos to defend it? They've benefited from it!"
 A 30ish woman offered an "Amen." Someone else encouraged Ms. Tripp to "Tell it!" And so she continued. She noted in stories about Adarand Constructors v. Pena, the recent Supreme Court decision that imposed strict constitutional limits on affirmative action, she saw only blacks interviewed on the news. "The name was Pena, folks. He was not a black man."
 Ms. Tripp also fumed about what she called excessive media coverage of black male celebrities accused of crimes, from Mike Tyson to Michael Jackson, and now O. J. Simpson.
 "If you black women would turn off the O. J. trial," she said, "you could put CNBC out of business. I don't know why you're watching it. O. J. would rather die than date you."
 Over lobsters, crab cakes and salads at the Chesapeake Oyster Grill in Fort Greene, the largely female crowd, ranging in age from post-grad to sub-50, blasted the news media for bias. In the past, entertainment and literature as well as art, politics and community affairs have been discussed.
 The salon was born five years ago after three record publicists shared a cab from Manhattan to Fort Greene only to discover that they lived within blocks of one another.
 "We realized that we lived so close together, but we had never been to one another's house," said Jacqueline Rhinehart, 37, national director of publicity for Arista Records. "We wondered, 'Well, who else lives in the hood?' "
 The initial gathering was small. But eight people soon mushroomed into 60, and the salon moved from informal potlucks in individual homes to large brunches in local black-owned restaurants. Now 1,000 names appear on the salon's mailing list.
 Entertainment is included in the $10 fee. (A poet and comedian appeared at the Oyster Grill.) The brunches draw an average of 100 people. But salon organizers say they do not make a profit.
 "This gives us an opportunity to learn more about each other, share viewpoints and make new friends," said Gwendolyn Quinn, 34, a salon organizer. "If you know and respect your neighbors, I think it makes for a much healthier environment, socially and economically."
 Though African-American salons are rare, black reading groups have been growing rapidly, according to the owners of several black bookstores.
 With 85 members, the Literary Society may be the largest black reading group in the city. Founded by Lana Turner, a Harlem real estate broker, in 1982, this group of lawyers, educators, social workers and doctors meet monthly. They assemble in one another's homes and, so, feel blessed that only 20 to 25 people show up at most meetings. The group is not looking for new recruits. "When you have 25 clear-thinking, articulate people at a meeting and everyone wants to talk, it gets difficult," Ms. Turner said.
 Women outnumber men, 7 to 1. Why this is is subject to debate. But Ms. Turner said, laughing, "The three or four who show up do carry the banner for their gender."
 At a recent meeting of the Brooklyn-based Awareness Book Club, David Lamb, a 29-year-old Park Slope resident, found himself doing just that -- carrying the banner for black men.
 Bell Hooks's book "Ain't I a Woman?" (South End Press, 1981) was on the agenda. There was consensus on some points, among them that white feminists tend to romanticize black women's "strength" and that black women are often asked to choose between black nationalism and feminism.
 But Mr. Lamb, a lawyer who recently self-published a novel ("Do Platanos Go With Collard Greens?") took issue with the author's contention that slavery, while wretched for both sexes, was worse for women because not only did they endure savage beatings, but they were sometimes sexually exploited by slave owners and overseers.
 "I think it's dangerous to get into who suffered more," Mr. Lamb said. "Black men were sexually exploited too. They were used to breed. They were bucks." Sometimes, he said, "They were forced to have sex with their own mothers and sisters." A momentary hush blanketed the room.
 Seven months ago, when a friend told Mr. Lamb about the reading group, he jumped at the chance to become a member. "I'm the only black male attorney at my law firm," he said. "And that's a lonely position to be in. At the book club, there's camaraderie with other blacks. It's a way of renewing your spirit."
 There's no shortage of spirit at the Brooklyn Moon Cafe in Fort Greene. Bohemians -- and buppies with "boho" souls -- clog the small, seven-month-old coffee house on Friday nights, when the main course is open-mike poetry.
 Those not early enough to get a bistro table sit side by side in folding chairs. A few pile onto slightly frayed Victorian sofas. But many are left standing, not a few outside peering over the baseball caps, dreadlocks and braids of those who beat them in.
 David Larrick Smith, 24, owner of an in-line skating school, is a regular.
 "People up there are expressing the frustrations of the race," he said, nodding to the front of the room where twentysomething poets and would-be bards recited original verse about love, racism, revolution, O. J. and black women's thighs. "You hear other people express how you feel, and you want to scream, 'I can relate!' There's a healing process that takes place."
 Recently, Brad Walrond, 24, a director of a youth program, recited a poem that captures the essence of the place: "People of Color Affirming Each Other."
 It is so beautiful to see people of color affirming each other
 I'm not waiting for ivory-tainted fame to come a'knocking at my door
 I feel famous now cause I can hear the glorious sound of ebony talking back to me, saying, 'Go on baby, Go on.'
 The raucous, patented laughter and spirited applause
 Jovial injunction and adulation that resound in a mighty chorus
 of a circle that cannot be broken . . .
 "There's a need to be nurtured by your own," Mr. Walrond later said. Booing is verboten at Brooklyn Moon.
 
MUSIC, CLUBS AND RESTAURANTS
 Dance clubs may be on the wane. But sometimes the dancing happens anyway.
 Tuesday is funk night at Cafe Wha?. The dimly lit cellar in the West Village that draws predominantly white crowds most evenings attracts black professionals in their 20's and 30's who come to lose themselves in the retro-funk of the Slam Clinic, which plays old favorites by groups like the Ohio Players, Parliament-Funkadelic, and Earth Wind & Fire. Clubgoers are transported to a 70's basement house party, a place, in the words of the emcee, William Stephenson, "where your Afro shriveled all up" from dance-induced perspiration.
 There is no dance floor, so clubgoers make do, moving with abandon in the narrow aisles, forcing waitresses to snake between shimmying hips, bobbing heads and flailing arms (the latter almost touch the wires that traverse the low ceilings). Surprisingly, management encourages the dancing.
 "The more they dance, the more they drink," Mr. Stephenson explained. "It's that simple."
 There is no dancing on Sunday at Chaz & Wilson, a cavernous Upper West Side supper club, when the R & B band, Ron Grant & Friends, shares the stage with budding performers during open mike night. Located on the northwest corner of 79th and Amsterdam, the usually predominantly white restaurant becomes a de facto Ebony Fashion Fair. Beautiful women with aerobicized bodies sport elegant silk pants suits, gold lame halters and dresses that are either very long or very, very short.
 "I date black women exclusively," said a 33-year-old engineer, who insisted on anonymity. "Why would I go to a white club?" The celebrities are another draw. Salt, of Salt-N-Pepa fame, and Kevin Willis, of the Miami Heat, were recently spotted. Knicks players are said to be regulars.
 There are a growing number of restaurants that draw largely black crowds, most of them owned, or co-owned, by blacks. Places like Kwanzaa, Pepper's and Mekka have opened in the last few years but B. Smith's and the Shark Bar have continued to attract legions of black professionals from across the city and neighboring suburbs for nine and four years respectively.
 Sam Allen, 34, a real estate broker, is a Shark Bar partisan. "The crowd is professional, but they're down to earth, not snobbish and pretentious like the crowd at B. Smith's," he said.
 Herbert Moreira-Brown, 40, a public school teacher, explained his enduring affection for B. Smith's. "We treat one another as individuals," he said, looking at the throng of people, overwhelming black and male and handsomely suited, at the bar. "I don't feel like I have to prove myself here the way I do when I walk into a white restaurant. Here, I'm not a black man, I'm a man."
Cyber-Hangouts With a Distinctly Urban Feel
 Sign on to New York Online, the nation's largest black-owned computer bulletin board system, and arguably its hippest, and suddenly a transit token materializes on the screen, followed by a digitized jazz trumpet riff. It doesn't take a techie to realize this is a cyberspace community with a decidedly urban flavor.
 The subway is a metaphor for New York Online, a service focusing on the arts, created as a bridge between people of different cultures and races, the same way the subway connects people in the city's diverse precincts "who might not otherwise meet," explained Omar Wasow, 24. Mr. Wasow, with fellow Stanford grad, Peta Hoyes, 25, founded the company in a Fort Greene brownstone a year and a half ago.
 But it is also a way for tristate black professionals to connect through black-themed chat rooms, to discuss, say, the recent Whitney Museum exhibit on African-American men or reactions to the movie "Panther" or black conservatives. Forty percent of New York Online's 1,100 users are black, 50 percent female, and most between the ages of 18 and 35.
 There are at least 100 black-owned or black-oriented bulletin board systems on the Internet, according to Essence magazine, which, along with Shade, Vibe, Paper and Out, are published on New York Online.
 John Knight Smith, 28, talks politics with other African-Americans and keeps abreast of upcoming black social and professional events using New York Online's black chat rooms, Society and Black Talk, as well as America Online's Ebony Room.
 Users sometimes get together off-line, said Mr. Smith, a Park Slope marketing coordinator and married father of three, who recently attended an "Ebony Room" party aboard the Mystique yacht as it cruised around Manhattan.
 "Sometimes people meet just to satisfy a sense of curiosity," Mr. Smith said. "There's also a lot of networking at these events. People bring their portfolios and hand out product and service information. There's a lot of talent out there."
 Meeting off-line has advantages, Mr. Smith added. Online services like America Online, which reach a mass audience, leave users vulnerable to race-baiting from outsiders.
 "Sometimes people with a screen name like 'hateblacks' will come into the Ebony Room just to be disruptive," Mr. Smith said. "Others will come in and say, 'I don't understand why you need this room.' Anybody with a computer has access."

Meatloaf and the 50's Style In New Village Eating Place
 E.J.'s Luncheonettes have proved to be popular gathering spots for young singles on the Upper East Side and Upper West Side. Now, the owners hope that a new outlet in the West Village, at 432 Avenue of the Americas, between Ninth and 10th Streets, will become a mecca for neighborhood residents. 
 "We found another strong residential community to open our neighborhood restaurant," said Howard Eisenberg, one of five partners who own the 50's-diners, and the manager of the newest one, which opened on July 27.
 E.J.'s serves large portions of dinner food (an array of breakfast items as well as home-style meatloaf, roast turkey platters, grilled fresh fish and salads) at prices ranging from $3 for two eggs, toast and home fries to $14 for New York strip steak.
 
Low-Interest Loans for Owners Of Historic Homes in Queens
 The New York Landmarks Conservancy has $1.5 million in low-interest loans available for owners of historic residences in Queens.
 "It's a five-borough program that has been going on for at least six years," said Joshua Schaff, a conservancy spokesman, "but residents in Queens have not been taking advantage." The borough's historic districts are Ridgewood, Hunters Point, Jackson Heights, Richmond Hill, Steinway, Old Astoria and Kew Gardens. The loans carry interest rates starting at 3 percent and can be used for exterior restoration and repairs.
 There are no income limits for applicants, Mr. Schaff said, although it is hoped that most of the money will be lent to low- and middle-income residents of the historic districts.
 
Cluster of Italian Restaurants Grows on West 44th Street
 An Italian restaurant, L'Allegria, opened recently on the northwest corner of 44th Street and Ninth Avenue, in what is becoming a small outpost of Italian cuisine.
 L'Allegria, in 2,500 square feet of space, serves fare like a salad of arugula, raicchio and endive ($4) and lombata di vitello alla griglia (grilled vel chop, $14.50). The pastas are all $7.50.
 Nicola Coladonato, the owner and chef, sold his other restaurant, Mangia e Bevi, at 53d Street and Ninth Avenue, three months ago.
 Opposite L'Allegria on West 44th and Ninth for four years; five weeks ago, it put up a large maroon awning that says, "44 Southwest Italian Continental."
 Just a few yards east across Ninth Avenue, a pizzeria, Don Giovanni, is scheduled to open in about three weeks, at 358 West 44th Street.

HEADLINE: WHAT'S DOING IN;
Cleveland

BYLINE: By JENNIFER STOFFEL; JENNIFER STOFFEL is the author of "The Cleveland Discovery Guide."

 BODY:
When a housewarming party is a decade in the making, it has to be pretty spectacular to live up to the hype. But the festivities surrounding the opening of the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame and Museum in Cleveland over Labor Day weekend may just be equal to the task.
For one thing, the party music will be provided by the likes of Bruce Springsteen and Martha and the Vandellas. And the museum that's being celebrated dramatically transforms Cleveland's skyline. 
 The $84-million building, designed by I. M. Pei, hugs the Lake Erie shoreline. Its striking pyramid-shaped tent of concrete, glass and steel rises over the lobby and its concrete wings jut into the harbor. With plans proposed and dropped over a 10-year period, fund-raising efforts that faltered, and even talk at one point of selecting another city, it is no wonder that the opening has inspired a party that will cover the Labor Day weekend.
The museum is the most stunning structure in a recent spate of downtown development. It joins the Gateway complex, with its baseball stadium and arena completed last year, as the city's newest attractions.
For maps and information contact the Convention and Visitors Bureau of Greater Cleveland, (800) 321-1004.
 
Events
 Opening ceremonies for the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame and Museum, Sept. 1 to 4, will include a Rockin' in the Streets procession starting from downtown at 11:30 A.M., Sept. 1, culminating in a 12:30 P.M. ribbon-cutting ceremony at the museum, and a concert, Sept. 2, starting 7:30 P.M. at Cleveland Municipal Stadium, with Bruce Springsteen, Chuck Berry, Little Richard, Al Green, The Pretenders, Melissa Etheridge, Jon Bon Jovi, Aretha Franklin, Dr. Dre, John Mellencamp, Martha and the Vandellas, among others. Ticket prices range from $30 to $540. Call Ticketmaster at (216) 241-5555.
The collection to be opened at the 150,000-square-foot museum includes film, videos, excerpts from radio programs, photographs, posters and interactive computer displays, creating what the museum is heralding as the definitive archive of rock. The collection of rock artifacts includes the original equipment from Sam Phillips' Sun Records Memphis recording studio, one of Jimi Hendrix's Fender Stratocasters and John Lennon's Sergeant Pepper uniform.

HEADLINE: INVESTING IT;
The Doubts About Japan's New Surge

BYLINE: By KEN BROWN 

 BODY:
TO hear some describe it, Japan's stock market may have turned a corner this week. But many analysts say the signs are in no way conclusive.
For five long years, ever since the Nikkei began its descent from 38,916 as the real estate bubble burst, bank loans went bad and the Liberal Democratic Party was ousted from power, American investors have hoped for a turnaround in that nation's huge stock market. But no luck. 
 So far this year alone, for instance, the $500 million Japan Fund is down 12 percent, in dollar terms.
Still, last week did provide some grounds for hope. Thanks to concerted action by the central banks of Germany, Japan and the United States, the yen fell from 93.9 to the dollar on Aug. 11 to 97.61 on Friday. The news sent the Nikkei up 4.1 percent in just one day, Wednesday.
For dollar-based investors, the yen's fall also held out the prospect of getting more in Japanese investment for their money. And some believe this summer's bailout of the Cosmo credit union -- the nation's fifth largest -- revealed Japan's resolve to clean up the troubled lending industry.
These and other good signs have drawn investment dollars to Japan. In July, foreigners invested a net 667 billion yen there, according to Salomon Brothers. And for the week ended Wednesday, the assets of the 10 largest United States mutual funds with 40 percent or more of their money invested in Japan inched ahead by $2 million, after asset reductions of $77 million in the previous two weeks alone, according to AMG Data Services.
But skeptics arch their eyebrows at these numbers. "If the market was correcting for a few months and this happens, it is exciting," said Craig Chudler, equities strategist for Salomon Brothers in Japan. "But this has been happening for six years." The Nikkei closed at 18,032 last week -- still less than half its 1989 high. The market would have to push past 21,500, Mr. Chudler said, to prove the slump was over.
And the Nikkei has touched four false bottoms, in April 1990, September 1990, August 1992 and November 1993. Rather than soaring from those spots, each time the market rose just a few thousand points only to fall again.
Nevertheless, individual investors or their fund managers need not shun Japan.
"I do think the weather is changing," said George Foot, a partner at Newgate Management Associates. "Again, no one in their right mind would predict a bottom but you better get ready to get back in Japan because Japan is getting ready to get back to earth after five years of being out of play."
If they are not cowed by the risks and uncertainties, investors might well profit from a cautious, gradual entry into the Japanese market through mutual funds or roughly 30 American depository receipts for Japanese stocks that are actively traded here. A.D.R.'s, which are bought and sold in dollars through American brokerage houses, represent shares of foreign companies and are traded much as stocks are.
"If I were an investor right now starting from zero, I would look to take about 30 percent to 50 percent of my intended position in Japan now and wait with the balance," said Stephen Neville, vice president of Yamaichi International in Canada.
Many solid prospects can be found among Japan's technology stocks, which like their American counterparts are market leaders. Rohm, a semiconductor maker, is up 50 percent this year, for example. David Thomas, who manages the Putnam Asia Pacific Growth Fund, likes Kyocera, which makes coatings for semiconductors. That stock is up 23 percent so far in 1995 -- second only to Nintendo, up 31 percent, as the best performer among Japanese A.D.R.'s.
Many investors are using this pinpoint approach. "I think overseas investors are being very cagey and smart because they are not buying the whole market," Mr. Chudler said. "The latest flows from overseas have been very targeted in the high-tech area."
Dollar-based investors must also realize that, to profit, their Japanese stocks must not only rise, but also outpace any further gains by the dollar against the yen. One strategy, analysts say, is to go with companies in particularly healthy industries, like pharmaceuticals and engineering. Banyu Pharmaceuticals is one example.
Another strategy is to buy exporters. While a falling yen means the shares of these Japanese companies are worth less in dollars, their products become cheaper abroad. Moreover, as the dollar fell below 80 yen in April, many exporters cut their costs greatly in order to remain competitive. With the yen hitting 97.61 to the dollar this week, the profits of these now-lean companies may grow greatly.
Seung Kwak, the lead portfolio manager of the $500 million Japan Fund, is focusing on small and medium-sized exporters like SMC, which makes pneumatic equipment, and large corporations like Hitachi and Canon. Large exporters -- Nikon, Nintendo and NEC, for instance -- also tend to be among the most liquid of Japanese A.D.R.'s.
Nevertheless, many analysts are far from bullish about Japan. They say there are deep problems with the economy, companies and Government, and until these are solved, any rise in the Japanese stock market will be temporary.
There is pessimism to overcome, too. "Until we see some sort of action that overcomes the rather pessimistic perspective of most people -- and a lot of it is psychological -- I suspect the economy is not going to come back very fast," said Hugh Patrick, a professor at Columbia Business School and director of the Center on Japanese Economy and Business.
He said the onus is on the Government to come up with an effective fiscal stimulus package this fall, and that depends in part on whether the current governing coalition falls and elections are held. "In some sense economic activities probably are prisoner of the political process over the next month and a half, two months," Mr. Patrick said.
Others point to the continuing banking crisis in Japan. True, the Government, breaking a longstanding taboo, bailed out the Cosmo credit union after creditors withdrew $915 million. But that's just the tip of the iceberg; the nation's banks have $570 billion of bad loans on their books.
Finally, some of Japan's bullish signs don't stand up to close inspection. Mr. Thomas of Putnam said many international and Asia funds are buying more Japanese stocks in part because other Asian markets are performing poorly or seem risky. And while foreigners bought 667 billion yen worth of Japanese equities in July, Japanese individuals, companies, banks and insurers were net sellers of about 722 billion.
In other words, investors must keep the current rally in perspective. "This is nothing relative to the five- to six-year correction the market is going through," Mr. Chudler said. "This is baby steps. The market is trying to get back up on its feet."

HEADLINE: Connecticut Q&A: Rear Adm. Richard A. Buchanan;
The Submarine Fleet, After the Closures

BYLINE: By ROBERT A. HAMILTON 

 BODY:
SUBMARINE GROUP TWO, two squadrons comprising some two dozen nuclear attack submarines and headquartered at the Naval Submarine Base in Groton, was spared by the Federal Defense Base Closure and Realignment Commission this year.
As a result, Rear Adm. Richard A. Buchanan, its commander, has found himself in charge of all Navy affairs north of Virginia, as one of the few flag officers assigned to the region. 
 Admiral Buchanan graduated from the United States Naval Academy in 1968, and has served on five submarines, including the U.S.S. Ohio, the first of the modern class of ballistic missile submarines.
The Admiral discussed the importance of the Navy in Connecticut, and the future of the submarine force here, during an interview at his office in Groton recently. Following are excerpts from that conversation.
Q: Why do you think the Groton base survived this last round of cuts?
A: There was a recognition that the amount of waterfront property, the amount of capability available in our Atlantic Fleet operational assets was as small as we could go without leaving ourselves vulnerable.
I think specifically, here in Groton, there was a very effective explanation of what this area had in the way of capability. We have the training, the maintenance, and the operational support pieces all in a very compact and efficiently operated facility.
Q. Why was southeastern Connecticut viewed as strategically important in the base review process?
A. One, by virtue of being a day closer to the Mediterranean and a day closer to the northern Atlantic than other Navy bases. We also have the ability to get out to sea with a limited amount of conflicting traffic, which would not be the case in busier port areas.
Q. How much of the Navy's attachment to Groton is nostalgia, since it was the first submarine base?
A. I think there's always some of that that's part of the equation, and I think that's good. This is a very historical site, and I think some of the value of that tradition was recognized. When push comes to shove, and you have no money and something has to go out, that might fall by the wayside. But assuming that you aren't forced to make that decision, it's wonderful to recognize the historic nature of what we possess here.
Q. Will there come a point where it's no longer viable to keep a submarine base here?
A. I don't think so. You never can tell, but Adm. Jeremy M. Boorda, chief of naval operations has said he thinks 55 submarines is the right number for the force. And having that number of submarines means we will need the base in Groton.
Q. With the demise of the cold war, do we need a submarine force?
A. Yes. The submarine is both a covert sensor platform, and a covert weapons launch platform. That means you can do things others don't know you're doing, or be places that others don't know where you are, so they may do things that they don't know are being observed.
We can provide information that others can't gather, whether it's acoustic information, visual information, electronic information or communications information -- and we're doing it around the world.
We also have the ability to launch the Tomahawk land strike missile, the harpoon antiship missile, the torpedo against submarines or surface ships. When you talk about weapons launch you also have to add things like the special forces. The Seals really appreciate our ability to get them in close, covertly.
Q. Has the "silent service" become less silent?
A. There's no question. We are responsible, in the submarine force as we are in the whole military, to market ourselves -- to the Congress, to the taxpayers, so they know they're getting value for their tax dollars. We need to market ourselves to the young people of our country because we need good young men and women to be the sailors and officers of the future, and we need to market ourselves to the sailors and officers of today because we need to have them stay in our business.
Q. Most submarines have a relationship with their namesake cities. Why have you pushed for new relationships with local towns as well?
A. Our partnership program complements their sister city relationships. U.S.S. Dallas, for instance, has a good relationship with the city of Dallas, but that's awfully far away, so it has a relationship with a local community, it sends sailors in to work with citizens, then shows off the ship to these people.
We have partnerships with communities where our people live, ranging from Old Saybrook to Stonington. One of the main benefits of the base realignment and closure process has been that it enhanced the awareness of the community of the Navy in their midst.
Q. What economic impact does the base have on Connecticut?
A. About $1 billion a year, based on data gathering for the base closure process. And some of the benefit goes beyond the money. The submarine business is very technically oriented, so it attracts people to provide support services. Also, our submariners are very interested in furthering their education, so they're taking courses on the base and in the community. All those aspects have a cumulative effect that's very valuable to the state.
Q. Does the community support continue now that the base closure process is over?
A. I think it should, I think it can, and I think it really has to. We need to make sure we never take for granted that the community will be there to support us, and we need to make sure the community doesn't take us for granted.
Q. Is there evidence the base has a significant role in the future of the submarine force?
A. The Navy continues to say Groton is its preferred homeport for the Seawolf, our newest class of submarine, which will be put into service next year. With all of the the technology, the maintenance and training capabilities, as well as the tactical support that's in place here, as well as the shipyard that built the ships (the Electric Boat Company), I think it's the right decision to homeport the three -- hopefully, three -- Seawolfs in Groton.
Q. Was the Navy influenced by the fact that Connecticut offered to pay to dredge the Thames River so the Seawolf could be based here?
A. It was a very generous offer, well-timed, and very much appreciated. Having that as an underpinning as the financial part of this project was helpful. The decision was made on its own merits, however, because we wanted to make it clear to all sites that the Navy is not accepting bribes to bring the Seawolf here. Groton was picked on its merits.
Q. You're recently became the first flag officer in your job to be designated the regional coordinator for the Navy. How does that work?
A. When they made the decision to close the Navy base in Philadelphia, there was no shore facility commander able to take responsibility for the Northeast.
The only operational flag officers north of Norfolk, Va., are myself, and two in Newport, R.I. -- one is the president of the War College and the other is commander of the Naval Undersea Warfare Center, responsible for a lot of research and development and technical initiatives.
I was tasked with the responsibility of taking over shore coordination in New Jersey, New York and the New England states. The responsibilities come from numerous commands -- from the Bureau of Personnel for casualty assistance and funeral honors, from the Bureau of Medicine for medical treatment facilities, from the Judge Advocate General's office where we have general court martial authority, from Naval Sea Systems Command for inspections, and from Facilities Engineering Command for environmental coordination. Then of course we're trying to coordinate with the Reserves and the recruiting offices.
Regionally, we can take advantage of economies of scale, and better utilize and apply our resources. For instance, though I am not yet totally responsible for all of the medical facilities in the Northeast, our hospital commanding officer here in Groton has been working with the hospital commanding officer in Newport, so that specialists in one place can move back and forth.
Since I've taken over, in the middle of the region rather than as far south as Philadelphia, there's been a growing sense of responsibility and coordination and enthusiasm for the job. It hasn't been without some pain, because the staff has been stretched, but they've been very helpful, and I'm hopeful we can ultimately get a couple of extra billets.

HEADLINE: Long Island Q&A: Marlene Post;
Leading Hadassah in Assisting Jewish and Non-Jewish Causes

BYLINE: By LINDA SASLOW 

 BODY:
THROUGHOUT its 83 years Hadassah has become the largest women's Zionist organization in the world and the largest women's volunteer organization in the United States. Hadassah, Hebrew for Esther, was founded in New York in 1912 by Henrietta Szold to provide health care for people in Palestine.
The founders were looking for the name of a Jewish heroine who had done something important for her people. The organization was named after Queen Esther, who saved the Jews in Persia. Hadassah is now comprised of 385,000 volunteer women in 1,500 chapters in all 50 states and Puerto Rico, including 17,000 members on Long Island. 
 In the United States, Hadassah teaches its members and the American public about the needs of Israel and about Jewish traditions in order to provide leadership for the American Jewish community.
Last week in Jerusalem, Marlene Post was installed as the 21st national president of Hadassah. As the organization's national treasurer since 1991, she has led Hadassah in raising more than $80 million.
Committed to programs of medical research, health care and educational development, Hadassah operates its own medical and educational institutions in Israel, including the Hadassah Medical Organization and the Hadassah College of Technology.
Mrs. Post, who lives in Manhasset Hills, was born and raised in Monticello, N.Y., in a traditional Jewish but non-Zionist home. A graduate of the Mount Sinai Hospital School of Nursing and Teachers College of Columbia University, Mrs. Post taught nursing before becoming involved full time in Hadassah. In recent years, her responsibilities in Hadassah have taken her on more than 70 trips to Israel. Like all members and officers of Hadassah, Mrs. Post receives no income for her services.
Q. Israel has changed greatly over the years and now has its own viable economy. Why should Americans give their money to Israel?
A. There's no question that Israel has seen a substantial change in its economy, particularly in the last few years. The reason anyone should give to Israel has less to do with money and more to do with the centrality of Israel for the Jewish people. Although many of us gave large sums of money to build the state and Hadassah has provided large sums to improve the quality of life for the people living there, the real tie has come because every time we give money to Israel, we are building a connection. It gives us a psychological tie to what is basically the Jewish homeland.
Q. How does Hadassah raise so much money?
A. One of the major sources of revenue is private donations. Hadassah has large contributors from all over the world who give money to finance projects like genetic research or to start a school of optometry in our College of Technology. These donors want to give their money to help their people or to promote research that will benefit mankind. We also get large contributions through major gifts fund raising and planned giving. Fifty percent of the people who leave money to Hadassah in their wills and bequests are not even members. They are looking for an organization that they trust, that does important work and recognizes the importance of Israel, and that is an organization that will last forever. In every community, grass roots fundraising takes place. We've also been receiving Federal Government grants for specific work and equipment in our hospital in Israel. Of all the monies received, 94 cents of every dollar goes to the projects in Israel. We are able to do that because Hadassah is run by volunteers.
Q. What projects will the money go to?
A. We're now building a new Mother and Child Pavilion. We'll be financing different aspects of that project with monies raised this year. We're also launching a major genetic-research project. At the hospital, plans include redoing the Cancer Institute, and starting a Human Biology Research Project, which will be important for diagnosis and treatment. In the field of education, Hadassah is introducing a course of optometry in the College of Technology, and upgrading the commnunity college to a higher academic level. Work is ongoing with immigrants from Ethiopia, training and educating them to prepare them for the Israeli Army.
Q. How has Hadassah changed over the years?
A. Hadassah has refocused its efforts to do more within the communities in the United States, with an emphasis on service and Jewish education. With many more working women and single mothers, Hadassah members need communal Jewish programming and services that fit into their crowded schedules. We've also recognized the crisis of continuity faced by the American Jewish community because of soaring rates of intermarriage. Study groups have changed to focus on topics that are more relevant to life today. One of our newer programs, Training Wheels, provides books and tapes for families to teach their children about Jewish holidays and traditions.
Q. With so many women in the work force and less time for volunteering, how has Hadassah continued to attract young members?
A. Hadassah thrives on the premise that if you have a good product, it's going to sell. We have changed over the years to accommodate today's woman. To attract younger women, we have created special interest groups: groups specifically for nurses, for lawyers, for Spanish-speaking women, Russian-speaking women, social workers, singles, you name it. If several women feel a need for a group, we will tailor make any special interest group they ask for.
Q.As a women's organization, how does Hadassah address contemporary women's issues?
A. Women's health care issues are a major concern for Hadassah. We want women to not only feel healthy, but to be healthy and to have the opportunity to know more about their bodies. We have a breast cancer-awareness program that stresses preventive care, provides breast self-examination and other educational materials. Legislatively, we have been active in Washington on issues that affect women. It was the Long Island region of Hadassah that spearheaded the campaign to start examining the water tables on Long Island because the incidence of breast cancer is higher here than elsewhere in the country. Hadassah also provides education about menopause, osteoporosis, nutrition, and stress related illnesses like heart conditions and ulcers.
Q. What can Hadassah volunteers do who are not interested in fund raising?
A. Where do I begin? There are a multitude of opportunities in every area, from education to community services. We have volunteers who work with high school students on our breast cancer-awareness program, others who are trained in our Curriculum Watch program to analyze a school's curriculum and check for the accuracy of materials and textbooks with regard to the history of the Jewish people. In Great Neck, Hadassah volunteers are involved in an amblyopia testing program in the schools. Last year in New York City Hadassah decided that not enough was being done for voter registration, and volunteers started an outreach program.
Q. How did you become involved with Hadassah?
A. I first joined for social reasons. I was home with two babies, ready to get out of the house and somebody rang my doorbell and asked if I wanted to come to a luncheon. I said yes. As I became more involved, I saw the important health care connection and the difference we were making in Israel. We were the forerunners -- the first schools of nursing and dentistry, provided the first major hospitals and did the first important research in Israel. This organization gave me an opportunity to connect with world Jewry and with women all over the United states like myself who wanted more Jewish education, and to be able to feel that we were doing something important.
Q. What are your personal goals as president of Hadassah?
A. I would like to think more in terms of world Jewry. There are two important things now going on in Hadassah. One is a strategic plan to examine the organization. Where should Hadassah be in the next generation? We need to be in the right position for the next century to attract women, keep them interested and keep Israel the centrality. Part of the strategic plan is a study by the National Commission on American Jewish Women in conjunction with Brandeis University, to examine and analyze the most in-depth and current information about Jewish women in the United States. At the same time, in Israel, we've hired a professional firm to do a major study to determine what the needs are of the country and what the institutions are doing to meet these needs. In about a year, the strategic plan and the Israeli study will meet, and we will have to sit down and write, create and then administer our new vision for the next century.
Q. Have any of the findings of the recent study of American Jewish women surprised you?
A. In two areas. Everyone has heard of Hadassah, even if it's just from a Jackie Mason joke. But while people know the name and think we do good work, many don't really know what Hadassah does. Some women who might have become involved in Hadassah have chosen instead to work with breast cancer awareness, but they didn't realize that breast cancer awareness is part of what Hadassah does. There are pieces of Hadassah's work that many women may be interested in, but they don't make the connection. The second surprise for me was the issue of women's spirituality. I didn't realize how important it is to American Jewish women today. While they are busier than ever, the need for a spiritual connection is high on their agenda. At Hadassah, we're going to have to change to address some of these spiritual needs and to provide experiences that allow for women to connect on a spiritual level.
Q. As the mother of three daughters, do you see a loss of volunteer spirit in the next generation?
A.My three daughters are all lifelong members of Hadassah. They have the volunteer spirit but it is channeled differently. In their own way, they are all involved in some form of volunteer activity. I believe that in the next generation the spirit is there, you just have to offer the right opportunities.
Q. As Hadassah's national president, you are the ultimate volunteer. What are the rewards of this nonsalaried position?
A. There is no salary that could provide the rewards I get from this position, which allows me to offer Jewish leadership, a connection with Israel and pride in the community. Each day is a new challenge. When I go to bed every night, I feel three things: I feel I've done something for the continuity of the Jewish people; I feel I've made a difference in the quality of life of my members, even if it's in a small way, and I feel that it is my obligation as a Jewish woman to insure that Israel is the centrality and that it will be there forever. Hadassah is my vehicle that does that for me. And I sleep very well at night!
