HEADLINE: Imagine, if You Will, A Sosa Trade Conspiracy

BYLINE: By MURRAY CHASS

 BODY:
LEST anyone has forgotten, Major League Baseball still owns a baseball team. Only the name has changed. They are now the Washington Nationals instead of the Montreal Expos. The Nationals won't have a new owner -- a real owner, an independent owner -- until the start of the coming season, at the earliest.
 That means the opportunity for conflict of interest continues to exist, and that conflict just might have reared its ugly head on Friday, when the Chicago Cubs traded Sammy Sosa to the Baltimore Orioles instead of to the Nationals. 
 The Orioles' deal for Sosa isn't complete, because Commissioner Bud Selig has to approve the amount of cash in the deal, which he will. The union said yesterday that it would approve a change in Sosa's contract. Sosa also has to waive his no-trade right, which he will do, then take a physical.
 But the Orioles are prepared to give the Cubs Jerry Hairston, a second baseman and outfielder, and two minor league players, and the Cubs are prepared to pay $15.5 million of the $25 million Sosa will be owed: a $17 million salary for this year, a $3.5 million severance payment and a $4.5 million buyout of an option year for 2006.
 The Cubs, disenchanted with Sosa, will pay $12 million of the 2005 salary and the $3.5 million severance. When they were talking with the Nationals last week, they were prepared to pay even more of the total.
 The Nationals would have needed a major Cubs contribution because they are under a strict $50 million budget. Selig has often said the Expos/Nationals face the same tough economic decisions as other teams, but the owners of other teams have the latitude to make exceptions.
 For example, if Drayton McLane wants Roger Clemens to pitch for his team, the Houston Astros, he has the option and the freedom to pay him $18 million and exceed his budget (payroll). But the Nationals don't have that option. If Major League Baseball has told them they can spend $50 million on their payroll, they cannot spend $52 million. It matters not that the Nationals' revenue for 2005 is expected to be at least $100 million more than the Expos' revenue last year.
 So the Nationals don't have the freedom to add Sosa at any cost, as long as they are already at or close to their limit, which the team president Tony Tavares says they are.
 Let's say that the Nationals had made a deal with the Cubs for Sosa. Jim Hendry, the Cubs' general manager, declined to comment on Sosa developments. Tavares said what they had with the Cubs was ''conceptual in nature.'' 
 But whatever the Nationals had went no further, either because of money they weren't allowed to spend or another element that could have been in play. The other element requires a suspicious mind, and right now, this mind is suspicious.
 Major League Baseball needs to complete a deal with Peter Angelos, the Orioles' owner, to satisfy his concerns about the Nationals moving into what he considers his team's marketing and television territory. Bob DuPuy, baseball's chief operating officer, has been negotiating with Angelos for months. 
 ''There are items that have been resolved, but all are contingent on what we do with certain other items,'' DuPuy said. ''But to get into position to sell the team, we need to get the situation with Baltimore resolved so we can put a broadcast plan in place for the Washington team.''
 The financial agreement, in which among other things baseball is expected to guarantee the value of the Orioles if the team is sold, is aimed at appeasing Angelos for placing the Expos in Washington. To take suspicion to the extreme, suppose baseball officials, knowing the Orioles wanted Sosa, made sure that the Nationals didn't get him first.
 Whether it was Tavares, the Selig-appointed Nationals president, or an official above him, perhaps someone blocked the Nationals from completing a trade with the Cubs. 
 Budget could always be used as the reason, no matter how little of Sosa's $17 million salary the Nationals would have had to pay, even as little as $2 million.
 This would explain why baseball people were hearing Friday morning that the Nationals were getting Sosa, then have it turn around later in the day to have the Orioles getting him.
 It's curious that the Nationals would have been allowed to give Odalis Perez a three-year, $18.5 million contract, but they didn't have a couple of million for Sosa.
 Maybe it's pure speculation, but maybe it's pure conflict.
 DuPuy didn't return a call yesterday, but last week, when he was speaking of the sale of the Nationals, he said baseball officials had begun looking into the approximately half-dozen groups of prospective owners. Those groups had until yesterday to submit $100,000 ''expression of interest'' checks.
 ''I'd like the initial rounds of due diligence done by the end of February,'' DuPuy said, ''and everything done by opening day.'' That is an aggressive timetable, he added.
 But Major League Baseball has already taken too long. The Nationals should not have been in a position to lose Sosa, if they had him or wanted him, over a couple of million dollars. A new owner should have been in place and in position to decide for himself if he wanted to expand his payroll. Every other team has an owner to make that kind of decision.

HEADLINE: Rise in Income And Spending For December

BYLINE: By Bloomberg News

 BODY:
Incomes and personal spending rose in December and sales of new homes increased, signs that the economy had momentum entering 2005, according to data released yesterday.
 Incomes surged a record 3.7 percent after Microsoft's one-time $32.6 billion dividend payout, the Commerce Department reported. Personal spending rose 0.8 percent in December, after a 0.4 percent rise in November, the department also reported, and December home sales rose 0.1 percent. 
 The rise in incomes was the most since the government began keeping records in 1959. Excluding the Microsoft payout, incomes rose 0.6 percent. Wages and salaries grew as employment improved, propelling consumer spending in the last six months of 2004 to the highest level in almost five years.
 Disposable income, or the money left over after taxes, increased 4 percent in December after a 0.4 percent rise the previous month. Wages and salaries rose 0.4 percent after increasing 0.2 percent. Consumer purchases, meanwhile, increased 0.9 percent, the most since July, after a 0.2 percent rise when adjusted for changes in prices, the Commerce Department said.
 Purchases of durable goods like autos, furniture and other long-lasting items, adjusted for inflation, increased 4.3 percent after falling 0.5 percent. Spending on nondurable goods rose 0.6 percent after rising 0.3 percent. Spending on services, which accounts for almost 60 percent of all spending, increased 0.4 percent after rising 0.3 percent.
 New-home sales increased to a 1.098 million annual rate last month, compared with 1.097 million in November, the Commerce Department said. Sales last year totaled 1.183 million, surpassing the 2003 record by 8.9 percent. Combined sales of new and previously owned homes reached a record high of 7.86 million last year. Purchases rose in the Midwest and West.
 While home sales rose in December, purchases may slow this year. Measured against sales, the supply of new houses rose to 4.8 months' worth in December, the highest since June 2000, from 4.7 in November.
 The number of new homes for sale rose to 432,000 last month, the most since August 1973, from 421,000 in November. The median number of months those homes have been for sale increased to 4.2 in December, from 4.1.

HEADLINE: U.S. Growth Rate May Be Revised

BYLINE: Reuters

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Jan. 31 

 BODY:
United States economic growth figures for the fourth quarter may be revised because of a miscalculation by Canada's statistics agency, a spokesman for the Bureau of Economic Analysis at the Commerce Department said on Monday. 
 While the error by the agency, Statistics Canada, is expected to increase United States gross domestic product in the October-to-December quarter, a spokesman for the bureau said the effect was not yet clear. 
 Canada cut its trade surplus for November by nearly 2 billion Canadian dollars ($1.6 billion) after discovering that a computer problem underestimated imports in a report two weeks ago, Statistics Canada said on Monday. 
 Canada's trade surplus widened only slightly in November, to 5.4 billion Canadian dollars, instead of the 7.3 billion Canadian dollars which the agency reported on Jan. 12, based on erroneous Canada Border Services Agency data. 
 The Commerce Department said on Friday that the United States economy grew at an annual rate of 3.1 percent in the fourth quarter, below the 3.5 percent expected by economists.

HEADLINE: Don't Speak the Language? Live With the Locals

BYLINE: By By MARCI ALBOHER

 BODY:
For years, Rebecca Koladycz traveled all over Latin America for the International Planned Parenthood Federation, visiting the organization's affiliates -- and mangling the Spanish language.
 In her first week on the job, she had an especially grueling trip to Peru. As an icebreaking exercise in a group meeting, people were paired off with colleagues they had never met and were asked to interview them. Then they had to introduce their partners to the other participants and reveal a few facts about them. 
 Alas, Ms. Koladycz's Spanish was not up to the task. Grasping only fragments of what her colleague told her, she stood up, palms sweating, and winged it. ''I gave him an extra child he didn't have, and as I continued to talk about him, he just looked at me with a blank stare,'' she said. 
 On that trip, and countless others, she cried herself to sleep after an exhausting day of desperately trying to understand and be understood.
 By studying reports and taking language classes in New York she had been able to master the technical language she needed for her job. ''But if a group went out to lunch and started chatting about their families and other interests, I just had such a hard time,'' she said. 
 Realizing her linguistic clumsiness was holding her back professionally, Ms. Koladycz enrolled in a Spanish-language immersion program in Guatemala, where she stayed with a family and studied for seven hours a day with a private tutor for two weeks. Since that trip, her confidence in her ability to navigate any situation has soared. ''Before, I always preferred to communicate by e-mail so I could look up words,'' she said. ''Now, I don't hesitate to pick up the phone.''
 Americans have always had a reputation for linguistic laziness, and since much of the business world is willing to conduct business in English, their deficiency tends not to hold them back. But an increasing number of Americans realize that going the extra step to hone skills in a foreign language can provide a professional edge or grease the wheels of deal-making. They are dusting off their high school Spanish, French or German, and the most ambitious of them are plunging into immersion language courses like the one taken by Ms. Koladycz. 
 These programs have proliferated throughout the world and come in all sizes, lasting from a few days to several weeks, emphasizing vocabularies in a variety of professional specialties and conducted as group sessions or one-on-one tutorials.
 For many American executives, Spanish is the language to learn, given the large Latin American market next door and the surge in the Hispanic population in the United States. 
 There are numerous immersion programs, both in Latin America and Spain, but Guatemala has become a hotbed of language study, in part because of its inhabitants' reputation for speaking in a clear, easily understandable accent and partly because of its extremely low cost. It is home to scores of schools, many of them based in Antigua, a well-preserved colonial city with cobblestone streets and easy excursions to nearby volcanoes and Mayan ruins. 
 For as little as $150 a week, foreigners can receive six hours of private language instruction for five days a week. Accommodations with a local family providing three home-cooked meals a day are generally included in the price. 
 Judith Anna, an executive with Broadcast Marketing, a British company that produces and distributes television film documentaries, was a novice when she decided to do a Spanish immersion program at the Academia de Espanol in Guatemala for three weeks to improve her ability to communicate with Latin American broadcasters who buy her company's programming. 
 When Ms. Anna arrived at the school, she was smitten by the bucolic setting -- students meet with their teachers outside in a garden with a swimming pool. Notwithstanding the vacation atmosphere, she treated learning Spanish like a job. In addition to six hours a day of instruction with her private teacher, Ms. Anna practiced her Spanish in the evenings and on the weekends by spending her free time with locals. school and in town. 
 Those seeking a more luxurious or sophisticated atmosphere for their immersion often find their way to Spain, Chile or Argentina, according to Cara Pulick, marketing manager of Bridge-Linguatec, a language school in Denver that sent more than 600 students overseas on language immersion programs in 2004. 
 ''Ninety percent of our clients go to these three countries,'' Ms. Pulick said, with Argentina a particularly popular destination. ''You can eat risotto and drink fine wine, discuss economics with your taxi driver, shop on European-style streets and do it all for next to nothing, all while learning your Spanish,'' she said. 
 True language lovers will take their immersion in whatever slices their schedules allow. Sarah Russell Roediger, a stockbroker who specializes in international securities, recently tacked on three days to a business trip in Madrid to do a customized immersion program set up for her by O.I.S.E., one of the premier language schools in Spain. Ms. Roediger, who already speaks German, French and Italian, studied for six hours a day, with a break of an hour and a half. She called the experience ''insanely intense'' but ''perfectly tailored to my needs.''
 David Leonard, senior vice president for Latin America at the Liberty Media Company, spent three weeks in Santiago, Chile, on one of Bridge-Linguatec's programs last July. Before his trip, Mr. Leonard, who says he spends 40 percent to 50 percent of his time in Latin America, had a fairly good understanding of Spanish, but says he ''wanted to be better able to respond, rather than just, 'I go to store now.''' 
 Since he had business in Santiago, Mr. Leonard planned his days so that he could meet with a teacher from 8 a.m. to 1 p.m. Then, from about 2 p.m. to 10 p.m., he worked in the offices of Liberty Media's local partners or lawyers -- and practiced what he had learned in the morning on them. ''Even though the people I deal with speak perfect English, they realized I was down there to study, so they would humor me,'' he said. 
 Mr. Leonard says he is now nearly fluent, and he plans to repeat the program next summer, this time staying with a family rather than at a hotel. The only reason he did not stay with a family the first time around, he said, was that once the lessons ended and he got down to work, ''I would have had to hijack all of their telephone and Internet capacity.''

HEADLINE: Cough Syrup Receives Kosher Seal of Approval

BYLINE: By LESLIE BERGER

 BODY:
The children's cough syrup Triaminic, a staple of family medicine cabinets for decades, has received a coveted seal of approval from the Orthodox Union, the country's largest and most powerful certifier of kosher products for consumers who adhere to Orthodox Judaism's dietary laws.
 All eight varieties of the liquid decongestant for children now bear the Orthodox Union's trademark label -- the initial U inside an O -- making Triaminic the first over-the-counter medicine to be certified as kosher. 
 For observant Jews who eschew foods and beverages with the slightest trace of animal derivatives, the seal means they can ease their children's scratchy throats and stuffy noses without any sense of religious conflict, said Rabbi Eliyahu Safran, the Orthodox Union's senior rabbinical coordinator.
 But the kosher certification is also expected to appeal to non-Jews, including vegetarians, people who are lactose intolerant and Muslims whose own dietary restrictions, known as halal, are similar to those of Jews. With consumers scrutinizing ingredients more carefully than ever, Rabbi Safran said, many seek out a kosher label as an additional assurance of quality control. 
 ''They know another vigilant pair of eyes are inspecting and verifying,'' he said. 
 An estimated 15 million to 20 million Americans buy kosher products, Rabbi Safran said.
 ''Kosher is hot,'' he said. ''The kosher market has been growing by leaps and bounds in the last decade. There's been more and more demand from kosher consumers, and big companies have been responsive.''
 Kosher Maalox, the liquid antacid, is in development with Novartis Consumer Health, the same company that makes Triaminic. And other pharmaceutical companies have expressed interest in working with the Orthodox Union to have their own over-the-counter products certified as kosher, Rabbi Safran said, though he declined to name them. 
 Prescription drugs are not a problem under Jewish dietary laws because they are viewed as lifesaving necessities. The Talmud -- the collection of Jewish writings that include biblical laws and subsequent interpretations of them by centuries of rabbinical scholars -- places a premium on the sanctity of life. Even the Sabbath may be broken if a sick person has to call a doctor or drive to a hospital. Similarly, Jews who are ill are exempt from fasting on Yom Kippur, the religion's annual Day of Atonement. 
 But over-the-counter medicines and supplements like vitamins are treated more like nourishment. Intended to ease discomfort or enhance health -- not cure an illness -- they are not entitled to the same exemptions as prescription drugs. The flavorings used to make liquid medicine more pleasant tasting also complicate matters because, in the eyes of Orthodox rabbis, they make medicinal products more like food. So kosher law applies, and any ingredient bearing animal derivatives renders a product unacceptable.
 The most common culprits are the emulsifier glycerin, traditionally made from beef tallow, and gelatin, often used in capsules and derived from the collagen in a variety of animals' skin and bones. Similarly, the supplement glucosamine, traditionally derived from the shells of shrimp, prawns and other shellfish, has become a popular treatment for stiff joints but formerly was off limits to kosher consumers since shellfish is taboo. Grape sugar and grape flavoring also send up a red flag to the kosher consumer because Talmudic law prescribes exactly how grapes can be processed for wine, and rabbis apply the same standards to modern-day grape products.
 Today, all these ingredients can be synthesized in a laboratory or derived from vegetables, and an array of kosher-certified supplements has been on the market for several years through Freeda Vitamins, a kosher purveyor based in New York, and the national VitaminShoppe chain, which has a large vegetarian clientele. But an over-the-counter medicine that is kosher certified is entirely new, Rabbi Safran and others said. 
 Marketing experts said getting a kosher certification had become a shrewd way for a company to gain market share for a minimal investment.
 ''No one does it because of social responsibility. They do it because it makes economic sense,'' said Menachem Lubinsky, president and chief executive officer of Lubicom Marketing Consulting, a Brooklyn-based consulting firm that analyzes and promotes the kosher food industry. Mr. Lubinsky said sales of kosher products would be close to $8.5 billion this year. 
 Bringing kosher Triaminic to market took about two years and mainly involved vetting each of its 50 or so raw materials for any trace of forbidden derivatives -- or possible contact with taboo items through machinery or packaging. First, Rabbi Safran's staff checked the Orthodox Union's vast database in its Lower Manhattan office to see which ingredients were already deemed kosher, either by the organization itself or another kosher certifier. Then letters were sent out to suppliers of noncertified ingredients and packaging, to see if they were willing to comply with kosher standards, go through a review and submit documentation of certification.
 A field rabbi for the Orthodox Union was dispatched to Novartis's plant in Lincoln, Neb., to supervise the production of all eight flavors of liquid Triaminic, from orange to grape to berry and bubble gum. New equipment was not necessary because the plant's machinery was already being cleaned on a regular basis at temperatures high enough to meet kosher standards of sterilization.
 One mother who keeps kosher said she would favor Triaminic the next time she bought cough syrup, though she usually tries homeopathy first for her three children, ages 8 and 4 and 9 months. 
 ''If it's a choice between two medicines, one that has the O.U. and one that doesn't, I'd choose the one that's kosher -- why not?'' said Chana Citron, a resident of the Upper West Side of Manhattan and the wife of a rabbi.

HEADLINE: Many Unhappy Returns

BYLINE: By PAUL KRUGMAN. 
E-mail: krugman@nytimes.com

 BODY:
The fight over Social Security is, above all, about what kind of society we want to have. But it's also about numbers. And the numbers the privatizers use just don't add up. 
 Let me inflict some of those numbers on you. Sorry, but this is important. 
 Schemes for Social Security privatization, like the one described in the 2004 Economic Report of the President, invariably assume that investing in stocks will yield a high annual rate of return, 6.5 or 7 percent after inflation, for at least the next 75 years. Without that assumption, these schemes can't deliver on their promises. Yet a rate of return that high is mathematically impossible unless the economy grows much faster than anyone is now expecting. 
 To explain why, I need to talk about stock returns. The yield on a stock comes from two components: cash that the company pays out in the form of dividends and stock buybacks, and capital gains. Right now, if dividends and buybacks were the whole story, the rate of return on stocks would be only 3 percent. 
 To get a 6.5 percent rate of return, you need capital gains: if dividends yield 3 percent, stock prices have to rise 3.5 percent per year after inflation. That doesn't sound too unreasonable if you're thinking only a few years ahead.
 But privatizers need that high rate of return for 75 years or more. And the economic assumptions underlying most projections for Social Security make that impossible. 
 The Social Security projections that say the trust fund will be exhausted by 2042 assume that economic growth will slow as baby boomers leave the work force. The actuaries predict that economic growth, which averaged 3.4 percent per year over the last 75 years, will average only 1.9 percent over the next 75 years.
 In the long run, profits grow at the same rate as the economy. So to get that 6.5 percent rate of return, stock prices would have to keep rising faster than profits, decade after decade.
 The price-earnings ratio -- the value of a company's stock, divided by its profits -- is widely used to assess whether a stock is overvalued or undervalued. Historically, that ratio averaged about 14. Today it's about 20. Where would it have to go to yield a 6.5 percent rate of return?
 I asked Dean Baker, of the Center for Economic and Policy Research, to help me out with that calculation (there are some technical details I won't get into). Here's what we found: by 2050, the price-earnings ratio would have to rise to about 70. By 2060, it would have to be more than 100.
 In other words, to believe in a privatization-friendly rate of return, you have to believe that half a century from now, the average stock will be priced like technology stocks at the height of the Internet bubble -- and that stock prices will nonetheless keep on rising. 
 Social Security privatizers usually defend their bullishness by saying that stock investors earned high returns in the past. But stocks are much more expensive than they used to be, relative to corporate profits; that means lower dividends per dollar of share value. And economic growth is expected to be slower.
 Which brings us to the privatizers' Catch-22.
 They can rescue their happy vision for stock returns by claiming that the Social Security actuaries are vastly underestimating future economic growth. But in that case, we don't need to worry about Social Security's future: if the economy grows fast enough to generate a rate of return that makes privatization work, it will also yield a bonanza of payroll tax revenue that will keep the current system sound for generations to come.
 Alternatively, privatizers can unhappily admit that future stock returns will be much lower than they have been claiming. But without those high returns, the arithmetic of their schemes collapses. 
 It really is that stark: any growth projection that would permit the stock returns the privatizers need to make their schemes work would put Social Security solidly in the black. 
 And I suspect that at least some privatizers know that. Mr. Baker has devised a test he calls ''no economist left behind'': he challenges economists to make a projection of economic growth, dividends and capital gains that will yield a 6.5 percent rate of return over 75 years. Not one economist who supports privatization has been willing to take the test.
 But the offer still stands. Ladies and gentlemen, would you care to explain your position?

HEADLINE: U.N. Election Chief Tells of Encouraging Moments on Voting Day

BYLINE: By WARREN HOGE

DATELINE: UNITED NATIONS, Jan. 31 

 BODY:
For Carina Perelli, the chief of the United Nations' electoral assistance division, there were three moments in tracking reports from Baghdad when she felt the turnout of voters in Iraq would exceed skeptics' predictions.
 ''The first were the lines in Mosul,'' she said. ''Because Mosul has been one of the hardest-hit places in Iraq in terms of intimidation of electoral workers, which is a good measure of the kind of politics of fear that have been practiced in Iraq, and the fact that people in Mosul were in line waiting to vote under those conditions was for me proof that the participation was going to be high.''
 In the hours immediately afterward, she said, there were two reinforcing developments. ''One was reports from our guys that when there was any sort of armed incident in line, the people would scatter, but when the security people had stabilized the situation, they, instead of going home, would return to the line,'' she said. 
 The other was evidence that in at least two suicide bombing attacks, people ended up spitting on the bodies of the attackers. ''In the Middle East, that is a very, very strong act of repudiation,'' she said, ''and when I heard about that, I said, this is transforming into a trend.''
 She said she could make no official pronouncements about the criticism that the United Nations elections effort in Iraq was inadequately staffed, other than to say that she was cheered by the outcome and proud of her workers in Iraq.
 Celebratory noises, however, came from the corridor, and she interrupted the interview to close her office door. ''My people are overexcited and elated, and they haven't slept all night,'' she explained.
 Ms. Perelli, 47, a sociologist and political scientist from Uruguay who has headed the United Nations elections assistance office since 1997, spoke of her reaction to the vote on Sunday next to a table of half-eaten sandwiches, fruits and snacks on one side of her 30th floor office overlooking midtown Manhattan and a bulletin board with scribbled numbers, place names and other election calculations on the other.
 Behind her was a photograph from the elections supervised by the United Nations in violence-torn East Timor in 1999. It pictured Ms. Perelli, her deputy, Carlos Valenzuela of Colombia -- currently running the unit's office in Baghdad -- and Sergio Vieira de Mello, the former chief of the United Nations mission to Iraq, who was killed in a bombing of the organization's office in Baghdad in August 2003.
 Ms. Perelli said at a news conference on Wednesday that the United Nations had provided all the technical assistance it could in setting up the vote and that she believed that the turnout would be higher than people were expecting.
 ''What I was seeing then was that you had massive participation by party agents, that despite pressures and intimidation, the poll workers and the workers at the electoral commission continued to do their jobs and the numbers were simply too big to be explained by economic factors, by the fact that there was not much employment and people simply said, oh, I need a job,'' she said. 
 The United Nations says the commission had 650 staff members in Baghdad and 6,000 workers around the country.
 Once the voting began, she studied other indicators. ''What you look for are patterns of behavior,'' she said. ''How did the people conduct themselves in line, at what time did they come, at what time do you start to see movement in the streets? Did only the men come, did women come by themselves or with men? Did people come in groups or individually? How did people react to attacks and problems with security?''
 She said that as in past elections she has worked on, she ended up most inspired by the voters themselves.
 ''Not only confronting your fears and your hopes,'' she said, ''but the whole issue of going into the streets, going to a polling station, seeing the polling station attacked and then having the double courage to go back and wait in line for your vote. It is an awesome exercise of sovereignty.''

HEADLINE: Off Broadway, Success Grows Costly and Rare

BYLINE: By JESSE McKINLEY

 BODY:
When the dark comedy ''Bug,'' by Tracy Letts, closed Sunday, the show had played 384 performances, a very respectable run that included $1.8 million in gross sales and a full 11 months at the Barrow Street Theater.
 More impressive than that, however, was the fact that the play had finally broken even by closing night. 
 ''It took us pretty much the whole ride to recoup,'' said Scott Morfee, one of the play's producers. ''I mean, if you look at the heyday of Off Broadway, in the late 90's, you had all kinds of shows recouping -- 'Hedwig and the Angry Inch,' 'How I Learned to Drive.' But it seems shows don't seem to burn as hot or fast anymore.'' 
 Indeed, ''Bug'' is the exception. Burdened by ever-higher costs and increased competition from Broadway and beyond, the successful commercial Off Broadway play is a rarity these days, producers say. 
 Long considered a cheaper, more viable alternative to the high costs of Broadway, the average Off Broadway production now regularly runs more than $500,000 to produce, with some costing nearly $1 million. 
 Predictably, those higher costs have been passed on to the consumer; good seats for Off Broadway shows now commonly run more than $50, with some shows asking $65 or $75. And while those prices might deter some ticket buyers, producers say they still aren't high enough to guarantee that they cover costs every week.
 Moreover, advance sales, which have decreased on Broadway since Sept. 11, have also slipped off Broadway, making planning for the future difficult. ''There's so much week-of and day-of sales, it just grinds you down,'' Mr. Morfee said.
 The economic travails come at a time when many millions of dollars have been sunk into building new Off Broadway theaters, including the new $23 million Dodger Stages complex on West 50th Street, which incorporates five Off Broadway spaces under one roof. (Off Broadway theaters are defined as having more than 99 seats and fewer than 500.) 
 Michael David, president of Dodger Theatricals, which opened the complex with Joop Van de Ende, a Dutch impresario, said he felt bullish about Dodger Stages. Four of the five theaters are currently booked; still Mr. David recognized the challenges of turning a buck off Broadway. 
 ''I think the cost goes up every day and the audience doesn't,'' he said. ''And considering the splendid number of offerings every night in New York, the potential audience isn't big enough to fill all those theaters.'' 
 And while many nonprofit Off Broadway companies are thriving, some older rental theaters -- where commercial productions are found -- are, in fact, being put out of their misery. The Variety Arts on Third Avenue is closed and to be demolished this year after its lease was not renewed by the owner. The same goes for the Douglas Fairbanks and John Houseman theaters on West 42nd Street, both of which are likely to be torn down.
 Off Broadway was long considered the more experimental sibling of the commercially minded worlds of Broadway, but these days it seems those Off Broadway shows that do make money are often the type of productions that don't need stars, good reviews or even dialogue to succeed. At the Minetta Lane, for example, in the West Village, where plays like ''Other People's Money'' and ''Gross Indecencies: The Three Trials of Oscar Wilde'' were produced in the late 1980's and 1990's, the current tenant is the South Korean hit ''Cookin','' which is described as a ''kitchen percussion show'' in which audience members are more likely to be fed -- literally -- than intellectually nourished. 
 A recent tenant of the Houseman, a comedy called ''Rounding Third,'' by Richard Dresser, offers a good case study in the perils, and costs, of producing plays Off Broadway. The play, produced in fall 2003, was the cheapest possible variety: a cast of two, one set, no musicians. (As a rule of thumb, musicals cost about twice as much as plays.) Still, it cost $240,000 to stage, according to its producer, Eric Krebs, a figure that included approximately $36,000 for sets and costumes, $30,000 for fees for creative staff and $40,000 for publicity. 
 But producers had reason for optimism. The play, about a pair of Little League coaches, had received fair to good reviews, but without sustained news media attention, the show soon found itself playing to half-filled houses. Producers spent more heavily on advertising, which produced brief spurts in sales, and eventually lost $380,000 hoping that the show would catch fire with audiences. 
 ''We couldn't get coverage in the press because we didn't have stars and we didn't have a disaster,'' said Mr. Krebs. ''And it needs a hook to find an audience. That's why you end up with so many stunt shows.'' 
 Mr. Krebs also says that while production costs Off Broadway are still less than Broadway, other expenses are still high. (Unlike Broadway, Off Broadway is not bound by expensive union labor contracts.) ''I think the finances of Off Broadway have become more precarious as real estate prices have become impossibly high,'' he said. ''It trickles down. Actors simply can't afford to work for $670 a week at the Houseman.'' 
 Still, many producers feel ticket prices can't go much higher before audiences begin to revolt. ''Even if costs increase 5 percent a year, ticket prices don't,'' Mr. David said. ''And there's only eight performances a week. That doesn't change. Your potential earning remains paralyzed.'' 
 Others say that there is also pressure to move some smaller, more intimate plays -- which have traditionally fared well off Broadway -- to Broadway, where actors, writers, and other creative personnel are eligible for resume-burnishing Tony Awards. (The Tonys don't consider Off Broadway productions for awards.) 
 ''The actors want Tony Awards; the producers want Tony Awards,'' said Ben Sprecher, an Off Broadway producer. ''They don't make any money in the theater, so they might as well go to a place where you can win a Tony Award.''
 Some commercial productions do create other revenue streams. Mr. Krebs, for example, ran ''Rounding Third'' long enough at the Houseman that he and his investors now will have a cut of any future film sales and amateur or regional productions. Likewise for ''Bug,'' which is scheduled to be made into a film. But for commercial producers, who survive show to show with no safety net, life is still tough. 
 ''The only true answer is that I don't know anything,'' said Mr. Krebs. ''It's extremely difficult. But when you get a hit, it's wonderful.''

HEADLINE: City Trying Again to Revive Brooklyn Freight Railyard

BYLINE: By JOSEPH P. FRIED

 BODY:
After spending $20 million in a failed effort to revive a sprawling freight yard on the Brooklyn waterfront, the city is again trying to put the site to use, this time by dividing it into two parts and seeking different companies to operate each part.
 The previous effort involved leasing the entire 33-acre site -- the 65th Street Railyard in Bay Ridge -- to one company, the Canadian Pacific Railway, three years ago. But Canadian Pacific found only one company to ship freight there on a long-term basis and, cutting its losses, the railroad pulled out of the yard in August, six months before its lease was to expire.
 Dividing the yard into 18-acre and 15-acre segments, the city's Economic Development Corporation said, could attract more operators -- maritime companies as well as railroads -- than keeping the site intact. The city had previously focused its search for a yard operator only on rail freight companies. 
 The effort to revive the city-owned yard comes at a time when the Port of New York is again thriving, after falling into a deep slump after World War II. And it is occurring as the Bloomberg administration strives to rejuvenate the Brooklyn waterfront. 
 In the new effort to resuscitate the 65th Street yard, companies are being asked to submit proposals to operate the 15-acre northern portion of the site. As for the 18-acre southern portion, a railroad company will be sought for that portion, a spokeswoman for the Economic Development Corporation, Janel Patterson, said last week. She said the agency was working with the New York & Atlantic, which runs freight service on Long Island Rail Road tracks.
 If a maritime company took over the northern portion, Ms. Patterson said, it could use barges to bring in freight that could be transferred to rail cars at the yard.
 But because the yard lacks docks, any company chosen would have to pay to have them built, at an estimated cost of nearly $4 million, Ms. Patterson said. 
 The yard's $20 million rehabilitation in the 1990's included the installation of equipment for transferring rail cars already loaded with cargo to or from barges, which would have floated the cars between the yard and a similar yard in Jersey City. 
 When the Giuliani administration announced in 2000 that the city and state had spent $20 million to rehabilitate the yard -- which fell into disuse after a wave of railroad bankruptcies in the 1960's and 70's -- it emphasized that besides freight transfers between rail cars and trucks, the site could have been used for floating loaded rail cars across the harbor. 
 Float operations here were once widespread, but they are now rare, with a single company, New York Cross Harbor Railroad, operating elsewhere on the Brooklyn waterfront. The new float equipment at 65th Street has never been used.
 Canadian Pacific has said it never wanted to use it. It said its plan to use the yard for transferring freight between rail cars and trucks failed because even though the railroad pushed a marketing plan, it was unable to attract the business it had expected. Officials at the Economic Development Corporation insist that a reorganization within Canadian Pacific after it leased the yard reduced its efforts to market the plan.
 Under the new approach for the site, the future of the gantry-like float equipment remains uncertain. It is situated in the southern section. The present search ''is not about the float barges,'' Ms. Patterson said, though she added that the city had not given up on using the float facilities. ''We're just not dealing with them today,'' she said.
 New York & Atlantic, which operates in Brooklyn and Queens and on Long Island, was a subcontractor to Canadian Pacific in the yard, handling switching and other activities. It has continued working in the yard after Canadian Pacific pulled out, serving the lone company that Canadian Pacific had attracted -- a brick company that provides a ''small volume of business'' at the yard, said Bruce Lieberman, chairman of New York & Atlantic.
 Mr. Lieberman said his company was interested in operating the entire yard but had not decided whether to make a bid to operate just the northern section.
 The New York Cross Harbor Railroad has said it is interested in moving its float operation to the 65th Street yard from its current Brooklyn location at 51st Street, which it says has ''antiquated facilities.'' But Donald B. Hutton, the executive vice president of Cross Harbor's parent company, the New York Regional Rail Corporation, said he needed to study the bid request for the northern area ''to see if we would respond.'' His company's main interest, he said, was the car-float equipment in the southern area.

HEADLINE: India's Harried Elite Now Turns, and Twists, to Yoga Lite

BYLINE: By HARI KUMAR

DATELINE: NEW DELHI 

 BODY:
It was 4:30 a.m., the stars were still out and Swami Ramdev was ready to begin the day's yoga lesson. His 12,000 students watched raptly as he sat wearing little more than a loincloth, chanting morning prayers in Sanskrit. When he walked on his hands across the stage in New Delhi's cavernous Jawaharlal Nehru stadium, they applauded.
 The students were on the final day of a weeklong yoga camp that the swami had promised would cure whatever ailed them, mentally as well as physically, and without a great investment of time. For a growing number of harried middle-class Indians, worrying about health problems associated with a more affluent lifestyle, that is just the message they want to hear. 
 While a majority of Indians are familiar with yoga, many think it is too complex and time-consuming to practice, particularly with the increasing demands on their time. The swami, youthful and photogenic, has become wildly popular with a ''yoga made easy'' approach that promises to yield quick health benefits with minimal effort.
 His emphasis is on pranayama -- roughly put, breathing exercises or the art of breath control. ''If you do pranayama half an hour daily, you will never fall sick,'' he claims.
 Each month, his weeklong yoga camps attract about 75,000 acolytes, he says, all of them paying at least $11. He receives an additional 60,000 visits to his permanent camp at Haridwar, 125 miles north of Delhi.
 Another million people watch his yoga camp each day on Aastha, a private television channel, according to executives there. His show is even beamed to the United States.
 India's elite, including its vice president, several Supreme Court judges and other senior government officials and politicians, touch his feet to get his blessings.
 He is not well known in the Western world and does not care to be. He speaks no English and has never traveled outside India. ''I am an Indian talent and my Indian brothers and sisters have first right on the benefits from me,'' he says. '' What God gave to me, I am giving to other people.''
 He has arisen at a moment when Indians, at least those of the growing urban middle class, are increasingly preoccupied with their health. 
 The number of diabetic patients in India, estimated at more than 30 million, has tripled in the past 20 years, according to WebHealthCentre.com. An estimated three million people die of heart disease every year and the number is increasing sharply. Recent studies say 30 percent of men and 55 percent of women in India's urban middle classes are overweight.
 Mr. Ramdev maintains that yoga can clear blocked arteries, lower blood pressure and cure diabetes, asthma, cancer, slipped discs, cervical and arthritis pain, kidney failure and poor eyesight. Medical professionals, not surprisingly, dispute many of his claims.
 ''Diseases are nothing but imbalances of the body, and yoga corrects those imbalances,'' he said.
 He is vague about his own background, saying he is in his late 40's and the son of an upper-caste farmer.
 According to his own account, he suffered paralysis on the left side of the body when he was 2 but fully recovered by the age of 10. The only visible sign now is his slightly shrunken left eye.
 He says he spent eight years in school, dreaming of becoming a saint. At 14, he ran away from home to a nearby Gurukul, a traditional school teaching Sanskrit and Vedic literature. He studied in the school for 10 years before spending many years wandering the Himalayas learning yoga and meditation. He has been teaching yoga for the last 15 years.
 He sleeps only five hours a night, from 10 p.m. to 3 a.m., but always bubbles with energy. He eats only fruits and vegetables, and claims he has never had sex. 
 ''I sublimate my libido to positive energy through yoga,'' he said. He was 25 before he used a telephone, he says, but now carries a fancy cellular phone.
 Unlike many other gurus, Mr. Ramdev is a talkative sort who speaks less of spiritualism and more about issues like health, education, politics and economics. He portrays himself as an Indian nationalist, building healthy individuals and a healthy nation through yoga, a philosophy on full display during the morning in the stadium.
 ''Say greetings with folded hands'' -- the traditional Indian way -- ''not by hi or bye,'' he told his students, before issuing a warning about the evils of Western fare.
 ''I want to remove the glasses of Western culture from your eyes,'' he roared as the sun rose and birds start chirping. ''Do not eat pizza, burgers or fast food. And use cold drinks like colas as toilet cleaner.''
 But when in New Delhi, the swami stays in the palatial house and uses the luxury car of an Indian friend who is a top executive of a multinational company. Asked about the seeming contradiction between criticizing foreign companies but living off their wealth, Mr. Ramdev smiled. ''At least he is our Indian brother and not selling liquor or tobacco,'' he said.

HEADLINE: Deciding How Much Global Warming Is Too Much 

BYLINE: By ANDREW C. REVKIN

 BODY:
Under the first treaty addressing global warming, 193 countries, including the United States, pledged to avoid ''dangerous'' human interference with the climate. 
 There was one small problem with that treaty, enacted 11 years ago. No one defined dangerous. With no clear goal, smokestack and tailpipe emissions of gases linked to rising temperatures relentlessly climbed. 
 On Feb. 16, a stricter addendum to that treaty, the Kyoto Protocol, enters into force, requiring participating industrialized countries to cut such emissions. 
 But its targets and timetable were negotiated with no agreement on what amount of cuts would lead the world toward climatic stability. The arbitrary terms were cited by President Bush when he rejected the Kyoto pact in 2001, leaving the world's biggest source of such gases on the sidelines.
 After a decade of cautious circling, some scientists and policy makers are now trying to agree on how much warming is too much. 
 One possible step toward clarity comes today, as 200 experts from around the world meet at the invitation of Prime Minister Tony Blair in Exeter for three days of talks on defining ''dangerous climate change'' and how to avoid it.
 The researcher running the meeting, Dennis A. Tirpak, formerly of the Environmental Protection Agency, said that experts always realized it would take a long time for science's projections to be absorbed by society, but few thought it would take this long. 
 ''I've always been a believer that science and truth will win out in the end,'' he said. ''But I have a sense we might be running out of time.''
 It has taken this long not just because the ''dangerous'' question is complicated, but because it holds dangers in and of itself. If scientists offer answers, as some have in recent days, they can be criticized for playing down uncertainties and intruding into the policy arena. If a politician answers, that creates a yardstick for measuring later progress or failure. 
 It is much easier for everyone simply to call for more research.
 But some experts now say that by the time clear evidence is at hand, calamity later in the century will be unavoidable. They say fresh findings show that potentially enormous environmental changes lie ahead. 
 ''I think that the scientific evidence now warrants a new sense of urgency,'' said Dr. James E. Hansen, a climate scientist and director of NASA's Goddard Institute for Space Studies. 
 A particular concern is the Arctic. An eight-nation, four-year study concluded in November that accumulating carbon dioxide and other emissions from human activities were contributing to the thawing of tundra and the retreat of sea ice. Recent studies of accelerating flows of ice to the sea in some parts of Antarctica also point to the prospect of a quickening rise in sea levels in a warming world. Other scientists point to the prospect of intensified droughts and floods.
 With pressure building for resolution and fresh action, some countries and groups of experts have tried to define a specific rise in earth's average temperature that presents unacceptable risks.
 The European Union has set this threshold at 2.5 degrees of additional warming from current conditions. That was also the danger level chosen last week by an international task force of scientists, policy experts, business leaders and elected officials led by Senator Olympia J. Snowe, Republican of Maine, and Stephen Byers, a Labor Party member of the British Parliament. 
 Some scientists have criticized this approach, saying understanding of the impact of greenhouse gases on the atmosphere remains far too primitive to manage emissions and thus avoid a particular temperature target.
 Others say the most logical response to the problem is to make societies more resilient to inherent extremes of climate. ''If we just significantly minimize our vulnerabilities to the extremes which occurred during the last 250 years, we'll be O.K. for the next 100,'' said Dr. John Christy, a climate scientist at the University of Alabama who has long opposed cuts in emissions. As for rising seas, he said, ''You've got 100 years to move inland.''
 Dr. Michael Schlesinger, who directs climate research at the University of Illinois, will contend at the meeting that the persistent uncertainty itself about big climate perils is precisely the reason to invest now in modest mandatory curbs on greenhouse-gas emissions. 
 Only with such a prod will societies move toward less-polluting choices, even as research continues on energy options that could in a few decades sharply reduce the human contribution to the greenhouse effect.
 Without global participation in such emission curbs, though, the shared atmosphere will essentially remain a dump with no gate or tipping fee for countries rejecting action. 
 Any consensus on climate risks will likely intensify pressure on the Bush administration to shift from its current opposition to any cuts in the gases. 
 In a speech Wednesday at the World Economic Forum, Mr. Blair pressed the United States to join Britain and other industrialized countries that have agreed to curbs on the gases.
 While the risks remained uncertain, Mr. Blair said, ''It would be wrong to say that the evidence of danger is not clearly and persuasively advocated by a very large number of entirely independent and compelling voices.''
 The Exeter meeting will probably set the tone for the next review of climate trends and causes. In 2007, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, a United Nations body, will issue a report that is expected to be the most comprehensive summation so far of human understanding of global warming.
 In three reports to date, that panel has fastidiously avoided defining unacceptable danger, though it has confirmed that humans have contributed to recent warming.
 Its current chairman, Dr. Rajendra K. Pachauri, an economist and engineer from India, is to address the conference today. 
 In an interview, he said it was clear that emissions contributing to warming had to be reduced, but defining what is dangerous remained a ''value judgment'' that was fundamentally the responsibility of society and its elected officials.
 He and several other experts said that everyone in the climate debate, scientists and policy makers, had to get used to the idea that whatever decisions were made, they would be made without scientific clarity. 
 Efforts to imply a false sense of certainty will backfire, and efforts to use uncertainty as an excuse for doing nothing will simply raise the stakes as more years slide by, and more long-lived emissions accumulate in the air.

HEADLINE: U.S. Companies Benefit From One-Time Law on Foreign Profits

BYLINE: By EDMUND L. ANDREWS

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Jan. 31 

 BODY:
When Congress passed a one-time tax break on foreign profits last fall, lawmakers said their main purpose was to encourage American companies to build new operations and hire more workers at home.
 But as corporations are gearing up to bring tens of billions of dollars back to the United States this year, adding jobs is far from their highest priority. Indeed, some companies say they might end up cutting their work forces.
 Hewlett-Packard, for example, which has accumulated $14 billion in foreign profits and lobbied intensively for the tax break, announced on Jan. 10 that it would continue to reduce its work force this year. That would come on top of more than 25,000 jobs that it eliminated during the previous three years. 
 Hewlett, like several other companies expecting to benefit from the tax break, said it had not made any final decisions about what to do with the money.
 Kellogg, the cereal manufacturer, announced on Monday that it would use the new tax break to bring back about $1 billion in foreign profits. Among other things, Kellogg said it would use the money to ''look at close-in acquisitions'' of other companies.
 And Procter & Gamble announced that it had about $10.7 billion in foreign profits that could be brought back at a fraction of the normal corporate tax rates. Though P.&G. said it had made no decisions, it would be eligible under the law to use that money to help finance its planned $57 billion takeover of Gillette.
 When the law was being debated, Senator John Ensign, a Republican of Nevada and a leading sponsor of the tax provision, predicted that it would prompt a surge of new investment in the United States and lead to hundreds of thousands of new jobs.
 ''There is not a lot of incentive for U.S. companies to bring the money back from overseas now because of the high tax penalty,'' Mr. Ensign said last year. ''This legislation is exactly the extra boost our economy needs.''
 Even if it does not lead to many new jobs, supporters of the legislation say, anything that allows American companies to allocate their funds more rationally should produce economic benefits. 
 By far the biggest tax windfalls will go to pharmaceutical companies. Pfizer, whose products include Viagra and the cholesterol-lowering drug Lipitor, said it might bring back as much as $38 billion in foreign profits.
 Four other pharmaceutical companies -- Eli Lilly, Bristol-Myers Squibb, Johnson & Johnson and Schering Plough -- announced plans in the last week to bring back as much as $37 billion among them.
 But many industry analysts are skeptical that drug companies will use the money for either further expansion beyond what they were already planning or for additional hiring.
 ''The pharma companies are cash-rich to begin with, and they don't need any additional cash to expand their operations,'' said Hemant K. Shah, an industry analyst in Warren, N.J.
 Far more likely, Wall Street analysts said, is that the companies will use their tax windfall to license drugs from others, take over other companies or simply shore up their balance sheets.
 The tax break was part of the American Jobs Creation Act, a huge corporate tax bill that Congress passed last fall in response to pressure from the European Union to resolve a long-running trade dispute. As part of that measure, a ''homeland reinvestment'' provision allowed companies to bring foreign profits into the United States at a much lower tax rate.
 To qualify for the one-time tax break, which essentially allows companies to pay 5.25 percent rather than 35 percent on the foreign profits, a company has to submit a ''domestic reinvestment plan'' that shows how it would invest the money in the United States.
 Wall Street analysts estimate that American companies have piled up at least $400 billion in profits outside the United States, deferring American corporate taxes on those profits as long as they were kept abroad.
 But the law and guidelines issued by the Treasury Department give companies a wide berth in defining their investment plans.
 The Treasury Department said companies could use the money to acquire other companies, pay down debt, buy up patents, cover the costs of litigation or simply finance the costs of sales and marketing.
 In a disappointment to some investors, however, officials ruled that companies cannot use their repatriated foreign profits to pay dividends or support stock repurchase plans.
 But analysts said many companies might well use the money to indirectly finance share buybacks.
 ''If you use repatriated capital for something that you might have used other capital for,'' asked Richard Evan, a pharmaceutical analyst at Bernstein Research, ''can you then use that other capital to buy back shares or pay dividends?''
 Robert S. McIntyre, director of Citizens for Tax Justice, a labor-backed research group that scrutinizes corporate tax practices, argued that nothing in the law required companies to do what Congress intended.
 ''Money is fungible,'' he said. ''You take it from one pot, and you put it in another.''
 Eli Lilly, whose products include Prozac, the antidepressant, said earlier this month that it might bring back as much as $8 billion in profits that have accumulated overseas.
 Terra Fox, a spokeswoman for Lilly, said the company expected to spend about $2 billion this year on worldwide capital expenditures, up from $1.9 billion last year, and that the United States would take up a higher share of the worldwide total this year.
 But Lilly also indicated that it might use the money to finance much of its standard operating expenses. ''Repatriating the cash allows us to make continued significant improvements in physical assets and people without incurring additional debt,'' Ms. Fox said. ''These actions will ultimately contribute to job creation and retention.''
 Many industry analysts are hoping that the big pharmaceutical companies actually avoid big new investments.
 ''Their costs structures right now, quite frankly, are fairly bloated,'' said Tony Butler, a phamaceutial analyst at Lehman Brothers. ''Adding head count right now doesn't make sense to me.''
 Hewlett, the computer and printer manufacturer, was one of the most vocal champions of the tax break on foreign profits and has accumulated about $14.5 billion that could be eligible for repatriation. Company executives suggested last year that they wanted to use some of their foreign profits to pay down debt, which ballooned after Hewlett bought Compaq several years ago.
 The Oracle Corporation, the leading maker of database software for running major businesses, has about $3 billion in foreign profits that could be brought back to the United States at a low tax rate. Analysts expect Oracle to use that money to help pay off its recent takeover of PeopleSoft, which also makes business application software, for $10.3 billion.
 In the meantime, Oracle plans to consolidate the two companies, reducing its combined work force by 5,000 people, to 50,000.
 Larry Ellison, Oracle's chairman, told analysts last week that the takeover of PeopleSoft would make his company a much stronger competitor against its biggest rival, SAP of Germany. ''I think we're going to have a much firmer foundation to build out applications than they will,'' Mr. Ellison said, ''because we will have a much larger base.''

HEADLINE: Exxon Mobil Earnings Jumped 27% in Quarter

BYLINE: By Bloomberg News

 BODY:
Exxon Mobil, the world's largest publicly traded oil company, said yesterday that its fourth-quarter profit rose 27 percent, to a record $8.42 billion, as fuel sales increased and demand spurred price gains.
 Net income climbed to $1.30 a share from $1.01 a share, or $6.65 billion, a year earlier, the company, which is based in Irving, Tex., said. 
Per-share earnings beat the average analyst estimate in a Thomson Financial survey by 23 cents. Full-year profit was $25.3 billion.
 The company increased full-year output for the first time in four years with new projects in Africa and Europe. 
 The increase occurred as oil prices rose to a record, swelling the company's 2004 sales to $298 billion -- more than the gross domestic product of Norway.
 ''They've been making a very big effort to expand into areas like offshore Africa,'' said Gene Pisasale, who helps manage $33 billion, including seven million Exxon Mobil shares, at the Wilmington Trust Company. ''Their global presence is bigger than any other company.''
 Fourth-quarter sales jumped 26 percent, to $83.4 billion, as increased demand from China, India and the United States pushed crude oil as high as $55.67 a barrel.
 Global oil use rose 3.3 percent, and 2004 consumption was a record. The gain was the biggest since 1976, according to the International Energy Agency.
 Shares of Exxon Mobil climbed 33 cents, to $51.60, on the New York Stock Exchange. 
 Exxon Mobil's net income from oil and natural gas sales jumped 49 percent from a year earlier, to $4.89 billion, as the company increased fourth-quarter output in Africa by 22 percent. Oil and gas production fell elsewhere around the world.

HEADLINE: Law Barring Junk E-Mail Allows a Flood Instead

BYLINE: By TOM ZELLER Jr.

 BODY:
A year after a sweeping federal antispam law went into effect, there is more junk e-mail on the Internet than ever, and Levon Gillespie, according to Microsoft, is one reason. 
 Lawyers for the company seemed well on the way to shutting down Mr. Gillespie last September after he agreed to meet them at a Starbucks in Los Angeles near the University of Southern California. There they served him a court summons and a lawsuit accusing him, his Web site and 50 unnamed customers of violating state and federal law -- including the year-old federal Can Spam Act -- by flooding Microsoft's internal and customer e-mail networks with illegal spam, among other charges. 
 But that was the last the company saw of the young entrepreneur. 
 Mr. Gillespie, who operated a service that gives bulk advertisers off-shore shelter from the antispam crusade, did not show up last month for a court hearing in King County, Wash. The judge issued a default judgment against him in the amount of $1.4 million. 
 In a telephone interview yesterday from his home in Los Angeles, Mr. Gillespie, 21, said he was unaware of the judgment and that no one from Microsoft or the court had yet followed up. But he insisted that he had done nothing wrong and vowed that lawsuits would not stop him -- nor any of the other players in the lucrative spam chain. 
 ''There's way too much money involved,'' Mr. Gillespie said, noting that his service, which is currently down, provided him with a six-figure income at its peak. ''And if there's money to be made, people are going to go out and get it.''
 Since the Can Spam Act went into effect in January 2004, unsolicited junk e-mail on the Internet has come to total perhaps 80 percent or more of all e-mail sent, according to most measures. That is up from 50 percent to 60 percent of all e-mail before the law went into effect. 
 To some antispam crusaders, the surge comes as no surprise. They had long argued that the law would make the spam problem worse by effectively giving bulk advertisers permission to send junk e-mail as long as they followed certain rules.
 ''Can Spam legalized spamming itself,'' said Steve Linford, the founder of the Spamhaus Project, a London organization that is one of the leading groups intent on eliminating junk e-mail. And in making spam legal, he said, the new rules also invited flouting by those intent on being outlaws.
 Not everyone agrees that the Can Spam law is to blame, and lawsuits invoking the new legislation -- along with other suits using state laws -- have been mounted in the name of combating the problem. Besides Microsoft, other large Internet companies like AOL and Yahoo have used the federal law as the basis for suits. 
 Two prolific spam distributors, Jeremy D. Jaynes and Jessica DeGroot, were convicted under a Virginia antispam law in November, and a $1 billion judgment was issued in an Iowa federal court against three spam marketers in December. 
 The law's chief sponsor, Senator Conrad Burns, Republican of Montana, said that it was too soon to judge the law's effectiveness, although he indicated in an e-mail message that the Federal Trade Commission, which oversees its enforcement, might simply need some nudging. 
 ''As we progress into the next legislative session,'' Mr. Burns said, ''I'll be working to make sure the F.T.C. utilizes the tools now in place to enforce the act and effectively stem the tide of this burden.''
 The F.T.C. has made some recent moves that include winning a court order in January to shut down illegal advertising from six companies accused of profiting from thousands of X-rated spam e-mail messages. But so far, the spam trade has foiled most efforts to bring it under control. 
 A growing number of so-called bulletproof Web host services like Mr. Gillespie's offer spam-friendly merchants access to stable offshore computer servers -- most of them in China -- where they can park their Web sites, with the promise that they will not be shut down because of spam complaints. 
 Some bulk e-mailers have also teamed with writers of viruses to steal lists of working e-mail addresses and quietly hijack the personal computers of millions of unwitting Internet users, creating the ''zombie networks'' that now serve, according to some specialists, as the de facto circulatory system for spam.
 ''We've thrown everything but the kitchen sink at this problem,'' said Chris Smith, the senior director of product marketing for Postini, a company that filters e-mail for corporations. ''And yet, all of these efforts have yet to make a significant dent.'' 
 Mr. Smith was speaking in a conference call with reporters last week to discuss Postini's 2005 e-mail security report, which echoed the bleak findings of recent academic surveys and statistics from other vendors that filter and monitor e-mail traffic.
 A survey from Stanford University in December showed that a typical Internet user now spends about 10 working days a year dealing with incoming spam. Industry analysts estimate that the global cost of spam to businesses in 2005, in terms of lost productivity and network maintenance, will be about $50 billion ($17 billion in the United States alone). And the Postini report concluded that most legislative measures -- in the United States, Europe and Australia -- have had little impact on the problem. 
 The American law requires solicitations to be identified as such in the subject line and prohibits the use of fake return addresses, among other restrictions. But the real soft spot in the American law, critics have argued, is that it puts a burden on recipients to choose to be removed from an e-mailers list -- an ''opt out'' feature that bulk mailers are obligated by the law to provide. (The European and Australian systems requires bulk mailers, in most cases, to receive ''opt in'' authorization from recipients.) 
 While a law-abiding bulk mailer under the American law might remove a person from its list, critics say, the scofflaw spammer simply takes an opt-out message as verification that the e-mail address is current and has a live person behind it. 
 ''Any spammer worth his salt is not going to follow Can Spam,'' said Scott Petry, Postini's founder and senior vice president for products and engineering, ''because it would be filtered out immediately.''
 Defenders of the Can Spam Act say blaming any one law is far too simple. 
 ''Most people say it's a miserable failure,'' said Anne Mitchell, who helped draft the legislation and is the chief executive of the Institute for Spam and Internet Public Policy, a research group in California. ''But I see it as a lawyer would see it. To think that law enforcement agencies can make spam stop right away is silly. There's no such thing as an instant fix in the law.'' 
 She and others note that filtering software has become particularly adept at catching the vast majority of spam before it ever gets to a user's in-box. Legitimate e-mail messages do sometimes get caught in such nets -- a drawback that generates its own chorus of complaints. But some specialists have also suggested that the overall success of identifying and weeding out junk e-mail from in-boxes may actually help explain the current surge in spam. 
 ''The more effective the filtering technology,'' Ms. Mitchell said, ''the more spam they have to send to get the same dollar rate of return.''
 Those rates of return can be staggeringly high (and the costs of entry into the market relatively low). 
 A spammer can often expect to receive anywhere from a 25 percent to a 50 percent commission on any sales of a product that result from a spam campaign, according to a calculus developed by Richi Jennings, an Internet security analyst with Ferris Research, a technology industry consulting firm. 
 Even if only 2,000 of 200 million recipients of a spam campaign -- a single day's response rate for some spammers -- actually go to a merchant's Web site to purchase a $50 bottle of an herbal supplement, a spammer working at a 25 percent commission will take in $25,000. If a spammer makes use of anonymous virus-enslaved computers to spread the campaign, expenses like bandwidth payments to Internet service providers are low -- as is the likelihood of anyone's tracking down who pushed the ''send'' button. 
 The overlapping and truly global networks of spam-friendly merchants, e-mail list resellers, virus-writers and bulk e-mailing services have made identifying targets for prosecution a daunting process. Merchants whose links actually appear in junk e-mail are often dozens of steps and numerous deals removed from the spammers, Mr. Jennings said, and proving culpability ''is just insanely difficult.''
 The new federal law does give prosecutors some leverage to go after the merchants -- but it must be proved that they knew, or should have known, that their wares were being fed into the illegal spam chain. 
 ''We wait to see a real test case of that,'' Mr. Jennings said. 
 In the meantime, analysts predict, more viruses will commandeer more personal computers as zombie spam transmitters -- which besides free relays give spammers a thicker cloak of anonymity. Mr. Jennings estimates that hijacked machines handle 50 percent of the spam stream, and other analysts have put the percentage higher. 
 Analysts also expect more use of virus bombs -- called directory harvest attacks -- to wrest working e-mail addresses from Internet service providers. ''It's the silent killer of e-mail servers,'' Mr. Smith of Postini said. 
 And bulletproof services like Mr. Gillespie's and another, Buprhost.com, are intent on continuing to offer spam-friendly merchants a haven from antispam complaints, starting at $89 a month. 
 ''If your Web site host receives complaints or discovers that your Web site has been advertised in e-mail broadcasts, they may disconnect your account and shut down your Web site,'' explains Buprhost.com, which promises no such disruptions. ''The reason we can do this is that we put your Web site in our overseas server where the local law will protect your Web sites.'' 
 ''It's very simple,'' Mr. Petry of Postini said of the junk e-mail scourge. ''Spam is technically very easy to send.''
 Which is why, according to Aaron Kornblum, Microsoft's Internet safety enforcement lawyer, suits against spam enablers like Mr. Gillespie are an important, if incremental, new front to pursue. 
 ''Microsoft's efforts in filing these lawsuits is to stop spammers -- and in this case hosting services that cater to spammers -- from plying their trade,'' said Mr. Kornblum, who noted that Microsoft was working to enforce the $1.4 million judgment against Mr. Gillespie. 
 ''Our objective with sustained enforcement activity is to change the economics of spamming, making it a cost-prohibitive business model rather than a profitable one.''

HEADLINE: Large-Scale Development Raises Preservation Concerns

BYLINE: By ROBIN POGREBIN

 BODY:
For years, the Loew's Victoria Theater, a once-elegant vaudeville house and movie palace, has languished on West 125th Street in Harlem. 
 Just a few doors down from its famous neighbor the Apollo Theater, the Victoria went from being celebrated as one of the city's largest and most beautiful theaters to failing as a five-screen multiplex that opened in 1987 and closed just two years later. Since then, the theater's Ionic columns and terra-cotta rosettes have decayed and the stage has remained bare, except for occasional small theatrical productions or church services. The marquee recently advertised a lingerie sale across the street. 
 Now, seven teams of developers, hoteliers and cultural organizations are competing to reimagine the site as a major new entertainment-hotel-residential complex. New York State, which owns the property, is interviewing the applicants and expects to make a decision in March. 
 The Empire State Development Corporation, which is evaluating the proposals with the Harlem Community Development Corporation, its subsidiary, declined to identify the applicants or describe their proposals.
 But documents obtained by The New York Times show that the state has narrowed the field to seven groups. Under terms set by the state, each team has enlisted an arts organization as part of its proposal, like the Bottom Line, the jazz club that recently closed in Greenwich Village; or the Jazz Museum in Harlem, which has yet to find a home. The development teams include hoteliers like Starwood and Ian Schrager; architects like Fox & Fowle, Davis Brody Bond and Lee Harris Pomeroy; and developers like Related Companies and Apollo Real Estate Advisers, which together built the Time Warner Center. 
 ''This is a great opportunity for Harlem and more specifically for 125th Street as it inches toward becoming an even grander destination,'' said Derek Q. Johnson, chairman of Integrated Holdings, which has partnered with Related.
 But development projects involving historic buildings are often magnets for controversy, and the Victoria is no exception. While the theater has been deemed eligible for listing on the National Register of Historic Places, it is not a designated landmark -- and the state is not requiring that the neo-Classical theater, with its ornate moldings and ceilings, be preserved.
 ''That is effectively a smack in the face to the community,'' said City Councilman Bill Perkins, who represents parts of Harlem. ''There is going to be a little bit of a fight on this, I can guarantee you.''
 ''That's a historic theater, and we'd like to see proposals recognize that,'' he continued. ''The preservation issue is compatible with the development issue.''
 At a meeting on Friday of the Harlem Community Development Corporation, the issue of preservation was addressed. While all of the proposals would involve retaining the facade, only two specify restoring some interior features. Michael Henry Adams, the Harlem historian and author of ''Harlem: Lost and Found'' (Monacelli Press, 2002), said he found this troubling. ''Whatever happens, I would like it to incorporate the beautiful interiors of this historic Harlem theater,'' he said. 
 In particular, Mr. Adams cited the elliptical anteroom on the second floor, the bas-relief decoration on the theater's saucer dome ceiling, the long mirrored lobby and the theater's gilded bronze and crystal chandeliers. 
 The 2,394-seat Victoria was designed in 1917 by Thomas W. Lamb, who built dozens of Loew's theaters around the world and several Broadway houses. ''It should not be allowed to be destroyed,'' Mr. Adams said. ''Were it restored, it would be one of the most distinguished theaters in New York.''
 Over the last few years, Harlem has seen an explosion of commercial development, from a new Marriott Hotel to Harlem U.S.A., a retail center, both on 125th Street. Developers say there is still a demand for more hotel rooms as well for apartments to accommodate professionals. But some people who live and work in Harlem are concerned that the influx in large-scale development will compromise the neighborhood's character and displace longtime residents.
 Mr. Perkins argues that the Victoria development project -- indeed, the overall influx of commercial building in Harlem -- should not be mistaken for a larger revival. ''These days, 'renaissance' is defined by real estate,'' he said. ''It's not a term to describe an intellectual, cultural, educational rebirth.''
 ''What these people want us to do is be grateful that deals are being made,'' he said. ''The easy way out is to tear something down and put something up.''
 Tensions are also brewing between the two agencies responsible for choosing a development plan for the site. Keith L.T. Wright, chairman of the Harlem Community Development Corporation, said his organization had been excluded from decision-making by the Empire State Development Corporation. ''There has been no consultation whatsoever,'' said Mr. Wright, also a state assemblyman whose district includes Harlem. ''It's plantationism at its best.''
 ''This is the last big development piece on 125th Street,'' he said. ''I just want to make sure some of my community groups are taken care of. They want a piece of the action.''
 But Deborah Wetzel, a spokeswoman for the Empire State Development Corporation, said that the Harlem Community Development Corporation had been fully consulted. ''We've been working very closely with them,'' she said. ''We're assisting them every step of the way; they sit in on every meeting and their board has final approval.'' The Harlem Urban Development Corporation, a precursor of the community development corporation, acquired the Apollo and the Victoria in the mid-1980's to save them from conversion to nontheater use.
 Two of the proposals feature the Jazz Museum, which was founded four years ago to present exhibitions and further jazz education. 
 The proposal submitted by the RD Management Corporation, a real estate investment and development company, calls the Jazz Museum ''the jewel in the crown'' of its $116 million multi-use development. The proposal plans to retain the theater's facade with a new marquee and overall design by Fox & Fowle Architects. 
 Taking a page from the new Jazz at Lincoln Center building at Columbus Circle, which -- in addition to its main stage -- includes a jazz club and a theater with a glass wall overlooking Central Park South, the proposal calls for a ''jazz cafe'' on the second floor for small ensembles. A bandstand would be framed by a large window on the 125th Street side of the building. 
 Now that Jazz at Lincoln Center is open in the Time Warner Center, the proposal says, momentum has been created for a Harlem-based jazz institution ''whose aesthetic will be informed by the sensibilities of the uptown community.''
 RD Management's submission also includes a 150-room hotel that would house a gallery for African-American art and a Harlem-themed restaurant. ''For example,'' the proposal says, ''the menu might offer a Zora Neale Hurston salad, a Romare Bearden pasta, a Miles Davis omelette and a Denzel burger.''
 The Jazz Museum would also be the cultural centerpiece of a $123 million proposal by Integrated Holdings and Related for a 150-room boutique hotel -- with Inter-Continental as a possible operator -- and 90 residential condominium units.
 Apollo Real Estate Advisers, along with Starwood Hotels and Resorts Worldwide, has proposed a $103 million W Hotel with 156 rooms, 58 residential condominiums and 4,000 square feet of office space for the Apollo Theater Foundation. The Apollo Theater space would include rehearsal and education areas, a black box theater and an Apollo cafe. The architect on the project is Davis Brody Bond. 
 A proposal by the Victoria Tower Development suggests a $150 million B.B. King Entertainment Center with a jazz dinner club; an art gallery run by the Studio Museum in Harlem; and a five-star, 304-room hotel. The other groups in the running are Full Spectrum, which has proposed a $111 million complex including 78 luxury condominiums and two clubs -- Victoria Small's Paradise and 930 Blues Cafe with programming that reflects black and Latino culture. 
 Thor Equities, which specializes in urban real estate projects, proposes a $70 million complex, including boutiques like Armani Exchange, Club Monaco and Kay Jewelers; a revived Bottom Line club, possibly with a recording studio; and a 238-room hotel. 
 Danforth Development Partners proposes creating a $113 million new Savoy Ballroom with banquet space for 300 people, a 90-room hotel designed by Mr. Schrager and two new theaters for Harlem-based performing arts companies like Classical Theater of Harlem, Bill T. Jones Dance Group and the Harlem School of the Arts. 
 At the meeting on Friday, it was clear that several Harlem Community Development Corporation board members were worried that a treasured neighborhood landmark would be erased. One board member asked, ''Can this theater be demolished?''
 Diane P. Phillpotts, president of the corporation, replied that substantial changes to the building would require consultation with the New York State Historic Preservation Office. 
 ''I understand the importance of preservation,'' she said. ''We also have to balance that against the economic development potential of the property.''

HEADLINE: Bush on Social Security and Clinton on Health Care: Oh, Those Devilish Details

BYLINE: By ROBIN TONER

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Jan. 31 

 BODY:
Thirteen years ago, Bill Clinton campaigned on the promise of universal health care, an immensely popular idea until he was elected and confronted the public with the costs of actually providing it -- in new regulations, new mandates, wrenching change. 
 Now, some analysts say, President Bush faces the risk of something similar happening on Social Security: the general idea of creating private investment accounts, a reliable applause line on the campaign trail last year, foundering on the details. It is a nightmare possibility for the Republicans, a potentially sweet karmic payback for the Democrats.
 At the urging of anxious Republicans, Mr. Bush plans to use his State of the Union address on Wednesday and a campaign-style swing through five states on Thursday and Friday to sell his plan to allow younger workers to divert part of their Social Security payroll taxes into their own investment accounts. This comes after a month of political backlash as the administration tried to turn this general promise into an actual policy, and the troublesome details, like how much it would cost, began to emerge. 
 Some Republican leaders, like Representative Bill Thomas of California, the House Ways and Means chairman, have been floating ideas to begin the legislative deal-making, only to find that those ideas have further stoked the anxiety and given Democrats more to criticize. Republicans trooped to the White House last week to urge the president to make his case more effectively and intensely with the voters.
 ''A lot of us expressed the view that the president started the debate and the other side is finishing the debate,'' said Senator Gordon H. Smith, Republican of Oregon, after one such meeting.
 Republican consultants are urging Republican officials, many of whom gathered at a Congressional retreat last weekend, to keep their message simple. ''It is key to teach your constituents that Social Security is hurting, but the way in which you go about communicating the problem and the need for reform is critical,'' a Republican briefing book advises.
 The question is how well Mr. Bush has prepared the public for this debate. On the campaign trail, he spoke broadly and appealingly about an account that younger workers ''can call their own, an account that the government cannot take away and an account that they can pass on from one generation to the next.'' 
 But he did not talk about how he would pay for these accounts, or the costs of shoring up Social Security over the long haul, or indeed almost any detail at all, although he promoted the issue in his 2000 and 2004 campaigns. While the White House is in no rush to discuss those details, others are airing the potential downsides as the legislative debate begins, including the possibility of benefit cuts for younger workers, the potential of a $2 trillion addition to the deficit and the general complexity of a transition to private accounts.
 Democrats, who were pummeled over nearly every page of the 1,342-page Clinton health plan 12 years ago, are eagerly highlighting every painful possibility emerging from the Republicans. ''They're getting a thousand cuts here,'' said Representative Rahm Emanuel, Democrat of Illinois, the chairman of the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee and a former top Clinton aide.
 It is a cliche of public policy that the devil is in the details, but nonetheless true. For the Clinton administration, the deadly details involved the method of getting to universal coverage: the requirement that employers provide insurance; the creation of quasi-governmental structures to administer the system; and the changes it would impose on Americans, even those who were perfectly happy with their medical care as it was. As the months dragged on, and the plan came under unrelenting attack from Republicans and an array of interest groups as a dangerous expansion of government, Americans shifted.
 That was the chief political lesson of the health care war: whichever side framed public opinion will win. 
 This battle for public opinion is just beginning on Social Security. The lobby for middle-aged and older Americans, AARP, much to the dismay of Republicans on Capitol Hill, has weighed in heavily against the idea of diverting payroll taxes to private accounts, the heart of the Bush plan. As of last week, an official at AARP said, ''We've generated about 200,000 phone calls to the Capitol.'' 
 But Mr. Bush is planning to use ''a good portion of his State of the Union address'' to ''talk about the need to save and strengthen Social Security for our children and grandchildren,'' said the White House spokesman, Scott McClellan. ''And I think you'll also hear him talk in a more specific way about some of the way forward to finding solutions to strengthen it.''
 A variety of polls suggest the Republicans have work to do. Andrew Kohut, director of the Pew Research Center for the People and the Press, said that while Americans believed there were problems with Social Security, they did not believe the system was in crisis, a central argument made by Mr. Bush to justify the changes he seeks. 
 In the New York Times/CBS News Poll two weeks ago, when Americans were asked what they thought was ''the most important problem facing this country today,'' Social Security was not close to the top; the economy, the Iraq war, terrorism, jobs and health care were well above it.
 Robert J. Blendon, an expert on public opinion and social policy at Harvard, said that part of the Bush administration's problem was that ''the president did not set this as a top agenda item in his campaign.'' As some Republicans said privately on Capitol Hill last week, Mr. Bush was re-elected because of national security, not Social Security.
 Moreover, as was the case with universal health care, support for private investment accounts drops as voters learn more about how they would work, Mr. Blendon said.
 Mr. Kohut argued that Mr. Bush, like his Democratic predecessor, may be overreaching. ''Both health care and the Social Security proposal could reach the same fate -- appeal to a public that sees a problem but isn't necessary sold on a solution,'' Mr. Kohut said. Mr. Bush has some advantages that Mr. Clinton did not. To begin with, overhauling Social Security, difficult though it may be, is not nearly as complex as reinventing the 15 percent of the American economy that the health care system accounts for. And while Americans may not think a crisis is imminent in Social Security, a majority in the New York Times/CBS poll said the program needed fundamental changes. The Bush camp also has the lessons of 1993-94 to draw upon.
 But then, so do the Democrats. ''It turns out there is something for nearly everybody to dislike about Bush's proposal,'' declared a polling memorandum circulated among Democrats last week, touting the analogy to the Clinton health wars -- which this time, it argued, will favor the Democrats.

HEADLINE: Conservative Party Hears Tough Talk From Hopefuls

BYLINE: By PATRICK D. HEALY

DATELINE: ALBANY, Jan. 31 

 BODY:
''Do you think pedophiles are home praying for redemption when they're out on bail?'' Jeanine F. Pirro, the Westchester County district attorney, asked leaders of the New York State Conservative Party in a speech on Monday.
 ''Not a chance. They're out looking for other victims,'' Ms. Pirro said derisively, winning nods of approval from like-minded members of her audience. 
 It was one of several highly charged remarks served up by Ms. Pirro and other possible candidates for 2006 races, to the delight of Conservative Party leaders who had gathered in Albany for a two-day conclave. Heavily cutting taxes, redrawing legislative districts and praising parochial schools were among the chords struck with hard-edged oratory by the politicians who used the party's dais to cement their conservative bona fides and test out new political themes.
 Gov. George E. Pataki also spoke at the conference on Monday night, pledging to hold state spending in 2005-06 to the rate of inflation, something that party members say his proposed budget does not do. He also called for accelerated tax cuts and an end to the State Assembly's hearings into possibly restoring the death penalty.
 ''Enough with the hearings. Let's reinstitute an effective death penalty law in the state of New York,'' Mr. Pataki said.
 Rick A. Lazio, the former congressman, stopped by on Sunday to speak on Social Security and re-connect with party members who backed his 2000 Senate bid against Hillary Rodham Clinton. ''There's no such thing as a bad time to see friends,'' he said. Asked about his own political future, Mr. Lazio said, ''No plans to run for anything right now,'' though he had an unmistakable gleam in his eye as he praised the Iraqi elections and mentioned a forthcoming foreign policy speech on his schedule.
 Michael Long, the chairman of the Conservative Party, who is popular with members as their indefatigable and immodest cheerleader, said, ''The mere fact that Rick and others are coming by shows they're thinking about their political futures, and we're the only party to have a conference where candidates can meet our county chairs.'' 
 While no one was explicit about their plans for 2006, the jockeying for attention, applause and business cards was obvious. An aide to Secretary of State Randy A. Daniels, who spoke on Sunday evening, twice urged a reporter to highlight the official's remarks because Mr. Daniels won strong applause (true) and is weighing a run for governor (if Mr. Pataki does not). Some party members praised Mr. Daniels's support for small-town economic development, charter schools and higher admissions standards at the State University of New York, yet at the same time were wary of his past affiliation as a Democrat.
 Ms. Pirro, who is reported by friends to be seriously considering a run for attorney general in 2006, arrived alone and took only a few questions from reporters; she devoted most of her time instead to chatting, hugging, and posing for pictures with Conservative Party members.
 And Edward F. Cox, a lawyer and State University of New York trustee, smiled broadly when party members broke into applause when one of them described Mr. Cox as a potential challenger to Mrs. Clinton in 2006. Mr. Cox, who spoke on education and strongly praised the parochial school model, mentioned the Senate race himself only when a conferencegoer urged him to run against Mrs. Clinton.
 ''Well, someone's got to,'' replied Mr. Cox, a son-in-law of the late President Richard M. Nixon.
 The most forward-looking speech of the conference, and the one that drew the biggest raves afterward, came from Ms. Pirro, who sounded like a candidate unveiling a statewide law enforcement agenda ending statutes of limitations, toughening bail requirements and marginalizing the insanity defense as ''plain crazy.''
 Saying criminal justice should not be ''politically correct,'' she bemoaned the tendency of some Americans to engage in a ''national therapy session'' on whether offenders were abused as children or experienced suffering that turned them violent. 
 ''You know what? I don't much care what happened to them that brought them to this point. The truth is, they made a decision to harm and victimize an innocent human being,'' Ms. Pirro said, pounding the podium for effect. 
 ''She'd be a great candidate against Hillary, just great,'' said Daniel F. Fitzgerald Jr., a party executive from Clinton, N.Y., referring to Ms. Pirro as a possible challenger next year to Mrs. Clinton. ''Jeanine's values and ethics on criminal justice issues are just what the Conservative Party stands for.''

HEADLINE: Amid Doubts, Mayoral Rival Says She's Set For Combat

BYLINE: By RANDAL C. ARCHIBOLD

 BODY:
To dispel widespread doubt that she is game for the rough-and-tumble mayoral race, C. Virginia Fields, the Manhattan borough president, put up her fists and threw a few jabs.
 ''You remember 'Rocky' running up the steps?'' she said, momentarily changing her persona as a congenial, go-along type. To those who question her willingness to press on or wonder whether there is an ulterior motive behind her campaign, she said, ''I'm running to win. End of conversation.''
 Ms. Fields, 59, who would be the city's first woman and second African-American mayor, is trying to catch up with a Democratic field that has four other candidates, most of whom turned up campaigning and staff building months ago. 
 But what is attracting attention among Democrats is Ms. Fields's potential to upset the plans of the candidate currently leading the field, Fernando Ferrer, the former Bronx borough president who in 2001 tried to become the city's first Latino mayor.
 Mr. Ferrer is counting on a unified black-Latino front in his effort to prevail in the September primary and oust Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg in November. But Ms. Fields's entrance in the race means the Democrats may have to endure some of the painful racial and ethnic splits that divided the party in the last mayoral election. Her candidacy also leaves black elected leaders with some delicate treading in deciding whom to support in the primary.
 Case in point: Representative Charles B. Rangel, a Fields ally and a pivotal Harlem Democrat, helped galvanize the black-Latino coalition that backed Mr. Ferrer in 2001.
 ''He is someone who has clearly said to me that he supports me,'' Ms. Fields said, referring to Mr. Rangel.
 But in an interview, Mr. Rangel was less absolute.
 ''I am not endorsing her'' right now, Mr. Rangel said, adding that he will meet with her advisers this week. At the same time, he said: ''I told her that as long as she is in this race I will not be backing anyone else. I do hope my support for her will not be just an emotional thing.''
 Many had dismissed Ms. Fields's candidacy, but that began to change after a Quinnipiac University poll last month showed Ms. Fields in second place behind Mr. Ferrer among the five Democrats seeking to oust Mr. Bloomberg. Among registered Democrats, 31 percent supported Mr. Ferrer and 15 percent backed Ms. Fields. Among registered voters, Mr. Ferrer tied with Mr. Bloomberg at 43 percent and Ms. Fields trailed Mr. Bloomberg 44 percent to 39 percent, making her the next closest competitor when the five Democratic candidates where matched up against Mr. Bloomberg. The poll among 1,027 voters had a margin of error of 3.1 percentage points.
 Ms. Fields, who has raised $1.2 million for her campaign, still lags behind Mr. Ferrer, who has raised $2.5 million; City Council Speaker Gifford Miller, who has raised $4.2 million; and Representative Anthony Weiner, who raised $1.5 million. Several Democrats said she needed to raise considerably more money in the next few months.
 Mr. Rangel said Ms. Fields's poll standing warranted attention. 
 ''I am surprised she and Freddy are doing so good with both in the race,'' he said.
 Jacques DeGraff, a Democratic consultant, said that Ms. Fields ''does not have the fire in the belly the way some others do'' but that her candidacy would cause many black Democrats to consider her.
 ''The big story, not only for her candidacy, is what are blacks going to do,'' he said. ''For Freddy to run, it is clear already he does not have the unity that existed before, and for many, Virginia is now a viable alternative. But right now she has to broaden her base.''
 To do that, she plans to promote what her aides say is a powerful personal story -- a ''hero's journey,'' in the words of one -- from serving jail time in her native Birmingham, Ala., with Martin Luther King Jr. in 1963 to ousting an incumbent for a City Council seat in 1989 to becoming the first black woman to serve as Manhattan borough president.
 Her aides say they also believe she will court women's groups. 
 In her State of the Borough speech last week, Ms. Fields promoted the idea of expanding programs to curb domestic violence. And, like her Democratic rivals, she plays up the need for more affordable housing, school improvements and the need to shore up small businesses. 
 In her speech, Ms. Fields said she supported rezoning the far West Side for commercial and residential development, was a ''supporter of the Olympics coming to New York City,'' but was against the West Side stadium proposed by Mr. Bloomberg. 
 Ms. Field said her chief complaint with the mayor is what she called his penchant to push big proposals without adequate public input. She also said he had not addressed the high unemployment rate among black men and Hispanic women and poor health care in minority communities.
 ''So now we must decide: Is New York to become a city of inclusion?'' she said during her speech last week.
 Lately Ms. Fields and her aides have been addressing rumors that she is in the race to raise her profile for some other office, perhaps a future run for Mr. Rangel's congressional seat when, or if, he steps down.
 Ms. Fields's campaign denies that she has any ulterior motives.
 ''For a long time the talk was, no matter what she did, she was not running,'' said Joseph Mercurio, Ms. Fields's chief consultant. ''Now that they know she is actually running, the quiet conversations about her not running have stopped.''
 Analysts question her ability to appeal beyond her Manhattan base, and Ms. Fields acknowledged that ''getting known citywide clearly is one of the challenges for me because I've never run citywide.''
 She does not point to her one or two signature achievements but instead lists a bevy of community work that tends not to attract widespread attention, like securing money for senior citizen centers, for playgrounds and for local business development.
 One question is whether she can draw black support beyond Manhattan as the black electorate increasingly resides in Brooklyn and, to a lesser extent, in Queens. The Rev. Al Sharpton, another crucial Ferrer supporter from 2001, is backing City Councilman Charles Barron, who represents a heavily black district in central Brooklyn. 
 ''Clearly she has a strong base of support among African-Americans in Harlem, but it remains to be seen if she can energize the much larger pockets of black residents in central Brooklyn and southeast Queens,'' said Hakeem Jeffries, founder and chairman of the Brooklyn Freedom Democratic Association.
 And there is concern among Democrats that the primary could cause racial and ethnic battles, which could weaken the party's candidate against Mr. Bloomberg. City Comptroller William Thompson, who is black, said he decided not to run in part because of such concerns.
 But he said Ms. Fields might escape such problems because people know that this is perhaps her only chance. While he plans to seek another term as comptroller, she will not be borough president next year because of term limits.
 ''A lot of people would sit back and say, 'Bill Thompson, he doesn't have to right now.' But Virginia is term-limited out,'' said Mr. Thompson.
 Ms. Fields said the determination of Democrats to defeat any Republican after the 2004 presidential election should quell such concerns.
 ''I think there is a re-energizing that I have seen in the city that speaks well for a Democrat to win this election in New York, and that's where the unifying will really have to come together,'' she said.


CORRECTION-DATE: February 3, 2005

 CORRECTION:
A picture caption on Tuesday with an article about the mayoral candidacy of the Manhattan borough president misspelled her given name in some copies. She is C. Virginia Fields, not Virgina. The article also misstated the precedent for her current service. She was the second black woman elected Manhattan borough president; the first was Constance Baker Motley, in 1965.

HEADLINE: Universal's Second Chance to Make Video Pay

BYLINE: By JEFF LEEDS

 BODY:
The world's biggest music company wants to make sure it doesn't end up playing the blues again because of the music video business.
 The Universal Music Group of Vivendi Universal says it will no longer provide music videos free, or at a nominal cost, to Internet and cable television services that are building a potentially giant business by playing videos on demand. Universal does not want to repeat what it considers the music industry's ill-fated decision in the 1980's to provide free videos to MTV.
 The move may test the record company's mettle against media giants like Yahoo Inc. and Time Warner. 
 Yesterday, senior executives at Universal Music notified an array of Internet and cable companies that they must negotiate licensing deals for use of Universal's music videos or remove them from their on-demand services. The record company -- which accounts for more than one-third of the new music sold in the United States -- also said it would no longer advertise on Internet sites or cable outlets that do not strike such licensing agreements.
 The music company quietly struck its first deal under the new terms in December with the Microsoft Corporation, which plays videos on its MSN service. The software maker agreed to pay Universal the bigger of either a fee per video viewed or a percentage of advertising revenue.
 All four major record corporations have been aiming to cut off a slice of the on-demand business, and while a handful of labels have claimed to strike deals to earn per-view fees or ad revenue from individual services, no label has struck such an aggressive stance before.
 The move is likely to rattle the emerging market for on-demand services and challenge rival music companies to follow Universal's lead. The company, whose roster includes acts like U2 and Ludacris, presented its new stance as a potential leap forward for an industry that has been weakened by falling CD sales, piracy and competition from other forms of entertainment. 
 ''Too many businesses have been built on the back of the content we produce,'' said Universal's chairman, Doug Morris. ''So in the future, content we produce won't just be provided for free for promotional purposes. People will have to pay if they're going to use it.'' 
 Universal said its new terms would apply to a wide range of services, including those of Yahoo's Launch, Time Warner's AOL Music on Demand and RealNetworks. It will also apply to on-demand services being developed by MTV, whose five-year deal with Universal recently expired. The company said it would make certain exceptions; for example, it would allow music retail Web sites to carry 30 seconds of a video free if they also included a ''buy'' button that consumers could use to purchase music. 
 Universal executives declined to discuss their exact terms. But an executive from one media company that runs an on-demand service, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said the record company had been asking for about a cent per play of a video, or a cut of ad sales. Based on that, Yahoo alone could be asked to pay more than $12 million a year.
 David Goldberg, a Yahoo vice president and general manager for music, said he had rejected previous overtures from various labels seeking a share of advertising revenue or per-view fees. ''We think we should pay the labels for content. We're happy to pay a fair economic rate that allows all of us to do well. But ultimately the consumer will determine what the value of music is.''
 The major record labels have long been haunted by their decision to cede potential profits from videos to the then-fledgling MTV channel in the 1980's, which established a licensing precedent. MTV did start to compensate the labels later in the 80's, but most music executives consider the fees -- several million dollars per company -- to be small. 
 Owing in part to the low fees and its own cheap programming costs, MTV became a juggernaut that generates some of the biggest profit margins in the media world -- it earned cash flow of roughly $620 million on sales of $1.09 billion last year, a margin of about 57 percent, according to estimates from Kagan Research in Monterey, Calif.
 Universal's new move is the second time in 16 months that Mr. Morris has shaken up the sluggish recording industry by upsetting established practices. In 2003, Universal said it would slash its suggested retail prices by almost one-third in a bid to breathe new life into CD sales. The price cut drew catcalls from many small retailers that felt their margins being squeezed, but company executives said the pricing plan had been a success, noting that Universal's album sales jumped about 7 percent last year, beating the industry's overall increase of about 1.6 percent. 
 Mr. Morris's action also adds a major record corporation to the swelling ranks of television networks and film studios that are squaring off against Comcast and other new purveyors of on-demand services over financial terms. 
 As for the licensing income the record labels do receive from MTV, it is generally not shared with the labels' artists. But Universal said it planned to pay a share of the fees it gets from on-demand services to artists and to music publishers. 
 MTV does not show music clips nearly as often as it once did, but the music video -- a medium of its own that has created its own star directors -- has found new life on the Internet, where millions of users flock to see videos and exclusive live performances by emerging music stars.
 In turn, online companies have sold advertising tied to performances. On Yahoo's Launch service, for example, a viewer who selected the video for the rapper Nelly's ''Over and Over'' yesterday saw an advertisement for the Staples office supply chain before the clip played. 
 Yahoo has said its users watch videos more than 300 million times per month. And Yahoo's chief executive, Terry Semel, noted at a recent analyst conference that the video service ''has become a very good advertising platform.'' 
 ''So it not only has huge volume, but it has huge opportunities to monetize,'' Mr. Semel said.
 Mr. Morris said he agreed. ''Video on demand is enormous and is going to continue to get bigger and bigger. Kids love it. So we're going to get paid for it now.''

HEADLINE: Besieged Chief of Atomic Agency Carries On

BYLINE: By MARK LANDLER

DATELINE: DAVOS, Switzerland, Jan. 30 

 BODY:
His agency is heading into its third showdown in three years with a potential nuclear-weapons state, and the United States is trying to push him out of his job.
 But when Mohamed ElBaradei, the director general of the International Atomic Energy Agency, came to the annual conference of the World Economic Forum here this week, he behaved like someone who expected to be in the thick of the proliferation debate for some time.
 In an interview, Dr. ElBaradei fleshed out his proposal for a five-year moratorium on building uranium-enrichment facilities, to stop the spread of atomic weapons to Iran or other countries. 
 ''The danger of proliferation has become much more real, much more imminent, and we cannot address it with business as usual,'' he said during a break from meetings with foreign ministers and American lawmakers. ''We need to look into new tools we can use.''
 Under the plan, which Dr. ElBaradei will present at a conference on the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty in May, countries would be able to lease enriched fuel from an international consortium. That would enable them to operate nuclear reactors to generate electricity, without having to build facilities for energy purposes that could be converted to weapons production.
 ''If you have the capability to develop that fissile material, you're not too far away from a weapon,'' he said. ''This is too dangerous. We can do better in terms of minimizing the security risk.''
 Enriched uranium, a prime ingredient of nuclear weapons, is at the heart of the current dispute with Iran. The Iranian government has agreed to stop enriching uranium temporarily, as part of its negotiations with Britain, France and Germany. But Iran has rebuffed the Europeans' demand for a permanent ban, saying enrichment is an integral part of its nuclear energy program.
 Dr. ElBaradei said his plan had elements in common with a proposal by President Bush, who wants to ban exports of nuclear technology to all countries that do not submit to inspections that many of them consider intrusive. But Dr. ElBaradei said his proposal, by being applied to all countries and by guaranteeing access to nuclear fuel, stood a better chance of winning broad support.
 ''To get everybody to agree, it would have to be a moratorium,'' he said. ''You would have a number of countries overseeing each other, to make sure there is no misuse of the system.''
 During the five-year ban, the world could overhaul the rules governing the transfer of nuclear technology and material, he added. He said he foresaw a bigger role for the United Nations Security Council, as well as for inspections by the International Atomic Energy Agency.
 Dr. ElBaradei said he was open to another proposal, by Mr. Bush in his antiproliferation initiative last year, to create a committee in the agency's 35-member governing board to speed the agency's response to crises like those that have been presented by disclosures about nuclear programs in Iran and North Korea.
 ''If the committee has an added value, I would welcome it,'' said Dr. ElBaradei, 62, an Egyptian diplomat.
 Such words are not likely to smooth over his relationship with the White House, which views him as soft on so-called rogue countries. He has urged the United States to get involved in Europe's talks with Iran. He describes military action -- an option left open by the Bush administration -- as ''really naive.''
 ''You need a good cop/bad cop in addressing every issue,'' Dr. ElBaradei said. ''But the good cop/bad cop have to be on the same wavelength. They have to share the same objective.''
 The United States has lobbied other members of the agency's governing board to deny Dr. ElBaradei a third term. His second four-year term ends in the fall. An American diplomat, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said the United States was invoking an informal agreement among several countries that directors of United Nations agencies should serve only two terms.
 Dr. ElBaradei said he had not spoken to Condoleezza Rice since her appointment as secretary of state. He did not meet with her new deputy, Robert B. Zoellick, who was in Davos. But he did chat with Senator John McCain, Republican of Arizona, who said in an interview later that Dr. ElBaradei deserved another term.
 Dr. ElBaradei professed to be ''fairly relaxed'' about Washington's opposition, saying no other country had come out publicly against him. There are no other declared candidates for his post.
 ''All I know is that an overwhelming majority wants me to continue to serve,'' he said, adding after a beat, ''whether they will sacrifice their life for me, or whether they are just prepared to live with me.''

HEADLINE: C.I.A. Chief Under First Bush Says He Has Declined New Job

BYLINE: By DOUGLAS JEHL

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Jan. 31 

 BODY:
Robert M. Gates, who was director of central intelligence under the first President Bush, said on Monday that he had turned down a request from the White House to return to Washington as the first director of national intelligence.
 Mr. Gates's decision appears to leave the White House without a leading candidate to fill the job, which was created by Congress last year to take charge of all 15 American intelligence agencies. Some members of Congress and senior intelligence officials have expressed concern that the absence of an appointee has created a leadership vacuum. 
 Six weeks have passed since President Bush signed the legislation that established the job. Some current and former intelligence officials have said they have been told that the White House was having a difficult time finding a suitable nominee for the post, whose duties include managing a $40 billion a year intelligence budget and refereeing disputes between the Pentagon and the Central Intelligence Agency.
 Mr. Gates, the president of Texas A&M University, said he was announcing his decision to end rumors that he might be leaving the university. He said that the request had presented him with ''the most difficult -- and close -- decision of my life,'' but that he declined the post last week.
 ''I was deeply honored to be asked and would have been honored to serve,'' Mr. Gates said in the announcement, posted on the university's Web site. But he said he had agreed to a request from the university's Board of Regents ''to remain as president at least through summer 2008.''
 The White House has said almost nothing in public about the search for a national intelligence chief. Mr. Gates's name had not been among those most widely mentioned, and it had not been known that he had been offered the job. Scott McClellan, the White House spokesman, said in a telephone interview that Mr. Gates had in fact been ''asked if he was interested in being considered'' for the post. But Mr. McClellan said that Mr. Gates had not been offered the job.
 Mr. Gates, a Soviet expert who spent much of his career as a C.I.A. analyst, served as director of central intelligence under President Bush's father from 1991 to 1993. He had served earlier as deputy national security adviser and as deputy director of central intelligence, from 1986 to 1989. He remains highly regarded in Washington and would have brought strong credentials and a deep knowledge of intelligence to the new post.
 Others being mentioned by current and former intelligence officials as possible candidates include William O. Studeman, a former deputy director of central intelligence and head of the National Security Agency; Laurence Silberman, a federal judge who is now co-chairman of a presidential commission on unconventional weapons; and Stephen Friedman, a former investment banker who until recently served as the chief coordinator for economic policy at the White House, and whom Mr. Bush recently named as chairman of the President's Foreign Intelligence Advisory Board.
 Lt. Gen. Michael V. Hayden of the Air Force, the current director of the National Security Agency, and Lt. Gen. James R. Clapper Jr., the director of the National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency, are being mentioned as candidates for No.2 jobs, either as deputy director of national intelligence or as deputy director of central intelligence. Porter J. Goss, the current director of central intelligence, is said by associates to be happy in that post and is not expected to be elevated to the national job.

HEADLINE: Shrinking, Detroit Faces Fiscal Nightmare

BYLINE: By JODI WILGOREN; Jeremy W. Peters contributed reporting for this article.

DATELINE: DETROIT, Jan. 29 

 BODY:
In the decade after he finished law school, Dan Varner watched with mounting exasperation as his black, middle-class peers defected from Detroit, beloved city of his birth. 
 He was the relentless city booster telling college-bound teenagers to come home after graduation, the one urging far-flung friends to move here, the man always talking about rebuilding the city while others abandoned it. 
 Then, one day, Mr. Varner said he realized ''there was really no one to have dinner with.'' He said he ''could count on one hand in the four blocks around me the number of men my age who had families.'' Enough became enough one spring day when he drove his children home past a band of teenage boys chanting profanity. 
 ''As a dad and a husband, you have an obligation to try to provide the best life possible,'' said Mr. Varner, 35, who in August moved his family to Ypsilanti Township, 45 minutes away. ''That was just something we couldn't find in Detroit.''
 The Varners are emblematic of the exodus that is plunging Detroit's government and school system into a fiscal nightmare, resulting in not just the slashing of staff and services, but also, for the first time, a fundamental right-sizing for a new, shrunken reality. The 139-square-mile Motor City now has a population of 911,000, less than half its 1950's peak.
 With the city facing a $389 million shortfall over three years and the threat of receivership, Mayor Kwame M. Kilpatrick announced this month that Detroit would soon lay off 686 people and eliminate 237 vacant jobs, cut employees' pay 10 percent across the board, end overnight bus service and close the aquarium. That is just a start, as consultants consider cutting departments -- like cultural affairs and the zoo, and health, transit and street lighting -- and ponder new taxes on everything from alcohol to vacant land.
 In the school district, which must submit to the state by Friday a deficit elimination plan in order to borrow the money it needs to operate, the chief executive, Kenneth Burnley, sent pink slips to 372 teachers before Christmas and plans to shutter 40 schools this summer. That sounds like a lot until it is laid against projections of enrollment plummeting to 100,000 by 2008, half what it was in 1999, which would result in the firing of 5,400 of 21,000 employees and closing 110 of 252 schools.
 The twin crises come as Mayor Kilpatrick, in the final year of his first term, is engulfed in a controversy over the city's two-year, $24,995 lease of a sport utility vehicle for his wife and three children. Dr. Burnley is also ensnared in an ugly fight after voters in November rejected the state-appointed board that hired him in favor of returning to an elected board this month. The board voted last week not to renew Dr. Burnley's contract, which expires June 30, but he remains a candidate for the one-year interim chief executive slot during the board transition. 
 So a dour mood has descended over a city that has been seeking a renaissance for more than a generation. The words people use to describe the situation are ''cataclysmic,'' ''debilitating,'' ''monumental,'' ''dire'' and ''grave.'' 
 ''To the extent bad politics continue to swamp good economics, I see no turnaround imminent,'' said David Littman, chief economist at Comerica Bank, who sat on a task force on city finances in 1975 and says Detroit's woes follow decades of denial about downsizing, privatization and competition. ''It does gravitate to a graveyard spiral.''
 Causes of the crisis are complex, and, unsurprisingly, much debated, but the story starts with some staggering numbers. Having lost one million residents in a half century, Detroit is expected to see its population drop by 50,000 more in the next five years; 15,168 business have departed since 1972. New loft developments credited with revitalizing downtown are mainly filled with empty-nesters, not the building blocks of a healthy community; white flight has become bright flight, with families and people earning more than $50,000 a year leading the way out of town.
 But the city's payroll still has the 18,000 employees of a decade ago (after spiking to 21,000 in the late 1990's), with 1.4 administrative employees for every 1,000 residents, far higher than the 1.0 median for major cities. Detroit, with antiquated technology like a 29-year-old payroll system, also spends more than most other cities on policing ($377 per capita, compared with a median of $221), garbage ($100 per capita versus Chicago's $62 and Milwaukee's $52) and other services. 
 Flight is even more furious from the public schools, which have lost 33,000 students since 1998-9, enough to fill 65 elementary schools (21 have closed). Competition that was supposed to promote improvement has instead hastened the district's collapse. Of the 9,300 students who did not return last fall, 3,400 went to charter schools and 1,300 to neighboring suburbs that recruit Detroit residents. 
 Those left are the hardest and most expensive to educate. One in seven Detroit students is in special education, and 72 percent are poor enough to qualify for free lunches, up from 61 percent four years ago.
 ''It's forced them to make cuts that would just make any other school district in the country cringe,'' said Michael Casserly, executive director of the Council of Great City Schools, which is based in Washington and works to promote urban education.
 Mr. Casserly said Detroit was in the worst crisis of any large school district in the nation.
 Making matters worse, the state has tried to plug its own shortfall by cutting payments to local governments. Cities got 3 percent less last year after a 3.5 percent cut the year before, and schools now get $124.45 less per student than they did in 2002, a loss of $19 million over two years for Detroit.
 The still-stagnant economy here -- Detroit's unemployment rate is 14 percent, compared with 7.3 percent statewide and 5.4 percent nationally -- punishes City Hall because the city relies more on income taxes than the property taxes that finance most other cities. The struggle to attract businesses and residents has been compounded by Detroit's tax burden, which is 5.5 times that of the average Michigan municipality. 
 But the city and school district could be out of money by the time the economy rebounds or the Legislature changes tax and financing formulas. So officials are negotiating with unions on buyouts and reductions in benefits, and wandering City Hall trying to consolidate jobs. Soon, business and civic leaders suggest, the city will hand street lights off to a local utility, push public health back to the county and try to create an independent transit authority. Among the more farfetched options is a head tax -- $252 per resident.
 ''This is the most public conversation we've had about the finances or the financial health of the city of Detroit, ever, in the history of this town,'' said Mayor Kilpatrick, who brought in municipal finance experts from across the country for a two-day forum this month. ''What we've been doing is looking at each operation in city government and asking a basic question: Is this a business that most cities are in? Is this a business that we should be in? And if we should, how can we afford to stay in it?''
 But the abstract discussion about whether a city should run buses does not soothe those who ride them in a city where one-third of the residents do not have cars. 
 ''I'm so ashamed they would consider such an inhumane thing,'' Annette Marshall, who has lived on the city's east side for 62 of her 68 years, said about the plan to eliminate 8 of Detroit's 52 bus routes and all bus service from midnight to 5 a.m. and after 8 p.m. Sundays. ''Without that, you won't have your city anymore.''
 Arbutus Garwood, 61, said her $14-an-hour wage could not cover $25 cab rides back and forth to some late-night shifts as a janitor at the MGM Grand casino.
 ''When you can't get to and from work there's a lot of things that break down,'' she said. ''I have a house. Grandchildren in college I help pay for. I know the city's in trouble, and they have to cut somewhere, but not the buses. I need them.''
 The imminent school closings, too, hit a community in its heart. 
 Andre Davis, 42, a city police officer, graduated from Detroit public schools and assumed that his 9-year-old twins would do the same. But ''if the school closings continue, I'm leaving the city,'' he said. 
 Mr. Davis continued: ''I'm not bashing Detroit, but I want more for my kids. It's embarrassing on a national scale.'' 
 The financial unraveling comes despite measurable improvements. Test scores are up and class sizes are down since Dr. Burnley's arrival in 2000. He has tripled the size of the security force, added 400 full-day kindergarten classrooms and enrolled 3,000 children in full-day preschool. But, still, people flee. 
 ''There's actually an organized effort to discount everything you do,'' Dr. Burnley said of outrage over the state-appointed board. ''Do you work on improving the public schools or do you get consumed by 'Oh, you took away my right to vote.' We've been dealing with that every day since we got here.''
 At a meeting last week of Detroit Renaissance, a group of business leaders founded in 1970, Mayor Kilpatrick, whose fancy suits and hip-hop persona have been a flashpoint for controversy since he took office, was greeted as though at a funeral: ''How you holding up?'' ''You O.K.?'' ''Anything I can do?'' 
 He brags about the 22 restaurants that have opened downtown in the past two years, the 7,400 new housing units coming in the next three, Super Bowl 2006 right here at Ford Field. But the 34-year-old mayor knows that his legacy will be slashing city government -- or, worse, failing to. 
 ''We've been a black eye on the landscape of America for too long,'' he said in an interview. ''I don't want that stigma attached to me and my kids anymore.'' 
 A few weeks ago he began working out with weights for the first time since he played college football. ''I'm getting in fighting shape,'' he said.

HEADLINE: Foes Will Need to Be Friends in Rebuilding of Sri Lanka

BYLINE: By SOMINI SENGUPTA

DATELINE: KILINOCHCHI, Sri Lanka, Jan. 28 

 BODY:
To this island racked by ethnic strife, civil war and then the wrecking ball of a tsunami, now comes a terrible boon: heaps of foreign reconstruction aid to quarrel over.
 The government estimates it needs some $3.5 billion to rebuild, including here in the north and east. Its chief enemy, the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam guerrilla faction, demands a hand in spending that windfall. The guerrillas control substantial portions of the north and east. 
 In an interview at the Tigers' headquarters here, the head of the group's political wing, S.P. Tamilselvan, said rebuilding in these areas, which the Tigers regard as an ancient Tamil homeland, would cost $1.32 billion.
 The Tigers have proposed a joint body, with representatives from government, the guerrillas and the Muslim political establishment, to decide how reconstruction aid is to be spent. No deal has been reached, but neither the state nor the rebels can go it alone. 
 Regarded as a terrorist organization by the United States and other governments, the Tigers have little chance of collecting direct foreign aid. Likewise, the Sri Lankan government would come under heavy criticism if it failed to ensure international donors that their money would be spent equitably, including in heavily damaged Tiger-controlled areas.
 In practical terms, little to no reconstruction can happen in the area without the Tigers' blessings. ''Unless they find ways of cooperating, neither the government nor the L.T.T.E. can do any rehabilitation,'' said Erik Solheim, Norway's special envoy to Sri Lanka, after talks with both sides in late January. ''They need each other.''
 Reaping reconstruction funds would clearly yield significant political benefits to rebels whose rallying cry for years has been self-rule and who are eager to demonstrate an ability to govern. The conflict between the ethnic Tamil north and east and the country's Sinhalese south has lasted more than two decades but a cease-fire has held since 2002. 
 Aided by a well-disciplined rank and file and a generous and politically active Tamil diaspora, the Tigers have already kicked into high gear to resuscitate the battered villages. In nearby Mullaitivu, the coastal stretch pummeled by the Dec. 26 disaster, bulldozers have cleared much of the wreckage. Boats that have been salvaged are being repaired in Tiger-sponsored workshops.
 Farther inland, masons hired by the Tigers' equivalent of a state planning ministry are building huts of cinderblock and palm fronds for displaced people currently crowded into schools. One hundred families are to be moved soon, and a school and community hall are to follow.
 Among the expatriate Tamils who arrived, armed with nationalist fervor, shortly after disaster struck was a water engineer from Birmingham, England, named Kalanithy Vairavamoorthy. The task that brought him was to set up a system to test water wells up and down the coast. The zeal that brought him here was altogether different.
 Mr. Vairavamoorthy said he considered this his homeland. He marveled at the organization and courtesy of the Tiger troops at the checkpoint at the entrance to their territory. He was delighted that they called him ''elder brother'' in Tamil, then helped him translate the Tamil-language paperwork. (Mr. Vairavamoorthy doesn't read Tamil, and his spoken Tamil is so rough that it makes fluent Tamil speakers close their ears in shame.)
 Mr. Vairavamoorthy, 38, was taken to Britain when he was 2 years old. He raised money for the Tamil movement as a teenager in Britain, considered (but ultimately resisted) joining the Tigers and came here, to the Tiger capital, to volunteer with the Tamil Rehabilitation Organization, officially an independent charity but closely allied to the rebels.
 He brooked no criticism of the Tigers. Asked about the widespread reports of the rebel recruitment of child soldiers -- Unicef has said 40 children have been drafted since the tsunami alone, a charge the Tigers have denied -- Mr. Vairavamoorthy said he was unaware of such allegations. ''There's a pride, you know,'' he said over dinner at the rebel guesthouse where he was staying. ''It's my home.''
 The Tamil Rehabilitation Organization has so far raised over $5 million for tsunami relief, but Tiger officials know that to deliver post-tsunami reconstruction will require the foreign aid that will soon trickle into the country. 
 The Tigers demand control over spending decisions, as Anton Balasingham, the Tiger's chief negotiator to the defunct peace talks with the government, put it, without ''political intervention from the south.''
 ''We want some equitable distribution of aid assistance from the donor community,'' Mr. Balasingham said in an interview as he inaugurated a boat-repair workshop in a nearby coastal village. He said his group was still in negotiations with the government to work out a joint mechanism on how to spend any aid. 
 ''We don't want a government mechanism,'' he added. ''They have proved to be inefficient and corrupt.''
 Government officials say it is too early to comment on the talks. 
 If and when a deal is reached, the stakes are certain to be very high. If it succeeds, analysts and diplomats say, it could help engender confidence between the two parties, at a time when communication had virtually broken down. Peace talks have been suspended since April 2003 and tensions were running high even before the tsunami.
 If cooperation fails, the consequences could be dire: if the warring parties cannot work together on reconstruction, Sri Lankans and others are likely to ask, how could they possibly agree on anything else, like a lasting peace deal?

HEADLINE: Black Migration, Both Slave And Free

BYLINE: By FELICIA R. LEE

 BODY:
The extraordinary range of African-American migrations -- from the earliest Africans who arrived to the recent movement of blacks back to the South -- is the focus of a new Web site and an exhibition of recent research that could redefine African-American history, said scholars involved with the project, which was announced yesterday at the Schomburg Center for Research in Black Culture in Harlem. ''In Motion: The African-American Migration Experience,'' a three-year project that cost $2.4 million, is probably the largest single documentation of the migrations of all people of African ancestry in North America, said Howard Dodson, director of the center, part of the New York Public Library.
 The exhibition at the Schomburg Center's Exhibition Hall, which opened yesterday, showcases many of the images, maps and music assembled for the project. But the project's 16,500 pages of essays, books, articles and manuscripts, as well as 8,300 illustrations and 60 maps are also available on the center's Web site (schomburgcenter.org) and could encourage a national conversation on the very definition of African-American, Mr. Dodson, a historian, said in an interview. 
 ''This is a huge story,'' Mr. Dodson said. ''This will serve as a catalyst for the continued re-thinking of who the African-American community is. For the first time, here's a project that explores the extraordinary diversity of the African-American community. This is organized around 13 migrations, 2 of them involuntary: the domestic slave trade and the trans-Atlantic slave trade.''
 Broadening the examination of migration beyond the slave trade means ''you come away with some very different perspectives,'' Mr. Dodson said. Twice as many sub-Saharan Africans -- about one million -- have migrated to the United States in the last 30 years as during the entire era of the trans-Atlantic slave trade, project organizers said.
 The project is chock full of illuminating facts. It shows that in recent years, twice as many African-Americans have moved from the North to the South as from the South to other regions. From 1995 to 2000 approximately 680,000 African-Americans moved to the South and 330,000 left, for a net gain of 350,000. 
 And for the first time, all the elements of the African diaspora -- natives of Africa, Americans whose ancestors were enslaved Africans, Afro-Caribbeans, Central and South Americans of African descent, as well as Europeans with African or Afro-Caribbean roots -- can be found in the United States. 
 This has happened in only the last 15 years and is prompting a far broader view of the term African-American, said Sylviane Diouf, a historian who served as the content manager for the project.
 In addition to the Web site and the exhibition, the project includes a book, ''In Motion: The African-American Migration Experience,'' released by National Geographic last month, and a Black History Month education kit, with lesson plans and a bibliography. 
 ''It's really a new interpretation of African-American history,'' Ms. Diouf said. ''We're seeing the centrality of migration in the African-American experience. What we're seeing now with the new immigration from Haiti, the Caribbean and Africa is a new diversity, people coming with their languages, their culture, their food.''
 Quintard Taylor, a professor of American history at Washington University in Seattle, who explored 400 years of migration in what is now the Western United States, said the project's Web site alone opened up new possibilities. 
 ''Now you have a potential audience of millions,'' said Mr. Taylor, whose research showed that some of the first settlers of places like San Antonio, San Francisco, Santa Fe and Tucson were people of African ancestry. 
 Beyond that, he said, most people know only bits and pieces of the story of the African diaspora. Now they can make the connections. 
 ''The central theme of finding political freedom and economic opportunity was as strong for those who ventured to Los Angeles from central Mexico in 1750, as for those who came to New York from Jamaica or the South in 1950,'' Mr. Taylor said in an e-mail message. 
 The project's scholars represent a range of mostly American universities, including the University of Chicago, Columbia and the University of Delaware. They were commissioned by the Schomburg, and most expanded on research that had already yielded scholarly material. 
 The money for the project, Mr. Dodson said, came in part from a grant from the Institute of Museum and Library Services, a federal agency, through the efforts of the Congressional Black Caucus and Representative Charles B. Rangel, Democrat of New York. 
 The research topics included the movements of blacks out of the United States to places like Liberia, Trinidad, Canada, Haiti and Mexico; the 19th-century migration north of both free and enslaved blacks; the migration of blacks in the West and even the journeys of runaway slaves. Some said their findings were surprising or at least tweaked conventional theories.
 Loren Schweninger, a professor of history at the University of North Carolina at Greensboro, said his research on runaways showed that many more fled to other parts of the South than made it North. Of the 50,000 or more slaves who ran away each year, perhaps only 2,000 made it North; it was just too difficult, for one reason. ''And that tells you a lot about slavery,'' he said.
 James O. Horton, a professor of American studies and history at George Washington University who explored migration to the North in the 19th century, found that inner cities were once far more racially integrated than now. Lacking public transportation, people in the same industries lived in the same areas and many blacks lived near their white employers, even wealthy ones.
 Harry Belafonte, whose parents immigrated from Jamaica, said at a news conference at the Schomburg yesterday that the project would dispel myths.
 ''I was born colored, after that Negro, then black and now we've settled on African-American,'' the 77-year-old singer said. ''No other group has taken a century just to learn what to call ourselves and what others should call us. We will use this Web site not only to be more prideful, but to allow the rest of the world to understand what they've done to us and what they've done with us.''

HEADLINE: Accents of Africa: A New Outsourcing Frontier

BYLINE: By MARC LACEY

DATELINE: NAIROBI, Kenya, Jan. 30 

 BODY:
Susan Mina, a Kenyan who has never stepped foot out of Africa, speaks English like the haughtiest of Britons. She can also put on a fair imitation of an American accent by swallowing all her words. Still, every once in a while, some Swahili slips out of her and that is not at all helpful as she tries to enhance Africa's role in the global explosion of outsourcing.
 It happened the other day when she was trying to get a British man to sign up for a new cellular telephone service. He was in his home, minding his own business. She sat near the Nairobi airport, doing her business as a sales agent for KenCall, Kenya's first international call center. The man's accent -- she pegged it as Irish -- was unintelligible to her. ''Pole sana?'' she blurted out, which is what one says in Swahili instead of ''Huh?''
 Controlling one's Swahili is just one of the challenges that Kenyans are facing as they play catch-up in an industry that India and other countries have turned into major job generators. 
 Kenya's regular phone lines are so abysmal that the founders of KenCall had to go through the cumbersome process of getting government approval to use a costly satellite hookup. Even more dollars were burned on an elaborate generator system aimed at keeping KenCall's computer screens running during Nairobi's frequent power failures.
 ''Africa needs to raise its game,'' said Russell Southwood, who publishes an online newsletter on telecommunications in Africa at balancingact-africa.com. ''It needs to show the world that it can do more than pick minerals out of the ground and grow fruits and vegetables.''
 KenCall is now up and running, and eager to lure business from Western companies that want cheap labor -- but educated cheap labor like Ms. Mina, who has a university degree but earns less than $5,000 a year, not as much as a fast-food cashier would make in the United States.
 Although just a tiny entrant in the call-center market, KenCall has enough clients to keep 200 telephone operators busy. Some of the Kenyan sales agents dial up Britons and urge them to save money on their cellular phones. Others dial up Americans and ask if they are interested in refinancing their home mortgages. Without knowing it, some Americans even dial up Kenya, responding to advertisements offering low-income grants or job assistance.
 After looking on for years as Asia cashed in on the outsourcing boom, Africa is now aggressively seeking its piece of the action.
 Datamonitor, a consulting firm that follows outsourcing, estimates that there are 54,000 call-center jobs in the most advanced countries in Africa, out of a total of 6 million such jobs worldwide. But the 54,000 figure only includes South Africa and the countries of North Africa, not emerging call centers in places like Ghana and Kenya.
 ''There's a lot of potential in Africa,'' said Peter Ryan, an analyst at Datamonitor. ''India, the Philippines and Canada are relatively mature, and that means wages and real estate are higher. So companies are asking, 'Are there other locations?'''
 South Africa is far ahead of the rest of the continent, with an estimated 500 call centers employing about 31,000 people. South Africa boasts that the accents of its workers are neutral enough to fool English speakers everywhere. It also has the same time zones as parts of Europe, making doing business easier.
 Ghana, which makes similar claims about its population's understandable English, has lured Affiliated Computer Services Inc., an outsourcing company based in Dallas that employs about 2,000 Ghanaians to process health forms for Aetna and other insurers.
 With vast populations of French speakers, Africa is working to claim that part of the market as well. French-language call centers are operating in Morocco, Senegal, Tunisia and Madagascar, all of them dialing up Parisians and pretending to be just down the ''rue.''
 ''They say, 'You have a charming accent,''' Fanta Diop, a supervisor at a call center in Dakar, the Senegalese capital, told Reuters recently. ''They never guess it's black Africa.''
 Much of the outsourcing in Africa is focused on telemarketing, which is less profitable than processing medical forms or acting as the customer service department of an overseas corporation. But making cold calls is considered an entree to the highly competitive industry.
 ''The market for this is huge,'' said Nicholas A. Nesbitt, the chief executive of KenCall, which he founded with his younger brother, Eric, and his brother-in-law, Steve Liggins, a retired banker. ''It's not possible to put a figure on it. Any job that is being done that doesn't require face-to-face contact can be outsourced. And why not to Kenya?''
 Kenya's political transition in December 2002 prompted KenCall's founders to return from overseas and invest in the country. The new government has had a rocky start in fighting corruption and creating new jobs -- its two main campaign promises. But Mr. Nesbitt said he was able to set up the call center without doling out any bribes -- ''not even so much as a cup of coffee,'' he said.
 Not only does the country offer an advantage that stems from its tepid economic growth over the years, its people have what Mr. Nesbitt calls a ''pleasant Anglicized accent.'' Many of its college graduates are unemployed or underemployed, and are eager to dial around the world for a paycheck that would be considered meager in the United States -- about $4,500 a year, including performance bonuses. That income is well above that of the average person in Kenya, where subsistence farming is the most popular job. Still, it only provides for a rather no-frills life in the costly capital. 
 Ms. Mina, one of KenCall's top sellers, graduated from a local university in 2002 but searched in vain for a job. ''I have so many friends who did not go to university and they are driving big cars,'' she said. ''It's been so frustrating.''
 One of her colleagues, Brian Mawanda, became so used to rejection in his job search that he believes the experience is helping him deal with all those people he calls who are not interested in what he is selling.
 ''I've had so many doors slammed in my face,'' said Mr. Mawanda, who graduated from college in 2001 with degrees in business administration and communications. ''Now, the worst someone can do is insult me and hang up.''
 Some of KenCall's agents must change their names on the job, trading Wanjira for Wendy, for instance. And they receive nonstop feedback from supervisors on their accents, their sales pitches and their ability to think on their feet.
 One frequent issue is the Kenyan habit of letting out a little grunt when someone else is talking, which is supposed to reassure speakers that their words are being heard. Some agents grow alarmed if the person on the other end of the line is quiet and ask with alarm: ''Hello? Hello? Are you there?''
 Some call-center workers have traveled the world, picking up their accents in the process. For others, KenCall is their virtual travel. Ms. Mina, for instance, visualizes herself sitting in the living rooms of the foreigners she is talking to on the phone.
 And even without leaving Nairobi, she and other agents are learning about cultural differences. Britons, the agents say, are far more likely to chat extensively with a telemarketer even if they have no interest in the product. Americans are a different story. They are abrupt, the Kenyans say.
 All the dialers, even those who have honed their accents to perfection, are inevitably asked where they are calling from. Usually, the agents say no more than that they are calling on behalf of a company based in, say, York. But that does not fool some people, who often receive calls from India and other parts of the world.
 When KenCall's agents do fess up that they are in Africa, there is inevitably a pause at the other end of the line. And then the reaction comes. It could be an anti-African slur. It could be just silence and the slamming down of the phone. But every once in a while, there are prospective buyers who have vacationed in Kenya and a rehash begins of the wonderful time they had.
 That is when Ms. Mina's heart starts beating fast. She plays along, does a bit of tourism promotion for her country and then, ever so gently, steers the conversation back to the product at hand. ''I still remember when one man who I talked to for so long finally said, 'Sign me up,''' she said with a smile.

HEADLINE: Phoenix Moves to Put Itself on the Biotechnology Map

BYLINE: By MORRIS NEWMAN

DATELINE: PHOENIX 

 BODY:
Taking the first step in an ambitious, if risky, strategy to create a biotechnology center, the city of Phoenix has completed work on a $46 million medical laboratory building dedicated to genetic research.
 Finished in December, the 170,000-square-foot laboratory stands on a 15-acre downtown area known as the Phoenix Biomedical Center at Copper Square. Although the official opening is not until March, two nonprofit research groups -- the Translational Genomics Research Institute, known as TGen, and the International Genomics Consortium -- have already moved into four floors that they leased before construction.
 Another floor of the six-story laboratory is to be occupied by the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases, an arm of the National Institutes of Health, leaving only one full floor still to be leased.
 City officials plan to build five additional structures and refurbish three buildings, which were part of a high school. All this development is to produce as much as one million square feet of space and is to take place in the next five years. The intent, according to city officials, is to create a research cluster as a lure to both academics and biotechnology company start-ups. 
 Phoenix joins a national race involving cities across North America, each seeking to position itself as a hub for the rapidly growing biotechnology industry.
 ''Phoenix is just the latest of the cities and states that have identified biotech as the growth area of the next 10 years,'' said Keith Brownlie, area practice leader for biotechnology in metropolitan New York at Ernst & Young, the accounting and consulting firm. The city, he added, is among many that are ''looking for higher-salaried white-collar people, such as researchers.''
 Unlike some of its competitors -- including such industry strongholds as the Boston-Cambridge area, the San Francisco Bay region, San Diego and the Research Triangle area of North Carolina -- Phoenix is starting from scratch. 
 Arizona does not even figure on the list of 16 states and Canadian provinces monitored by Ernst & Young as the largest biotechnology markets in North America. That list was led by California, Massachusetts and Quebec, according to a report by the firm in 2004. 
 ''It's an act of will,'' Richard Love, chief operating officer of TGen, said of the drive to create a biotechnology hub in Phoenix. 
 Willful or not, when judged by fund-raising, the biotechnology effort appears broadly supported in Arizona: in a single eight-month period in 2003, the city of Phoenix raised $100 million from public and private sources, including the state of Arizona and the Flinn Foundation, a private organization started by a Phoenix doctor in 1965, whose grant recipients include medical causes. The city's contribution is limited to the construction cost for the laboratory building. 
 Still, the amount raised in Phoenix is a tiny fraction of the $3 billion that voters in California have authorized that state to spend for stem cell research. 
 Phoenix's sum also includes $5 million from the Salt River Pima-Maricopa Indian Community of Maricopa County, Ariz., which operates casinos and which is seeking to sponsor research that could benefit the tribe's members, according to H. Janette Torres, the city's technology industry manager. 
 ''There is a high incidence of diabetes in the Native American population, and the tribe was interested in partnering with TGen by funding diabetes research,'' she said.
 From the biotechnology fund, the city provided $46 million to construct the laboratory to TGen's specifications for the group to rent and pledged an additional $12 million in operating costs for the two research groups.
 In its bid for biotechnology success, Phoenix is seemingly trying to follow the classic recipe for biotech centers, by seeking to replicate the mix of education, industry and government found in established research capitals.
 Medical schools and the researchers and entrepreneurs they attract are part of that formula. Accordingly, Phoenix has persuaded three public universities -- the University of Arizona, Arizona State University and Northern Arizona University -- to combine forces and create the city's first four-year medical school near the Phoenix Biotech Center. It is scheduled to hold its first classes in 2006.
 Even the local school district is joining in by building a new science-oriented high school near the center, with the hope of expanding the city's biomedical labor force. 
 For city officials, the biotechnology move is the means to create new economic momentum in Phoenix's thinly developed downtown. ''We had been looking for a way to bring 'intelligent capital' to our region and create some density of population in our downtown area,'' said Patrick Grady, director of the city's Downtown Development Office.
 Although Phoenix's population has increased to 1.4 million -- it was the sixth-largest city in the country in 2000 -- most of its growth is away from downtown in a spreading circle of suburban sprawl. Most new office buildings and shopping centers are in outlying areas of Phoenix like the developments along Camelback Road three miles north of downtown, and in suburbs like Scottsdale about eight miles east.
 Phoenix first prospered a century ago as a railroad depot for cattle, cotton and citrus. In recent decades, the city enjoyed some success as a center for software and silicon chip manufacturing. With growth in those industries flagging, city officials looked for new economic engines to lift downtown. ''We had folks looking into retail development, and other folks looking at residential development,'' Mr. Grady recalled. 
 In 2002, the Flinn Foundation commissioned a report about the Arizona economy from the Battelle Memorial Institute. The report found that Arizona had a little-noticed concentration of research and biotechnology companies with strengths in cancer research, neurosciences and bioengineering.
 Following up quickly on the report, Phoenix officials began the biotechnology drive the same year, by responding to a request for proposals for a new headquarters for TGen, a research group formed by scientists formerly affiliated with the National Institutes of Health. Other areas competing to attract the company included the Baltimore-Bethesda area of Maryland, Atlanta and Houston. Phoenix offered to construct a building to TGen's specifications quickly and to provide the $12 million subsidy. TGen's rent has not been made public.
 Designed and built by a venture of DPR Construction Inc. of Redwood City, Calif., and the Smith Group architecture firm, based in Detroit, the straightforward laboratory stands near the center of downtown, close to City Hall, the city's expanding convention center and a theater district. 
 Although the research groups have barely moved into the building, city officials are set to start construction this summer on a second building at a cost of $27 million. It is to be occupied by the Arizona Biomedical Collaborative, a research venture of the state's three public universities. 
 There are risks in the costly effort, according to Mr. Brownlie, the bio-industry consultant. To succeed, Phoenix will need ''the basic infrastructure and the facilities that support the personnel who work in biotech companies,'' starting with ''a successful research park,'' where start-up companies can turn discoveries into products. 
 Competing states offer a variety of incentives to biotechnology companies, like financing from settlements from tobacco-industry lawsuits. Other states, including New Jersey, allow companies to sell their net operating losses, which can be used as tax credits by those who buy them.
 Despite the high number of communities racing to capitalize on biotechnology, Mr. Grady said, the two anchor organizations in the new laboratory will make Phoenix competitive in the genomics niche. ''We are not just building another biotech center,'' he said. ''We are on the leading edge of a very important technology. The genomics field is not more than five years old.''
 Arizona can compete not only with direct incentives but also with affordable housing, according to Ms. Torres. ''You can buy a large three-bedroom house in Phoenix for $230,000, which would barely get you a condo in California,'' she said.
 For Mr. Grady, however, ''what will bring people here will be the science,'' he said.
 ''All the amenities are secondary.''

HEADLINE: Let's Put This Speech to Bed

BYLINE: By Jeff Shesol. 
Jeff Shesol, a speechwriter to President Bill Clinton from 1998 to 2001, is the author of ''Mutual Contempt: Lyndon Johnson, Robert Kennedy and the Feud That Defined a Decade.''

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
AT this moment, clustered in front of a single computer screen, speechwriters are putting the finishing touches on this evening's address. They have been working for weeks. Tonight, at long last, their words will take flight.
 If only America were listening. It probably won't be, because these speechwriters are working on the other speech -- not the State of the Union address, but the Democratic response. Tonight's rebuttal will be brought to you by the minority leaders of the House and Senate, Nancy Pelosi and Harry Reid. Even in Washington, the rebuttal will elicit, at most, a collective yawn -- unless it takes a dramatic turn. If the two speakers bicker, for example, or announce a decision to join the Republican Party. That could get people talking. 
 Regardless of what happens tonight, the genre itself is in need of rethinking. The rebuttal is a dog of a speech. If it achieves anything it is a lightness of being, an instant irrelevance. Or worse: the State of the Union response has a long record of diminishing anyone who delivers it. It's time either to reform the rebuttal -- or retire it.
 It wasn't supposed to be this way, but the history of the rebuttal speech reveals few, if any, moments of glory, and not a single quotable line, despite the best efforts of speechwriters, including myself. This doomed and dreary business began in 1966, a few moments after President Lyndon Johnson concluded his State of the Union address. Republican leaders did not respond to the speech immediately, but instead announced their intention to respond. Five days passed. Finally, they delivered a speech so supportive of Johnson's policy in Vietnam that the White House press secretary thanked them publicly.
 The rebuttal's low-water mark came in 1996, when Senator Bob Dole -- then a White House hopeful -- scowled and slashed his way through the speech. Reviews, especially among Republicans, were unsparing. ''I gave a fireside chat the other night,'' Mr. Dole said later, ''and the fire went out.''
 In fairness to Mr. Dole, it must be noted that the deck is stacked against any who dare to follow the State of the Union. Every year, the speech is preceded by a Super Bowl-like buildup, and Washington's version of the Hollywood red carpet: the familiar procession of Supreme Court justices in black robes, generals adorned with medals and, then, with a booming introduction and lots of backslapping, the president of the United States.
 Never mind that the address itself is rarely notable; ''laundry list'' is the usual epithet. But the surroundings -- the majestic House chamber -- confer a kind of grandeur on the speaker.
 When the speech is over, the networks cut to a cramped room somewhere inside (or, it appears, underneath) the Capitol. The flag in the backdrop seems real enough, but the leather-bound volumes in the bookcase look fake. It is not an auspicious environment for a call to action. There is no audience; there will be no applause.
 Can anything be done to save this speech? Is there some way to make it mean something, to capture just a little of the limelight and remind the public that the United States has a two-party system?
 One possibility is to get out of that confounded room and find a better venue. Both parties have tried. During the Clinton presidency, one Republican delivered the response to an audience of high school students; another spoke at a partisan pep rally. In the past few years, Democrats have taken to issuing a ''prebuttal'' -- like the one that Ms. Pelosi and Mr. Reid delivered at the National Press Club earlier this week.
 A better idea is to forget about the packaging and fix the product. The biggest problem with the rebuttal is that speakers and speechwriters tend to see it as a downsized State of the Union -- there may be less laundry on the list, but the speech is still overstuffed, lacking in coherence and clarity. Iraq, Social Security, health care, the economy -- if the president's speech covers it all, the response will, too, however hastily.
 Why the pressure to check every box? Because the opposition party, by definition, has no president, and thus no ultimate authority, no final word on the core message of the speech. Instead, the rebuttal has to satisfy a party caucus -- and that's a lot of editors. As a result, the response, no less than the State of Union speech itself, is written by committee.
 A short speech should have a sharp focus. It ought to make one clear, provocative argument and leave the audience with no doubt about the speaker's purpose. A less ambitious speech may well be a more effective one. For example, the Democrats could use their less-than-equal time to define an exit strategy for Iraq and leave it at that. Or they could present a plan to save Social Security from privatization. With an unambiguous message in hand, the Democrats could then build on their speech as the president does -- by heading out to the heartland, repeating a single, memorable refrain, and making the case for a clear course of action.
 If that doesn't work, there's a third possibility: Call it off. Let the president have his night. No one would miss the annual response; few would even notice it was gone. And while the State of the Union Message may be a constitutional requirement, a rebuttal, thankfully, is not.

HEADLINE: Shares Climb on Earnings And a Drop in Oil Prices

BYLINE: By The Associated Press

 BODY:
Stocks moved higher yesterday as strong earnings and a drop in oil prices offset the impact of lower-than-expected manufacturing activity and apprehension about the Federal Reserve's impending decision on rates.
 The Dow Jones industrial average closed up 62 points, or 0.59 percent, at 10,551.94. The broader gauges were also higher. The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index rose 8.14 points, or 0.69 percent, to 1,189.41. The Nasdaq composite index added 6.29 points, or 0.31 percent, to 2,068.70. 
 Wall Street expects the Federal Reserve's Open Market Committee to raise short-term interest rates by another 0.25 percentage point at the conclusion of its two-day meeting today. The statement that accompanies the decision will also be closely examined for clues about what lies ahead. Worry about the Fed meeting kept some investors on the sidelines, but trading was still brisk -- a fact that analysts found encouraging after January's steep declines.
 But economists were somewhat disappointed by the Institute for Supply Management's report yesterday on manufacturing. The group's index of manufacturing activity affirmed the rebound at the nation's factories, but not at the pace economists expected. The reading came in at 56.4, down from a revised 57.3 in December, and just under forecasts of 57.
 Oil prices, which have stayed high despite the relative success of weekend elections in Iraq and OPEC's decision to maintain current production targets, declined on speculation that a government report to be released today will show an increase in United States oil stockpiles. Crude futures settled down $1.08, at $47.12, on the New York Mercantile Exchange.
 January was an uncharacteristically poor one for stocks, with the S.&P. 500 dropping 2.53 percent. This has raised some concern on Wall Street, because January's performance often foreshadows trading for the rest of the year. 
 ''You're definitely seeing some institutions out there that held back in January that would've been out there had the markets gone up instead,'' said Bill Groenveld, head trader at vFinance Investments. ''I do believe, however, that if we break this downtrend and have a solid move up, we'll see more people getting back in.''
 Lifting the Dow, the financial services giant American Express surged $3.40, or 6.4 percent, to $56.75, after announcing plans to spin off its financial advisory business to its shareholders and focus on its charge and credit card, payments processing and travel businesses. Shareholders were to get all of the stock in the new company; the spinoff is expected to be completed in the third quarter.
 Among the day's decliners, Tyco International fell $1.63, or 4.5 percent, to $34.51, after it reported a 1.4 percent drop in quarterly profits as charges for divestitures and early retirement of debt outweighed surging sales. Excluding the charges, earnings matched Wall Street forecasts.
 In other earnings news, Boston Scientific, the medical device maker, rose $1.75, or 5.3 percent, to $34.81, after beating per-share earnings estimates by a penny. A sharp rise in sales of coronary stents, which more than offset one-time charges from stock-option modifications and a change in tax law.
 MGM Mirage, the owner of the Bellagio and MGM Grand casinos, gained $1.98, or 2.8 percent, to $73.79, after it posted lower fourth-quarter earnings because of big gains in the year-ago period. But strong customer spending and significant room rate increases helped increase profit above Wall Street expectations. Revenue rose 11 percent, and the company reiterated its forecast for the current quarter.
 Advancers outnumbered decliners by more than 2 to 1 on the New York Stock Exchange.
 Treasury prices fell yesterday in advance of the Federal Reserve's decision on interest rates. The 10-year note fell 3/32, to 100 28/32. The yield, which moves in the opposite direction from the price, rose to 4.14 percent, from 4.13 on Monday. 
 Here are the results of yesterday's auction of four-week Treasury bills:

HEADLINE: Health Secretary Calls for Medicaid Changes

BYLINE: By ROBERT PEAR

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Feb. 1 

 BODY:
Michael O. Leavitt, the secretary of health and human services, called Tuesday for sweeping changes in Medicaid that would cut payments for prescription drugs and give states new power to reduce or reconfigure benefits for millions of low-income people.
 In his first speech as secretary, Mr. Leavitt also said it should be more difficult for elderly people to qualify for Medicaid by transferring assets to their children.
 ''Medicaid must not become an inheritance protection plan,'' Mr. Leavitt said at a convention of health care executives here. ''Right now, many older Americans take advantage of Medicaid loopholes to become eligible for Medicaid by giving away assets to their children. There is a whole industry that actually helps people shift costs to the taxpayer.'' 
 Medicaid helps pay the bills for two-thirds of the 1.6 million people in nursing homes in the United States.
 Mr. Leavitt said President Bush wanted to join Congress in an effort to rein in the cost of Medicaid, the nation's largest health insurance program. Medicaid spending has shot up 63 percent in the last five years. Federal and state outlays now total more than $300 billion a year.
 Anticipating the proposals by the Bush administration, many governors have banded together in a bipartisan effort to stave off restrictions on federal Medicaid spending. In a letter to Congress in December, the National Governors Association said it was unacceptable to shift federal costs to the states as part of a deficit-reduction strategy.
 Meanwhile, some governors, including George E. Pataki of New York, have turned to Medicaid in trying to address their own budget pressures. Some states have dropped recipients, set strict limits on spending and reduced benefits. 
 One of the biggest changes Mr. Leavitt suggested Tuesday was to provide a more ''flexible package of benefits'' to women and children in many low-income families.
 States already have a large degree of discretion, but the basic package of benefits required under Medicaid is more comprehensive than that of most private plans. The Medicaid package is also more extensive than the benefits required under the Children's Health Insurance Program, which is less likely to cover mental health services, vision care and dental treatments.
 ''Medicaid is not meeting its potential,'' Mr. Leavitt said. ''It is rigidly inflexible and inefficient. And, worst of all, it is not financially sustainable.''
 Mr. Leavitt, a former three-term governor of Utah, laid out several options that he said could save Medicaid more than $50 billion in the coming decade. Even with these changes, he said, Medicaid spending will probably grow more than 7 percent a year.
 The Congressional Budget Office said last week that under current law, with no changes, Medicaid would grow an average 7.8 percent a year in the coming decade, compared with an average 7.9 percent a year in the prior decade.
 Mr. Leavitt said the federal government could save $15 billion in the next 10 years if it stopped ''overpaying for prescription drugs.'' 
 George M. Reeb, assistant inspector general at the Department of Health and Human Services, told Congress in December that most states paid for drugs based on the ''average wholesale price,'' a list price that bears little resemblance to the prices actually paid by retail pharmacies serving Medicaid recipients. 
 Patrick J. O'Connell, an assistant attorney general of Texas, testified at the same hearing that some pharmacies had received ''windfall profits'' and that some manufacturers had ''purposely reported false and inflated prices to Texas Medicaid.''
 Mr. Leavitt said Tuesday that Medicaid could save $4.5 billion over the next 10 years if it restricted the ability of elderly people to gain Medicaid coverage of long-term care by transferring assets to their children.
 Finally, he said, the federal government could save $40 billion in the next decade if it cracked down on ''accounting gimmicks'' that he said were used by states to shift costs to the federal treasury.
 The Government Accountability Office, an investigative arm of Congress, said last week that such moves by the states ''generate excessive federal matching payments'' and ''cost the federal government several billions of dollars each year.''
 In 2003, Mr. Bush proposed giving states a fixed amount of federal money for people the states had voluntarily decided to cover under Medicaid. Democrats and advocates for the poor denounced this as a block grant. Under such an arrangement, they said, Medicaid would be less responsive to changes in the economy and to increases in poverty and medical costs.

HEADLINE: For Frist, Tough Agenda and Conflicting Pressure

BYLINE: By ROBIN TONER; David D. Kirkpatrick contributed reporting for this article.

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Feb. 1 

 BODY:
The fate of President Bush's domestic agenda rests, in many ways, with Bill Frist, the Senate majority leader, a man confronted on a typical day with anger on the left, demands on the right and a general anxiety attack in the Republican center over Social Security.
 Dr. Frist is a busy man. In the past six days he has raced from the Senate to the glittery World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, back to a Republican retreat in West Virginia, then back to the nonglittery Senate, where he began the debate on Tuesday on the nomination of Alberto R. Gonzales as attorney general, hailing him as ''a manifestation of the American dream.''In short, Dr. Frist, a 52-year-old former heart surgeon from Tennessee, is trying to balance a lot these days: the demands of the Senate; his own ambitions, possibly presidential; White House expectations that he deliver on an extraordinarily difficult agenda, including the president's proposal to partly privatize Social Security; and renewed pressure from the Democrats, who still have enough votes to grind the Senate to a halt.
 The central problem for Dr. Frist is that he needs the Democrats, or at least a few of them, but he also needs to hold together a sprawling, predominately conservative Republican caucus. So he promises more bipartisanship, but only to a point. 
 ''I can play hardball as well as anybody,'' he said, unprompted, at the end of a recent interview. ''That's what I did, cut people's hearts out. On the other hand, I do it to cure them, to heal them, to make them better.''
 Democrats, whose hearts are presumably on the table, express skepticism. ''I think Frist's personal instincts are to try to be bipartisan, and at least, to a degree, accommodating,'' said Senator Charles E. Schumer, Democrat of New York. ''But I think he is pulled by his caucus and may well be pulled by his presidential ambitions to be more hard-line.''
 Dr. Frist, who has a calming bedside manner, a staunchly conservative record and an intense but strikingly brief political background, now holds one of the hardest jobs in American politics. Senator Lamar Alexander, another Republican from Tennessee, said: ''It's a little like being a university president, which I once was. It sounds like you're in charge, but you're not.''
 The Senate requires 60 votes for true control, the number necessary to break a filibuster and end debate. The chamber has 55 Republicans, which means that at crucial moments, like moving for a vote on controversial judicial nominees or Social Security, leaders need support across party lines.
 Dr. Frist and the Democrats are heading for an extraordinary showdown over filibustering judicial nominations. Democrats have blocked 10 of about 50 nominees to the appellate courts. Dr. Frist is warning that unless Democrats allow all of Mr. Bush's nominees to go to a floor vote this year, he may seek to change the rules of the Senate to end judicial filibusters. 
 Democrats say it would fundamentally change the nature of the Senate, and vow to retaliate with parliamentary warfare. Senator Harry Reid of Nevada, the new Democratic leader, said the rule change -- called the nuclear option by Democrats -- would affect the chances for bipartisanship across the board. ''You can't have it both ways,'' Mr. Reid said in an interview. ''We're not going to have the nuclear option one day, and kiss and hug the next.''
 Dr. Frist must balance all these calculations, while recognizing, he said, that ''I've got 750 days left, and in those 750 days I've got an agenda that can be historic, working with this president and with 55 Republican senators, and to accomplish that, every day that goes by is a day lost.''
 After those 750 days, he says, he will head home, having served just two terms as he intended in 1994, when he ran as a citizen-lawmaker in an anti-incumbent year. ''I still see myself as a heart surgeon from Tennessee who happens to be in a position of governing, helping govern this body and govern the country,'' he said.
 He acknowledged the presidential speculation around him, saying he was not averse to it but quickly adding, ''That is not my goal.''
 Last week, he and other Republican leaders unveiled a legislative agenda topped by Mr. Bush's Social Security proposal, which is still undefined. But it is not clear how Dr. Frist will hold his party together through something as politically fraught as overhauling Social Security.
 One veteran lobbyist, who did not want to be identified because he did not want to antagonize Republicans, said: ''What held the Republicans together in the Senate last time was the desire to see Bush through to re-election and a sense that their fates were tied to his. That's no longer true.''
 In fact, there is widespread anxiety in Republican circles these days, and no real consensus on how to achieve the president's domestic goals or even, perhaps, whether doing so is worth the price. The Republican caucus ranges from the moderate ''blue state'' senators -- Olympia J. Snowe and Susan Collins of Maine, Lincoln Chaffee of Rhode Island and Arlen Specter of Pennsylvania -- to the firebrand freshmen who are eager to lead the charge for the conservative social agenda and against government spending.
 Ms. Snowe, a power broker on the Finance Committee, is already voicing questions and concerns about diverting payroll taxes to private Social Security accounts.
 Dr. Frist must tend this Republican caucus with care. A scion of a wealthy Nashville medical family who spent years as a transplant surgeon, he is known as a workaholic who sends BlackBerry messages throughout the night and into the early morning. He meets weekly with Senate committee leaders and is praised by moderates like Ms. Snowe as being accessible.
 But he is also attentive to a broader conservative base, feeding the speculation about his national ambitions. When social conservatives celebrated their election victory at a party before the presidential inauguration, Dr. Frist was there, saying he and his wife had walked six blocks through the freezing cold to be with them.
 His high-profile international travel -- he flew to Southeast Asia, Iraq and Europe last month, then to Davos last week -- also heightens the sense that Dr. Frist is looking beyond the Senate. (There was, in fact, some grumbling among Republicans about Dr. Frist dividing his time between Davos and the party retreat.) If he is to advance, though, he needs a successful final two years as leader.
 In many ways, he was an accidental majority leader, jumping into the race after the previous leader, Senator Trent Lott of Mississippi, was caught in a firestorm over his praise of Strom Thurmond's segregationist presidential campaign in 1948.
 Dr. Frist's first two years at the helm were not easy. He had just 51 Republican votes; he faced the determined opposition of Tom Daschle, then the minority leader; and he was trying to do business in the middle of a charged presidential election, in which the Democratic nominee was a member of the Senate.
 Moreover, Dr. Frist's legislative and political skills got decidedly mixed reviews. He helped pass the historic Medicare overhaul, for example, but was unable to push through several other important bills on issues like energy and curbs on class action suits. With a bigger Republican majority now, he says he has maneuvering room that he did not have before. And, he said in the recent interview, partisan tensions should cool down with the presidential campaign out of the way.
 At the moment, though, Dr. Frist faces what looks like a solid wall of Democratic opposition and suspicion, particularly on Social Security. Mr. Reid said Tuesday that every Democrat in the Senate now opposed Mr. Bush's proposal for diverting payroll taxes to private accounts. Democrats say they are still angry over their leaders being shut out of the conference committee that worked out the final Medicare law, legislation affecting 40 million Americans. They also remember Dr. Frist traveling to South Dakota to campaign against the Democratic leader, Mr. Daschle, who was defeated.
 Mr. Reid said, ''I would never do that.''
 Dr. Frist, whose amiable manner belies a deeply partisan streak, said he had no regrets and did not feel bad about Mr. Daschle's loss. But he said he hoped for a warmer relationship with Mr. Reid.
 Many Democrats suspect that Republicans simply want to pick off a handful of ''red state'' Democrats to put their party over the top.
 ''They and the president seem to want to continue the same approach they've always used,'' said Senator Byron L. Dorgan of North Dakota, a member of the Democratic leadership, ''that they control the White House, the House and the Senate, and they're going to call the shots.''
 Mr. Reid, who said he liked Dr. Frist personally, asserted that if it were up to the Republican leaders in the Senate, ''we'd work together and get some things done. But I don't think it's up to them. I think it's up to the president.''
 And so far, Mr. Reid added, ''They've tried to jam us on judges, and they've tried to jam us on Social Security.''
 Among Republicans, there is a clear feeling that Democrats are not playing by the rules, by refusing to recognize the Republican majority as having a mandate. ''You have a very tough core of Democrats on the other side who are just purely ideologically driven and don't want to see any kind of collaboration with the Republicans that may result in changes to the way they structure programs around here,'' said Senator Rick Santorum of Pennsylvania, No. 3 in the Republican leadership.
 Dr. Frist said he hoped for more bipartisanship and civility, but was keenly aware that he had just two years left to get things done. ''I know where we're going,'' he said. ''It's crystal clear to me.'' And that, he said, is ''a safer, stronger, healthier, freer, more prosperous America'' -- a message that sounds far more presidential than legislative.

HEADLINE: For Patriots' Coach, War Is Won or Lost Before Game Begins

BYLINE: By DAMON HACK

DATELINE: JACKSONVILLE, Fla., Feb. 2 

 BODY:
Bill Belichick says football games are won before players ever take the field. An opponent's weakness should be exploited. Preparation can make victory a self-fulfilling prophecy.
 Those statements are nods to Sun Tzu's military treatise, ''The Art of War,'' a book that shapes Belichick's coaching philosophy, and to the influence a head coach can wield in the National Football League.
 Delivering that message in his deep monotone, Belichick has formed the bedrock of a New England Patriots team that will try to win its third Super Bowl title in four seasons when it meets the Philadelphia Eagles on Sunday here at Alltel Stadium. 
 If the Patriots defeat the Eagles, Belichick would cement a legacy rivaling many of the league's greatest coaches. In a sport where most secrets die under the glare of game film, the 52-year-old Belichick stands apart from his peers, defying the league's economic design for parity.
 He has become a master of deception by identifying players smart enough and physically gifted enough to play several positions. He then uses them in innovative ways. During the American Football Conference championship game against the Indianapolis Colts last season, Belichick kept switching cornerback Ty Law and safety Rodney Harrison, confusing quarterback Peyton Manning and baiting him into four interceptions. 
 Belichick stretched the conventions of the game further this season. Way back in training camp last summer, he was already worrying about possible backups for the Patriots' defensive secondary, just in case problems arose during the season. Knowing that wide receiver Troy Brown had played a little cornerback in college, Belichick began trying him out on defense, a highly unusual approach in today's ultra-specialized N.F.L. But the move looked prescient when two key defensive backs were lost to injuries, and Brown was ready to step in, even contributing three interceptions, the second-highest total on the team.
 Ernie Accorsi, the Giants' general manager, said of Belichick's myriad schemes, ''You can't nail him down.''
 Around the N.F.L., people are listening to Belichick, a disciplined leader in rumpled sweatsuits.
 ''When Kennedy was running for president and you heard him speak for the first time, you thought, 'This guy has been preparing to be president his whole life,''' said Accorsi, who was Belichick's boss with the Cleveland Browns in the early 1990's. ''When I sat down with Bill for the first time and he started speaking, you just had the feeling that he had been preparing to be a head coach his whole life.
 ''I think he clearly is the best coach in the N.F.L. Everything he does as a coach has been planned for. He is at the head of the class and he's young enough that I don't know where it's going to stop.''
 Belichick's players refer to him as the smartest coach in the league, citing his unquenchable thirst to read, learn and teach. He graduated from Wesleyan University in Middletown, Conn., where he studied economics and played football, lacrosse and squash.
 A victory Sunday would give him 10 victories in 11 postseason games as a head coach, elevating him above the 9-1 playoff record he now shares with Vince Lombardi, the Green Bay Packers' taskmaster who won five N.F.L. championships in seven seasons during the 1960's.
 Belichick's run has drawn comparisons to Chuck Noll, who won four Super Bowl championships in six seasons with the Pittsburgh Steelers, Bill Walsh, who won three titles during the 1980's as coach of the San Francisco 49ers, and others in different eras.
 But Belichick's accomplishments have come during the salary-cap era, when each of the league's 32 teams has had the same spending limit on players. That puts New England on an unusual level, said Jimmy Johnson, who coached the Dallas Cowboys to Super Bowl titles during the 1992 and 1993 seasons, part of a run of three titles in four seasons.
 ''It may be the finest coaching job in the history of the N.F.L.,'' Johnson said of Belichick.
 Johnson said the role of a coach is even more critical today than before free agency and the salary cap, which began in 1994, because players switch teams every year and coaches are forced to field inexpensive rookies to stay under the cap.
 ''Belichick and I talked about it the other day,'' Johnson said. ''You can't compare the post-salary-cap era to the Steelers, the 49ers and the Cowboys. Back in those days, you had players for six, seven years. You didn't have to cut veterans who made a lot of money. You had fewer mistakes.
 ''For them,'' Johnson said of the Patriots, ''dealing with new players every year -- every week -- and to still be of this quality says a lot.''
 Noll's teams boasted a roster of future Hall of Fame players that carried the Steelers through most of the 1970's.
 ''It's even tougher now to put a string together and keep it together,'' Noll said in a telephone interview. ''It's tougher to win the second time and then the third time and then the fourth time. You have to have special people around you that believe in what they're doing and that want to do it.''
 Belichick's team exudes an everyman quality. When players are injured, Belichick has been able to replace them, bringing the new ones up to speed and continuing to win.
 In New England's 20-3 victory over the Indianapolis Colts in a playoff game on Jan. 16, the Patriots' secondary, which was missing its two starting cornerbacks, held Manning, the league's most valuable player, without a touchdown pass for the first time this season. 
 Belichick and the rest of his coaching staff seemed to know where Manning wanted to throw even before he planted his feet.
 ''He creates anxiety in opposing players, like he did with Peyton,'' said Carl Banks, a retired linebacker who played for Belichick when he was the Giants' defensive coordinator and coach of the Browns.
 Banks said that Manning ''wanted to go downfield'' with his throws, but Belichick blanketed the passing lanes with defenders.
 Belichick gives credits for some of his football acumen to his immersion in the game at an early age. His father, Steve, was hired as a scout and assistant coach at Navy in 1956. Belichick grew up dissecting plays at his father's knee.
 Belichick later studied the innovations of Paul Brown, one of the first coaches to bring a cerebral mien to professional football as the coach of the Cleveland Browns in the 1950's.
 ''So many of the things that we do today and that I did when I was at Cleveland were the same things that Paul Brown did,'' Belichick said. ''The same schedule, the same philosophy, the same approach to getting your team to perform to the highest level on the practice field, in meetings, in strategy, in game situations.''
 The mental preparation seen in Belichick's teams was evident in those of other Brown disciples like Walsh and Noll.
 ''One thing I learned was to never beat the heck out of your football team in practice,'' said Noll, who played for Brown for seven years on the Cleveland Browns. ''He used to say, 'A lot of coaches leave their game on the practice field.' He wanted a lot of the preparation to be mental, and I think it carried over to the games.''
 Willie McGinest, a Patriots linebacker, said Belichick surrounds himself with players whose intellect is equal to their athleticism. Many of New England's linebackers, like McGinest, were defensive linemen in college. They are large enough stop the run and agile enough to drop back into pass coverage -- whatever a scheme calls for.
 ''You have to be smart and you have to study,'' McGinest said. ''This organization throws a lot of things at you, because they like to change schemes week in and week out. You have to learn on the fly. Our game plans relate to what we want to do and what we want to stop you from doing.''
 Belichick, who was fired in Cleveland after a 5-11 season in 1995, has had nearly a decade to reflect on the mistakes of his five-year tenure there. He admits that he failed to delegate authority, another way of saying he did not trust his coaching staff or veteran players to take on leadership roles.
 His style, Belichick said, has changed.
 ''I'm kind of a detail-oriented person and, sometimes, that's not good,'' he said. ''Sometimes, it's better to let other people worry about things and let the head coach be the head coach.''
 With two Super Bowl titles, Belichick has as many as Bill Parcells, his former mentor with the Giants and Jets and now a rival of sorts with the Cowboys. (Belichick won his pair without Parcells, while Parcells's two championships came with Belichick as his assistant.)
 Charley Casserly, the Houston Texans' general manager who was a Washington Redskins executive while Joe Gibbs coached the team to three Super Bowl titles, said that Belichick belongs on a list of great coaches for his ability to exploit matchups, a skill that can benefit a team long before a game begins.
 Once on the field, the action appears preordained, as it did against the Colts and, one week later, against the Pittsburgh Steelers in the A.F.C. championship game at Heinz Field.
 With the Steelers facing a fourth-and-one in the first quarter, Belichick called Patriots linebacker Ted Johnson to the sideline, anticipating what play Pittsburgh might run.
 Johnson relayed the message to his teammates, who then corralled Pittsburgh's bulky running back, Jerome Bettis, short of a first down and stripped the ball from him. On the next play, New England scored on a 60-yard touchdown pass.
 ''He gave me a tip and I relayed it to the guys who needed to know,'' Johnson said. ''He obviously knew something I didn't. I think it was more of a gut call on his part.'' 
 In many ways, it spoke to Belichick's core philosophy, one revealed in the legacy of N.F.L. coaches and in the pages of Sun Tzu's military strategy.
 ''One thing he said was that every battle is won before it is fought,'' Belichick said. ''I'm just glad I'm not fighting him.''

HEADLINE: An Improvising Conductor Celebrates an Anniversary

BYLINE: By BEN RATLIFF

 BODY:
When you do something for 20 years, an elegance and economy of motion set in; you cut more quickly to the point. In a jazz group, with a musician leading the band, the point is the freedom of all the group's individual players, atop the consensual boundaries of a tune and the tailored group sound. In conducting classical music, the point is the written work filtered through the conductor: his temperament, his tempos, his interpretation of the score.
 Butch Morris has combined these two disciplines and come up with a third, something he calls ''conduction.'' Standing before a group of improvisers -- often jazz improvisers, but he has worked with poets, electronic musicians and others -- he dislodges music from them, arranging it as it moves by means of hand signals, working from a little bit of his own written music, or more often none at all. Mr. Morris has been doggedly creating work for himself; he recently got up to Conduction No.143. While he long ago proved the validity of his idea, in some particularly moving performances he has also developed efficacy in its practice. 
 For the 20th anniversary of his Conduction No.1, Mr. Morris will be conducting ensembles in New York every night this month. The first gig of ''Black February,'' as he's calling the project, was at the Knitting Factory on Tuesday, with a jazz ensemble he calls Band Big.
 Anyone who has serious feelings about music should beware of the intentional fallacy -- giving too much consideration to what the musician is trying to do as opposed to what actually comes out. But it's hard not to provide a little bit of intention here. According to his statements and interviews, Mr. Morris doesn't fully believe that what he does is composing. He is comfortable with calling his work a form of arranging. Without question, it is improvisation. 
 In any case, you don't remain in the dark for long when you see him at work. Quick-thinking, direct, witty, straight-faced, specific, attuned to the strengths and bugs of his own system, Mr. Morris plays his musicians to get what he wants. There is a game aspect of the performances, or perhaps just a language aspect: eventually you realize that Mr. Morris's index finger at his temple means ''commit something you just played to memory, because you will be asked to repeat it''; two hands outstretched and swinging apart means ''develop a phrase''; and so on. 
 On Tuesday, the 13 members of Band Big, including three trumpeters, two trombonists, two bassists and two drummers, played without any written music. Mr. Morris indicated a downbeat and a tempo, and the musicians immediately negotiated an initial theme together, less muddy than you might expect. It repeated through various soft and loud variations; a trumpet line by Duane Eubanks trickled forth, and then a saxophone solo by J.D. Allen ran in counterpoint to it. The drummers and bassists worked up a vamp, and the horn players developed some antiphonal back-and-forth. Suddenly Mr. Morris held out his left hand, palm down, and brought it down. The drummers kept a tiny murmur of cymbals and bass drum, but the temperature of the music had been sharply altered.
 In three improvised pieces, Mr. Morris went through other parts of his basic vocabulary -- pans of sound across the group, stops and starts, sudden dropouts of instruments, and the repetition and development of short phrases, gaining feeling and emphasis. By the end of the set, the musicians -- some of them new to Mr. Morris, others not -- were following him much more closely.
 It was not the best of Mr. Morris's performances. It takes time for any of his groups to find their center of gravity, to learn to react more quickly to his directives, and that is the sure and great thing about this month's project: the strengths of his system will be revealed.

Butch Morris will perform every Tuesday night this month with Band Big at the Knitting Factory, 74 Leonard Street, TriBeCa. Information about his other conduction performances this month at Zebulon, Nublu,the Medicine Show Theater, the Project Room, the Bowery Poetry Club and other places is at www.conduction.us.

HEADLINE: Assembly Tries to Cancel Pataki's TV Pitches

BYLINE: By PATRICK D. HEALY

DATELINE: ALBANY, Feb. 2 

 BODY:
Forget the state budget. Not to mention mass transit, the proposed Jets stadium, Medicaid and that pothole in Poughkeepsie that needs filling.
 On Wednesday, the people's business in the State Assembly was dominated by Gov. George E. Pataki's mug, and how often New Yorkers need to see it. 
 Not so often, Democrats decreed. (Newsflash!)
 By 100 to 43, along mostly partisan lines, the Assembly voted to ban statewide elected officials -- the governor, lieutenant governor, attorney general and comptroller -- from appearing in taxpayer-financed commercials celebrating all things New York on television, radio and the Internet.
 Mr. Pataki used to feel the same way when he was an assemblyman and Gov. Mario M. Cuomo appeared in such ads; at one point he even supported a similar bill. Today, however, Mr. Pataki is the only one of four statewide officials who appears regularly in such ads, and he has a reputation for appearing in tens of millions of dollars worth of them.
 On Tuesday night's edition of the MSNBC program ''Hardball,'' for instance, the host, Chris Matthews, asked Mr. Pataki about New York City's economy and told the governor, ''I see you on a lot of the TV commercials for Lower Manhattan development.''
 Neither the governor's office nor several state agencies could put a precise price tag on the commercials over Mr. Pataki's three terms in office. But aides to Mr. Pataki said he appeared this winter in a $4.9 million campaign promoting investment in Lower Manhattan, $1.2 million in cable commercials for the ''I Love New York'' tourism campaign, and a $1 million promotion for renewable energy supplies.
 Mr. Pataki also tried to build support for new children's health programs in a five-year, $26 million ad campaign, which included $9.3 million in state money, that ended about two years ago. Democrats asserted that there had been additional print, radio and television ads over his time in office that would have been banned under the bill.
 David Catalfamo, Mr. Pataki's communications director, dismissed the Assembly action as silly. ''Post 9/11, he's a natural spokesman to encourage the world that New York is a safe place to come to and invest in,'' he said.
 But Democrats charged that the advertisements were a self-aggrandizing waste of taxpayers' money, intended to cast Mr. Pataki as a spokesman for obviously popular issues, promote his re-election campaigns, and further his presidential aspirations in states like New Hampshire and Pennsylvania, where some of the ads also appear.
 The Assembly majority leader, Paul A. Tokasz, the bill's sponsor, expressed contempt on Wednesday for Mr. Pataki's championing state health care programs on the airwaves in one breath, then proposing cuts to Medicaid in his proposed budget.
 ''The disingenuousness is just too much,'' Mr. Tokasz said in an interview.
 The Democrats' point made, the bill is now expected to go to the Republican-controlled Senate, and die.

HEADLINE: Fed Steps Up Interest Rates A Sixth Time

BYLINE: By EDMUND L. ANDREWS

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Feb. 2 

 BODY:
The Federal Reserve raised short-term interest rates on Wednesday, its sixth increase since June, and signaled that it intends to keep raising rates in the months to come. 
 The central bank nudged the federal funds rate, the rate charged on overnight loans between banks, by a quarter of a point, to 2.5 percent.
 In a statement that accompanied Wednesday's decision, the policy-setting Federal Open Market Committee repeated previous declarations that it could afford to raise rates at ''a pace that is likely to be measured.'' By echoing its policy statement from December almost word for word, the Fed indicated that it has not yet developed a plan to either accelerate or pause in its slow-but-steady approach to raising rates in small increments at each meeting. Policymakers also stuck to their relatively sanguine outlook on the economy, saying that growth appeared to be solid and inflation expectations were ''well-contained.'' 
 Since starting to tighten policy, the Fed has more than doubled overnight lending rates from their near-record low of 1 percent eight months ago. Even with the latest rate increase, short-term borrowing costs are barely equal to the pace of inflation and still well below historical averages. More important, long-term interest rates for corporate bonds and home mortgages have declined in recent months.
 Analysts said there was so much money available for lending that financial institutions were reducing margins on loans for relatively high-risk corporate borrowers.
 ''There is so much liquidity in the marketplace that the only way lending institutions can compete is by lowering rates,'' said William Zadrozny, chief executive of Siemens Financial Services, which provides financing for business equipment and an array of other needs. ''People are reaching to employ their money.''
 The Fed's decision had little impact on stock and bond markets, because investors viewed the rate increase as a foregone conclusion.
 The Standard & Poor's 500 index rose slightly after the announcement, and investors continued to snap up long-term Treasury bonds in the expectation that inflation and interest rates would remain relatively low.
 The confidence of bond investors continues to surprise many analysts.
 The spread between interest rates for risk-free 10-year Treasury bonds and riskier corporate bonds is at its narrowest since 1998, according to data compiled by Richard Yamarone, chief economist at Argus Research, an economic consulting firm in New York.
 ''It's too much money chasing too few goods,'' said Mr. Yamarone, harking back to the description of inflation originally coined by the economist Milton Friedman.
 The spread between rates on 10-year Treasury bonds and corporate junk bonds -- those rated below Baa by Moody's Investors Service -- has declined from 3.01 percent in March 2001 to 1.76 percent as of last week.
 Even though some Fed officials have begun to worry that rising costs to hire workers and slowing growth of productivity could fuel inflation, the central bank said on Wednesday that the upside and downside risks to both inflation and growth were still ''roughly equal.''
 ''Even after this action, the stance of monetary policy remains accommodative and, coupled with robust underlying growth in productivity, is providing ongoing support to economic activity,'' the committee said in its statement.
 By reiterating that monetary policy is still ''accommodative,'' the Fed signaled that interest rates had not yet reached a neutral level that neither encourages inflation nor slows down the economy.
 Alan Greenspan, chairman of the Fed, has refused to say what a neutral rate would be in practice. But most analysts expect the Fed to keep raising the overnight rate until it reaches at least 3.5 percent or perhaps 4 percent.
 Mr. Greenspan is expected to shed more light about the Fed's plans when he testifies before House and Senate banking committees on Feb. 16 and Feb. 17.
 Fed officials face several big uncertainties as they plot their interest-rate strategy. They need to dissect conflicting pressures on inflation: Consumer prices have climbed more slowly in recent months, but last year's increase in oil prices has not yet had its full impact.
 Potentially more important, Fed officials must grapple with the possibility of a slowdown in productivity growth and rising costs to hire workers.
 Faster productivity growth allows the nation to produce more goods and expand more rapidly than would otherwise be possible without sparking higher inflation.
 The nation's productivity soared at a pace of more than 4 percent a year in 2002 and 2003, nearly twice as fast as economists consider normal for the United States, but it slowed to 1.8 percent in the third quarter of 2004 and may have declined even more since then.
 Economists say it is normal for productivity to rise in the early stages of an economic recovery, as companies try to meet rising demand for goods without adding more workers. Improvements in productivity usually slow down in the later stages of a recovery as employers pay higher wages to recruit scarce workers.
 Faster productivity growth allowed Mr. Greenspan to defy conventional wisdom in the middle and late 1990's by keeping interest rates relatively low even though the economy was booming. But Fed officials are already wondering whether the pace will stabilize at the relatively strong rate of about 2.5 percent that became normal in the late 1990's.
 Ben S. Bernanke, a Fed governor, gave a detailed analysis of the issue in a speech last month and cautiously sided with optimists who predict that productivity will remain at its late 1990's levels.
 ''I think the productivity optimists have a good case,'' Mr. Bernanke said, citing research that showed that technological advances would continue to spread throughout the economy even if the overall pace of technological advance slows somewhat.
 But William Dudley, chief United States economist at Goldman Sachs, warned last week that productivity might slow more than many analysts predict.
 Among other potential drags on productivity, Mr. Dudley cited the federal government's large and stubborn budget deficits that drain capital from private investment, the need for companies to divert more money into energy-saving equipment and a slowing pace of technological change.
 Mr. Greenspan appeared to signal that he remains open to both sides of this debate.

HEADLINE: Inquiry Faults U.N.'s Oil-for-Aid Program

BYLINE: By JUDITH MILLER

 BODY:
An interim report by a United Nations-appointed panel investigating the oil-for-food program in Iraq severely criticizes its director and depicts the program as ''tainted'' for failing to follow the organization's own procedures.
 In an essay appearing today in The Wall Street Journal, Paul A. Volcker, the former Federal Reserve chairman who heads the three-member commission investigating the oil-for-food program, said its procurement system had failed to follow ''the established rules of the organization designed to assure fairness and accountability.''
 He said the report, which is scheduled to be made public today, also accuses Benon Sevan, the Cypriot who had headed what was once the world body's largest humanitarian effort, of ''irreconcilable conflict of interest.'' 
 Citing what he called ''conclusive'' evidence, Mr. Volcker wrote that by ''effectively participating in the selection of purchasers of oil under the program,'' Mr. Sevan had violated both ''specific United Nations rules and of the broad responsibility of an international civil servant to adhere to the highest standards of trust and integrity.'' 
 One official who has seen parts of the report said that it also criticized another senior United Nations official, Joseph Stephanides, a senior official on the Security Council staff, for failing to ensure that the organization's own rules for buying oil, selling goods and selecting contractors were followed.
 Telephone calls were made last night to the offices of both Mr. Sevan and Mr. Stephanides, but neither man could be reached for comment.
 In his essay, Mr. Volcker said the report explored in ''excruciating detail'' three ''potentially vulnerable'' parts of the $64 billion program, which was aimed at easing the debilitating effects of economic sanctions on the Iraqi people between 1996 and 2003 by ensuring that Iraq's oil revenues were used to buy food, medicine and other necessities for its people. 
 Specifically, he said the interim report discussed the initial selection of major contractors hired to inspect Iraqi oil exports, imports of ostensibly humanitarian goods, and how the program's funds were spent and managed. The report also discusses internal program audits, many of which have already been disclosed, and how the program spent its own administrative funds, he wrote.
 ''The findings do not make for pleasant reading,'' Mr. Volcker concluded.
 His interim report, which has been eagerly and skeptically awaited by United Nations critics, is months overdue. Hampered by what investigators and diplomats called a reluctance among some member countries to cooperate and a lack of subpoena power, Mr. Volcker's panel has had difficulty obtaining evidence. Conservatives and other critics have accused him of being insufficiently impartial and independent, a charge he has denied. And John Danforth, who recently left his position as American ambassador to the United Nations, said Mr. Volcker, with a staff of over 60 people and a budget of some $30 million, lacked some tools needed to conduct a thorough inquiry.
 Mr. Volcker was particularly critical of the oil-for-food program's procurement system. ''We have found in each case that the procurement process was tainted,'' he wrote, by a failure to follow established rules.
 ''Perhaps not surprisingly,'' he added, ''political considerations intruded, but in a manner that was neither transparent nor accountable.''
 Repeating criticisms the commission, officially known as the Independent Inquiry Committee, made in an earlier report, Mr. Volcker said the interim report concluded that the auditing system was ''underfunded and undermanned'' and hence, ''unable to meet effectively the challenge posed by a really unique, massive and complex program of humanitarian assistance.''
 Despite the ''skill and dedication of auditing professionals,'' he wrote, the auditing system lacked ''clear reporting lines and the management responsiveness critical to achieving a fully effective auditing process.''
 Even though no evidence of ''systematic or widespread abuse'' was found in how the program's administrative funds were spent, Mr. Volcker wrote, the commission still found what he called ''a clear lapse from disciplined judgment.''
 Mr. Volcker called his panel's initial findings about Mr. Sevan ''more disheartening.'' He indicated that the investigation of Mr. Sevan, an aide to Kofi Annan, was continuing, as was his investigation of how and why Cotecna Inspection, a Swiss-based company that was hired to inspect humanitarian goods bought by Iraq and that employed Mr. Annan's son, got its own contract.
 Mr. Annan has denied charges of nepotism within his organization and said he had not known that his son, Kojo, had continued being paid by Cotecna after leaving the company. Mr. Sevan have also previously denied charges of wrongdoing, but he has declined for many months to meet with or talk to reporters.
 Under the rules of the oil-for-food program created by the United States and other members of the Security Council, Iraq could chose to whom it would sell its oil and buy humanitarian goods. Congressional investigators have said that because of the program's structure, secrecy and poor oversight, billions were diverted from the program.
 Mr. Annan told reporters yesterday that the United Nations would adopt reforms in response to Mr. Volcker's criticisms and recommendations, and that he was already doing so.

HEADLINE: Text of the Fed's Statement on Interest Rates

 BODY:
Following is the text of a statement released by the Federal Reserve yesterday after the Fed's monetary policy panel, the Federal Open Market Committee, decided to raise its benchmark interest rates a quarter point:
 The Federal Open Market Committee decided today to raise its target for the federal funds rate by 25 basis points to 2 1/2 percent. 
 The committee believes that even after this action, the stance of monetary policy remains accommodative and, coupled with robust underlying growth in productivity, is providing ongoing support to economic activity. Output appears to be growing at a moderate pace despite the rise in energy prices, and labor market conditions continue to improve gradually. Inflation and longer-term inflation expectations remain well contained. 
 The committee perceives the upside and downside risks to the attainment of both sustainable growth and price stability for the next few quarters to be roughly equal. 
 With underlying inflation expected to be relatively low, the committee believes that policy accommodation can be removed at a pace that is likely to be measured. Nonetheless, the committee will respond to changes in economic prospects as needed to fulfill its obligation to maintain price stability. 
 Voting for the F.O.M.C. monetary policy action were Alan Greenspan, chairman; Timothy F. Geithner, vice chairman; Ben S. Bernanke; Susan S. Bies; Roger W. Ferguson Jr.; Edward M. Gramlich; Jack Guynn; Donald L. Kohn; Michael H. Moskow; Mark W. Olson; Anthony M. Santomero; and Gary H. Stern. 
 In a related action, the board of governors unanimously approved a 25-basis-point increase in the discount rate, to 3 1/2 percent. In taking this action, the board approved the requests submitted by the boards of directors of the Federal Reserve Banks of Boston, New York, Philadelphia, Cleveland, Richmond, Atlanta, Chicago, St. Louis, Minneapolis, Kansas City, Dallas and San Francisco.

HEADLINE: N.H.L. Players Reject Latest Proposal to End Lockout

BYLINE: By JOE LAPOINTE

 BODY:
The leaders of the two sides in the National Hockey League lockout will rejoin the negotiations today in an attempt to save the season. But their top aides expressed only limited optimism last night after the N.H.L. Players' Association turned down another written proposal by the owners.
 Gary Bettman, the N.H.L. commissioner, and Bob Goodenow, executive director of the union, will meet today for the first time since Dec. 14. The talks will take place at an undisclosed location in New York, said Ted Saskin, the senior director of the union. 
 Saskin and Bill Daly, the executive vice president of the league, will also be at the meeting, along with Bob Batterman, a lawyer for the league, and John McCambridge, a lawyer for the union. No players or team owners will participate. The two sides held meetings each of the past two weeks without Bettman and Goodenow.
 Saskin and Daly spoke on separate conference calls yesterday about the most recent offer, a 15-point proposal released by the league on its Web site and handed to the union earlier. Daly stressed that it included an offer of profit sharing with the union and revenue sharing among the owners.
 But Saskin stressed that the core of the dispute remained a salary cap, the league's primary demand when it shut down the start of training camp on Sept. 16. The league wants to hold individual team payrolls to $42 million and allow the players no more than 55 percent of league revenue.
 The players have said they will roll back salaries 24 percent and make other concessions to contain costs. But Saskin repeated yesterday that the union would not accept a salary cap and that this was the main issue.
 ''It's better to be optimistic than pessimistic,'' he said. ''But I don't want to mislead anyone and suggest I'm optimistic. There's nothing over the last few years in the way they have approached things that would lead me to have any sense of optimism.''
 Daly was slightly more upbeat, but added that there was little room for flexibility in a salary-cap concept that the union has repeatedly rejected. Although he league refused to set a date for cancellation of the season, Daly acknowledged that time was running out. 
 ''I think we all know that we're right down to the end here,'' Daly said. ''Bob and Gary really have to be in the room to do the deal that needs to be done. I think it will be positive for them to be in the room. Hopefully, we'll have a productive day. People know that if hockey is going to be played this season, something has to be done imminently.''
 As of today the league has canceled 762 games of its 1,230-game regular-season schedule. To play a schedule of as few as 28 regular-season games, then four full rounds of Stanley Cup playoffs, a negotiated collective bargaining agreement would have to be in place sometime this month.
 The proposal yesterday included acceptance of the union's offer for a 24 percent salary rollback. When it was offered on Dec. 9, many players said that they thought it was too large a concession but that it was the basis of a settlement with the league, which has said it lost $497 million in operations over the last two seasons.
 Given that the league has repeatedly minimized the impact of the proposed rollback, Saskin was asked whether the union would consider rescinding that concession. 
 ''That is not something that we are talking about right now,'' he said. ''But obviously, as the process goes on, it's not something that will be out there forever.''
 Daly conceded that the union had clearly communicated its opposition to the salary cap.
 ''Obviously, we're at the end, timewise, in terms of being able to continue this process and still play games this season,'' Daly said. ''Obviously, the framework is still something that they have continuously suggested they are not willing to accept.''
 Daly said the N.H.L. would remain firm in seeking a link between pay and revenue, which it calls cost certainty.
 ''We have said all along that we need to know what our costs are going to be,'' Daly said. ''That's something we continue to adhere to.''
 Daly said that since the last collective bargaining agreement 10 years ago, the system ''has been incredibly inflationary'' and has caused drastic leaguewide losses.
 ''We know only one way to fix that,'' Daly said, ''and it is by putting our player costs in a more proper relationship, a defined and enforceable relationship with our revenues. And that's the premise on which we've proceeded. Once we get by that point, we are more than willing to compromise over virtually any other issue.''
 Saskin said changes yesterday in the N.H.L.'s proposal were ''very minor and cosmetic'' from what the union heard in discussions last week.
 ''We're at a critical time period,'' he said. ''There's no doubt about that.''

HEADLINE: That Next Call May Come From a Wireless Hot Spot

BYLINE: By ANNE EISENBERG. 
E-mail: Eisenberg@nytimes.com

 BODY:
TODAY people take laptops to wireless hot spots in coffee bars and airports to check their e-mail messages and to explore the Internet. Soon they may pack a new type of telephone and take it along, too, to make inexpensive calls using those wireless connections.
 The phones are called voice over Internet protocol over Wi-Fi (or, simply, voice over Wi-Fi) handsets. Like conventional voice over Internet protocol, or VoIP, services, they digitize the voice and send it as data packets over the Internet. But they do it wirelessly, over an 802.11, or Wi-Fi, network. 
 And also like conventional VoIP, the technology may become popular with people who want to economize on their long-distance bills by using Wi-Fi connections when possible. ''If you make a large number of calls, it could save money,'' said Philip Solis, a senior analyst at ABI Research in Oyster Bay, N.Y., and author of a report on prospects for the technology.
 Wi-Fi handsets will soon be common on the consumer market, Mr. Solis said. ''Probably we will see dual-use handsets that are cellphones as well as voice over Wi-Fi.''
 Vonage, a company that offers VoIP service, will soon sell portable Wi-Fi handsets that people can use at public access points or on wireless networks in their homes and offices as an alternative to cordless phones. Vonage, which is based in Edison, N.J., expects to offer the handsets by midyear, its chief executive, Jeffrey Citron, said.
 The price for the phone is not yet set, he said, ''but it will cost something comparable to a cordless phone, between $75 and $100.'' 
 Vonage has 400,000 customers who use its VoIP service, Mr. Citron said. Some programs offered by the company offer unlimited calling for a monthly fee of about $25. Customers with the service could use their wireless handsets to make additional calls at no cost at access points besides their homes. ''Why not take your handset with you and make unlimited phone calls from other places?'' he said.
 Vonage is testing the handsets now, and will soon be conducting a larger trial, Mr. Citron said.
 Dual mode handsets, which can use voice over Wi-Fi and cellular services, are also appearing, Mr. Solis of ABI said. These phones are designed to work as cellular handsets when, for example, people are driving, and then switch to a local area network as people enter a building and transfer from the cellular network to Wi-Fi.
 Such dual mode phones have many advantages, said Martin Fichter, a vice president for product management and engineering at Siemens Communications, in San Diego. ''We believe that voice over I.P. over Wi-Fi is a big growth field for the future,'' he said, in part because such calls would reduce traffic on cellular networks, saving money for carriers by delaying the need to build more cellular capacity. ''The call is being connected through the Internet,'' he said, ''so everyone wins.''
 Wi-Fi Internet telephony could also lower expenses for the office staff of a company. ''If we set up a Wi-Fi connection in the office, our handsets could go through Wi-Fi and save money,'' he said.
 The dual phones may also benefit consumers who have poor cellular reception where they live. ''It's a way to leverage voice over I.P. to reach people in many homes in the U.S. where cellphone coverage is not optimal,'' Mr. Solis said. ''If someone calls you on your cellular number, you can get connected by broadband inside the house.'' Then customers could move to cell coverage outside.
 Motorola is developing a dual mode handset for business customers that will let users have one number for both cell and broadband handsets, said Bob Duerr, a director of product marketing for the company. ''Call my extension and the phone will ring whether I'm at the desk or on the cell network,'' he said. The system should also be able to transfer calls seamlessly between the cellular and Wi-Fi networks.
 Jane Glover, marketing manager for Motorola's development of the dual network system, said the company was in the final stages of testing and fine-tuning, and that the system was just about ready for business customers. The Motorola handset and supporting systems, developed with two other companies and offered for sale through one of them, Avaya, is not meant for public Wi-Fi access points, because of potential security issues.
 Dan MacDonald, director of marketing for Nokia Enterprise Solutions in White Plains, N.Y., said the popularity of voice over Wi-Fi was just beginning. 
 And however awkward its name -- Mr. MacDonald prefers voice over I.P. over wireless LAN -- the technology will soon be widespread. ''It's an absolute certainty in our minds that it will happen,'' he said. ''In the future, literally every mobile device will have Wi-Fi capability in it.''

HEADLINE: The U.N. aims to cut poverty in half, even as the experts wonder how to measure it.

BYLINE: By Alan B. Krueger. 
Alan B. Krueger is the Bendheim professor of economics and public affairs at Princeton University. E-mail: akrueger@princeton.edu

 BODY:
ONE of the United Nations' top goals is to cut in half the proportion of people living in extreme poverty by 2015, compared with 1990. The World Bank is responsible for keeping track. Accurately monitoring poverty is essential for knowing whether the goal is achieved and whether antipoverty strategies are working. 
 But measuring poverty is difficult for a particular country, let alone the world. The movie star Angelina Jolie challenged celebrities at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, last week to know ''absolutely what they're talking about'' when it comes to poverty, yet even experts would have trouble meeting her standard. Knowing the extent of the rise or fall of worldwide poverty is difficult because poverty is not easy to define or measure. 
 First, establishing a poverty line -- or level of consumption below which one is considered impoverished -- involves an element of arbitrariness. For many poor families, not having enough money amounts to not having enough food. But there is no particular threshold level of income or expenditures above which people automatically become fully functioning, nourished members of society. 
 ''Poverty lines are as much political as scientific constructions,'' said Angus Deaton, a Princeton economist and expert on economic development. In such places as different as the United States and India, the poverty line was initially set with reference to minimum standards of food consumption. Yet over time, Professor Deaton noted, the poverty lines in both countries were adjusted to keep pace with overall price inflation, not the price of food or the share of food in the average family's budget. Despite straying from its original conception, the poverty line survived because of its political and administrative usefulness. 
 The U.N. has set the line for extreme poverty at living on less than $1 a day. This threshold has obvious rhetorical appeal and surely qualifies as extreme poverty by any standard in developed countries; it is also not far off the poverty line used by many of the poorest countries themselves. 
 Once an international poverty line is set, it must be converted to local currencies. This is trickier than it sounds. Currency exchange rates are inappropriate because most of the items that the poor consume are not traded on world markets. Living expenses are much lower in rural India than in New York, but this fact is not fully captured if prices are converted with currency exchange rates. 
 To convert the $1 poverty line into foreign currencies, the World Bank uses indexes of ''purchasing power parity.'' Simply put, these indexes reflect the cost of buying a standard bundle of goods in each country. 
 Although it is desirable to use purchasing indexes, they are not available for all countries and are skewed toward representing the purchases of the wealthiest households, not the poorest, when they are available. Another problem is that the bundle of goods that poor families actually buy varies from country to country because of differences in tastes and availability. 
 Thus, the $1 poverty line is best viewed as an approximation. 
 Once the poverty line is set in local currency, the consumption of a representative sample of households must be compared with the line to determine the percent of people getting by on less than $1 a day. (Each household's consumption is spread equally among its members, another leap of faith.) 
 Again, this is harder than it sounds. The World Bank typically relies on whatever government surveys that countries routinely produce. 
 But there is no uniform standard in the way countries collect and process their data, which is important because the poverty rate is sensitive to how consumption is measured. 
 Consider India, home to 33 percent of the world's poor -- or 20 percent, depending on how the data are collected. 
 India was a pioneer in social surveys and has one of the best government statistical agencies in the world. Still, uncertainty shrouds the level of poverty in India. In one experiment, India's national survey organization asked half of the households it surveyed to report their spending on certain items over a 30-day period and half over a seven-day period. Households reported 30 percent higher food consumption per day in the shorter interval, enough to cut the poverty rate in half. It is not certain which measure is more accurate, although follow-up work points toward the longer interval.
 Perhaps the best one can hope for is consistency of measurement within countries to detect changes in poverty over time. But continuing past practices can prolong the use of misleading poverty counts that are not comparable across countries. Clearly, there is a need for Latin American countries, which usually measure poverty by income rather than consumption, to collect reliable household consumption data because consumption is a better measure of living standards. 
 The herculean measurement problems aside, careful research by Shaohua Chen and Martin Ravallion of the World Bank indicates that much progress has been made toward the goal of halving poverty in China and India. But, they found, little progress has occurred in Latin America and Africa, and the former Soviet states are slipping into deeper poverty. Because China and India accounted for 60 percent of the world's poor in 1990, the goal of halving poverty may be achieved a decade from now, even while many regions see no progress. 
 Despite the progress in China and India, 18 percent of the world's population still somehow survives on less than $1 a day. 
 The United Nations has recently held a number of brainstorming sessions to gather proposals for the secretary general's report to the General Assembly on achieving the development goals, which will be delivered next month. 
 An essential prerequisite is to improve poverty statistics and ensure their integrity. 
 Although the process of setting a poverty line is necessarily political, the task of measuring poverty should be insulated from political influences. The World Bank, however, is an inherently political institution. 
 Yet no other international body currently has the expertise or resources to monitor worldwide poverty, so it is important for the next president of the World Bank to value and protect the impartiality of the statistical and research staff. The U.N. could also help by working with statistical agencies around the world to develop uniform standards for poverty surveys and then to ensure that their data are adequately documented and publicly archived. To this end, the U.N. could restart its Household Survey Capability Program, which supported statistical offices in developing countries in the 1980's. 
 This may not be a cause that celebrities are ready to line up for, but improving poverty data will put the world in a better position to monitor progress and evaluate poverty reduction strategies by the time the poverty line is moved up to $2 a day.


GRAPHIC: Chart: ''Defining Poverty''Poverty is not easy to measure or define. The United Nations currently considers a person living on less than $1.00 a day to be living in extreme poverty.

HEADLINE: The Little Village That Could, and Did

BYLINE: By BILL PENNINGTON

DATELINE: LAKE PLACID, N.Y. 

 BODY:
There is no sign on the edge of tiny Lake Placid proclaiming the approaching village as the home of two Winter Olympic Games. Here, inside the vast, forested Adirondack State Park, there is room for unaffected understatement.
 The introduction to the Olympic setting of Lake Placid comes a mile from the village, where looming 243 feet above a bend in the road -- as if wedged in the clouds -- is a ski jump, from which athletes launch themselves for a descent equivalent to soaring off a 26-story building.
 Past the ski jump, in the heart of the village on Main Street, is a 400-meter speedskating oval, where competitive skaters in the morning and tottering tourists in the afternoon trace paths in the ice taken by Eric Heiden, winner of five gold medals in the 1980 Olympics.
 And another quarter-mile up the road, in a building overlooking this hamlet of 2,800 permanent residents, is the site of what may be the most famous event in American sports. It is called simply the 1980 Rink, and anyone who believes in miracles has heard of it. Nearly a million people annually, some arriving in busloads, make a pilgrimage to the scene of the United States Olympic hockey team's upset of the Soviet Union. 
 It was 25 years ago on Feb. 13 that Lake Placid was host to the 1980 Winter Games. Much has changed about the Olympics since -- larger and longer, more costly and more controversial -- but in the ensuing quarter-century, no place has embraced the legacy of its Olympic moment like Lake Placid.
 In 25 years, it may be the best example of an Olympics that worked, an Olympics that did what it was intended to do. The 1980 Olympics put Lake Placid on the map internationally as a destination resort, brought a boom to the local economy that has yet to ebb, left little debt, bestowed spiritual aid to a flagging Olympic movement and created such good will that Lake Placid is still considered a contender for a future Winter Olympics.
 Many Olympic cities, towns and regions are left with empty competition sites that are often torn down. Cost overruns are frequent. Any positive bounce from being the host to the world's best-known athletic event is hard to define or quantify.
 In Lake Placid, all of the 1980 Olympic facilities are not only intact, but most have also been upgraded, and since 1980 they have been the site of 15 world championships, 65 World Cup events and 200 national-level events involving 20 sports. 
 The local economy has benefited as tourism has more than doubled to turn Lake Placid into a four-season resort. Although the number of hotel rooms in Lake Placid has remained static since 1980, the amount of money the hotels have taken in annually has increased by more than $53 million in the last 15 years, according to state tax figures.
 The fascination with the 1980 United States Olympic hockey team has lured thousands of youth teams to Lake Placid. On most weekends from early November to late April, 1,200 to 2,500 hockey players and their parents might arrive in Lake Placid.
 ''Everyone wants to step foot on the rink where the Miracle on Ice took place,'' said Ron Butler, a village resident for 48 years who owns the local Comfort Inn and Howard Johnson restaurant.
 At nearby Whiteface Mountain, where the Alpine skiing competitions were held, the timing sheds and scoreboards from the 1980 Olympic races are still near the old finish lines. It is possible to ski the Olympic downhill course or the trail where the American Phil Mahre won his silver medal in the slalom. The cross-country skiing tracks are eight miles outside the village and open to the public, as is the bobsled run, where for a fee a driver will hand you a helmet and whisk you down the track at 50 miles an hour.
 ''I don't want to call Lake Placid a theme park,'' said Roby Politi, the village's mayor. ''But Lake Placid is kind of a big Olympic theme park. And it's not fake. The people here breathe the Olympic spirit.''
 When it comes to elite-level winter sports competitions, Lake Placid is always on the ready to stage another one. Two years ago, inadequate snow conditions made it impossible for an Alaskan resort to put on the national Alpine championships as scheduled. With three weeks' notice, Whiteface Mountain and Lake Placid were host to the eight-day championships.
 ''Whatever the event, if anybody drops out, we're here,'' Politi said. ''This is what we do. The Olympics, the Olympic sports, this is our business.''
 All this attention has not been good for every citizen of the village and the surrounding town of North Elba. Increased tourism has brought many second-home buyers, sending real estate prices skyrocketing beyond the means of many local residents. Million-dollar homes are no longer uncommon.
 On Lake Placid's historic and picturesque Main Street, there are now national clothing outlets like the Gap and Izod.
 ''But I don't think anyone wants to go back to the 1970's when anybody around here who could rub two credit cards together left for Florida in the winter,'' Butler said.
 While Lake Placid had successfully staged the 1932 Winter Olympics, those Games did not make the village a mecca for winter sports activity afterward. It was known outside the area primarily as a summer resort. Lake Placid officials began bidding for another Winter Olympics in 1954 but did not succeed for 20 years.
 Once the 1980 Games were awarded to Lake Placid, one of their stated missions was to prove that a small town could still conduct the Olympics. Lake Placid also aimed to ride the recognition of the Olympics to a new status as a year-round resort.
 The Lake Placid Olympics got off to a poor start when labor troubles produced breakdowns in the transportation system. But these woes were corrected in a few days, and by the time United States hockey captain, Mike Eruzione, and his teammates were accepting their gold medals on Feb. 24, 1980, Lake Placid's place as America's feel-good Olympics was well established.
 The 1980 Olympics compiled a deficit, but at $10 million it was not insurmountable. Still, a critical step was the state of New York's decision to take responsibility for the debt and control of the competition sites.
 ''It was controversial to a point,'' said Ron Stafford, whose 37-year term as the region's state senator ended in 2000. ''Some people hated to give up the venues. But statewide, there was an understanding that we had take care of these things or lose the great opportunity the 1980 Olympics had afforded New York.''
 To govern the sites, the state created the Olympic Regional Development Authority. It receives more than $7 million annually from the state and $700,000 from North Elba, part of a $27 million budget. 
 Fifteen years ago, not far from the ski jumps, the authority built the Olympic Training Center, a large complex including dormitory rooms, a cafeteria, gymnasiums, workout rooms and a wing for sports medicine care. It is host to about 8,000 athletes a year, boxers to bobsledders.
 They come to train at the scene of a historic Olympic Games, when one little village took in the world and put on all the events.
 ''The community accepted the Olympics as the purity of sport, and we've been able to keep that alive for 25 years,'' said Ted Blazer, president of the Olympic authority and a longtime resident of the area. ''Maybe that's the message of the 1980 Games, a lesson in not making things too complicated.''

HEADLINE: Condo Fever Turns Buyers Into Early Birds

BYLINE: By MOTOKO RICH

 BODY:
ANGELINA UMANSKY, a 39-year-old spa owner from San Francisco, was visiting a friend in Miami two weeks ago when she heard about a new condo development downtown. Hoping to find a vacation home, but worried that others were interested, too, Ms. Umansky arrived at the sales office at 8 a.m. the day after seeing some model units. 
 About 50 other buyers were already in line. Two hours later, a sales agent summoned her and said she had four minutes to decide which unit to buy. She acted fast, offering $350,000 for a two-bedroom, two-bathroom unit. 
 Ms. Umansky thinks she got a bargain; when she called on behalf of a friend less than eight hours later, she was told the asking price on a unit like hers had climbed to $380,000, a nearly 9 percent price increase. 
 Just when it seemed as if the real estate market couldn't get any barmier, it has. With inventories lagging behind demand and prices for new homes rising seemingly by the hour in destination cities like New York and second-home markets like Miami and Orlando, home buyers are camping out overnight in front of sales offices, pestering brokers and developers and scooping up multiple units in the real estate version of scalping.''This is a perfect storm for a frenzied housing market,'' said Susan Wachter, a professor of real estate at the Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania. ''The economy is strengthening, the restrictions on development are increasing and long-term mortgage rates are still historically low.'' Ms. Wachter added that as interest rates start to creep up, more buyers tend to pile into the market, trying to lock in good rates.
 Across the country, according to the National Association of Home Builders, the number of new condos sold jumped 32 percent to an estimated 115,000 in 2004 compared with a year earlier. And in New York the number of condo sales in the three months through December 2004 increased 8.2 percent over the same period a year earlier, and average condo prices were up 11.1 percent to $1.29 million, according to Miller Samuel, a New York real estate appraiser.
 The gold rush mentality has some economists concerned. Some buyers of new condos and houses are behaving like day-traders before the dot-com crash, said John Vogel Jr., a real estate professor at the Tuck School of Business at Dartmouth College.
 In some cases, developers are actually creating the frenzy. In central Florida, Transeastern Homes, which builds subdivisions, asks prospective buyers to put down a refundable deposit of $500 to $5,000 to reserve a time slot to buy a house that has yet to be built, sometimes without knowing more than the general location of the subdivision and a price range. 
 Buyers review floor plans and maps first at a Web site or in a brochure. When they arrive at the sales ''event,'' typically at a hotel or a convention center, they spend five minutes looking at a map and choosing a home before the next buyer moves to the front of the line. Price increases -- up to 16 a day-- are announced over loudspeakers.
 ''People get excited and get caught up in it,'' said Joel Lazar, a Transeastern vice president. ''Even if they weren't planning on buying a home, they convince themselves to buy a home.''
 Last Sunday, Jeanette Gomez, a banquet server at a resort hotel, drove her mother, Maria Gomez, to her 11:12 a.m. appointment at a hotel in west Orlando. Although the senior Ms. Gomez wasn't planning to buy, she ended up making an $18,500 down payment on a two-bedroom town house. ''I pushed her,'' her daughter said. ''I said 'Just do it.' I think it's a good buy because the sales agent told us the price already went up $20,000 since yesterday.''
 What's lost in the giddiness is a sense of history. ''People have a belief that's not true: that you can't lose money in real estate,'' said Joseph Gyourko, a real estate professor at Wharton. ''We know from the late 80's and early 90's that you can.''
 In New York, for example, median sales prices -- the exact middle of all sales prices -- peaked at $375,000 in 1987 before plunging 45 percent to a low of $205,000 in 1995. Median prices did not climb back up to their 1980's levels again until 2000, according to Miller Samuel. In the Northeast, the National Association of Realtors said median sales prices fell 11 percent from 1988 to 1989, and did not return to 1988 levels until 2001. 
 That doesn't stop some buyers from making impulsive down payments on condos that don't yet exist. In October, AnneMarie Alexander, then a broker with Prudential Douglas Elliman, took some brochures and parked her BMW 740 in front of a hole in the ground on 17th Street in Chelsea. She proceeded to sell five luxury condos -- at prices above $1 million each -- from the back seat of her car. ''I showed them the site through a hole in the fence,'' Ms. Alexander said. 
 Last summer, arguments erupted when 50 prospective buyers spent the night in front of a 16-unit building in Park Slope, Brooklyn, before an open house. As a result, the Corcoran Group, which marketed the property, now sells new condos only by appointment, said Jay Schippers, head of new development for Corcoran in Brooklyn. 
 Now buyers and their brokers are quarreling over viewing dates. Security guards at 56 Pine Street, a 90-unit condo in Manhattan, called the police to escort two brokers out of a sales office last month. ''They said they were not leaving until they got an appointment,'' said Andy Gerringer, a managing director of Prudential Douglas Elliman, which is helping to sell the condos. 
 If all else fails, some buyers try bribery. When 3,600 people showed up for a party showcasing a 419-unit condo project in Arlington, Va., last September, the developers booked appointments through the end of January. Afterward, those who had missed out were ''offering us lunch and tickets to baseball games,'' said David Klimas, a broker with McWilliams/Ballard, which was marketing the development. (Mr. Klimas said the buyers' tactics did not work.) 
 Hoping to beat out the crowds vying last fall for apartments in the Toy Factory Lofts, a new condominium in downtown Brooklyn, Jason Lynn showed up at 11 p.m. -- 14 hours before the sales office opened. He was carrying a fold-up chair, his iPod, some tennis balls (for pick-up handball) and a book. Before long there were enough other early birds to start a card game. 
 Mr. Lynn says he was happy to stay up all night. He landed a 700-square-foot loft for $314,000 -- 15 percent more than he would have paid at an open house two days earlier. 
 ''There is always a frenzy at the beginning of a development because the prices are lower,'' said David Behin, an executive vice president at the Developers Group, which handled sales at the Toy Factory.
 Some excited buyers aim to get a jump on property before it is advertised. Kenneth Horn, president of Alchemy Properties, which is developing a 67-unit condo on 19th Street in Chelsea, said he already has more than 200 individuals and more than 300 brokers on a waiting list for the development, which has yet to receive approval from the attorney general's office, which regulates new real estate. 
 Brokers field calls from people poised to sign a contract the minute one is available. Some check in three times a day, said Michael Klein, an agent with Liberty Realty in Hoboken, N.J. A couple of times last year, he said, he called clients at 11 p.m. to share floor plans fresh from the printer. The buyers signed deals the same night. 
 Hoping to manage the crush, the developers of Maxwell Place, a luxury condominium project in a renovated coffee plant on the Hoboken waterfront, told interested buyers in November that they would need appointments, available only to 77 people and only by calling an 800 number at exactly 1 p.m. on a Tuesday. Within an hour, all 77 appointments were taken.
 Mr. Vogel, the real estate professor, said the sales hysteria has troubling parallels. ''We've now moved past the stage of people saying we've got to get in before it's too late,'' said Mr. Vogel. ''Now we're at the speculator stage.''
 Indeed, Harold Gallo, director for marketing of the Related Group, a developer in Miami with a 1,000-unit condo that sold out in 36 hours last spring, said that about 50 percent of the buyers were investors -- in other words, people who will never live in the apartments and often sell them before anyone moves in. Mr. Vogel said that the frantic buying was characteristic of the tech bubble before it collapsed, adding, ''It speeded up.'' 
 The biggest threat to the housing boom is a sharp increase in mortgage rates. ''That will quickly knock the wind out of these housing markets and the psychology will reverse as quickly as it appeared,'' said Mark Zandi, the chief economist at Economy.com, a private research group. For now, interest rates are expected to rise modestly throughout the year.
 None of the naysaying bothers Kathleen Gillman, an interior designer, and her son Patrick, a real estate agent, who bought a $200,000 town house in Orlando at a Transeastern sales event last Saturday. Four months ago Mr. Gillman bought another house nearby, his mother said, adding that it is now worth $50,000 more. ''It is interesting how many different viewpoints are out there about whether it's going to level off now, go on for 10 more years or one more year,'' she said. ''Right now we're going to take the viewpoint that it's certainly not over yet.''

HEADLINE: Sure, You Can Watch the Oscars, but Can You See All the Nominated Movies?

BYLINE: By MICHELINE MAYNARD; Jeremy W. Peters contributed reporting for this article.

DATELINE: ANN ARBOR, Mich., Feb. 2 

 BODY:
Jane Stanton stood in line under the marquee of the Michigan Theater on Sunday night, waiting to buy tickets for ''Hotel Rwanda,'' her third movie full of Oscar contenders in four days.
 Ms. Stanton, 54, wasn't only trying to see them before the Academy Awards are handed out on Feb. 27; she was also trying to see them while she could.
 ''Hotel Rwanda'' and ''Million Dollar Baby,'' another of her selections, just opened here on Friday, even though both were in theaters before Christmas on the East and West Coasts. 
 That is an all-too-typical wait for Ms. Stanton, a research associate at the University of Michigan. ''Often, it's a few months before these movies make it here,'' she said. ''And when they do finally get here, they're gone in a week.''
 That is, if they arrive at all. The lobby walls across from the ticket booth tantalizingly sport posters for ''Vera Drake,'' whose star, Imelda Staunton, has been nominated for best actress, and ''The Sea Inside,'' which is up for two awards, including best foreign film.
 But ''Vera Drake,'' first released more than three months ago, will not play Ann Arbor until Friday, said a spokeswoman for Fine Line Features, which is distributing the film. And ''The Sea Inside,'' also from Fine Line, is not currently scheduled to play here, though it has been in a small number of theaters elsewhere across the country since December. 
 Studios say the answer is simple economics. Film companies have increasingly chosen to let their Oscar prospects trickle into the marketplace, letting the awards hoopla build before they risk advertising dollars on a wider market -- as Warner Brothers did with ''Million Dollar Baby,'' which was seen on a few screens seven weeks ago, and reached most of the country only last weekend.
 ''It's a money-driven situation,'' said Marian Koltai-Levine, executive vice president for marketing at Fine Line. ''We're able to distribute the pictures where we can get box office.'' 
 But the inability of moviegoers beyond both coasts to see this year's nominated films has been a thorny issue for the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences, sponsor of the Academy Awards, and never more so than this year.
 Ratings for another awards program, the Golden Globes, dropped nearly 40 percent in January, even though the show was heavily promoted by NBC, and its red-carpet arrivals were also covered by two cable networks. The Hollywood Reporter, an industry trade publication, attributed the drop to the absence from theaters of a spate of low-profile films.
 Bruce Davis, the academy's executive director, said moviegoers' difficulty in finding this year's Oscar-nominated films was ''a terrific concern.''
 ''The whole Oscar exercise is to identify the work that people ought to be seeing,'' he said in a telephone interview last week. If the movies aren't widely available beyond the East and West Coasts, ''what's the point of telling people about that?'' he asked.
 Still, the academy does not feel comfortable acting on its worries, Mr. Davis said. He explained that the academy ''very carefully keeps a membrane'' between itself and distributors and studios, which ultimately decide on movies' availability. ''It isn't our place to say, 'rerelease them, strike some more prints and get them around''' to theaters, Mr. Davis said. 
 Last year, the academy's ratings for its awards show jumped by 17 percent, perhaps partly because ''The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King,'' which won 11 awards, including best picture, was a crowd-pleaser that had been seen by tens of millions. According to Mr. Davis, the ratings might also have been helped by the show's broadcast shift from late March to late February, the end of the networks' winter sweeps period. 
 When the telecast took place in March, ''very few pictures were left in theaters,'' Mr. Davis said. ''At least in February, the movies are fresher,'' he added. 
 Ms. Koltai-Levine said the Golden Globes did not have low ratings because viewers were unable to see the movies: the problem lay with their less familiar nominees. ''More independent films were nominated, and people didn't know the talent,'' she said. ''It all depends on who's on the cover of The Star and Us Weekly.''
 The first cities to get most independent films are New York and Los Angeles, said Russ Collins, executive director of the Michigan Theater, which was built in 1928 and shows independent films in its vast auditorium and in an intimate screening room. Next comes a ring of big cities like Chicago, Dallas and Seattle, he said -- an assertion confirmed by the distributors. The third tier includes smaller cities and college towns with sizable moviegoing populations, like Ann Arbor. The fourth tier, he said, receives movies long after they open or perhaps not at all, forcing avid filmgoers to buy or rent DVD's and videos.
 When many of these movies finally reach theaters, Mr. Davis noted, ''they explode for a couple of weeks and then go away.'' 
 An exception this year seems to be ''Sideways,'' nominated for five Oscars, including best picture. That film, from Fox Searchlight, began playing in Ann Arbor only a couple of weeks after opening in October, and was in almost 1,700 theaters nationwide by last weekend, according to Boxofficemojo.com, a Web site that tracks film performance. 
 ''Sideways,'' which has earned $41 million in domestic ticket sales since its release, is still playing here at two multiplexes and at the State Theater, a sister to the Michigan that often inherits movies shown there.
 Mr. Collins compares ''Sideways'' to ''Amelie,'' a quirky French film that was a hit in 2001, or ''My Big Fat Greek Wedding,'' which became a blockbuster in 2002. '''Sideways' is one of those films that caught a buzz and did very well,'' he said.
 By contrast, ''Being Julia,'' which earned a best-actress nomination for Annette Bening, played for just one week here last fall to tiny audiences, Mr. Collins said. 
 That unpredictability frustrates Sarah Evilsizor, 26, a ticket taker at the Michigan who recently moved here from Paterson, N.J. While living there, she said she often went to the Angelika Film Center in SoHo the day that films opened. 
 Now, Ms. Evilsizor said, she avoids talking about movies with friends back East, so they won't spoil the endings of ones she hasn't seen.
 ''It's kind of silly to even read any of the reviews that come out,'' Ms. Evilsizor said, ''because it doesn't pertain to your life in this small part of the world.''
 But Matthew D. Price, 32, an associate professor of art at the University of Michigan, said the wait did not bother him. ''There are probably a lot of Midwestern cities that don't get these movies at all,'' he said. 
 Referring to the state's northernmost wilds, Mr. Price asked, ''What if I lived in the Upper Peninsula or something?''

HEADLINE: It's Maybe a Bubble, but a Selective One

BYLINE: By GARY RIVLIN

DATELINE: SAN FRANCISCO, Feb. 2 

 BODY:
Is the Internet bubble half empty or half full?
 With Google's stock on a roll, rising more than 7 percent yesterday to close at $205.96 and prompting some analysts to predict it will hit $290 or more in the coming months, it can seem like the late 1990's again on Wall Street. Shares in Google have been trading for less than six months, but they have risen 142 percent and the company has a market value of $56.2 billion, equal to that of Starbucks, Nike and Southwest Airlines -- combined. 
 Shares in another Internet star, Yahoo, are up 73 percent in the last 52 weeks. 
 But try convincing the chief executives of eBay and Amazon.com, two undisputed kings of the Internet era, that investors have had a relapse of irrational exuberance. Even though eBay's profits for all of 2004 were up 76 percent from a year earlier, the share price is down by a third since the start of January, primarily because the fourth-quarter results reported last month fell a penny short of analysts' forecasts. 
 And when Amazon.com reported growth in profits and revenue on Wednesday after the market closed, investors sent its stock tumbling as much as 15 percent in after-hours trading because those results, too, fell short of analysts' expectations. The company's stock, trading below $36 a share in the aftermarket, was down 33 percent from its high of $54.70 in mid-2004. 
 The tale of two trajectories among Internet leaders has prompted a debate. 
 ''Of course we're in a bubble again,'' said Fred Hickey, editor of The High-Tech Strategist newsletter in Nashua, N.H., and a longtime technology stock analyst. But others say that Internet investors have learned to draw distinctions that many failed to make during the dot-com craze.
 ''The good news here is that investors are certainly proving themselves more selective,'' said David M. Garrity, an analyst at Caris & Company in New York. ''It's not like we're seeing Internet stocks go up wildly across the board. This isn't the 1990's when all a company had to do is put out a barrage of press releases and see the price go up.'' 
 John Tinker, an analyst at ThinkEquity Partners, an investment bank in San Francisco, agreed that investors so far were proving themselves far more discriminating than in the late 1990's -- even if he detected over-reactions in both directions. ''This is a market that is over-rewarding for strong performance and over-penalizing when a company falls short of expectations,'' he said.
 Google's latest stock surge came on the strength of the company's announcement, after the close of the market Tuesday, that its sales and profits grew much faster than expected in the fourth quarter. 
 Profit for the period was up sevenfold compared with the final three months of 2003. And revenue for the first time broke the billion-dollar mark for a quarter, more than twice the level in the fourth quarter of 2003.
 Mr. Tinker says such performance justifies Google's current share price -- and then some. ''Sure, the share price of Google is high, but we're talking about a company with a revenue growth rate that is accelerating, not decelerating,'' Mr. Tinker said. ''These aren't a couple of guys right out of college talking about how they'll make money down the road.''
 The company's results seemed to have touched off a bit of one-upmanship among analysts on Wednesday to see who could be the most upbeat about Google, which has now surpassed eBay as the Internet stock with the greatest market value. Among analysts who revised their forecasts, Mr. Tinker projected that Google stock would hit $290 a share within the next 12 months, while Mr. Garrity predicted a price of $300 share ''or better.'' 
 The company sold shares for $85 each in its initial public offering in August. But while Google's stock price has soared, Internet stocks generally have remained relatively flat. Shares in the Morgan Stanley Internet index have risen 20 percent during the period. 
 Even while others perceive investors' drawing distinctions, Mr. Hickey still sees signs of giddiness. Mr. Hickey provides any number of examples to make his point. Volume in the penny stock world has doubled in recent months, he said, and he points to the ''wildly inflated valuation'' that the market has assigned to Travelzoo Inc., which conducts online marketing for the travel industry. Shares in Travelzoo have soared nearly sevenfold since the start of 2004, though the company reported net income of less than $2 million in the third quarter of 2004, its most recent numbers. Travelzoo's stock closed at $57.83 Wednesday, putting the company's market value just below $1 billion.
 Yet it is Google that raises Mr. Hickey's voice an octave or two. The crucial number for those analysts in awe of Google was its advertising revenue, up 122 percent from the previous year's fourth quarter. The bulk of that is from Google's AdWords program, in which it lets advertisers bid on key words -- ''asbestos'' for lawyers, say -- with the highest bidders having their ads appear whenever someone performs Web searches using those words. The bidding can run from 5 cents to $100 a click, according to Google.
 ''Basically what we're seeing is a temporary land rush going on where legal firms are paying something like $35 a click for words they see as valuable,'' Mr. Hickey said. ''Whether that's economical or not, we don't know. But I suspect it's not because I hear lawyers say it's not worth it at that price. 
 ''What happens when Microsoft is ready to really push its search engine?'' Mr. Hickey asked. ''It's basic supply and demand. When supply increases, prices fall.''
 To Mr. Hickey, the result will be 1999 all over again. ''Everyone was crazy over banner ads,'' he said. ''Banner ads, banner ads, banner ads. But guess what? It turns out banner ads weren't worth as much as people thought, and the result was that companies like Yahoo saw their share prices fall by 70 or 80 percent.''

HEADLINE: When Franchisees Lose Part of Their Independence

BYLINE: By EVE TAHMINCIOGLU

 BODY:
Philip Castaldo has owned a 7-Eleven franchise in Commack, N.Y., for 26 years and had always considered himself an independent contractor who, although part of a franchise system, had the freedom to run his business like an entrepreneur. That is, until recently, when he said he was forced to sign a contract with 7-Eleven limiting his decision making. 
 Early last year, Mr. Castaldo found out that he would be required to buy 85 percent of his product mix based on 7-Eleven's recommendations and would have to purchase those goods from distributors and companies designated by 7-Eleven, which is based in Dallas. 
 In the past, the buying decisions were largely left to his discretion, except for some proprietary products like 7-Eleven's signature slushy drink, the Slurpee. He was buying candy and cigarettes, among other products, from a host of local distributors and companies, giving him flexibility and the ability to bargain-hunt. 
 While Mr. Castaldo says he has no objection to buying some grocery products from the McLane Company, a unit of Berkshire Hathaway and the main distributor 7-Eleven has designated, he wants the freedom to choose. (A typical 7-Eleven store has about 2,400 to 3,000 items.) 
 ''We used to have much more liberty than we have now,'' he said. ''It's almost like I'm becoming a store manager.'' For example, he said, he had to drop the coffee he was getting from a local distributor and now buys a 7-Eleven brand, and he had to scale back buying a variety of flavors of Life Savers because the one recommended by 7-Eleven was peppermint.
 A 7-Eleven spokesman, Jack Wilkie, said the decision to set the product mix threshold at 85 percent was based on the company's desire to have consistent products in every 7-Eleven store. In addition, he said, the move to centralized distributors creates economies of scale and makes the process of product procurement more streamlined.
 ''It's all about using our leverage to get the lowest cost on goods for our franchisees,'' Mr. Wilkie said. 
 In response to 7-Eleven's initiatives, the National Coalition of Associations of 7-Eleven Franchisees, representing 2,000 members, filed a lawsuit in March 2004 against the company in an effort to thwart the new rules. The complaint, which is pending in California Superior Court in Alameda County, seeks to allow franchisees to revert to the old agreement, which expired Dec. 31, 2003, for more than 1,000 store owners. The suit states that the new agreement will have an adverse effect on franchisee net income.
 The dispute between 7-Eleven and its franchisees is just one skirmish in a conflict throughout the franchising industry, which finds itself in an increasingly competitive environment. A 2004 study sponsored by PricewaterhouseCoopers and the International Franchise Association calculated that there were about 760,000 franchise locations nationally. While the franchise association did not have comparable figures for previous years, it said its membership had doubled since 2000, to 950 franchise companies today. 
 As rival stores increasingly pursue customers, franchisers are demanding greater uniformity in their products to enhance their brands and promote customer loyalty. ''As franchise agreements are coming up for renewal, companies are saying, 'We need our product mix to be the same; we need our pizza to taste the same, everywhere,''' said Steve Hockett, president of FranChoice, a national franchise-referral network in Eden Prairie, Minn.
 7-Eleven is feeling pinched on all sides as more retail outlets expand into food, coffee, cigarettes, newspapers and other of its staples. ''We are in a competitive environment, whether it's grocery stores with 24-hour operations, pharmacies, coffee shops,'' Mr. Wilkie said.
 Mr. Wilkie said his company, which owns 2,400 of its own stores, had instructed its 3,200 franchise locations to move in stages to meet the 85 percent target. It required them to stock 75 percent of their shelves according to its specifications by October 2004, 80 percent by January 2005 and 85 percent by April.
 If franchisees do not meet those requirements, they will be charged 2 percent of their share of profits, or as much as $1,000 to $2,000 a month, said Tariq Khan, national chairman of the franchisee coalition in Rockville Centre, N.Y. (Franchisees split their profits 50-50 with 7-Eleven.)
 Those terms were written into a new contract that franchisees of 1,500 stores signed last May, after their existing agreements expired. But many of them, including Mr. Castaldo, said they had no choice but to accept the provisions or risk losing their businesses.
 Mr. Wilkie of 7-Eleven maintained that franchisees operating the other 1,700 stores, whose contracts were not expiring, recognized the benefits of the new directives and signed the agreement. ''Their intentions are good,'' said Mr. Khan, about 7-Eleven's 85 percent edict. ''But the geography of the franchisees is so diverse it does not make sense.'' In some cases, the new restrictions will be counterproductive by forcing store owners to drop products that are popular in their areas, he argues.
 Steven Hirshheimer, a franchisee in Bellmore, N.Y., is a case in point. Mr. Hirshheimer said that as part of the new policy, 7-Eleven recently informed him that he would have to begin selling Oscar Mayer hot dogs on his roller grill instead of Boar's Head hot dogs. But, he said, ''my customers like Boar's Head.''
 The franchisee lawsuit against 7-Eleven now pending in California disputes some terms in the agreement and ultimately seeks to give franchisees the option to stay with their old contract or opt for the new one, said Patrick Carter, a San Francisco lawyer representing the franchisee association. 
 ''Franchisers just naturally have the desire to control what the franchisees do,'' he said. ''They want the contract to say the franchisees are independent contractors but then they want to rule and govern everything they do.'' 
 While many franchisees understand the need for consistency, they are frequently unhappy with steps to restrict their buying decisions. In another dispute reflecting the industry's push for greater controls, Little Caesars Enterprises sued dozens of its franchisees in April for breach of contract and trademark infringement, claiming their restaurants were using unapproved products, including cheese, pepperoni and sauce.
 The suit is part of a continuing battle at the pizza chain. In 1999, franchisees sued the company to overturn its requirement that they buy all their products from its wholly owned distributor, Blue Line. 
 Two years later, the two sides reached a settlement, giving franchisees the right to purchase products elsewhere. As a result, a Little Caesars franchisee group, representing 300 stores, formed a cooperative in 2003 to buy products from a source other than Blue Line. Little Caesars and Blue Line are units of Ilitch Holdings.
 Michael Caddell, a lawyer with Caddell & Chapman in Houston, called the Little Caesars suit retaliatory and an attempt to derail the cooperative's shift to a new distributor. But he is positive about the future. ''We are working together cooperatively'' with Little Caesars, he said, ''and I believe in the next month or so all of these issues will be resolved and the lawsuit dismissed.'' 
 Officials at Little Caesars declined to comment on the company's lawsuit, which is pending in United States District Court in the Eastern District of Michigan. 
 Big, established franchisers face the biggest push back from franchisees when it comes to dictating buying decisions, said Mr. Hockett of FranChoice. New players, by contrast, often start out running their businesses with centralized distribution networks and designated product mixes -- and with contracts that leave franchisees little room for maneuver.
 Wing Zone, a take-out chain that started franchising in 1999, is an example. Last year, the company, which is based in Atlanta, bought six million to seven million pounds of chicken wings, said Stan Friedman, executive vice president of the chain, which has 62 locations in 20 states. Buying in bulk for all its franchisees just made economic sense, he said. ''Our franchisees are supplied centrally, with one-stop shopping via our distribution channel,'' Mr. Friedman said.
 Technology and an emphasis on just-in-time delivery are also driving the trend as more and more franchise companies look to quickly replenish products at many locations, said Will Reilly, an executive at Ascential Software, a supply chain software company in Westboro, Mass., that counts 7-Eleven among customers. 
 ''Clearly, the more distributors you have in the mix, the more complex it becomes from a technology perspective,'' he said. 
 Budding entrepreneurs who are considering buying a franchise but want to make their own purchasing decisions have plenty of options, according to Barney Greenbaum, a marketing specialist at FranNet, a consulting firm that connects franchisers and prospective franchisees. The best advice, he said, is simple: read franchise agreements carefully to figure out the level of buying autonomy.
 After more than two decades as a 7-Eleven franchisee, Mr. Castaldo said he longed for the days when he had more autonomy. ''I am not in charge of my own destiny anymore,'' he lamented.

HEADLINE: Feds Restrained Pace on Rates Inspires Only a Limp Rally

BYLINE: By JONATHAN FUERBRINGER

 BODY:
Stocks got only a small lift yesterday after Federal Reserve officials said that rate increases in the future would continue to come at a measured pace.
 The statement also announced a quarter of a percentage point increase in the Fed's benchmark short-term interest rate, to 2.5 percent. That removed any threat, for now, that interest rates would rise more quickly than expected in the months ahead because of inflationary pressures. 
 ''The Fed statement was as positive as they possibly could make it,'' said Marc Pado, United States market strategist at Cantor Fitzgerald & Company. 
 But he said that the stock market may not have rallied much because there were factors that could alter the market's tone, including the president's State of the Union speech last night, the January employment report scheduled for Friday and the meeting of the Group of 7 nations on Saturday, which is likely to focus on the dollar.
 The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index climbed 3.78 points, or 0.3 percent, to 1,193.19. It was up about 3 points before the Fed announcement. 
 The Dow Jones industrial average rose 44.85 points, or 0.4 percent, to 10,596.79, while the Nasdaq composite index rose 6.36 points, or 0.3 percent, to 2,075.06. All three market gauges are still down for the year, with S.&P. 500 off 1.6 percent, the Dow down 1.7 percent and the Nasdaq off 4.6 percent.
 In the Treasury market, shorter-term yields rose modestly after the Fed announcement, with the yield on the two-year note climbing to 3.31 percent, from 3.28 percent on Tuesday. But the yield on the 10-year note remained at 4.14 percent as the price slipped 1/32 to 100 27/32. 
 Google, the Internet search engine, was the big story of the day, as its stock jumped $14.06, or 7.3 percent, to $205.96, a closing high. The stock has risen 141.7 percent since its initial public offering in August.
 After the market closed on Tuesday, Google said that its fourth-quarter profit was $204 million, up from $27.3 million in the same quarter a year ago.
 The report was a surprise because Google said in November that it expected fourth-quarter revenue growth to be slower than last year. 
 Jordan Rohan, an analyst at RBC Capital Markets, raised his price target yesterday for Google to $250. One reason, he said, is that institutional investors will show greater demand for the shares. Google is not yet in any of the major stock indexes but it will be eventually, prompting index funds to buy it, he said.
 The strong earnings report from Google gave a lift to Yahoo, Google's chief competitor. Yahoo's stock rose 79 cents, or 2.3 percent, to $35.54.
 The other earnings story was written by Boeing, the aircraft maker. Its fourth-quarter earnings beat expectations and the company said it expected sales to improve in the next two years. The stock rose $1.19, or 2.3 percent, to $52.23.
 The Fed's quarter-point rate increase, the sixth since June, was expected. What investors and analysts were looking for was any signal that future rate increases would come faster than expected. But the Fed's statement retained language that said rate increases would be ''at a pace that is likely to be measured.''
 And despite indications that some Fed policy makers are concerned about inflationary pressures, yesterday's statement said that ''inflation and longer-term inflation expectations remain well contained.''
 In a message to clients, David J. Greenlaw, chief United States fixed income economist at Morgan Stanley, said he believed that inflation concerns were growing ''but are not yet sizable enough to alter the gradual tightening approach.''
 Alan Greenspan, the chairman of the Fed, will testify before Congress this month. If he gives any indication then that inflation fears are growing, both stock and bond investors could be set up for an unhappy surprise.

HEADLINE: An Olympic-Size Saturation Is Planned to Impress 2012 Evaluators

BYLINE: By JIM RUTENBERG

 BODY:
Wherever the 13 members of the International Olympic Committee's evaluation commission turn during their visit to New York City this month, they will be confronted by a very simple message: New York really wants the Olympics.
 Yesterday, Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg presented what will most likely rank as one of the most expensive and extensive municipal advertising campaigns ever tailored to such a small group of people. 
 The city and the nonprofit group most aggressively lobbying the committee are grabbing every piece of available advertising space it can for a campaign promoting New York as the best place for the 2012 Summer Games. The campaign, which officials estimate could benefit the city financially up to $20 million, is timed for the committee's mid-February arrival. The commission members' visit could prove critical to whether the city will be awarded the Games, beating out four other finalists: Paris, London, Madrid and Moscow. 
 But the ads, largely focusing on New York's international diversity and to be paid for by corporate donors, will remain omnipresent until the committee renders its decision this summer. 
 ''You're going see ads on phone kiosks and bus shelters and subway entrances and street poles and open spaces in each of the five boroughs,'' Mr. Bloomberg said at a news briefing at City Hall. ''You're going to see them on 7,000 subway cars and 4,000 city buses and 13,000 taxis. You'll hear them on the radio, you'll see them on television -- newspapers, magazines, Internet -- we're not going to slack on anything.''
 The new campaign is a very visual example of just how much the 2012 Summer Olympics mean to the mayor, who has poured tons of political capital and time into an effort that has drawn a fair share of criticism.
 Mr. Bloomberg has made securing the Olympics a main component of his economic development plan, arguing that the Games would help transform the city while creating jobs. But an important part of the plan is the proposed stadium on the Far West Side, and polls suggest that most New Yorkers oppose the mayor's plan to finance it publicly. 
 Corporate donors are covering the costs of the new advertising campaign, though much of it with in-kind contributions. Every major television station in the city is donating time for NYC2012 commercials, officials said. The print advertisements will run, without cost, on phone booths, billboards, tops of taxis, in some subway cars and on some buses.
 Private companies like Viacom and ClearChannel control most of that space. Officials said no publicly controlled space would be used that would otherwise fetch a profit. For instance, the campaign would appear only on spaces in subway cars that are otherwise earmarked for public service announcements.
 The print ads feature the NYC2012 logo and rainbow-colored slogans like ''Every Country Gets Homefield Advantage'' and ''Every Flag Will Wave.''
 The NYC2012 logo -- with a blue and green rendering of the Statue of Liberty -- will be affixed to every city taxi, every city bus and every subway car, officials said. NYC2012, the officials said, is picking up production costs.
 At $15 million, the advertising campaign would cost $1.15 million per International Olympic Committee member. 
 But officials said the campaign was also intended to influence the scores of international reporters who will cover the visit, while trying to excite the public as well.
 ''We certainly want to make sure that it's in everybody's face,'' Mr. Bloomberg said.

HEADLINE: BUSH SAYS A GRADUAL OVERHAUL OF SOCIAL SECURITY IS ESSENTIAL

BYLINE: By RICHARD W. STEVENSON and DAVID E. SANGER

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Feb. 2 

 BODY:
President Bush challenged a wary Congress on Wednesday night to join him in reinventing Social Security for the 21st century, saying his generation had a duty to preserve the retirement system for those who follow and for the first time setting out details of the individual investment accounts at the heart of his proposal.
 ''Social Security was a great moral success of the 20th century, and we must honor its great purposes in this new century,'' he said. "The system, however, on its current path, is headed toward bankruptcy. And so we must join together to strengthen and save Social Security.'' [Transcript, Page A22.]
 Delivering his State of the Union address three days after Iraqis went to the polls in their first free election in half a century, Mr. Bush promised not to end the American mission there before the Iraqis are capable of providing their own security against the bloody insurgency. 
 ''We will not set an artificial timetable for leaving Iraq, because that would embolden the terrorists and make them believe they can wait us out,'' he said. 
 Turning to the Middle East, where Israelis and Palestinians are embarking on a new effort at peace, he asked Congress for $350 million to support the Palestinians under their new president, Mahmoud Abbas. 
 He also expanded on the promise in his Inaugural Address to fight tyranny, saying to the Iranian people, ''As you stand for your own liberty, America stands with you,'' and urging Saudi Arabia and Egypt to ''show the way toward democracy in the Middle East.''
 He gave a preview of a domestic battle he will join in earnest next week, saying the budget he will propose on Monday would substantially reduce or eliminate more than 150 programs, an assault on government spending of a scale not seen since the ill-fated effort by Congressional Republicans in 1995 to cut entire cabinet agencies. 
 ''The principle here is clear,'' he said. ''Taxpayer dollars must be spent wisely, or not at all.''
 In an evening marked by emotional responses and the waving of fingers stained with purple ink in a gesture of solidarity with the millions of Iraqis who defied the threat of violence to vote on Sunday, Mr. Bush won hearty applause throughout much of his 53-minute speech. He was relaxed and smooth in his delivery, even when some Democrats hooted in derision at his assertions that Social Security is in dire financial straits.
 The president went into the speech fortified by his narrow but decisive victory over Senator John Kerry in November, expanded Republican majorities in the House and Senate and images of Iraqis turning out to vote on Sunday in large numbers. Mr. Bush will not face the voters again. But this year's address opened what could be the last two campaigns of his career. One is to persuade Congress and the American people to go along with his plans to remake not just Social Security but also large swaths of other domestic policy along conservative lines through judicial appointments, legislation and executive action. 
 The other is to shape his own place in history as a leader who extended freedom and democracy more broadly into the world even as he unleashed American military might to combat what he had cast as the terrorist threat to those values.
 He linked the two as elements of a generational commitment, referring to the children and grandchildren of those holding power today and asking, ''What will be the state of their union?''
 Mr. Bush's proposal for Social Security, if enacted, would produce the first fundamental overhaul in the way the retirement system works since it was created seven decades ago. Once fully phased in, his plan would allow workers who will be 55 or younger this year to place as much as 4 percent of their wages subject to the Social Security payroll tax into personal accounts that they could invest in stocks and bonds and draw on only after retiring. Workers currently pay 6.2 percent of their taxable wages to finance the retirement system, an amount matched by their employers, so a maximum contribution to the proposed accounts would amount to nearly two-thirds of their payroll tax.
 Mr. Bush did not say how he would pay for his plan; nor did he commit himself to any particular course of cuts in the guaranteed benefit to restore the retirement system's health. But simply by putting Social Security at the top of his domestic agenda and making it the centerpiece of his address, he declared his willingness to engage fully in one of the most politically fraught and ideologically charged policy battles of recent times.
 To create a sense of urgency in Congress, Mr. Bush described Social Security as in deep financial trouble.
 ''If you've got children in their 20's, as some of us do, the idea of Social Security collapsing before they retire does not seem like a small matter,'' he said. ''And it should not be a small matter to the United States Congress.''
 Critics of Mr. Bush's approach have accused him of fear-mongering, saying that there is no immediate crisis and that his prescription for change is too expensive and introduces too much risk. Social Security's actuaries estimate that the system will remain healthy until 2018, when it will begin paying out more in benefits than it takes in through payroll taxes. It would then be able to pay full benefits until 2042 by cashing in its trust fund of government bonds. After that, it would be able to pay about three-quarters of the benefits promised under current law, which calls for benefits to rise faster than the cost of living.
 By themselves, the accounts would do nothing to close the $3.7 trillion gap over the next 75 years between what Social Security is expected to pay out in benefits and what it will take in through payroll taxes. 
 Mr. Bush did little to resolve how he would deal with the most explosive component of his approach: the additional benefit cuts that would be necessary to erase that shortfall; and he repeated his opposition to tax increases as a solution. But for the first time he spelled out some of the options he might accept, including changing the formula used to set initial benefits, discouraging early retirement and raising the retirement age, notably attributing each idea to a Democrat, including former President Bill Clinton and Senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan of New York, who died two years ago.
 ''All these ideas are on the table,'' he said. ''I know that none of these reforms would be easy. But we have to move ahead with courage and honesty, because our children's retirement security is more important than partisan politics.''
 Mr. Bush skirted the issue of paying for the establishment of the accounts. That process, by the White House's calculation, would require more than $750 billion in additional government borrowing between now and 2015, and trillions of dollars of additional borrowing in the subsequent decade once the system is fully up and running, analysts said.
 Like every State of the Union address, this one contained a legislative laundry list, including his calls for an overhaul of the tax system and changes in immigration law. It also contained nods to important constituencies. Faced with unhappiness among some conservatives that he has elevated Social Security to a far more prominent place on his agenda than some of their priorities, he stressed his support for a constitutional amendment that defines marriage as between a man and a woman. He went on to repeat his belief in ''a culture of life,'' and while not specifying whether he would revisit his decision on limiting stem cell research, he said he wanted to ''work with Congress to ensure that human embryos are not created for experimentation or grown for body parts.''
 He also described a new three-year initiative to ''keep young people out of gangs'' and said the effort would be led by his wife, Laura Bush. 
 Having weathered a re-election campaign in which he parried criticism that he had led the United States into war with Iraq on false, exaggerated or ever-changing pretenses, he again presented himself as commander in chief in a battle that extends well beyond Iraq. 
 Yet he also struck the optimistic tone required by the occasion and promised to work across party lines to address the nation's problems.
 ''Tonight, with a healthy, growing economy, with more Americans going back to work, with our nation an active force for good in the world, the state of our union is confident and strong,'' he said, with Vice President Dick Cheney and J. Dennis Hastert, the speaker of the House, applauding against the backdrop of an American flag behind him.
 When he turned to foreign policy, Mr. Bush was far less combative than in the State of the Union Message in 2002, when he took aim at Saddam Hussein's Iraq, Iran and North Korea. He offered words of reassurance that he had no visions of empire-building, in an apparent effort to allay concerns that had been raised by his critics at home and abroad as they interpreted his Inaugural Address.
 Yet at the same time he seemed determined to answer both Democrats and some members of his own party who have argued that with the first wave of elections behind in Iraq, now is the time to begin a gradual withdrawal.
 ''The new political situation in Iraq opens a new phase of our work in that country,'' Mr. Bush said. 
 Describing his military strategy for the year, he added: ''We will increasingly focus our efforts on helping prepare more capable Iraqi security forces, forces with skilled officers, and an effective command structure.'' 
 The United States, he argued, ''will increasingly be in a supporting role.''
 But with his insistence that he will set no ''artificial timetable for leaving Iraq'' he was signaling that the nation should be prepared for a lengthy stay.,
 The measures of success he set for Iraq were lofty and hard to quantify: ''A country that is democratic, representatives of all its people, at peace with its neighbors, and able to defend itself.''
 He barely mentioned North Korea, other than to declare that he is ''working closely with governments in Asia'' to disarm the country, which Mr. Bush's advisers now believe has begun exporting raw nuclear materials.

HEADLINE: President Plans Anti-Gang Initiative and Program to Train Lawyers in Death Penalty Cases

BYLINE: By ROBERT PEAR

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Feb. 2 

 BODY:
Declaring that ''taxpayer dollars must be spent wisely, or not at all,'' President Bush said on Wednesday that his budget for next year would cut or eliminate more than 150 government programs.
 In his State of the Union address, Mr. Bush also announced two new initiatives in domestic policy. He said that Laura Bush would lead a national effort to ''keep young people out of gangs,'' by giving them positive models to emulate. 
 The president said that Mrs. Bush would enlist religious and community groups in a $150 million, three-year effort to ''show young men an ideal of manhood that respects women and rejects violence.'' 
 In addition, the president, who as governor of Texas was criticized for the state's high rate of executions, said he would ask Congress to expand training for defense lawyers in criminal cases that could result in the death penalty. 
 ''We must make doubly sure no person is held to account for a crime he or she did not commit,'' Mr. Bush said. ''So we are dramatically expanding the use of DNA evidence to prevent wrongful conviction. Soon I will send to Congress a proposal to fund special training for defense counsel in capital cases, because people on trial for their lives must have competent lawyers by their side.''
 The White House said Mr. Bush's 2006 budget, to be unveiled on Monday, would request $236 million for additional laboratory analysis of DNA samples and for the training of lawyers and law enforcement officers in the use of DNA.
 Such training would improve the use of DNA to solve crimes and to clear suspects, the White House said, noting that many public crime laboratories had large backlogs of samples waiting for analysis.
 Mr. Bush confirmed that he was preparing a comprehensive new effort to rein in the growth of domestic spending, as lawmakers and lobbyists had predicted.
 ''America's prosperity requires restraining the spending appetite of the federal government,'' he said. ''I welcome the bipartisan enthusiasm for spending discipline. I will send you a budget that holds the growth of discretionary spending below inflation, makes tax relief permanent, and stays on track to cut the deficit in half by 2009.''
 Mr. Bush said his budget would cut programs that are not getting results, or that duplicate current efforts or do not fulfill essential priorities.
 He did not name any of those programs. Other administration officials said Mr. Bush would propose cutbacks in Medicaid, Amtrak subsidies, housing assistance and community development programs, among others. Mr. Bush said he wanted to extend educational standards and testing from elementary schools to high schools. Testing is a major element of the sweeping education law he signed in January 2002.
 ''Under the No Child Left Behind Act,'' Mr. Bush said, ''standards are higher, test scores are on the rise and we are closing the achievement gap for minority students. Now we must demand better results from our high schools, so every high school diploma is a ticket to success.''
 The White House said Mr. Bush's budget would seek $1.5 billion for a new high school initiative to evaluate the academic performance of high school students and to ensure that diplomas are truly meaningful.
 In addition, Mr. Bush said, ''we will make it easier for Americans to afford a college education, by increasing the size of Pell grants.'' The budget would increase the maximum Pell grant award by $100 a year, to $4,550 in five years.
 Mr. Bush reaffirmed his support for a proposed constitutional amendment to ban same-sex marriage. White House officials said last month that they did not think they had the votes needed to approve such an amendment in the Senate.
 But in his State of the Union speech, Mr. Bush said: ''Because marriage is a sacred institution and the foundation of society, it should not be redefined by activist judges. For the good of families, children and society, I support a constitutional amendment to protect the institution of marriage.''
 The president praised Congress for doubling the budget of the National Institutes of Health, but said that medical research must not violate the dignity of human life. ''I will work with Congress to ensure that human embryos are not created for experimentation or grown for body parts, and that human life is never bought and sold as a commodity,'' Mr. Bush said. 
 About 45 million Americans lack health insurance. Mr. Bush quickly recapitulated his proposals to expand coverage and to slow the rapid growth of health costs.
 ''I ask Congress to move forward on a comprehensive health care agenda,'' he said, ''with tax credits to help low-income workers buy insurance, a community health center in every poor county, improved information technology to prevent medical errors and needless costs, association health plans for small businesses and their employees, expanded health savings accounts, and medical liability reform.''

HEADLINE: 'We Democrats Have a Different Vision': The Rebuttal

 BODY:
Following are excerpts from statements by Senator Harry Reid of Nevada, the Senate Democratic leader, and Representative Nancy Pelosi of California, the House Democratic leader, as prepared for delivery:

Mr. Reid
 I was born and raised in the high desert of Nevada in a tiny town called Searchlight. My dad was a hard-rock miner. My mom took in wash. I grew up around people of strong values -- even if they rarely talked about them. . . .
 It's time that America's government lived by the same values as America's families. It's time we invested in America's future and made sure our people have the skills to compete and thrive in a 21st century economy. That's what Democrats believe. That's where we stand. That's what we'll fight for.
 Too many of the president's economic policies have left Americans and American companies struggling. And after we worked so hard to eliminate the deficit, his policies have added trillions to the debt -- in effect, a 'birth tax' of $36,000 on every child that is born.
 We Democrats have a different vision: spurring research and development in new technologies to help create the jobs of the future. Rolling up our sleeves and fighting for today's jobs by ending the special tax breaks that encourage big corporations to ship jobs overseas. A trade policy that enforces the rules of the road so that we play to win in the global marketplace instead of sitting by and getting played for fools.
 After World War II, through the Marshall Plan, we rebuilt Europe and they went from poverty to an economic powerhouse. Today, we need to invest in our nation's future with a Marshall Plan for America -- to build the infrastructure our economy needs to go -- and grow. President Eisenhower did that in the 1950's with the interstate highways. National investment created the Internet in the 1970's. We need to build the next economy -- and we need to start now.
 This 21st century economy holds great promise for our people. But unless we give all Americans the skills they need to succeed, countries like India and China will take good-paying jobs that should be ours. . . .
 I want you to know that when we believe the president is on the right track, we won't let partisan interests get in the way of what's good for the country. We will be first in line to work with him. But when he gets off track, we will be there to hold him accountable.
 And that's why we so strongly disagree with the president's plan to privatize Social Security. Let me share with you why I believe the president's plan is so dangerous. There's a lot we can do to improve American's retirement security, but it's wrong to replace the guaranteed benefit that Americans have earned with a guaranteed benefit cut of 40 percent or more. Make no mistake, that's exactly what President Bush is proposing.
 The Bush plan would take our already record high $4.3 trillion national debt and put us another $2 trillion in the red. That's an immoral burden to place on the backs of the next generation.
 But maybe most of all, the Bush plan isn't really Social Security reform. It's more like Social Security roulette. Democrats are all for giving Americans more of a say and more choices when it comes to their retirement savings. But that doesn't mean taking Social Security's guarantee and gambling with it. And that's coming from a senator who represents Las Vegas. 
 Are we willing to do right by our parents and care for our children? Do we believe that big corporations with powerful lobbyists should get special favors and that the wealthiest should get special tax breaks? Or do we believe we are all God's children and that each of us should get a fair shot and each of us deserves a say in our future?

Ms. Pelosi
 Throughout our nation's history, hope and optimism have defined the American spirit. With pride and determination, every generation has passed on a stronger America than the one it inherited. Our greatest responsibility is to leave our children a world that is safer and more secure.
 As House Democratic leader, I want to speak with you this evening about an issue of grave concern -- the national security of our country.
 Any discussion of our national security must begin with recognition and respect for our men and women in uniform. . . . Our troops not only defend us, they inspire us. They remind us of our responsibility to build a future worthy of their sacrifice.
 Because of the courage of our servicemen and women and the determination of the Iraqi people, Iraq's election on Sunday was a significant step toward Iraqis taking their future into their own hands. Now we must consider our future in Iraq.
 We all know that the United States cannot stay in Iraq indefinitely and continue to be viewed as an occupying force. Neither should we slip out the back door, falsely declaring victory but leaving chaos.
 Despite the best efforts of our troops and their Iraqi counterparts, Iraq still faces a violent and persistent insurgency, and the chairman of the National Intelligence Council said in January that Iraq is now a magnet for international terrorists.
 We have never heard a clear plan from this administration for ending our presence in Iraq. And we did not hear one tonight. Democrats believe a credible plan to bring our troops home and stabilize Iraq must include three key elements.
 First, responsibility for Iraqi security must be transferred to the Iraqis as soon as possible. . . . .Second, Iraq's economic development must be accelerated. . . . Third, regional diplomacy must be intensified. . . . If these three steps are taken, the next elections in Iraq, scheduled for December, can be held in a more secure atmosphere, with broader participation, and a much smaller American presence.
 Just as we must transfer greater responsibility to the Iraqi people for their own security, we must embrace a renewed commitment to our security here at home. It's been over three years since the attacks of Sept. 11. Our hopes and prayers will always be with the 9/11 families, who strengthen our resolve to win the war on terror. The pain and horror of that day will never be forgotten by any of us, yet the gaps in our security exposed by those attacks remain. . . . 
 We can and we must keep the world's most gruesome weapons out of the world's most dangerous hands. Nothing is more important to our homeland security, and indeed to the safety of the world. For three years, the president has failed to put together a comprehensive plan to protect America from terrorism, and we did not hear one tonight. . . . 
 Democrats are committed to a strong national security that keeps America safe, that wins the war on terror, and that never again sends our troops into harm's way without the equipment they need. . . . 
 For those returning from military service today -- our newest veterans -- Democrats are calling for a G.I. Bill of Rights for the 21st century to guarantee access to education, health care and the opportunity for good jobs.
 And as we protect and defend the American people, we must also protect and defend our Constitution and the civil liberties contained therein. That is our oath of office.

HEADLINE: Hearings on Antipollution Bill End, With Each Side Unmoved

BYLINE: By MICHAEL JANOFSKY

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Feb. 2 

 BODY:
The hearings are over; the contentious issues are clear.
 What remains uncertain is just how or even whether the Bush administration's preferred approach to curbing pollution emissions will survive a committee vote to reach the full Senate this year.
 The final hearing on the Clear Skies Act of 2005 ended Wednesday with minds apparently unchanged. Nine members of the Senate Environment and Public Works Committee, led by its chairman, James. M. Inhofe of Oklahoma, favor the bill; nine other committee members, including one Republican, Lincoln Chafee of Rhode Island, prefer another approach. Mr. Inhofe promised a final version of the bill in two weeks. 
 Three hours of testimony on Wednesday appeared to do more to highlight differences than smooth a path toward compromise. James L. Connaughton, chairman of the White House Council on Environmental Quality, said ''the time is now'' to pass the measure, praising what he described as its balanced approach to reducing pollution while spurring economic benefits.
 John D. Walke of the Natural Resources Defense Council was the only one of four witnesses who opposed the bill, calling it a dangerous rollback of current Clean Air Act statutes and a financial reward to utility companies.
 Senators on both sides of the issue expressed hope that bipartisanship would prevail, but none articulated a way to get there. ''Like everything else in this place, the devil is in the details,'' Senator George V. Voinovich of Ohio, a co-sponsor of the bill along with Mr. Inhofe, said after the hearing. ''A lot of things were raised; we'll look at all of them.''
 Some of the major points dividing committee members are these:
 Should a bill that sets emission limits for sulfur dioxide, nitrogen oxides and mercury include caps for carbon dioxide, a heat-trapping gas that scientists say contributes to global warming?
 Are the 70 percent pollution reductions promised by 2018 deep enough and soon enough?
 Does the bill take a realistic approach to curbing mercury emissions when many of the smaller coal-fired power plants covered would be exempt from new mercury controls?
 Mr. Connaughton, a leading contender to replace Michael O. Leavitt as administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency, argued that the Clear Skies approach would benefit both the environment in the form of record emission cuts and the economy in the form of jobs. Its passage, he said, would bring nearly the entire country into compliance with air pollution standards, reduce the threat of costly litigation and assure that power plant operators spent $52 billion on upgrades.
 Abraham Breehey of the International Brotherhood of Boilermakers, Iron Ship Builders, Blacksmiths, Forgers and Helpers told the committee that ''a significant portion'' of the money would guarantee union jobs for his workers, installing pollution controls. 
 Opposing the bill, Mr. Walke said its health costs would exceed by $61 billion those of an Environmental agency proposal developed under President Bush's first administrator, Christie Whitman.
 After hearing the arguments from both sides, Mr. Voinovich said: ''We need to move forward; it's important to the environment and the economy. We have to find some way to get a meeting of the minds.''

HEADLINE: Bush's Calls for Tort Overhaul Face Action in Congress

BYLINE: By STEPHEN LABATON

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Feb. 2 

 BODY:
With President Bush pressing Congress for a swift overhaul of the nation's civil liability system, action in the Senate Judiciary Committee this week is quickly turning into the political laboratory for what will be doable and what will be difficult.
 In his State of the Union address on Wednesday evening, Mr. Bush once again urged lawmakers to rewrite the tort law rules to do away with what he has called frivolous and costly lawsuits, which he has repeatedly said have become a significant drag on the economy. 
 ''We must free small business from needless regulation and protect honest job-creators from junk lawsuits,'' Mr. Bush said in the address. ''Justice is distorted, and our economy is held back, by irresponsible class actions and frivolous asbestos claims -- and I urge Congress to pass legal reforms this year.'' 
 His critics, led by the trial lawyers and labor and consumer groups, say that the crisis is not one of litigation, but of public health and safety. They say his proposals are meant to protect big companies and their insurers from claims of injury, environmental neglect and consumer fraud.
 Still, there is broad bipartisan support for some pieces of Mr. Bush's tort law plan, while serious obstacles stand in the way of passage of others. 
 On Thursday, the Senate Judiciary Committee is expected to approve by a wide margin a measure that would transfer most class-action lawsuits from state courts to federal courts. That measure, the first in the package of changes to the tort system, is expected to reach the Senate floor next week, and Republican and Democratic supporters say it will be quickly approved. 
 The bill has seven Democratic co-sponsors: Senators Herb Kohl of Wisconsin, Thomas R. Carper of Delaware, Christopher J. Dodd of Connecticut, Dianne Feinstein of California, Mary L. Landrieu of Louisiana, Blanche Lincoln of Arkansas, and Charles E. Schumer of New York. 
 The measure is opposed by federal judges who say they fear it will clog their dockets, and by consumer, environmental and civil rights groups that say it could close the courthouse door to cases that are not frivolous, or at least defer action on them. 
 They say that federal judges are likely to dismiss class-action cases that involve the laws of several states, like major consumer-protection suits, and that because there are many more state judges than federal judges, one likely effect of the legislation would be a significant delay in class actions.
 Lawmakers supporting Mr. Bush's efforts say they hope that the quick adoption of the class-action measure will provide political momentum for the two other major tort-law bills: one to remove all asbestos injury cases from the courts and the other to limit damages in medical malpractice suits.
 But at a hearing on Wednesday before the Senate Judiciary Committee, the lawmakers explored several issues that threaten to derail the asbestos measure. Congress has for years tried without success to adopt legislation to address the growing number of asbestos lawsuits.
 The bill, a complex piece of legislation that would channel all asbestos claims out of the courts and into a $140 billion special trust program, is being worked out by Senator Arlen Specter, Republican of Pennsylvania, the new chairman of the Judiciary Committee, and Senator Patrick J. Leahy of Vermont, the panel's ranking Democrat. 
 Mr. Specter has assigned a friend and senior appeals court judge, Edward R. Becker of Philadelphia, the task of coordinating negotiations and drafting sessions with representatives from the defendant asbestos makers, insurers, as well as labor groups and trial lawyers. 
 The measure would force plaintiffs who say they are victims of asbestos poisoning out of the courts, requiring them to apply for relief to the new trust to be run under the auspices of the Labor Department. 
 Judge Becker and Mr. Specter still face a list of difficult issues, any one of which could ultimately derail the legislation. On Wednesday, the committee heard testimony about the medical and legal issues surrounding the growing number of cases in which workers are filing claims for injuries that they assert were caused by exposure to asbestos from construction and to silica from activities like sandblasting and mining.
 Like many other aspects of the legislation, the debate over the treatment of silica illnesses by the courts essentially boils down to devising a measure that would be able to set up mechanisms to distinguish legitimate claims of injury from spurious ones. 
 Some lawmakers said they did not want legislation that would push silica cases into the new asbestos trust, but neither did they want to create a mechanism for plaintiffs to get into state courts by claiming to have simultaneously suffered from asbestos and silica exposure. 
 Complicating the policy decisions was new evidence suggesting that thousands of workers are claiming to be suffering from both silica and asbestos exposure in many cases that could be fraudulent. Senator Feinstein, Democrat of California, said, ''We do have to preclude dual claims'' without restricting legitimate silica cases. 
 A panel of medical experts testified Wednesday that it was extremely rare for a person to suffer from both asbestos and silica diseases, and that it was simple to distinguish symptoms of each disease.
 That conclusion seemed to hearten the senators, particularly Mr. Specter, who suggested that the courts would be able to separate meritorious from frivolous claims with relative ease.

HEADLINE: Washington's Oscar Night: Red and Blue And Smiling

BYLINE: By ALESSANDRA STANLEY

 BODY:
The words were stately and solemn -- but not the man uttering them. As applause lapped around him, George W. Bush grinned, nodded and, at one point, when promising to block judges who ''legislate from the bench,'' even winked. His was the confident grin of a high school student who was expected by many to flunk the course, and instead got an A minus on his last paper. 
 There was no mystery over what the president would say about the state of the union (''strong''), just on how he would say it. He was not as bold and belligerent as he was at his Inaugural Address; he was buoyant. 
 Mr. Bush is sometimes described as the luckiest politician alive, and once again his good fortune played out just in time for the first State of the Union address of his second term. He faced Congress fresh from a surprisingly successful Iraqi election that for a moment at least cast the war in a rosier light, allowing the president to take a victory lap -- with standing ovations on both sides of the aisle. 
 The state of the union is less a political event than a Washington showboating ritual -- Oscar Night on the Potomac. For viewers accustomed to political bickering and entrenched partisanship, particularly on so polarizing an issue as Social Security, the spectacle of Democratic senators laughing with their Republican rivals and cheering the president might be puzzling. (The groans that greeted Mr. Bush's dire predictions for Social Security were brief and muted.) In Washington, under the warm glow of a live camera, the power of victory is everything. Democrats do not want to get caught looking peevish anymore than do the losers at the Academy Awards. 
 In Hollywood, celebrities walk the red carpet. In the Capitol, the carpet is blue, but new cabinet members strutted down it with the same dazed delight as the stars in the movie ''Sideways.''
 Hollywood stars use fashion to show off their good looks and glamour. Senators and members of Congress also use clothes to make a statement, though style has nothing to do with it. Many women followed the example of Senator Kay Bailey Hutchison of Texas and wore boxy bright crimson suits that recalled the 1980's and Nancy Reagan red -- her husband is Mr. Bush's role model and the last Republican president to win a second term. (There is always at least one fashion rebel. Elizabeth Dole, her dark hair dyed honey, wore a violet suit that was more evocative of Elizabeth Taylor than Nancy Reagan.)
 Republicans held up index fingers painted purple as a symbol of Iraqi citizens whose fingers were inked as they voted last Sunday. They looked as if they were fans holding up cigarette lighters at a rock concert. 
 And like the Oscars, much of the fun of the night is in the cutaways to famous faces in the audience. Hillary Rodham Clinton, who in 2001 was caught rolling her eyes as the newly elected president unveiled his budget and tax cuts, has since learned to be lens-wary. When the camera turned to her as Mr. Bush raised the issue of reforming the tax code, Mrs. Clinton kept her eyes demurely cast down and hands folded -- only her pursed lips betrayed her inner disdain. 
 Senator John Kerry was frowning in concentration as he listened to Mr. Bush list his economic achievements. As soon as he felt the camera's focus, the defeated presidential candidate relaxed his features into a mask of cheerful complacency.
 Mr. Bush is not known for natural eloquence (he made the word ''duty'' sound like the second word in ''Howdy Doodie'' ), but he does know how to put silence to effective use. The most dramatic moment occurred when he acknowledged a dead marine's Texan mother in the balcony. As she handed what appeared to be her son's dogtags to an Iraqi woman, the president bit his lip and looked like he was about to cry -- a poignant tableau that superseded all the flag-covered coffins the Pentagon has shielded from cameras and all the soldiers' funerals the president has not attended.
 Mostly, however, the president was in high spirits. So were some of the television reporters who covered his speech. Bob Schieffer, who was just appointed to succeed Dan Rather temporarily until CBS News picks a new anchor, looked even jollier than Mr. Bush. As giddily excited members of Congress mobbed the president at his arrival, Mr. Schieffer chuckled happily. 
 ''I always love it, Dan,'' he said to the less joyful Mr. Rather. ''This has got to be the greatest boost to any president's ego.''

HEADLINE: 'We Must Pass Reforms That Solve the Financial Problems of Social Security'

 BODY:
Following is a transcript of President Bush's State of the Union address, as recorded by The New York Times:
 As a new Congress gathers, all of us in the elected branches of government share a great privilege: We have been placed in office by the votes of the people we serve. And tonight that is a privilege we share with newly elected leaders of Afghanistan, the Palestinian territories, Ukraine and a free and sovereign Iraq. 
 Two weeks ago, I stood on the steps of this Capitol and renewed the commitment of our nation to the guiding ideal of liberty for all. This evening I will set forth policies to advance that ideal at home and around the world.
 Tonight, with a healthy, growing economy, with more Americans going back to work, with our nation an active force for good in the world, the state of our union is confident and strong. 
 Our generation has been blessed by the expansion of opportunity, by advances in medicine, by the security purchased by our parents' sacrifice. Now, as we see a little gray in the mirror, or a lot of gray, and we watch our children moving into adulthood, we ask the question: What will be the state of their union?
 Members of Congress, the choices we make together will answer that question. Over the next several months, on issue after issue, let us do what Americans have always done and build a better world for our children and our grandchildren. 
 First, we must be good stewards of this economy and renew the great institutions on which millions of our fellow citizens rely.
 America's economy is the fastest growing of any major industrialized nation. In the past four years, we've provided tax relief to every person who pays income taxes, overcome a recession, opened up new markets abroad, prosecuted corporate criminals, raised homeownership to its highest level in history and, in the last year alone, the United States has added 2.3 million new jobs. When action was needed, the Congress delivered, and the nation is grateful.
 Now we must add to these achievements. By making our economy more flexible, more innovative and more competitive, we will keep America the economic leader of the world. 
 America's prosperity requires restraining the spending appetite of the federal government. I welcome the bipartisan enthusiasm for spending discipline. I will send you a budget that holds the growth of discretionary spending below inflation, makes tax relief permanent and stays on track to cut the deficit in half by 2009. 
 My budget substantially reduces or eliminates more than 150 government programs that are not getting results, or duplicate current efforts, or do not fulfill essential priorities. The principle here is clear: Taxpayer dollars must be spent wisely, or not at all. 
 To make our economy stronger and more dynamic, we must prepare a rising generation to fill the jobs of the 21st century. Under the No Child Left Behind Act, standards are higher, test scores are on the rise and we're closing the achievement gap for minority students. 
 Now we must demand better results from our high schools, so every high school diploma is a ticket to success. We will help an additional 200,000 workers to get training for a better career by reforming our job training system and strengthening America's community colleges. And we will make it easier for Americans to afford a college education by increasing the size of Pell Grants.
 To make our economy stronger and more competitive, America must reward, not punish, the efforts and dreams of entrepreneurs. Small business is the path of advancement, especially for women and minorities, so we must free small businesses from needless regulation and protect honest job-creators from junk lawsuits. Justice is distorted, and our economy is held back by irresponsible class actions and frivolous asbestos claims, and I urge Congress to pass legal reforms this year.
 To make our economy stronger and more productive, we must make health care more affordable and give families greater access to good coverage and more control over their health decisions. I ask Congress to move forward on a comprehensive health care agenda, with tax credits to help low-income workers buy insurance, a community health center in every poor county, improved information technology to prevent medical error and needless costs, association health plans for small businesses and their employees, expanded health savings accounts, and medical liability reform that will reduce health care costs and make sure patients have the doctors and care they need. 
 To keep our economy growing, we also need reliable supplies of affordable, environmentally responsible energy. Nearly four years ago, I submitted a comprehensive energy strategy that encourages conservation, alternative sources, a modernized electricity grid and more production here at home, including safe, clean nuclear energy. My Clear Skies legislation will cut power plant pollution and improve the health of our citizens. And my budget provides strong funding for leading-edge technology -- from hydrogen-fueled cars, to clean coal, to renewable sources such as ethanol. Four years of debate is enough -- I urge Congress to pass legislation that makes America more secure and less dependent on foreign energy.
 All these proposals are essential to expand this economy and add new jobs, but they are just the beginning of our duty. To build the prosperity of future generations, we must update institutions that were created to meet the needs of an earlier time. Year after year, Americans are burdened by an archaic, incoherent federal tax code. I have appointed a bipartisan panel to examine the tax code from top to bottom. And when their recommendations are delivered, you and I will work together to give this nation a tax code that is pro-growth, easy to understand and fair to all. 
 America's immigration system is also outdated, unsuited to the needs of our economy and to the values of our country. We should not be content with laws that punish hardworking people who want only to provide for their families, and deny businesses willing workers, and invite chaos at our border. It is time for an immigration policy that permits temporary guest workers to fill jobs Americans will not take, that rejects amnesty, that tells us who is entering and leaving our country, and that closes the border to drug dealers and terrorists.

Social Security
 One of America's most important institutions, a symbol of the trust between generations, is also in need of wise and effective reform. Social Security was a great moral success of the 20th century, and we must honor its great purposes in this new century. The system, however, on its current path, is headed toward bankruptcy. And so we must join together to strengthen and save Social Security.
 Today, more than 45 million Americans receive Social Security benefits, and millions more are nearing retirement, and for them the system is sound and fiscally strong. I have a message for every American who is 55 or older: Do not let anyone mislead you. For you, the Social Security system will not change in any way. 
 For younger workers, the Social Security system has serious problems that will grow worse with time. Social Security was created decades ago, for a very different era. In those days people did not live as long, benefits were much lower than they are today, and a half century ago, about 16 workers paid into the system for each person drawing benefits. 
 Our society has changed in ways the founders of Social Security could not have foreseen. In today's world, people are living longer and therefore drawing benefits longer, and those benefits are scheduled to rise dramatically over the next few decades. And instead of 16 workers paying in for every beneficiary, right now it's only about three workers, and over the next few decades, that number will fall to just two workers per beneficiary. With each passing year, fewer workers are paying ever-higher benefits to an ever-larger number of retirees. 
 So here is the result: Thirteen years from now, in 2018, Social Security will be paying out more than it takes in. And every year afterward will bring a new shortfall, bigger than the year before.
 For example, in the year 2027, the government will somehow have to come up with an extra $200 billion to keep the system afloat, and by 2033, the annual shortfall would be more than $300 billion. By the year 2042, the entire system would be exhausted and bankrupt. If steps are not taken to avert that outcome, the only solutions would be dramatically higher taxes, massive new borrowing, or sudden and severe cuts in Social Security benefits or other government programs. 
 I recognize that 2018 and 2042 may seem a long way off. But those dates aren't so distant, as any parent will tell you. If you have a 5-year-old, you're already concerned about how you'll pay for college tuition 13 years down the road. If you've got children in their 20's, as some of us do, the idea of Social Security collapsing before they retire does not seem like a small matter. And it should not be a small matter to the United States Congress. 
 You and I share a responsibility. We must pass reforms that solve the financial problems of Social Security once and for all.
 Fixing Social Security permanently will require an open, candid review of the options. Some have suggested limiting benefits for wealthy retirees. Former Congressman Tim Penny has raised the possibility of indexing benefits to prices rather than wages. During the 1990's, my predecessor, President Clinton, spoke of increasing the retirement age. Former Senator John Breaux suggested discouraging early collection of Social Security benefits. The late Senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan recommended changing the way benefits are calculated. 
 All these ideas are on the table. I know that none of these reforms would be easy. But we have to move ahead with courage and honesty, because our children's retirement security is more important than partisan politics.
 I will work with members of Congress to find the most effective combination of reforms. I will listen to anyone who has a good idea to offer. We must, however, be guided by some basic principles. 
 We must make Social Security permanently sound, not leave that task for another day.
 We must not jeopardize our economic strength by increasing payroll taxes.
 We must ensure that lower income Americans get the help they need to have dignity and peace of mind in their retirement. 
 We must guarantee there is no change for those now retired or nearing retirement. 
 And we must take care that any changes in the system are gradual, so younger workers have years to prepare and plan for their future. 
 As we fix Social Security, we also have the responsibility to make the system a better deal for younger workers. And the best way to reach that goal is through voluntary personal retirement accounts. 
 Here is how the idea works. Right now, a set portion of the money you earn is taken out of your paycheck to pay for the Social Security benefits of today's retirees. If you are a younger worker, I believe you should be able to set aside part of that money in your own retirement account, so you can build a nest egg for your own future.
 Here is why personal accounts are a better deal. Your money will grow, over time, at a greater rate than anything the current system can deliver, and your account will provide money for retirement over and above the check you will receive from Social Security. In addition, you'll be able to pass along the money that accumulates in your personal account, if you wish, to your children or grandchildren. And best of all, the money in the account is yours, and the government can never take it away. 
 The goal here is greater security in retirement, so we will set careful guidelines for personal accounts. 
 We will make sure the money can only go into a conservative mix of bonds and stock funds.
 We'll make sure that your earnings are not eaten up by hidden Wall Street fees. 
 We'll make sure there are good options to protect your investments from sudden market swings on the eve of your retirement. 
 We'll make sure a personal account cannot be emptied out all at once, but rather paid out over time, as an addition to traditional Social Security benefits.
 And we will make sure this plan is fiscally responsible by starting personal retirement accounts gradually and raising the yearly limits on contributions over time, eventually permitting all workers to set aside 4 percentage points of their payroll taxes in their accounts. 
 Personal retirement accounts should be familiar to federal employees, because you already have something similar called the Thrift Savings Plan, which lets workers deposit a portion of their paychecks into any of five different broadly based investment funds. It's time to extend the same security, and choice, and ownership to young Americans. 

Values
 Our second great responsibility to our children and grandchildren is to honor and to pass along the values that sustain a free society. So many of my generation, after a long journey, have come home to family and faith, and are determined to bring up responsible, moral children. Government is not the source of these values, but government should never undermine them. 
 Because marriage is a sacred institution and the foundation of society, it should not be redefined by activist judges. For the good of families, children and society, I support a constitutional amendment to protect the institution of marriage. 
 Because a society is measured by how it treats the weak and vulnerable, we must strive to build a culture of life. Medical research can help us reach that goal by developing treatments and cures that save lives and help people overcome disabilities, and I thank the Congress for doubling the funding of the National Institutes of Health. 
 To build a culture of life we must also ensure that scientific advances always serve human dignity, not take advantage of some lives for the benefit of others. We should all be able to agree on some clear standards. I will work with Congress to ensure that human embryos are not created for experimentation or grown for body parts, and that human life is never bought and sold as a commodity. America will continue to lead the world in medical research that is ambitious, aggressive, and always ethical. 
 Because courts must always deliver impartial justice, judges have a duty to faithfully interpret the law, not legislate from the bench. As president, I have a constitutional responsibility to nominate men and women who understand the role of courts in our democracy and are well qualified to serve on the bench, and I have done so. The Constitution also gives the Senate a responsibility: Every judicial nominee deserves an up-or-down vote.
 Because one of the deepest values of our country is compassion, we must never turn away from any citizen who feels isolated from the opportunities of America. Our government will continue to support faith-based and community groups that bring hope to harsh places. 
 Now we need to focus on giving young people, especially young men in our cities, better options than apathy, or gangs, or jail. Tonight I propose a three-year initiative to help organizations keep young people out of gangs, and show young men an ideal of manhood that respects women and rejects violence.
 Taking on gang life will be one part of a broader outreach to at-risk youth, which involves parents and pastors, coaches and community leaders, in programs ranging from literacy to sports. And I'm proud that the leader of this nationwide effort will be our first lady, Laura Bush. 
 Because HIV/AIDS brings suffering and fear into so many lives, I ask you to reauthorize the Ryan White Act to encourage prevention, and provide care and treatment to the victims of that disease. And as we update this important law, we must focus our efforts on fellow citizens with the highest rates of new cases, African-American men and women. 
 Because one of the main sources of our national unity is our belief in equal justice, we need to make sure Americans of all races and backgrounds have confidence in the system that provides justice. In America we must make doubly sure no person is held to account for a crime he or she did not commit. So we are dramatically expanding the use of DNA evidence to prevent wrongful conviction. Soon I will send to Congress a proposal to fund special training for defense counsel in capital cases, because people on trial for their lives must have competent lawyers by their side. 

National Security
 Our third responsibility to future generations is to leave them an America that is safe from danger, and protected by peace. We will pass along to our children all the freedoms we enjoy -- and chief among them is freedom from fear.
 In the three and a half years since September the 11th, 2001, we've taken unprecedented actions to protect Americans. We've created a new department of government to defend our homeland, focused the F.B.I. on preventing terrorism, begun to reform our intelligence agencies, broken up terror cells across the country, expanded research on defenses against biological and chemical attack, improved border security and trained more than a half million first responders. Police and firefighters, air marshals, researchers, and so many others are working every day to make our homeland safer, and we thank them all.
 Our nation, working with allies and friends, has also confronted the enemy abroad, with measures that are determined, successful and continuing. The Al Qaeda terror network that attacked our country still has leaders, but many of its top commanders have been removed. There are still governments that sponsor and harbor terrorists, but their number has declined. There are still regimes seeking weapons of mass destruction, but no longer without attention and without consequence. Our country is still the target of terrorists who want to kill many and intimidate us all, and we will stay on the offensive against them until the fight is won. 
 Pursuing our enemies is a vital commitment of the war on terror, and I thank the Congress for providing our servicemen and women with the resources they have needed. During this time of war we must continue to support our military and give them the tools for victory. 
 Other nations around the globe have stood with us. In Afghanistan, an international force is helping provide security. In Iraq, 28 countries have troops on the ground, the United Nations and the European Union provided technical assistance for the elections, and NATO is leading a mission to help train Iraqi officers. We are cooperating with 60 governments in the Proliferation Security Initiative, to detect and stop the transit of dangerous materials. We are working closely with the governments in Asia to convince North Korea to abandon its nuclear ambitions. Pakistan, Saudi Arabia and nine other countries have captured or detained Al Qaeda terrorists. In the next four years, my administration will continue to build the coalitions that will defeat the dangers of our time.
 In the long term, the peace we seek will only be achieved by eliminating the conditions that feed radicalism and ideologies of murder. If whole regions of the world remain in despair and grow in hatred, they will be the recruiting grounds for terror, and that terror will stalk America and other free nations for decades. 
 The only force powerful enough to stop the rise of tyranny and terror, and replace hatred with hope, is the force of human freedom. Our enemies know this, and that is why the terrorist Zarqawi recently declared war on what he called the ''evil principle'' of democracy. And we have declared our own intention: America will stand with the allies of freedom to support democratic movements in the Middle East and beyond, with the ultimate goal of ending tyranny in our world. 
 The United States has no right, no desire, and no intention to impose our form of government on anyone else. That is one of the main differences between us and our enemies. They seek to impose and expand an empire of oppression, in which a tiny group of brutal, self-appointed rulers control every aspect of every life. 
 Our aim is to build and preserve a community of free and independent nations, with governments that answer to their citizens, and reflect their own cultures. And because democracies respect their own people and their neighbors, the advance of freedom will lead to peace. 
 That advance has great momentum in our time, shown by women voting in Afghanistan, and Palestinians choosing a new direction, and the people of Ukraine asserting their democratic rights and electing a president. We are witnessing landmark events in the history of liberty. And in the coming years, we will add to that story. 

The Middle East
 The beginnings of reform and democracy in the Palestinian territories are now showing the power of freedom to break old patterns of violence and failure. Tomorrow morning, Secretary of State Rice departs on a trip that will take her to Israel and the West Bank for meetings with Prime Minister Sharon and President Abbas. She will discuss with them how we and our friends can help the Palestinian people end terror and build the institutions of a peaceful, independent democratic state.
 To promote this democracy, I will ask Congress for $350 million to support Palestinian political, economic, and security reforms. The goal of two democratic states, Israel and Palestine, living side by side in peace is within reach, and America will help them achieve that goal. 
 To promote peace and stability in the broader Middle East, the United States will work with our friends in the region to fight the common threat of terror, while we encourage a higher standard of freedom. 
 Hopeful reform is already taking hold in an arc from Morocco to Jordan to Bahrain. The government of Saudi Arabia can demonstrate its leadership in the region by expanding the role of its people in determining their future. And the great and proud nation of Egypt, which showed the way toward peace in the Middle East, can now show the way toward democracy in the Middle East. 
 To promote peace in the broader Middle East, we must confront regimes that continue to harbor terrorists and pursue weapons of mass murder. 
 Syria still allows its territory, and parts of Lebanon, to be used by terrorists who seek to destroy every chance of peace in the region. You have passed, and we are applying, the Syrian Accountability Act, and we expect the Syrian government to end all support for terror and open the door to freedom.
 Today, Iran remains the world's primary state sponsor of terror, pursuing nuclear weapons while depriving its people of the freedom they seek and deserve. We are working with European allies to make clear to the Iranian regime that it must give up its uranium enrichment program and any plutonium reprocessing, and end its support for terror. And to the Iranian people, I say tonight: As you stand for your own liberty, America stands with you.
 Our generational commitment to the advance of freedom, especially in the Middle East, is now being tested and honored in Iraq. That country is a vital front in the war on terror, which is why the terrorists have chosen to make a stand there. Our men and women in uniform are fighting terrorists in Iraq, so we do not have to face them here at home. And the victory of freedom in Iraq will strengthen a new ally in the war on terror, inspire democratic reformers from Damascus to Tehran, bring more hope and progress to a troubled region, and thereby lift a terrible threat from the lives of our children and grandchildren. 
 We will succeed because the Iraqi people value their own liberty, as they showed the world last Sunday. Across Iraq, often at great risk, millions of citizens went to the polls and elected 275 men and women to represent them in a new Transitional National Assembly. A young woman in Baghdad told of waking to the sound of mortar fire on Election Day, and wondering if it might be too dangerous to vote. She said, ''hearing those explosions, it occurred to me the insurgents are weak, they are afraid of democracy, they are losing. So I got my husband, and I got my parents, and we all came out and voted together.''
 Americans recognize that spirit of liberty, because we share it. In any nation, casting your vote is an act of civic responsibility; for millions of Iraqis, it was also an act of personal courage, and they have earned the respect of us all.
 One of Iraq's leading democracy and human rights advocates is Safia Taleb al-Suhail. She says of her country: ''We were occupied for 35 years by Saddam Hussein. That was the real occupation. Thank you to the American people who paid the cost but most of all to the soldiers.'' Eleven years ago, Safia's father was assassinated by Saddam's intelligence service. Three days ago in Baghdad, Safia was finally able to vote for the leaders of her country. And we are honored that she is with us tonight. 
 The terrorists and insurgents are violently opposed to democracy, and will continue to attack it. Yet the terrorists' most powerful myth is being destroyed. The whole world is seeing that the car bombers and assassins are not only fighting coalition forces, they are trying to destroy the hopes of Iraqis, expressed in free elections. And the whole world now knows that a small group of extremists will not overturn the will of the Iraqi people.
 We will succeed in Iraq because Iraqis are determined to fight for their own freedom and to write their own history. As Prime Minister Allawi said in his speech to Congress last September, ''Ordinary Iraqis are anxious to shoulder all the security burdens of our country as quickly as possible.'' That is the natural desire of an independent nation, and it also is the stated mission of our coalition in Iraq. 
 The new political situation in Iraq opens a new phase of our work in that country. At the recommendation of our commanders on the ground, and in consultation with the Iraqi government, we will increasingly focus our efforts on helping prepare more capable Iraqi security forces -- forces with skilled officers and an effective command structure. 
 As those forces become more self-reliant and take on greater security responsibilities, America and its coalition partners will increasingly be in a supporting role. In the end, Iraqis must be able to defend their own country -- and we will help that proud, new nation secure its liberty. 
 Recently an Iraqi interpreter said to a reporter, ''Tell America not to abandon us.'' He and all Iraqis can be certain: While our military strategy is adapting to circumstances, our commitment remains firm and unchanging. We are standing for the freedom of our Iraqi friends and freedom in Iraq will make America safer for generations to come. 
 We will not set an artificial timetable for leaving Iraq, because that would embolden the terrorists and make them believe they can wait us out. We are in Iraq to achieve a result: A country that is democratic, representative of all its people, at peace with its neighbors and able to defend itself. And when that result is achieved, our men and women serving in Iraq will return home with the honor they have earned. 
 Right now, Americans in uniform are serving at posts across the world, often taking great risks on my orders. We have given them training and equipment; and they have given us an example of idealism and character that makes every American proud. The volunteers of our military are unrelenting in battle, unwavering in loyalty, unmatched in honor and decency, and every day they are making our nation more secure. 
 Some of our servicemen and women have survived terrible injuries, and this grateful nation will do everything we can to help them recover. And we have said farewell to some very good men and women, who died for our freedom, and whose memory this nation will honor forever. 
 One name we honor is Marine Corps Sgt. Byron Norwood of Pflugerville, Tex., who was killed during the assault on Falluja. His mom, Janet, sent me a letter and told me how much Byron loved being a Marine, and how proud he was to be on the front line against terror. She wrote: ''When Byron was home the last time, I said that I wanted to protect him like I had since he was born. He just hugged me and said: 'You've done your job, Mom. Now it's my turn to protect you.''' 
 Ladies and gentlemen, with grateful hearts, we honor freedom's defenders and our military families represented here this evening by Sergeant Norwood's mom and dad, Janet and Bill Norwood.
 In these four years, Americans have seen the unfolding of large events. We have known times of sorrow, and hours of uncertainty, and days of victory. In all this history, even when we have disagreed, we have seen threads of purpose that unite us. The attack on freedom in our world has reaffirmed our confidence in freedom's power to change the world. We're all part of a great venture: To extend the promise of freedom in our country, to renew the values that sustain our liberty and to spread the peace that freedom brings. 
 As Franklin Roosevelt once reminded Americans, ''Each age is a dream that is dying, or one that is coming to birth.'' And we live in the country where the biggest dreams are born. The abolition of slavery was only a dream, until it was fulfilled. The liberation of Europe from fascism was only a dream, until it was achieved. The fall of imperial communism was only a dream, until one day it was accomplished. 
 Our generation has dreams of its own, and we also go forward with confidence. The road of providence is uneven and unpredictable, yet we know where it leads: It leads to freedom. 
 Thank you, and may God bless America.

HEADLINE: Football? They Play A Game?

BYLINE: By RICHARD SANDOMIR

 BODY:
IN a nation desperately seeking an effective diet that can take it off and keep it off, there is one area of wild and intentional binging that would make a cardiologist weep and the government's low-calorie food pyramid tumble: the trans fat-loaded pre-Super Bowl programming.
 Mel Brooks might have been contemplating the pre-Super Bowl's expanding girth when, in ''The Producers,'' he had the hyperventilating nerd Leo Bloom call the conniving impresario Max Bialystock a ''fat, fat fatty.''
 Here is some simply alarming arithmetic.
 A Super Bowl lasts three to three-and-a-half hours. It always begins on a Sunday and never schleps into the wee hours of a Monday, unlike a World Series game, which, with no time limits, can, and has, gone on forever. The reliable length of the Super Bowl reflects football's clock-controlled regimentation. 
 But such organic strictures do not exist before the National Football League's ultimate game, the holiest of days for its millions of disciples. The pre-game preamble grows like Audrey II in ''Little Shop of Horrors,'' and, for all we know, has swallowed whole a few sportscasters.
 ''Feed me! Feed me more deep voices!'' 
 There is, then, something unnatural about lead-in programming that is twice or three times as long as the game itself.
 Once upon a reasonable era, dating from the first Super Bowl in 1967 to the eighth one in 1975, the pre-game stuffing lasted only 30 minutes. It then moved to 90 minutes, then two, then two-and-a-half hours, then three hours. In 1997, for its first Super Bowl, Fox Sports found inspiration in the length of a Leon Uris mini-series and ratcheted up its output to five hours, prompting one of its stars, Terry Bradshaw, the analyst and four-time Super Bowl-winning Pittsburgh Steelers quarterback, to say, ''We're setting a precedent for the future.''
 He was sagacious. In 1999, Fox went up to seven hours. 
 Last year, CBS encroached into two-day territory for nine total hours, following a shocking retrenchment by ABC to four hours.
 But to precede Sunday's game in Jacksonville, Fla., between the New England Patriots and the Philadelphia Eagles, excess will gleefully rule, although there will be no quarterbacks' mom swapping or any versions of ''When Linebackers Attack!'' Rupert Murdoch's network will break the not-so-magical double-digit barrier: 10 1/2 hours, starting tomorrow from 3 to 5:30 p.m., Eastern time, and resuming Sunday from 10 a.m. to 6 p.m. 
 Sometime before 6:30, the game will start. Remember the game, between the Patriots, who could win their third Super Bowl in four years, and the Eagles, who last played (and lost) in the Super Bowl 24 years ago?
 ''If they told us, you're on at Saturday at 9 a.m., we'd produce from Saturday at 9 a.m.,'' said Scott Ackerson, executive vice president of Fox Sports and overseer of all pregame production. ''It's all dictated by sales, and what the marketplace allows. Initially, our sales department said we might end up with 12 hours, which we did, then it ended up with 10 1/2.''
 If you can sell it, it shall be produced.
 Let it be said that the 10 1/2 hours is not the length of a single program. There are eight shows, much of them taped, including Saturday's ''Howie Long's Tough Guys,'' a celebration of gridiron muscle, sweat and mucus, and Sunday's ''Untold Stories of the Super Bowl'' (football retirees like Mr. Long and Mr. Bradshaw discussing their glory days). There is the ''Best Darn Super Bowl Road Show Period,'' a special version of the occasionally naughty Fox Sports Net talk cable show with Tom Arnold and John Salley (which, for its looser universe, uses the word ''damn'' not ''darn,'' but some Fox broadcast affiliates shun the former adjective). 
 The four-hour Super Bowl extension of Fox's Sunday pregame show will cut from game discussion and analysis to a hole-in-one contest in Ponte Vedra, Fla., at the 17th hole of the renowned TPC at Sawgrass golf course, with stars from baseball, football and Nascar (sports that Fox covers) playing for charities; and to the singers John Fogerty and Kelly Clarkson, who became a star on Fox's ''American Idol,'' from the N.F.L.'s Tailgate Party.
 Fox will also present a military tribute and interviews with the former Presidents George H.W. Bush and Bill Clinton, football fans who will be making their appeal for tsunami relief. 
 ''Look, I don't expect everybody to watch all of it, except my mom,'' Mr. Ackerson said. ''We looked into what we've done in the past, and what's worked and we've tried to give something for everyone.''
 That Ed Sullivanesque approach to satisfying, or at least attracting large groups of viewers -- while simultaneously promoting some of the broadcasting network's stars and programs -- led CBS last year to begin its Sunday slate of Super Bowl programming with shows featuring stars from Nickelodeon and MTV, which, like CBS, are divisions of Viacom. 
 Before previous Super Bowls, Fox has used one of its former ''Beverly Hills 90210'' studs, Jason Priestley, to lead a tour of Miami; ABC produced vignettes from its long-forgotten sitcom ''Me and the Boys''; and Bill Cosby offered pregame monologues for NBC more than a year after his sitcom ended.
 And in a feature that should have been retired before it was conceived, NBC had two of its announcers, Mike Ditka (now a spokesman for Levitra) and O.J. Simpson (now unemployed and playing golf), playing a video game to a numbingly dull conclusion.
 The pregame extravaganzas tend to follow a standard script: start the marathon with a soft, feature-laden, entertainment focus leading inexorably to hard-core football discussion. Fox is making one significant change in the mix on Sunday: from noon to 1 p.m., Eastern time, it will carry ''Tony Hawk's Underground 2 Presents: Boom Boom HuckJam,'' the skateboarding icon's arena exhibition featuring skateboarders and motocross and BMX riders.
 Not surprisingly, there is a cross-promotional imperative afoot: the taped program is part of a one-year deal for Mr. Hawk to provide programming for Fox, Fox Sports Net and the company's action sports network, Fuel, which is sponsoring Mr. Hawk's summer tour. ''We're trying to do something different, so we thought why not?'' Mr. Ackerson said.
 Football fans will have to go from reveling in the Super Bowl memories of Troy Aikman, a former Dallas Cowboy quarterback, to watching skateboarders and motocross riders launch over the skateboarders' ramp.
 It is a less jarring segue than it seems, said Pat Hawk, the chief operating officer of her brother's company. She said the youthful action sports and older football audiences can and do co-exist. ''You'll see the audience is a football audience,'' she said. ''Dads and sons; moms and the kids from the neighborhood. It crosses over. Tony's done halftimes for Arena Football League and college football games.'' 
 Ultimately, Super Bowl viewers hunger for raw football and don't necessarily tune in heavily until a couple of hours before the game. Last year, the Nickelodeon program posted a 1.8 Nielsen rating, which grew to a 2.5 for the MTV show. But it took until 4 to 5 p.m. for the rating to spike to an 8.3, followed by an 11.4 from 5 to 5:30 and 16.0 from 5:30 to 6.
 The game, with the infamous revelation of Janet Jackson's right breast during dirty dancing with Justin Timberlake at half-time, produced a 41.4 rating. No chances will be taken this year (though who knew Janet Jackson was a risk?); massed military choirs will sing the National Anthem, Alicia Keys will sing ''America the Beautiful'' and Sir Paul McCartney is the main halftime entertainer. 
 There is little to deter a network from greeting the Super Bowl with the belief that it can grab more viewers with a high cholesterol diet, build ratings through television's longest days and set up a strong platform for programs after the game and the on-field celebrations have ended. 
 ''Super Bowl Sunday is the No. 1 unofficial American holiday,'' said David Hill, chairman of the Fox Sports Television Group. ''It's a day when people celebrate around the television set. I think they'll stick with Fox from early in the morning until 'The Simpsons' and 'American Dad.' We're looking to give it the full coverage the day deserves.''

 CORRECTION:
An article in Weekend on Feb. 4 about the increase in pregame programs before the telecast of the Super Bowl misidentified the game, in 1975, that was the most recent to be preceded by a pregame program lasting only 30 minutes. It was the ninth Super Bowl, not the eighth.

HEADLINE: First Findings See No Brakes Used in Most Of Jet's Path

BYLINE: By PATRICK McGEEHAN and MICHELLE O'DONNELL; David Kocieniewski and John Holl contributed reporting for this article.

 BODY:
The National Transportation Safety Board, which is investigating the crash of a corporate jet at Teterboro Airport in New Jersey on Wednesday, said yesterday that its findings indicated no braking system was in effect until the plane was 5,000 feet along the 6,013-foot runway. Normally, a liftoff takes place around 3,000 feet.
 Officials could not say whether the pilots attempted to stop the plane earlier, or whether there had been a mechanical problem. 
 Earlier yesterday, a lawyer for the pilot said that his client had made a valiant effort to stop the plane when he realized that a mechanical problem would prevent it from lifting off. 
 Michael A. Moulis, a lawyer for Platinum Jet Management, the company that was operating the plane when it rammed into a warehouse on Wednesday morning, said the pilot, John Kimberling, told him that ''something broke'' as the plane roared toward the end of the runway. As the jet skidded across six lanes of Route 46, a main thoroughfare at the northern end of the airport, Mr. Kimberling and his co-pilot tried to guide it through a break in traffic, Mr. Moulis said the pilot told him.
 ''He said, 'I think I clipped one,''' meaning a car, Mr. Moulis recounted from Teterboro, where he was meeting with investigators for the safety board. He declined to say what he and Mr. Kimberling thought had malfunctioned, because he said he did not want to interfere with the investigation.
 But Mr. Moulis, who said he was representing Mr. Kimberling and Platinum Jet, said he believed that the investigation would rule out pilot error or ice on the wings as a cause of the crash. 
 Witnesses told investigators that there was no ice on the wings. 
 In addition to the findings about the skid marks, Debbie Hersman, a spokeswoman for the safety board, said that a flight data recorder had captured only 10 seconds of the 43 seconds that elapsed between the start of the plane engine's acceleration and the crash. ''It's not exactly what we were looking for,'' Ms. Hersman said. ''But we're hopeful that we can get more information from it.''
 The cockpit voice recorder, which is still being analyzed, indicated that there had been a decision to discontinue the takeoff, the authorities have said. Ms. Hersman said that the jet's reverse thrusters, which are part of the braking system along with conventional brakes, had deployed but that it was unclear whether the brakes had.
 Saying a catastrophe had been narrowly avoided, Acting Gov. Richard J. Codey and United States Representative Steven Rothman said they would petition the Federal Aviation Administration to adopt further restrictions on the number and types of flights from Teterboro. 
 In Wednesday's crash, the plane ripped the roof off one car, a Toyota sedan, seriously wounding its driver and a passenger before smashing through the brick facade of a warehouse across the highway. But none of the eight passengers, a group of financial executives, were seriously hurt, and Mr. Kimberling and the co-pilot, Carlos W. Salaverria, escaped with broken bones in their legs.
 Mr. Moulis said that Mr. Kimberling's feet ''were injured because he was jamming on the brake so hard.'' 
 Both pilots, who had not yet been interviewed by investigators, spent Wednesday night at Hackensack University Medical Center. The third member of their crew, a 22-year-old cabin aide, Angelica Calad, had only scrapes and bruises, said Patrick Rivers, operations manager of the Voodoo Lounge in Fort Lauderdale, Fla., where Ms. Calad works part time as a hostess.
 After the crash, Mr. Rivers said, Ms. Calad called the club from an undisclosed location where she is being questioned by investigators to tell co-workers of her harrowing experience. She said she was strapped into the jump seat near the cockpit of the small plane when the ride turned ''a little bumpy,'' Mr. Rivers said.
 ''The next thing she knew she was in a warehouse,'' he said.
 Mr. Moulis told a more heroic tale about Ms. Calad, who, like the two pilots, was working for Platinum Jet, a charter company based in Fort Lauderdale, on a freelance basis. Despite being soaked in jet fuel and fearing that the plane would explode, she instructed the passengers to help her kick open the main cabin door, then helped them jump out of the smoking wreck, he said.
 After the passengers -- five employees of Kelso & Company, a private investment firm in Manhattan, and three men from other financial firms in New York -- escaped, Mr. Kimberling helped Mr. Salaverria off the plane, then touched each seat to make sure it was empty before he jumped out, Mr. Moulis said. 
 He said Mr. Kimberling was a veteran pilot who had logged more than 15,000 hours of flight time, including more than 3,000 hours flying planes like the one he was piloting on Wednesday. According to aviation administration records, Mr. Kimberling and Mr. Salaverria have clean records, with no history of accidents or other incidents.
 ''He's been around the block,'' Mr. Moulis said, referring to Mr. Kimberling. 
 The crew arrived at a hotel near the Teterboro Airport around midnight on Tuesday, about seven hours before the failed takeoff, after traveling from Fort Lauderdale to New York, Ms. Hersman said.
 Manuel Epelbaum, a Miami lawyer representing Mr. Salaverria, arrived in New Jersey yesterday to meet his client. He said he had not been authorized to talk about him.
 In Trenton, Mr. Codey and Mr. Rothman said the accident exposed the potential dangers the airport poses, though Mr. Codey said the federal agency was unlikely to accede to the demands of some area residents and shut the airport.
 After meeting with representatives of the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey and the state's economic development authority, Mr. Codey and Mr. Rothman called on the federal agency to ban midsize Stage 2 aircraft from the airport. The federal agency classifies planes by the noise their engines produce. The newest and quietest ones are Stage 3. Most private planes have noisier Stage 2 engines.
 The ban would not affect the plane that crashed on Wednesday, a Canadair CL-600 Challenger that was built in 1980 and used by the Canadian military before going into the private sector in March 2001, because it is a Stage 3 craft. 
 But New Jersey officials say the ban would still reduce the likelihood of a serious crash and reduce the number of daily flights to about 475 from 500. ''In time, smaller flights would almost certainly take the place of those larger aircraft,'' Mr. Rothman said. ''But they would generate less noise and we would have a safer airport.''
 In addition to the restriction on the size of planes using the airport, New Jersey officials are asking the federal agency to provide safety barriers at the end of the runway and improved firefighting equipment that would allow them to cut through a burning plane's fuselage and douse flames with fire retardant foam before they could ignite the fuel tanks.

HEADLINE: Productivity Strong for Year, But It Slowed in 4th Quarter

BYLINE: AP

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Feb. 3 

 BODY:
The productivity of American workers, a critical contributor to rising living standards, increased by 4.1 percent in 2004, capping a remarkable three-year period in which worker efficiency climbed at the fastest pace in a half-century.
 The Labor Department reported Thursday that productivity for the final three months of 2004 rose at an annual rate of just 0.8 percent, however, which was the slowest quarterly increase in almost three years.
 The rapid gains in productivity began slowing in the July-September quarter, when productivity rose by just 1.8 percent, after increases of 3.7 percent in the first quarter and 3.9 percent in the second quarter. 
 But private analysts said productivity growth, while slowing from the supercharged rates of the last three years, should remain at healthy levels through 2005.
 Productivity, the amount of output produced for each hour of work, is an crucial factor in improving living standards because it allows companies to pay workers more based on their increased efficiency without having to raise the prices of products, which would increase inflation.
 Productivity rose by 4.4 percent in 2003 and 2004. The 4.3 percent average annual gain for the last three years was the strongest productivity performance in more than a half-century of record keeping. 
 In another report, the Commerce Department said Thursday that orders to factories increased a record 11.1 percent for all of 2004, even though order growth slowed to a modest 0.3 percent rise in December.
 The December increase was the weakest since September, when there was no increase. It reflected a 1.1 percent rise in orders for durable goods, which was revised from an earlier estimate of 0.6 percent.
 The 11.1 percent surge in factory orders for the year was the biggest gain on record, besting the previous high of 8.1 percent set in 1994.
 Meanwhile, the Labor Department said that the number of newly laid-off workers filing claims for unemployment benefits totaled a seasonally adjusted 316,000 last week, a decrease of 9,000 from the previous week, pushing new claims to the lowest level since early December. Claims rose by 7,000 the previous week after plunging by 49,000 for the week ending Jan. 15.
 The decline in jobless claims last week was a better showing than was expected. Many analysts had been forecasting an increase of about 5,000 in new claims. The four-week moving average dipped to 331,500, the lowest level since early January.
 For all of 2004, employment grew by 2.2 million workers, the first annual gain after three years of job losses as the country struggled to cope with the 2001 recession and a jobless recovery that reflected in large part the ability of companies to get more output from a smaller work force.

HEADLINE: Election Board Raises Limits For Donations

BYLINE: By GLEN JUSTICE

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Feb. 3 

 BODY:
The Federal Election Commission voted Thursday to raise the limits for political contributions in the 2006 election, only the second time since the Watergate reforms of the 1970's that the numbers have been changed.
 Donors can now give $2,100 to presidential and Congressional candidates in each election, up from $2,000, and $26,700 to national political parties each year, up from $25,000. 
 The modifications were required by the McCain-Feingold campaign finance law of 2002, which called for the commission to tie contribution limits to inflation every two years. 
 ''I like to call it election law for math majors,'' said Michael Toner, a Republican commissioner. ''It is a little more complicated, there's no doubt about it.''
 In total, an individual can contribute $101,400 to federal politics in every two-year election cycle, up from $95,000. That includes a maximum of $40,000 to federal candidates and $61,400 to political parties and other committees. Contribution limits for political action committees are not indexed to inflation and were not changed. 
 To complicate matters, the commission released the numbers for the new limits weeks after they technically became effective. Contribution limits that apply to each election took effect on Nov. 3, 2004, the day after the election, and those that apply annually took effect on Jan. 1 of this year.
 Before setting the limits, the commission had to wait for the release of the Consumer Price Index, the best measure of inflation in the United States. The report from the Bureau of Labor Statistics came out in mid-January. 
 ''People have been fund-raising at the old levels,'' said Bob Biersack, a commission spokesman. ''If they want to go back and get a little more, they can.''

HEADLINE: The New Noir, Not Always by Men or by Americans

BYLINE: By MARGO JEFFERSON

 BODY:
Noir is the perfect example of how a popular form goes classic. Video stores devote shelves to noir films. Theaters mount sold-out festivals; we crowd in and cheer at the first sight of those terse, lurid titles on-screen: ''Double Indemnity,'' ''Naked City,'' ''I Wake Up Screaming.'' Playwrights, poets and performers create noir characters and scenes. We read novelists like Dashiell Hammett, James M. Cain and Jim Thompson -- once deemed pulp -- in respectable Library of America volumes. 
 The best television drama still thrives on noir traditions: cities that are corrupt from top to bottom, law officers as cynical as the criminals they pursue, people driven by greed (for money, power, sex), and a pervasive sense that everyone has hidden motives and nothing is what it seems. ''Law & Order,'' with its clockwork plots of social and psychic blight that end bleakly or ambiguously, has entered rerun eternity. The tales of multilayered corruption and complication in ''The Wire'' make repeat viewing both necessary and pleasurable. (George Pelacanos, one of the best contemporary noir novelists, writes for ''The Wire.'' So does flashy Dennis Lehane, whose pre-''Mystic River'' thrillers were his best.) 
 In the 1980's, the small, resourceful Black Lizard Press began reissuing noir novels of the 40's and 50's in all their pulp glory: small volumes on thin paper with steamy, stylized covers that seemed to say: ''I'm a piece of lowlife memorabilia. Don't pass me by.'' 
 In 1990 Vintage bought Black Lizard; its first reissues were upscale and sleek. Now, Vintage has reissued a much bigger selection of these books in their original formats, both famous and obscure. You may know titles like ''Shoot the Piano Player,'' but what about ''The Damned Don't Die''? 
 It seems noir is busting out all over. But why now? Ann Douglas, professor of literature at Columbia University, is writing a book about the form called ''Noir Nation.'' As a genre, noir took off in the late 40's, she said, adding,''Its golden age coincided with the first 10 years of the cold war and of the U.S. as an openly imperial power.'' Its resurgence is hardly accidental now, she said, when conservatives talk about a new kind of war between good and evil and reclaim America's right to be an empire.
 ''Noir is a critique of power,'' Ms. Douglas went on. ''It operates on Balzac's premise that every great fortune is the result of a great crime. Power and money are ugly and they rule. You enjoy it but you don't forget it.'' At the very least, noir offers an alternate reality -- moments of real passion, a bleak code of honor, and a need for freedom amid corruption. At its best, noir offers a map of subversion. 
 Noir was a brainchild of the United States. And most of the creators of classic noir -- novelists and screenwriters, directors and cameramen -- were men. Women were their mysterious, sometimes villainous, always seductive objects of desire. It should be no surprise, then, that in the 1970's female writers started creating female detectives with the cynical integrity of the classic men. (One of the first of these writers, Marcia Muller, remains one of the best.) 
 Right now, though, some of the best writers of modern noir come from outside the United States -- Sweden's Henning Mankell, for instance, whose Kurt Wallander mysteries move from local and national politics to global economics and (in Ms. Douglas's phrase) ''transnational psychopathy.'' 
 Some of the most original writers of this imported noir are women. Noir has always shown that greed and chaos are as close as the company we work for or the politicians we vote for. The best female writers are adding families to that list -- with a vengeance. And if male writers have explored the eros of violence, these women explore the violence of eros. 
 I found a telling remark that seemed to foreshadow this trend in ''Detour,'' one of the few classic noir tales by a woman. In this clever 1953 novel by Helen Nielsen, a burly, thickheaded law officer sneers, ''This is a sheriff's office, not a court of human relations.''
 But noir is a court of human relations, and some crimes are beyond legal restitution. 
 In the Scottish writer Denise Mina's forceful trilogy (''Garnethill,'' ''Exile,'' ''Resolution''), Maureen, the central character, is an alcoholic; a working-class underachiever in Glasgow, fighting the legacy of a sexually brutal family.
 Glasgow is also the city of noir brutality in Louise Welsh's sinister ''Cutting Room.'' As a drug dealer observes, ''You know, Glasgow imports more baseball bats than any city in Britain, and there's not a single baseball team in town.'' The narrator is a witty, dissolute gay man of 43 named Rilke, who works in an auction house. While assessing the estate of a rich Glasgow merchant, Rilke comes across pornographic photographs that suggest a young woman has been killed in the making of a snuff film. Unsure of his own motives, he decides to find out. 
 Ms. Welsh is such a good writer she can afford leisurely scenes that give us the texture of Rilke's life but don't help solve the mystery. Why should they? This isn't how life works. It is Ms. Welsh's elegantly edited version of how a noir unfolds in real time. 
 Two of the best female new-noir novelists I have read are Japanese: Miyuki Miyabe and Natsuo Kirino give us an underworld that has moved quietly above ground. In this quotidian world no one is heroic: not the criminals and not their pursuers. Men and women get equal time as objects of desire and menace. 
 Both writers take the full measure of Japan's boom-bust economy of the 1980's. In Ms. Miyabe's coolly harrowing ''All She Was Worth,'' money is the engine of lust: mergers and scams have turned consumers into addicts. Everyone borrows, some steal and a few kill. Her new novel, ''Shadow Family,'' will be published this month: it involves a husband and father who creates a second, altogether different family on the Internet. 
 Ms. Kirino's ''Out'' has just been published in paperback by Vintage, and it is superb. It begins on a factory line where women assemble box lunches. Four are part-time night shift workers; by day they are hardworking, unhappy homemakers. When one kills her husband in a fit or rage, the others band together to hide the crime. 
 Sisterhood? More like the desperate need for money, and for the ringleader, Masako, a desperate need to break free of her life. Masako is a fascinating character: stern, relentlessly smart; a crime-solver and a criminal. Ms. Kirino writes of Masako's growing solitude: ''When stones lying warm in the sun were turned over, they exposed the cold damp earth underneath, and that was where Masako had burrowed deep. There was no trace of warmth in this dark earth, yet for a bug curled up tight in it, it was a peaceful and familiar world.''

HEADLINE: Bush Outlines Ways Cuts Could Close Funding Gap

BYLINE: By EDMUND L. ANDREWS

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Feb. 3 

 BODY:
Until his State of the Union speech on Wednesday, Mr. Bush had described his vision of overhauling Social Security almost entirely through the allure of letting people divert some of their payroll taxes to private accounts.
 But on Wednesday, Mr. Bush publicly acknowledged for the first time that his plan would also require significant cuts in future benefits and stark choices about who should have to bear them. 
 Mr. Bush briefly outlined four basic approaches that could each theoretically save the government trillions of dollars. The burden of those cuts would fall on distinctly different groups of people.
 The first choice would be to reduce benefits primarily for wealthy retirees, on the theory that they will have plenty of other money to cushion their old age. 
 A second choice would be to slowly delay the normal retirement age, which would spread the impact among all workers but could force people to work well past age 70.
 A third choice would be to curtail greatly the growth of future benefits by indexing them to increases in consumer prices rather than wages.
 The fourth option would discourage workers from taking early retirement, another way of reducing the number of years for people to be paid benefits.
 ''All these ideas are on the table,'' Mr. Bush declared in his speech. ''I know that none of these reforms would be easy. But we have to move ahead with courage and honesty.''
 What would old-age benefits look like if Congress chooses one path over another?
 As it happens, each of the four approaches has been scrutinized at length by lawmakers, as well as by the Social Security Administration. 
 One seemingly innocuous but radical change would be to index the increase in future benefits to the increase in consumer prices rather than wage increases. The idea is simple. At the moment, a person's initial retirement benefit is based on a percentage of that person's preretirement earnings over 35 years.
 Because wages generally rise faster than inflation, that means that benefits for each new generation of retirees are more expensive than the prior scale. 
 Indexing Social Security benefits to inflation would mean that benefits remain constant in real terms. It would also mean that the benefits would replace a smaller and smaller part of people's incomes.
 The Congressional Budget Office estimated last year that a switch to price indexing would reduce the promised monthly benefit for a median-income person who retires in 2065, from $26,000 under current law to $14,000.
 The change would also save the government more than $4 trillion over 75 years, more than enough to eliminate the $3.7 trillion shortfall that the government is estimating for that period.
 Opponents of the idea, including some Republicans, say the change could plunge future workers into poverty as soon as they reach retirement age.
 Even if their benefits equaled those of today, people who rely on Social Security in the future would see their incomes and standards of living plunge compared with their neighbors'.
 The second approach suggested by the president would be to delay the normal retirement age, now 65 and scheduled to increase gradually to 67. Supporters say the change would merely reflect longer life expectancies, which climb about one month a year.
 To save enough money to eliminate the projected Social Security gap, analysts estimate that people would eventually have to wait until 73 or 74 before being able to collect full retirement benefits.
 ''If you wanted to do this all through the retirement age, you would have to increase the retirement age about one year for each decade,'' said Andrew A. Samwick, a professor of economics at Dartmouth and a former staff economist on Mr. Bush's Council of Economic Advisers.
 Critics say that approach would pose an unfair hardship on people in physically demanding jobs like construction and factory work, as well as lower-income workers. A study by the National Academy of Social Insurance, a nonpartisan research organization here, estimated in December 2003 that 25 percent of early retirees, at 62 to 64, were too frail to handle their normal work.
 Yet another approach would be to reduce benefits primarily for wealthy retirees. But analysts said it would be difficult to close the entire gap by putting the burden on a relatively small segment of the population.
 Partly because the financial choices are so difficult, a growing number of Republican lawmakers have proposed financing a Social Security overhaul by looking for revenues outside the standard payroll tax.
 ''We have to think more broadly,'' said Representative Bill Thomas, the California Republican who is chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee. Without offering specifics, Mr. Thomas suggested looking at ''other sources of revenue'' that would include federal income taxes.
 ''I don't think we can do Social Security as a stand-alone bill,'' said Representative John Linder, a Georgia Republican who supports fundamental overhauls of the income tax and Social Security.
 Some Republicans have even gone so far as to suggest the one approach Mr. Bush did not mention in his speech, raising the ceiling on income subject to payroll taxes, which is now about $90,000 a year. The idea appeals to some politicians because only about 6 percent of Americans earn more than $90,000 a year. Imposing Social Security taxes on incomes of up to $200,000 would come close to eliminating the entire deficit.
 Mr. Bush has adamantly opposed any increase in payroll taxes. At least for the moment, that idea is off the table.

HEADLINE: Sales Start Strong, but Retailers Are Worried About 2005

BYLINE: By TRACIE ROZHON

 BODY:
Merchants and retail analysts are increasingly concerned that America's retailers will have a tough time during the rest of the year, despite better-than-expected January results that were released yesterday.
 The results, which compared sales at retail stores open at least a year, also accentuated the differences between the haves and the have-nots: those store chains performing admirably and those that seem to be floundering.
 The retail industry's trade group, the National Retail Federation, said yesterday that its view was guarded about 2005, in a press release that included words like ''challenging,'' ''difficult and ''cautious.'' 
 The group's chief economist, Rosalind Wells, predicted a slowdown in the early part of this year that would affect the whole year, ''forecasting mild 3.5 percent growth in retail sales for the year, compared to the robust 6.7 percent gain in 2004,'' according to yesterday's release. 
 Tracy Mullin, chief executive of the Washington-based group, said, ''Retailers are aware of the challenges they face in 2005.'' She said consumers were facing higher energy costs and slower wage growth, both likely to hamper upward momentum in sales.
 Ms. Mullin said last year's strong numbers make comparisons tricky. ''The economy is stable,'' she said, ''but it means trying to get that uptick is harder.'' In an interview, she argued that the results do not have much to do with energy prices and other global problems. ''Consumers have already adapted to higher gas prices, to the war in Iraq,'' she said.
 Eric Beder, a retail analyst with JB Hanauer, held a mixed view. ''Fashion is somewhat stale,'' he said. ''We're in the second year of the current color trends and in the third year of the current renaissance in luxury goods. Then there is the specter of higher interest rates, which will hurt everyone.'' 
 A hopeful sign, Mr. Beder said, is higher job growth, ''and the consumers' almost irrational desire to spend on new items -- whether they need them or not.''
 Over all, January same-store sales for specialty apparel and accessories rose 2.3 percent, wrote Margaret Mager, a Goldman Sachs analyst, in a report issued yesterday. The increase, she wrote, was above her company's prediction of 1.4 percent for the specialty index, but sales ''were driven mainly by clearance/low-margin goods.''
 The winners in yesterday's results were clear, and mostly unsurprising. American Eagle Outfitters continued a gangbuster turnaround; sales in January 2005 were 22 percent higher than sales in January 2004. Sales at Bebe Stores, another youth-oriented chain, were up 29.3 percent. The luxury good retailer Neiman Marcus posted a 12.2 percent rise.
 But then there were merchants who continued their disappointing performances. Gap, the country's largest specialty store chain, continued to worry analysts, with sales down 7 percent over all and off 16 percent at its Old Navy division. The Express, part of the Limited, also fell by 16 percent.
 Among department stores, Nordstrom posted a solid 8.8 percent rise, while sales at May Department Stores, which recently ousted its chief executive, fell 7 percent. 
 Wal-Mart, the country's largest store chain, posted a gain of 2.5 percent, but sales at its archcompetitor, Target, were up 9.4 percent.
 Marshal Cohen, the chief researcher for the NPD Group, a marketing consultant in Port Washington, N.Y., said he thought the gap between the successful and unsuccessful merchants would widen in 2005.
 ''This is going to be a year where the consumer will not be willing to experiment,'' Mr. Cohen predicted. ''They'll pay what they want to, for what they want, and go home with their purchases and enjoy them.''
 While Mr. Beder, the analyst from JB Hanauer, said he thought the luxury sector was vulnerable, Mr. Cohen said he believed that, for the most part, it would keep performing well, though there might be movement from brand to brand.
 Mr. Cohen, citing interviews that NPD conducted after the holidays, said consumers ''are still splurging, but with care, and most often, on the so-called aspirational, or accessible, luxury items'' -- those that bear a chic brand name but cost less than other chic names. (The brand most often labeled as accessible luxury is Coach; its stock split last week.)
 ''The middle class is reaching up to these luxury brands, or reaching down to the discounters,'' he said. 
 At Costco, a discounter that specializes in generally fancier merchandise than its competitors, sales were up 4 percent. Federated Department Stores, which operates a range of mid-priced department stores, was down 0.4 percent.
 Mr. Cohen said he also worried about home furnishings stores in 2005. The Bombay Company, which imports furniture, was flat for January. Pier 1 fell 10.4 percent.

+'BROOKLYN THE MUSICAL' The enterprising design team of Mark Schoenfeld and Barri McPherson's aggressively maudlin show has come up with all sorts of ideas for converting everyday urban detritus into glamorous props and accessories. from traffic cones into megaphones to garbage bags into evening gowns. But the whole production, directed by Jeff Calhoun, is a kind of cultural recycling of discarded showbiz forms. An urban fairy tale told by street singers, ''Brooklyn'' is a throwback to the simple and whimsy-laden little musicals that blossomed off Broadway several decades ago. Try to imagine a sanitized ''Hair'' or a secular ''Godspell,'' with a helping of funky 70's disco, all filtered through the throat-stretching vocal pyrotechnics of ''American Idol.'' If that hybrid appeals to you, you're welcome to it. If not, you may find yourself feeling like a cranky commuter in a subway car, trapped with a perky team of harmonizers who say they just want to leave you with a smile on your face (1:45). Plymouth, 236 West 45th Street, (212)239-6200. Tuesdays at 7 p.m.; Thursdays and Fridays at 8 p.m.; Wednesdays and Saturdays at 2 and 8 p.m. Sundays at 3 p.m. Tickets: $25 to $96.25.

+'LA CAGE AUX FOLLES' This alternately pallid and garish revival of the 1983 musical, with songs by Jerry Herman and a book by Harvey Fierstein, comes to life only when its cross-dressing chorus line takes over. This story of a gay couple who run a nightclub in St. Tropez has two bright stars in Daniel Davis (as the manly part of the couple) and the wonderful but slightly miscast Gary Beach (as the womanly one). But Jerry Zaks's production often gives the impression of merely going through the motions, amiably but robotically, of its gag-laden, sentimental plot. What makes ''La Cage'' worth visiting for people whose diet does not include canned corn and packaged sugar is the plumed and spangled all-male ensemble of dancers. Each one emerges as a saucy individual, and as a team they have been choreographed by Jerry Mitchell with a feisty sense of humor and an athletic verve that should make Arnold Schwarzenegger think twice about using ''girly men'' as a pejorative term (2:30). Marquis Theater, 1535 Broadway, between 45th and 46th Streets, (212)307-4100. Tuesdays at 7 p.m.; Thursdays and Fridays at 8 p.m.; Wednesdays and Saturdays at 2 and 8 p.m.; Sundays at 3 p.m. Tickets: $25 to $100.

*+ 'DAME EDNA: BACK WITH A VENGEANCE!' It was nearly a half-century ago that Edna Everage (damehood still awaited her) was invented by an Australian drama student named Barry Humphries, whose body the mauve-haired entertainer continues to take over for public appearances. Rather like the plant in ''The Little Shop of Horrors,'' the blowsy Edna kept becoming larger, glitzier and hungrier as she fed on the adulation of theater and television fans over the years. As her exhaustingly funny new show makes clear, that growth process hasn't stopped. When she last appeared on Broadway five years ago, she was merely a megastar, Dame Edna condescendingly tells her audience; now she is ''a glittering gigastar.'' In this singing, dancing shrine to herself, she proves it by exploiting our culture's masochistic obsession with the rich and famous (2:30). Music Box Theater, 239 West 45th Street, (212)239-6200. Tuesdays at 7 p.m.; Wednesdays through Saturdays at 8 p.m.; Saturdays at 2 p.m.; Sundays at 3 p.m. Tickets: $67.50 to $87.50.

*+'DEMOCRACY' Michael Frayn's glorious study of the mutations of politics and the men who practice it, directed by Michael Blakemore, is one of those rare dramas that don't just dare to think big but that fully translate their high aspirations to the stage, with sharp style and thrilling clarity. For New York theatergoers who have endured the recent spate of dutiful revivals and misconceived star vehicles, watching this gripping study of the fraught glory years of Chancellor Willy Brandt of West Germany and the spy who loved him is like riding a wave after dog paddling in shallow waters (2:30). Brooks Atkinson Theater, 256 West 47th Street, (212)307-4100. Tuesdays at 7 p.m.; Thursdays and Fridays at 8 p.m.; Wednesdays and Saturdays at 2 and 8 p.m.; Sundays at 3 p.m. Tickets: $60 to $95.

+'FIDDLER ON THE ROOF' From the moment it sounds its first word in David Leveaux's placid revival, the voice of Harvey Fierstein (who has replaced Alfred Molina in the central role of Tevye) makes the audience to prick up its ears. Heard not so long ago issuing from the plus-size form of Edna Turnblad in the musical ''Hairspray,'' Mr. Fierstein's voice is one of the most distinctive in theater, variously evoking a kazoo, a congested saxophone, wind in a bottle and echoes from a crypt. It is, in a way, its own multicolored show. Whether it fits comfortably into the little Russian village of Anatevka is another issue. But at least it brings a bit of zest to David Leveaux's abidingly bland production (2:55). Minskoff Theater, 200 West 45th Street, (212)307-4100. Tuesdays at 7 p.m.; Wednesdays through Saturdays at 8 p.m.; Wednesdays and Saturdays at 2 p.m.; Sundays at 3 p.m. Tickets: $35 to $100.

+'LITTLE WOMEN' Sutton Foster never merely walks when she can scamper in this perky, sketchy adaptation of Louisa May Alcott's classic novel of a Civil War-era New England girlhood. Portraying Jo the tomboy, Ms. Foster creates a dizzyingly hyperkinetic creature who, were she living in the 21st century, would probably be on Ritalin. Ms. Foster (a Tony winner for "Thoroughly Modern Millie") shows a gift for fresh comic line readings. But her energy is often less infectious than exhausting. The same can be said of of the show, directed by Susan H. Schulman and featuring a book by Allan Knee, with songs by Jason Howland and Mindi Dickstein. Watching the production is rather like speedreading Alcott's novel. And the cast members, who include the mellow-voiced Maureen McGovern, mostly bring to mind 1860's-themed editions of the American Girl series of dolls (2:20). Virginia Theater, 245 West 52nd Street, (212)239-6200. Tuesdays at 7 p.m.; Thursdays and Fridays at 8 p.m.; Wednesdays and Saturdays at 2 and 8 p.m.; Sundays at 3 p.m. Tickets: $60 to $100.

'700 SUNDAYS' This one-man memoir of a play by Billy Crystal, the beloved comic actor and longtime Oscar host, has been carefully set up to suggest a night of home movies with a buddy from your high school days who is equal parts attention-grabbing showoff and softhearted sweetie pie. In resurrecting the boy he was and the parents who made him the man he is, Mr. Crystal does indeed show flickering faded films from his childhood, projected onto the windows of a replica of the house on Long Island where he spent his youth. You would be hard-pressed to find a Broadway show with a more artfully calculated comfort factor. Directed by Des McAnuff, and featuring some funny riffs on familiar archetypes, ''700 Sundays'' makes the characters in Neil Simon's domestic comedies look as tortured as figures out of Eugene O'Neill. And Mr. Crystal has a way of making even the ostensibly exotic feel as wholesome as apple blintzes (2:20). Broadhurst Theater, 235 West 44th Street, (212)239-6200. Tuesdays through Saturdays at 8 p.m.; Wednesdays and Saturdays at 2 p.m. Tickets: $71.25 to $91.25; extremely limited.

++'TWELVE ANGRY MEN' This stage adaptation of Reginald Rose's celebrated television drama from 1954 (made into a film in 1957) suggests that sometimes the best way to present a fossil is just to polish it up and put it on display without disguise, annotation or apology. As a tidy portrait of clashing social attitudes in a jury room, it definitely creaks with age. But somehow the creaks begin to sound like soothing music, a siren song from a period of American drama when personalities were drawn in clean lines, the moral was unmistakable and the elements of a plot clicked together like a jigsaw puzzle without a single missing piece. Even those who like their theater hip and cerebral might want to lower their eyebrows for this 90-minute production. With an ensemble that includes Boyd Gaines, Mark Blum and Peter Friedman, this is a showcase for some of New York's finest character actors, who all manage to chew the scenery without smacking their lips. American Airlines Theater, 227 West 42nd Street, (212)719-1300. Tuesdays through Saturdays at 8 p.m.; Wednesdays, Saturdays and Sundays at 2 p.m. Tickets: $46.25 to $86.25.

Off Broadway

'FAT PIG' Neil LaBute's latest work is on one level yet another demonstration that men are paragons of bad faith and cowardice, a judgmental tradition that this writer established with his screenplay for ''In the Company of Men.'' Yet ''Fat Pig,'' directed by Jo Bonney, is also the most emotionally engaging and unsettling of Mr. LaBute's plays since ''Bash'' five years ago. A show that might have been merely a point-proving exercise is immeasurably enriched by Mr. LaBute's empathy and by the skill and honesty of Jeremey Piven (of ''The Entourage'' on HBO) as a charming rising executive, and and Ashlie Atkinson, the overweight woman he falls for. Andrew McCarthy and Keri Russell (late of ''Felicity'') round out the taut ensemble (1:40). Lucille Lortel Theater, 121 Christopher Street, West Village, (212)279-4200. Mondays and Tuesdays at 7 p.m.; Wednesdays, Thursdays and Fridays at 8 p.m.; Saturdays at 2:30 and 8 p.m. Tickets: $50.

*+ 'FORBIDDEN BROADWAY: SPECIAL VICTIMS UNIT' Gerard Alessandrini, the writer and creator of the 22-year-old ''Forbidden Broadway'' series of satirical revues, would seem to be as steamed-up and homicidal as Dirty Harry in a den of crooked cops. This means he is in particularly good form. The New York theater's favorite practitioner of tough love has put on the brass knuckles for this round. The production features the expected caricatures of ego-driven singing stars (Patti LuPone, Hugh Jackman). But even more than usual, the show offers an acute list of grievances about the sickly state of the Broadway musical, where, as Mr. Alessandrini's lyrics have it, ''everything old is old again'' (1:45). Douglas Fairbanks Theater, 432 West 42nd Street, Clinton, (212)239-6200. Mondays, Tuesdays, Fridays and Saturdays at 8:15 p.m.; Wednesdays at 2:30 p.m.; Saturdays at 4 p.m.; Sundays at 3:30 and 7:30 p.m. Tickets: $49.50 to $57.

*'THE GODS ARE POUNDING MY HEAD! (AKA LUMBERJACK MESSIAH)' Even lumberjacks get the cosmic blues in the world of Richard Foreman, the Florenz Ziegfeld of avant-garde drama. In many ways, this show is a typical Foreman extravaganza: tightly orchestrated hallucinogenic visual effects, bruising slapstick and cryptic, fragmented dialogue. But there is also a newly wistful, elegiac note here. ''Gods,'' which features Jay Smith and T. Ryder Smith as a pair of weary woodsmen, is as majestically mad and funny as any Foreman spectacle. But it also has a sadness appropriate to what appears to be a farewell note of sorts, since Mr. Foreman has said he is giving up the kind of plays he has been creating since 1968 to focus on film (1:10). Ontological Theater at St. Mark's Church, 131 East 10th Street, (212)533-4650. Tuesdays, Thursdays, Fridays, Saturdays and Sundays, 8 p.m. Tickets: weekdays $20, $15 for students; $25 for Saturday performances.

*'HURLYBURLY' If you are going to inhabit a wasteland, you might as well be thoroughly wasted. That would appear to be the first rule of survival for the characters who have been brought so vibrantly and unforgivingly to life in the New Group's smashing revival of David Rabe's 1984 play. For these pharmaceutically fried losers in the Hollywood Hills, drugs and alcohol are way beyond recreational status. They're what generate love and hate, security and anxiety, often in such a blurred succession of responses that it's hard to distinguish among them. But thanks to a terrific, uncompromising cast -- directed by Scott Elliott and led by Ethan Hawke, Josh Hamilton and Parker Posey -- theatergoers are likely to experience a heady buzz of excitement and clarity that any of the desperate characters on stage would kill for (3:15). Acorn Theater, 410 West 42nd Street, (212)279-4200. Mondays through Fridays at 8 p.m.; Saturdays at 2 and 8 p.m. Tickets: $50.

++'JEWTOPIA' In a word, oy. Actually, even that small but spectacularly useful Yiddish word, with its infinite capacity for inflection, won't suffice to register the proper dismay at this slapdash, feeble-witted comedy. Written by and starring Bryan Fogel and Sam Wolfson, the cheerfully vulgar ''Jewtopia'' is aimed squarely at Jewish audiences not above indulging in a little lowbrow ribbing of their common ground. Make that a lot of lowbrow ribbing, most of it is about as fresh as a kugel from last year's Seder. Mr. Fogel and Mr. Wolfson flail away at hoary old stereotypes with a lack of ingenuity and a coarseness that are as numbing as they are dispiriting. The director John Tillinger, hired to polish the production for its New York engagement (it ran for more than a year in Los Angeles), has done little to tame its tacky excesses or shore up its slipshod construction There are circumcision jokes aplenty, of course, and the requisite zingers about controlling Jewish mothers. and their daughters who don't put out. Several bits are funny despite the familiarity, as when a mother unleashes a volley of questions at her prospective son-in-law with the speed and accuracy of an ace machine-gunner. Later, a woman's status as an imposter is revealed when it's recalled that she paid retail for the Chanel bag. So it goes for two hours. Westside Theater (Downstairs), 407 West 43rd Street, Clinton, (212)239-6200. Tuesdays at 7 p.m.; Wednesdays at 2 and 8 p.m.; Thursdays and Fridays at 8 p.m.; Saturdays at 2 and 8 p.m.; Sundays at 3 p.m. Tickets: $59.50 for Tuesdays through Thursdays; $65 for Fridays through Sundays.

*+'NINE PARTS OF DESIRE' The voices are a study in contrasts: vivid and subdued, sophisticated and naive, seductive and standoffish. But they cohere to form a powerful collective portrait of suffering and endurance in Heather Raffo's impassioned theatrical documentary about the lives of contemporary Iraqi women. A solo piece written and performed by Ms. Raffo, an actress of Iraqi and American heritage, the play is a welcome reminder that the costs of tyranny and violent conflict are borne not by some amorphous, insentient collective population but by individuals, in this case women whose lives have been frayed and fractured, sometimes beyond repair, by the tortured history of their country. Bush foes expecting a polemical broadside will be disappointed. Ms. Raffo drew on more than 10 years of interviews to assemble her theatrical mosaic, and the commendable results reveal that she is a journalist, not a purveyor of propaganda. There is plenty here to fuel outrage at the suffering of Iraqi citizens directly caused by American bombing. But Ms. Raffo's women also bear witness to the monstrousnessof Saddam Hussein's regime, with more than one of the play's characters fiercely avowing that no price is too high to pay for ridding the country of his brutality (1:30). Manhattan Ensemble Theater, 55 Mercer Street, SoHo, (212)239-6200. Tuesdays through Fridays at 8 p.m.; Saturdays at 3 and 8 p.m.; Sundays at 3 p.m. Tickets: $55; limited number of $20 student rush tickets available at the box office one hour before the show.

'A NUMBER' Since the 1970's, Caryl Churchill has produced studies of a world quaking under constant siege in which style somehow always uniquely mirrors content. In this stunning, elliptical play about a father's experiment with genetic engineering, this invaluable dramatist considers a threat to the very cornerstone of Western civilization since the Renaissance: the idea of human individuality, a subject she manages to probe in depth in a mere 62 minutes of spartan sentences and silences. Every word, gesture and pause in this dramatic fugue for two actors -- meticulously directed by James MacDonald and performed by Arliss Howard and Dallas Roberts -- sets off echoes of multiple meaning. The play trenchantly makes the point that we no longer have the apparatus, verbal or psychological, to accommodate the changes in a time when science is moving faster than society. It is hard to think of another contemporary playwright who combines such economy of means and breadth of imagination (1:05). New York Theater Workshop, 79 East Fourth Street, East Village, (212)239-6200. Tuesdays at 7 p.m.; Wednesdays, Thursdays and Fridays at 8 p.m.; Saturdays at 2 and 8 p.m.; Sundays at 2 and 7 p.m. Tickets: $65.

+'UNDER THE BRIDGE' Kathie Lee Gifford, best known for purveying chitchat on morning television, has re-emerged in showbiz behind the scenes, as the author of a new musical aimed at family audiences. ''Under the Bridge,'' with book and lyrics by Ms. Gifford and music by David Pomeranz, tells the heartwarming story of a spunky group of homeless children who befriend a cranky but lovable old bum. As his hard heart is softened, the urchins and their widowed mother find the home they've long dreamed of. A new family is born. All this in Paris, yet. As that precis suggests, in adapting a popular children's book by Natalie Savage Carlson, Ms. Gifford does not exactly strive tirelessly to avoid the cliched. The score is competent if generic. Mr. Pomeranz's melodies are pleasant and neatly tailored, while Ms. Gifford's lyrics are doggedly rhymed if rarely graceful. Despite energetic performances all around (special kudos to the likable Ed Dixon as the hobo), Eric Schaeffer's production feels inert (2:10). Zipper Theater, 336 West 37th Street, (212)239-6200. Tuesdays through Fridays at 7 p.m.; Wednesdays at 2:30; Saturdays at 2 and 7 p.m.; Sundays at 1 and 6 p.m. Tickets: $55.

Last Chance

+'GEM OF THE OCEAN' Theatergoers who have followed the work of August Wilson will find in this grandly evangelical drama a touchstone for his great cycle of plays chronicling the African-American experience in the 20th century. Set in 1904 in Pittsburgh, ''Gem'' is chronologically the first chapter in the cycle. As such, it is a swelling overture of things to come, a battle hymn for an inchoate republic of men and women just beginning to discover the price of freedom. It is also the least dramatically involving of Mr. Wilson's plays. Directed by Kenny Leon, with a strong cast led by Phylicia Rashad as a former slave who is more than 280 years old, ''Gem'' has passages of transporting beauty. But the metaphorical resonance of events and relationships eclipses dramatic immediacy here (2:30). Walter Kerr Theater, 219 West 48th Street, (212)239-6200. Tonight at 8; tomorrow at 2 and 8 p.m; Sunday at 3 p.m. Tickets: $25 to $86.

'ALIENS OF THE DEEP' Directed by James Cameron and Steven Quale. (G, 48 minutes). When the director James Cameron proclaimed himself ''king of the world'' on winning the Oscar for ''Titanic,'' who knew that he also had designs on the rest of the solar system? His newest film, ''Aliens of the Deep,'' is a grandiose hybrid of undersea documentary and outer-space fantasy that begins on our planet's ocean floor and ends many miles under the ice crust that covers Europa, the second moon of Jupiter. The movie's sneaky transition from undersea documentary to speculative fantasy of a journey yet to be undertaken is so seamless, you could easily mistake the last portion of the film as the record of an actual space voyage. Mr. Cameron's theory, supported by astrobiologists, is that the life forms found at the deepest levels of the ocean where no light from the sun penetrates may hold clues to the nature of possible life in outer space. Filmed in Imax-3D, it is a visual adventure worthy of that much-degraded adjective, awesome.
STEPHEN HOLDEN

'THE AVIATOR' Starring Leonardo DiCaprio. Directed by Martin Scorsese (PG-13, 169 minutes). The famously eccentric and reclusive empire builder Howard Hughes was born alone and died alone, the two times in his life when he was no different from anyone else. For the rest of his life, the high-flying Hughes seemed to have drifted in from some distant aerie where exotic birds hatch far from everyday worries. At the age of 18, he was both an orphan and a millionaire, and while he could never be called ordinary, in the following two decades his wealth and all that it afforded brought him a very American kind of celebrity. It is that celebrity, fueled by money, stoked by matinee looks and playboy style, which preoccupies ''The Aviator,'' Mr. Scorsese's visually sumptuous if disappointingly hollow account of Hughes's early life. Written by John Logan, the story principally covers the late 20's through the 40's, when Hughes, played by Mr. DiCaprio, was gadding about both Hollywood and the aviation world.
MANOHLA DARGIS

'BEYOND THE SEA' Starring Kevin Spacey, Kate Bosworth and John Goodman. Directed by Mr. Spacey (PG-13, 118 minutes). The matching of two slithery chameleons, the singer Bobby Darin (who died in 1973 at the age of 37) and his latter-day doppelganger, Mr. Spacey (now 45), sparks a weird bluish flame that suggests a wax yule log posing as wood in the season's teeming fireplace of movie biographies. When ignited, it releases acrid, waxy fumes that feel queasily chemical. The movie, which the star directed and helped write and in which he sings (wonderfully), smacks of the same kind of obsession that brought Bob Fosse's ''All That Jazz'' to creepy reptilian life. Its vision of show business in the 50's and 60's is as tawdry as Fosse's and as incisive in suggesting it's a grubby rags-to-riches circus. (Ms. Bosworth plays Sandra Dee, the bimbo movie princess Darin strenuously wooed and married.) The movie also touches on the ugly reality of show business mothers who force their children to act out their dreams and line their pocketbooks.
HOLDEN

'CLOSER' Starring Natalie Portman, Jude Law, Julia Roberts and Clive Owen. Directed by Mike Nichols (R, 110 minutes). Four characters in search of an objective correlative for their needy, angry, compulsive states of feelings. Mr. Nichols's smooth, nimble direction improves Patrick Marber's verbose, pretentious play yet exposes some of its flaws. Two American women (Ms. Portman and Ms. Roberts) are entangled with two Englishmen (Mr. Law and Mr. Owen) in a four-handed game of deception, self-delusion and betrayal that skips and leaps over a period of several years. The formal trickiness of the narrative strips the characters of any daily context that would give their emotions meaning, and the movie is a succession of scenes, some quite powerful on their own, that don't really add up to much. The actors work hard to give their schematic, overwritten roles some nuance and individuality, but only Mr. Owen -- raw, brash and witty -- succeeds.
A.O.SCOTT

'COACH CARTER' Starring Samuel L. Jackson, Rob Brown, Robert Ri'chard, Rick Gonzalez, Nana Gbewonyo and Antwon Tanner. Directed by Thomas Carter (PG-13, 137 minutes). In this solid, unsurprising inspirational-coach drama, Mr. Jackson plays Ken Carter, who returns to his old high school in the tough Northern California city of Richmond to turn a squad of underachieving misfits into winners, both on and off the court. Based on a true story, the movie combines sports-picture suspense with heroic-educator uplift when Carter, dismayed that his players are slipping academically, padlocks the gym in the midst of an undefeated season. Mr. Carter (the director, no relation to the coach) infuses this sentimental warhorse with some flourishes of realism, which are bolstered by the hip-hop soundtrack and by the performances of the younger cast members, especially Mr. Brown, as a talented forward struggling with his responsibilities, Ashanti as his girlfriend, and Mr. Gonzalez as a player sliding toward a life of crime.
SCOTT

'ELEKTRA' Starring Jennifer Garner, Terence Stamp, Kirsten Prout, Goran Visnjic, Cary-Hiroyuki Tagawa and Will Yun Lee. Directed by Rob Bowman (PG-13, 96 minutes). The latest Hollywood movie to give comic books a bad name, ''Elektra'' stars Ms. Garner as a superheroine who dons fetishwear the color of blood before laying waste to every man in sight. ''Your parents must have had a sense of humor,'' the broodingly handsome and plucky love interest says to Elektra about her mythopoetic name. She answers in the negative: no, they did not, and neither does she. This chick may have a complex (or two), but like the rickety vehicle supporting her and the hopes of Marvel Comics, she emphatically does not have a sense of humor. What she emphatically does have -- and this is of course the entire point of ''Elektra'' -- is a hot bod and a costume that looks as if it was designed by someone very familiar with the Victoria's Secret catalog.
DARGIS

'FAT ALBERT' Starring Kenan Thompson and Kyla Pratt. Directed by Joel Zwick (PG, 93 minutes). One of the truisms of contemporary pop culture is that just when you think it couldn't get any worse, its purveyors any more shameless, you are proved decisively wrong. Based on Bill Cosby's corpulent charmer and his band of brothers, the ''Fat Albert'' movie opens just days after the release of the DVD compilations of the original show. DVD's for the program are featured so prominently in the movie, and the movie feels so much like an extended-play sitcom, I half expected Mr. Cosby to pop up on screen to sell me the discs along with a Coke. From 1972 through 1984, the animated television series ''Fat Albert and the Cosby Kids'' enjoyed enormous success. The cartoon was austere but eminently watchable and featured one of those sitcom tunes that etch a permanent groove in your head. Just as memorable was Mr. Cosby's basso-profundo delivery of Fat Albert's trademark ''hey, hey, hey,'' a mantra that signaled that no matter what happened, all would be right in the end. In ''Fat Albert,'' that trademark is resurrected to depressingly diminished ends.
DARGIS

*'HEAD-ON' Starring Birol Unel, Sibel Kekilli, Catrin Striebeck and Guven Kirac. Directed by Fatih Akin (Not rated, 118 minutes). In German and Turkish, with English subtitles. Love doesn't just hurt in the jagged German romance ''Head-On''; it cuts and bleeds and even kills. A story about a lonely man and a still-lonelier woman fighting against their worlds and what often seems like their own best interests, the film has caused a stir in Germany for the murky, troubling light it sheds on the lives of the country's Turkish immigrants. Its popularity made it a fleeting social phenomenon and a minor cultural footnote. But it doesn't explain why this film about two strangers with suicidal tendencies and a deep commitment to self-aggrandizing drama is the first very good movie of this very young year. One of the truisms about romances, even those shaded pitch black and set to banging rock music, is that you have to fall in love with the characters when they're falling for each other. It takes a long time for Cahit (Birol Unel) and Sibel (Sibel Kekilli) to get inside each other's heads, much less anywhere else, but it doesn't take us long to care about these two perfectly imperfect beings.
DARGIS

'HIDE AND SEEK' Starring Robert De Niro, Dakota Fanning, Famke Janssen, Elisabeth Shue, Amy Irving, Dylan Baker and Melissa Leo. Directed by John Polson. (R, 105 minutes). In the downbeat, sufficiently unsettling ''Hide and Seek,'' Mr. De Niro plays a New York City shrink, David, who's married to a somnolent type (Ms. Irving) whose love for their daughter, Emily (Ms. Fanning), can't disguise her unhappiness. Soon after the story starts, violence descends on the Callaway family, and David and Emily move to the country for some healing. Once there, things go from lousy to worse as Emily starts staring blankly into the surrounding woods and palling around with a sinister invisible friend called Charlie. Blood drips into the story; then, it pours. One of the most gifted child actors around, Ms. Fanning has both chops and a preternaturally intense screen presence; even when you don't believe the setup, you buy what she is selling. That's a good thing when it comes to this horror-thriller hybrid, which was written by Ari Schlossberg and needs all the help it can get from its actors.
DARGIS

'HOTEL RWANDA' Starring Don Cheadle, Sophie Okonedo, Joaquin Phoenix and Nick Nolte. Directed by Terry George (PG-13, 121 minutes). This wrenching political thriller, based on fact, performs the valuable service of lending a human face to an upheaval so savage it seemed beyond the realm of imagination when news of it filtered into the West. The movie certainly isn't the first screen depiction of a nation consumed in ethnic strife. But its vision of the slaughter of 800,000 Tutsis by the ruling Hutu tribe in Rwanda during a hundred-day bloodbath in 1994 offers a devastating picture of media-driven mass murder left unchecked. The story is based on the real-life experiences of Paul Rusesabagina (Mr. Cheadle), the soft-spoken Hutu manager of the Hotel des Mille Collines, in Kigali, who with his Tutsi wife, Tatiana (Ms. Okonedo), and children, narrowly escapes death several times. Mr. Rusesabagina was directly responsible for saving the lives of more than 1,200 Tutsis and Hutu moderates by sheltering them in the hotel and bribing the Hutu military to spare them. The movie, which is squeamish about showing the full extent of savagery, hammers every button on the emotional console.
HOLDEN

'IN GOOD COMPANY' Starring Dennis Quaid, Topher Grace and Scarlett Johansson. Written and directed by Paul Weitz (PG-13, 106 minutes). This gently revisionist fairy tale about good versus evil is set on the battlefield of contemporary corporate culture, a site of our leading blood sport. Mostly, though, the movie is about men. The two men at the story's engaging center are Carter Duryea (Mr. Grace), a young executive who has been promoted beyond his abilities to run the advertising department of a magazine with the resonant name of Sports America. The man whom Carter is meant to make redundant is the 51-year-old Dan Foreman, a ruggedly appealing adult who brings out the best in everyone. Dan has a picture-perfect family and is the kind of unabashedly old-fashioned masculine type Mr. Quaid has been slow-cooking to perfection over the years and which, on American screens at least, has lately gone missing.
DARGIS

'LEMONY SNICKET'S A SERIES OF UNFORTUNATE EVENTS' Starring Jim Carrey, Liam Aiken, Emily Browning, Kara Hoffman and Shelby Hoffman. Directed by Brad Silberling (PG, 108 minutes). Since the publication of the first installment in Lemony Snicket's (aka Daniel Handler's) charmingly malignant book cycle ''A Series of Unfortunate Events,'' the three Baudelaire children -- Violet, Klaus and Sunny -- have been trying to find safe harbor in a world fraught with danger. For 11 consecutive books, the children have passed from the care of one well-intentioned adult to another, braving the sort of peril usually faced by silent-screen heroines named Pauline and leaving a trail of corpses in their wake. To date, the cause of their misfortunes has been their onetime guardian, Count Olaf, who hopes to steal their fortune. But now the characters have embarked on one of the most dangerous adventures known in literature: their story has been turned into a major Hollywood movie -- and with Jim Carrey, no less.
DARGIS

'THE LIFE AQUATIC WITH STEVE ZISSOU' Starring Bill Murray, Owen Wilson, Cate Blanchett, Anjelica Huston, Willem Dafoe and Jeff Goldblum. Directed by Wes Anderson (R, 118 minutes). More elaborate whimsy from Mr. Anderson, who confected a parallel-universe Manhattan in ''The Royal Tenenbaums'' and who now goes even further, inventing tropical islands and new species of exotic fish when the mood strikes him. Somehow, though, this movie is more charming than irritating, partly thanks to Mr. Murray's performance -- a tour de force of comic minimalism -- as Steve Zissou, an ocean adventurer with a boatload of problems. ''The Life Acquatic'' is thick with potential narrative complications -- involving, for starters, Zissou's long-lost son (Mr. Wilson), estranged wife (Ms. Houston), slimy archrival (Mr. Goldblum) and needy first mate (Mr. Dafoe) -- but Mr. Anderson is less a storyteller than a curator of odd specimens and curious situations. The pleasures of this movie are like those of a beautifully illustrated, haphazardly plotted picture book, which precocious children (and nostalgic adults) can linger over, feeding their own reveries and fantasies.
SCOTT

'MEET THE FOCKERS' Starring Robert De Niro, Ben Stiller, Dustin Hoffman, Barbra Streisand, Blythe Danner, Teri Polo and Owen Wilson. Directed by Jay Roach (PG-13, 114 minutes). Like ''Meet the Parents,'' the follow-up new comedy ''Meet the Fockers'' hinges on the well-traveled idea that there's something comic about being Jewish in America. Not the Philip Roth, take-no-prisoners funny, in which Jewish identity is good, bad, happy, sad, a historical chip on the shoulder, a sign of radical difference. Rather, the post-Borscht Belt funny of the genial sitcom Jew whose difference is amorphous enough to be thoroughly unthreatening; the Jew as an ethnic accessory that non-Jews on both sides of the camera can enjoy without anxiety, like the cute cabala string Madonna likes to wear. And so, just as Bernie loved Bridget, and Rhoda loved Mary, so does Greg Focker (Mr. Stiller) love Pam Byrnes (Ms. Polo). And because Greg loves Pam, Pam's father, Jack (Mr. De Niro), doesn't love Greg. Not because no man could ever be good enough for his daughter, but because Greg doesn't look like Pam's old squeeze, the fair-haired Kevin (Mr. Wilson).
DARGIS

'THE MERCHANT OF VENICE' Starring Al Pacino, Jeremy Irons, Joseph Fiennes and Lynn Collins. Directed by Michael Radford (R, 127 minutes). Shakespeare's most problematic play -- at least with respect to modern sensitivities -- receives an intelligent intepretation from Mr. Radford and from a superb cast. Mr. Pacino, showing welcome restraint after a series of overdone stage and screen performances, emphasizes Shylock's grief and estrangement, turning him into a fragile monster. But his villainy, however much it smacks of blood libel, cannot be discarded without compromising the play's complex ideas about justice and duty, and Mr. Radford does not try to wash away the stain of anti-Semitism that is woven into the heart of his source. He does remind us how much more is going on in the play, and along with his talented production designer and cinematographer, he renders Venice as a series of Renaissance paintings -- tableaus that in evoking Velazquez, Rembrandt, Titian and Vermeer, immerse us in the ferment of early modern Europe. Mr. Irons is quietly mesmerizing in the title role, a creature of mysterious melancholy whose soul seems at once pure and rotted. The movie really belongs to Ms. Collins, who gives Portia her rightful wit and charisma, and makes her the play's cruel and lovely moral center.
SCOTT

'MILLION DOLLAR BABY' Starring Clint Eastwood, Hilary Swank and Morgan Freeman. Directed by Mr. Eastwood (PG-13, 135 minutes). Mr. Eastwood takes what appears to be a conventional boxing-melodrama plot about a crusty old trainer whose heart is melted by a spirited young fighter and turns it into a glowing, somber meditation on friendship, ambition and death. The picture's scale is small, and its pacing leisurely, which gives you a chance to savor three lovely performances: from Ms. Swank as the young boxer, Mr. Freeman as a world-weary former contender and Mr. Eastwood as the trainer, Frankie Dunn. At 74, Mr. Eastwood has achieved a level of mastery that leaves him with nothing to prove, and so, unafraid of sentiment and willing to risk cliche, he has made a graceful, lyrical, devastating masterpiece -- the best film released by a major Hollywood studio this year.
SCOTT

'MONSIEUR N' Starring Philippe Torreton, Richard E. Grant, Jay Rodan and Elsa Zylberstein. Directed by Antoine de Caunes (Not rated, 127 minutes). In French, with English subtitles. This densely plotted costume drama, which flashes back from the exhumation of Napoleon Bonaparte's body in 1840 Paris to the years leading up to his death in 1921 on the remote island of St. Helena, imagines that his official death might have been an elaborate hoax. The screenplay is peppered with Napoleon's epigrammatic zingers, which reveal him as the smartest person in the room. Mr. Torreton's glowering emperor exerts a magnetic if slightly repellent spell. Mr. Grant, as Hudson Lowe, the British governor in charge of the island, is almost as fine in the role of a raging control freak whose behavior is more stereotypically Napoleonic than Napoleon's. If the movie amounts to little more than a historical divertissement, it is well done.
HOLDEN

'OCEAN'S TWELVE' Starring George Clooney, Brad Pitt, Matt Damon, Catherine Zeta-Jones, Andy Garcia, Don Cheadle, Bernie Mac, Julia Roberts, Casey Affleck and Scott Caan. Directed by Steven Soderbergh (PG-13, 120 minutes). At a certain point in this enjoyable, unabashedly trivial caper flick, a trio of crooks played by Mr. Damon, Mr. Cheadle and Mr. Caan start running through the different ways they can get out of their immediate jam. Things have gone badly for these likable rogues, and now most of their crew -- including the smooth piece of work who gives the film its title, Danny Ocean, played by the equally silky Mr. Clooney -- has landed in the clink. The crooks are looking for a get-out-of-jail-free card, which, given the film's criminally underdone plot and smog of self-satisfaction, is something that Mr. Soderbergh may have wanted to stash up his own sleeve. As anyone within spitting distance of a television set knows, ''Ocean's Twelve'' is the high-profile sequel to Mr. Soderbergh's big box-office entertainment ''Ocean's Eleven.'' Once again, Mr. Clooney's Danny is the leader of the pack; Mr. Pitt plays his second in command, Rusty Ryan; and Mr. Damon plays Linus, a puppy that desperately wants to be a dog but may not have sprouted the requisite fangs.
DARGIS

'THE PHANTOM OF THE OPERA' Starring Gerard Butler, Emmy Rossum, Patrick Wilson, Miranda Richardson and Minnie Driver. Directed by Joel Schumacher (PG-13, 143 minutes). ''Far too many notes for my taste,'' a minor character remarks, apropos of the threatening letters being sent by the micro-managing phantom. That pretty much sums up the problems with Andrew Lloyd Webber's bombastic score, the pretentious clutter of which is well matched by Mr. Schumacher's production. For all the invocations of ''the angel of music,'' this film, adapted from the curiously popular stage musical, will most likely leave you with a devilish headache. The songs are unlistenable, which also makes them hard to sing, but Ms. Rossum and Mr. Butler show some impressive vocal technique, and Ms. Rossum, in addition to being lovely, has enough movie star luminosity to avoid being buried in the busy sets and elaborate costumes. This 2-hour-20-minute barrage may drive you back to the 1925 version of ''Phantom,'' which starred Lon Chaney and which has many virtues. For one thing, it is short. For another, it's silent.
SCOTT

'SPANGLISH' Starring Adam Sandler, Tea Leoni and Paz Vega. Directed by James L. Brooks (PG-13, 110 minutes). Mr. Brooks, one of the smartest and sunniest men in Hollywood, turns his attention to class division, cultural misunderstanding and marital discord in Los Angeles -- all subjects ripe for the kind of warm-hearted comedy in which he specializes and all of them treated with astonishing smugness and dishonesty. Mr. Sandler plays John Clasky, a successful chef who almost falls for his maid, Flor (Ms. Vega), a situation that Mr. Brooks rescues from sleaziness by making Jack's wife, Deborah (Ms. Leoni), a thoroughgoing monster: irredeemably selfish, vain and ridiculous. Deborah, a bad mother and a useless wife, serves as the film's scapegoat, and her demonization contrasts with the idealization of Flor in a way that manages to be both overtly misogynist and implicitly racist. Mr. Sandler smiles through it all, playing a nice guy who unwittingly personifies the film's self-adoring liberal bad faith.
SCOTT

'A VERY LONG ENGAGEMENT' Starring Audrey Tautou. Directed by Jean-Pierre Jeunet (R, 133 minutes; in French, with English subtitles). If you like battleground carnage delivered with aesthetic brio, the kind that ensures that when a soldier explodes into confetti, his flesh will dapple a trenchmate as decoratively as pink rosettes on a cake, this new French film will serve you nicely. Set during World War I and its immediate aftermath, and directed by the cult favorite Jean-Pierre Jeunet, it follows the adventures of a young woman, Mathilde (Ms. Tautou), who holds fast to the hope that her young soldier fiance will return home from his apparent grave. Even when death seems to part them, the cord of her love remains unbroken. Best known for ''Amelie,'' a modern fairy tale also starring Ms. Tautou, Mr. Jeunet is in the possession of a distinctive visual style that's part Rube Goldberg, part F.A.O. Schwarz, and generally enjoyable for about 15 minutes.

'WHITE NOISE' Starring Michael Keaton, Chandra West and Deborah Kara Unger. Directed by Geoffrey Sax (PG-13, 101 minutes). A laugh-laced cheap thrill that has nothing to do with the Don DeLillo novel of the same title, ''White Noise'' was directed by Mr. Sax, whose resume hopefully notes that this would-be auteur comes from a long and venerable line of BBC-trained directors. It is a long and venerable line that, on the evidence of his feature filmmaking debut, Mr. Sax may bring to an unintended end. It's impossible to say exactly who takes the brunt of the blame here, although the screenwriting credit belongs to Niall Johnson. Mr. Johnson apparently wrote ''White Noise'' in 2002, several years after the Japanese horror movie ''Ringu'' helped trigger the recent fad for Asian horror, and his script hinges on the premise that there are ghosts in the machine anxious to reach out and touch us. Often, the person on this side of the death divide is a spunky woman or a high school girl in a miniskirt and knee socks, but here the hero reaching across time, space and genre is played by Mr. Keaton.
DARGIS

'THE WOODSMAN' Starring Kevin Bacon. Directed by Nicole Kassell (R, 87 minutes). Ms. Kassell directs this story of a paroled child molester struggling to re-enter society after 12 years in prison in a lean, unassuming style, which suits the subject matter and gives the fine cast room to explore their complicated, unhappy characters. The story is not always plausible, and the atmosphere sometimes feels programmatically grim, but the film is a serious, compassionate attempt at psychological realism, anchored by Mr. Bacon's precise, unsettling performance as a man trying to untangle his decent impulses from his destructive, predatory urges.

Pop

A selective listing by critics of The Times: New or noteworthy rock and pop concerts in the New York metropolitan region this weekend. * denotes a highly recommended concert. Full reviews of recent concerts: nytimes.com/music.

*ANTIBALAS, Southpaw, 125 Fifth Avenue, at Sterling Place, Park Slope, Brooklyn, (718)230-0236. Antibalas delivers a New York makeover to Fela Kuti's Afrobeat, the Nigerian funk propelled by burly saxophones, fierce percussion and righteous anger. Performing constantly around New York has given the band a combined tightness and relaxation, the assurance that they can sustain and expand a groove until everyone is dancing. Tonight at 9; admission is $15.
JON PARELES

BONGA'S VODOU, Satalla, 37 West 26th Street, Manhattan, (212)576-1155. Bonga Jean-Baptiste leads a drum-and-dance ensemble playing voodoo rhythms from Haiti. Tomorrow night at 10; admission is $15.
PARELES

*BUCKWHEAT ZYDECO/MARCIA BALL, B.B. King Blues Club and Grill, 243 West 42nd Street, Manhattan, (212) 997-4144. Stanley (Buckwheat) Dural Jr. is a zydeco accordionist that rockers can love. He bolsters the hefty sound of his accordion with a horn section, and his sets include plenty of gutsy blues tunes along with Cajun two-steps and waltzes. The band is an indefatigable party generator. Marcia Ball plays two-fisted New Orleans barrelhouse piano and sings in a husky, good-natured voice. Tonight at 8 and 10:30; admission is $25.50.
PARELES

DAMIEN CONNOLLY AND FRIENDS, Glucksman Ireland House, 1 Washington Mews (Fifth Avenue above Washington Square), (212)998-3950. Irish traditional music by Damien Connolly, who took up his family's musical heritage by learning both his father's instrument, the button accordion, and his uncle's, the fiddle. He also plays an old-style, one-row accordion, the melodeon. He will be accompanied by his wife, Sally Connolly, on flute along with Matt Mancuso on fiddle, Pete Mancuso on guitar and Annmarie Acosta on piano. Tonight at 9; tickets are $15.
PARELES

*JOHNNY CUNNINGHAM TRIBUTE, Town Hall, 123 West 43rd Street, Manhattan, (212)840-2824 or (212)545-7536. The Scottish fiddler Johnny Cunningham was a great raconteur and an even better Celtic fiddler, and his death in December 2003 was a loss to traditional music. He helped spark a Scottish music revival in the 1970's as a member of Silly Wizard and went on to a career of performing, producing and composing. His friends and musical collaborators have organized a tribute that's likely to present some of the most heartfelt Celtic music of the year. To play some of Mr. Cunningham's music, including tunes from his Obie-winning score for "Peter and Wendy," the group includes Phil Cunningham, Johnny's brother and frequent musical partner, on accordion; the forthright Irish singer Susan McKeown; the fiddler Kevin Burke, one of Mr. Cunningham's very few peers; Seamus Egan, who plays flute, tenor banjo and mandolin and also happens to be one of the writers of the Sarah McLachlan hit "I Will Remember You," and Aidan Brennan on guitar. Guests are likely to show up as well. Tomorrow night at 8; tickets are $30 and $35, $15 for students.
PARELES

DR. JOHN, Community Theater, 100 South Street, Morristown, N.J., (973)539-8008. Dr. John is steeped in New Orleans barrelhouse piano, swampy bayou funk and the gris-gris mysticism that surrounds it. He has applied his cagey growl of a voice and his florid piano playing not just to New Orleans funk and rhythm-and-blues but to Ellington, standards and songs with a conscience, though his latest album circles back to some New Orleans classics. Tonight at 8; tickets are $37 to $47.
PARELES

JOLIE HOLLAND, Mercury Lounge, 217 East Houston Street, at Ludlow Street, Lower East Side, (212)260-4700. On her album "Escondida" (Anti), Jolie Holland savors anachronisms in largely acoustic songs that mix swing, gospel, blues, Appalachian ballads and other Americana. The settings are folky, but the tidings are often dark: "Big stars fall down twinkling as they fall," she warns. Tomorrow night at 10:45, with Akron/Family at 9:30 and Sean Hayes at 8:30; tickets are $12 in advance, $14 tomorrow.
PARELES

LHASA, Satalla, 37 West 26th Street, (212)576-1155. Lhasa had a childhood worthy of a NAFTA citation, growing up in upstate New York, Mexico and Montreal. On her album "The Living Road" (Nettwerk America), her lean, mostly acoustic arrangments dip into anything from Mexican waltzes to guitar feedback. She sings in Spanish, French and English, with a husky, torchy voice that fills her music with the smoldering drama of Mexican boleros and French chansons. Tomorrow night at 7:30 and Sunday night at 9:30; tickets are $20 in advance, $25 at the door.
PARELES

USTAD ABDUL WAHID KHAN SAHIB TRIBUTE, Mela Foundation Dream House, 275 Church Street, 3rd floor, between Franklin and White Streets, TriBeCa, (212) 925-8270. La Monte Young, the fountainhead of Minimalist composing, was a disciple of the Indian singer Pandit Pran Nath. This is a tribute to his guru's guru, Ustad Abdul Wahid Khan Sahib, a virtuoso who sang primarily for holy men and at Sufi saints' tombs. The concert will feature evening ragas including Mr. Young's "Raga Sundara," sung by Mr. Young, his wife Marian Zazeela and the Just Alap ensemble. The alap is the meditative, improvisational prelude that begins every classical raga; "just" refers to just intonation, the tuning system based on exact mathematical ratios rather than the compromises necessary for keyboards. Tomorrow night at 9; admission is $24, $18 for students and members of the Mela Foundation.
PARELES

LOSER'S LOUNGE TRIBUTE TO QUEEN: NO TIME FOR LOSERS, Fez (downstairs at the Time Cafe), 380 Lafayette Street, at Great Jones Street, East Village, (212) 533-2680. Joe McGinty and his coterie of songwriting connoisseurs apply themselves to the mixture of hard-rock grandiosity and campy arrogance that was Queen. Doubtless they'll figure out some ingenious ways to reinterpret the multitracked splendors of songs like "Bohemian Rhapsody." Tonight and tomorrow night at 8; admission is $20 tonight, $25 tomorrow.
PARELES

*M.I.A., Knitting Factory, 74 Leonard Street, TriBeCa, (212)219-3006. This Sri Lanka-raised, London-based rapper made an explosive debut with a pair of devastating reggae-influenced singles: "Galang" and "Sunshowers" found her riding sharp beats playfully, chanting and declaiming and sometimes even singing alongside her propulsive computer-generated tracks. (Visit www.miauk.com to hear for yourself.) Her debut album, "Arular" (XL), isn't scheduled to be released until Feb. 22, but this should be a wildly exciting party for a club full of revelers who already consider her a star. Tomorrow night at 10:30, with Diplo (M.I.A.'s D.J., who's also half of the great Philadelphia D.J. duo Hollertronix) and Catchdubs, both of whom are to stick around after M.I.A. for a free after-party; tickets are $12.
KELEFA SANNEH

DAVID MORALES, Crobar, 530 West 28th Street, near 10th Avenue, Chelsea, (212)629-9000. Mr. Morales, a house-music veteran, has made his name as a D.J., a producer and -- above all -- a remixer. For one example of what he does, search out his 11-minute "Def Mix" version of Mariah Carey's "Dreamlover," included on Ms. Carey's compilation, "The Remixes" (Columbia); after a long percussion break, he isolates and repeats a few of her ultra-falsetto ad-libs to create a sublime, spooky study in vocal texture. Tomorrow night after 10; tickets are $25 in advance, more at the door.
SANNEH

THE O'JAYS, Apollo Theater, 253 West 125th Street, Harlem, (212)749-5838 or (212)864-0372. The O'Jays were the flagship group of the Philadelphia soul producers Gamble and Huff, dealing with hard times in songs like "Backstabbers" and "For the Love of Money" and hoping for better ones with "Love Train." Tomorrow night at 8; tickets are $45 to $65.
PARELES

*RAINER MARIA, Northsix, 66 North 6th Street, Williamburg, Brooklyn, (718) 599-5103. Everything is in flux in the music of Rainer Maria. From verse to verse, its songs sound like hurtling punk or grand arena-rock or pensive folk-rock. But amid the musical shifts and ambivalent lyrics, the music is full of muscle and conviction. Tomorrow night at 9, with Tristeza, Dropsonic and Tungsten 74 opening; tickets are $10 in advance, $12 tomorrow.
PARELES

THE RED PARTY, Spirit, 530 W. 27th Street, near 10th Avenue, Chelsea, (212)268-9477. Junior Vasquez, a veteran D.J., comes to Spirit to throw this annual party, which is likely to attract a mainlymale crowd. Expect to hear the usual digitized disco and euphoric synthesizer lines, but don't be surprised if, at some point during his scheduled 10-hour set, Junior Vasquez also finds time to play thicker and darker rhythmic tracks; he knows the crowd will follow him wherever he roams. Tonight, well after 10; tickets are $20 in advance, $30 at the door.
SANNEH

THE ROGERS SISTERS, Northsix, 66 North Sixth Street, Williamsburg, Brooklyn, (718)599-5103. This proud trio excavates the sharp, twitchy post-punk of yesteryear, emphasizing not only the music's severity but its occasional playfulness, too. The Rogers Sisters' recent mini-album, "Three Fingers" (Troubleman Unlimited), nods to the sing-song choruses of the Delta 5 and even the sardonic pop of Devo. Tonight at 9, with the Flesh and Thunderbirds Are Now!; tickets are $10.
SANNEH

*SASHA, JAMES LAVELLE, Crobar, 530 West 28th Street, near 10th Avenue, Chelsea, (212) 629-9000. Sasha, the wildly popular progressive-house D.J., has a knack for pleasing huge crowds without (for the most part) pandering to them. He avoids both the obvious and the unusual, topping his steady, thumping beats with complicated electronic patterns that slowly decay and mutate. He is to be joined by James Lavelle, from the electronica duo Unkle; perhaps Mr. Lavelle will find time to spin the hypnotic "Delayed Gratification" mix of the Unkle track "Reign," which was chopped up and stripped down by Morgan Geist, of Metro Area. Tonight after 10; tickets are $35 in advance, more at the door.
SANNEH

*SOWETO GOSPEL CHOIR, Zankel Hall, 881 Seventh Avenue, (212) 247-7800 or (212)545-7536. Gospel music and traditional South African harmonies and rhythms have found common ground and hybrid possibilities since Christian missionaries arrived in South Africa in the 19th century. This 32-member choir carries the fusion toward jubilation, performing traditional songs (and "Mbube," the Zulu song better known as "The Lion Sleeps Tonight") alongside gospel messages. They sing in six languages Tonight at 10; tickets are $30 to $42.
PARELES

THIRD WORLD, S.O.B.'s (Sounds of Brazil), 204 Varick Street, at Houston, South Village, (212)243-4940. Third World occupies the pop end of the reggae spectrum, harmonizing on hits like "Now That We've Found Love" while promising "Roots With Quality." Sunday night at 8; admission is $18 in advance, $20 on Sunday.
PARELES

ZEMOG, EL GALLO BUENO, Zebulon, 258 Wythe Avenue between Metropolitan Avenue and North Third Street, , Williamsburg, Brooklyn, (718)218-6934. Zemog, El Gallo Bueno is a Boston band that pushes the hard-driving mambos of salsa toward the squall of Sun Ra's free jazz. Tomorrow night at 10; admission is free.

Cabaret

A selective listing by critics of The Times: New or noteworthy cabaret shows in Manhattan this weekend. * denotes a highly recommended show. Full reviews of recent cabaret shows: nytimes.com/music.

RUTH BROWN, Le Jazz au Bar, 41 East 58th Street, (212)308-9455. This rhythm-and-blues legend has weathered one personal disaster after another, but misfortunes that might have silenced a less determined performer have only added dimension to Ms. Brown's already larger-than-life musical personality. Exhibiting a flamboyant showmanship that recalls her peer, James Brown, she proudly presents herself as an indomitable member of royalty and stylistic descendant of the Queen of the Blues herself, Dinah Washington. Tonight and tomorrow night at 7:30 and 9:30 and Sunday at 8. Cover: $50.
STEPHEN HOLDEN

BARBARA CARROLL, Oak Room, Algonquin Hotel, 59 West 44th Street, (212)419-9331. The Lady of a Thousand Songs is back in the Oak Room for Sunday brunch and evening performances. This elegant red-headed pianist and singer is a poised entertainer whose impeccable pianism belongs to the school of jazz that maintains a sense of classical decorum at the keyboard. Even when swinging out, she remains an impressionist with special affinities for Thelonious Monk and bossa nova. Vocally, she belongs to the conversational tradition of Mabel Mercer, with a style that's blase but never cold. Sunday at 2 and 8 p.m. Cover: $55 at 2, including brunch at noon; $42 at 8, with a $15 minimum (an $80 dinner-and-show package is available).
HOLDEN

*BLOSSOM DEARIE, Danny's Skylight Room, 346 West 46th Street, Clinton, (212)265-8133. To watch this singer and pianist is to appreciate the power of a carefully deployed pop-jazz minimalism combined with a highly discriminating taste in songs. She remains the definitive interpreter, at once fey and tough, of the pop-jazz satirist Dave Frishberg, as astute and unforgiving a social critic as exists. The songs -- her own and other people's -- date from all periods of a career remarkable for its longevity and for Ms. Dearie's stubborn independence and sly wit, which have never gone stale. Tomorrow night at 7; Sunday night at 6:15. Cover: $25, with a $15 minimum; a $54.50 dinner-and-show package is available.
HOLDEN

UTE LEMPER, Cafe Carlyle, Carlyle Hotel, 35 East 76th Street, (212)570-7189. This imperious, Dietrich-like cabaret singer, who is performing with a pop quartet through Feb. 26, lends the entire nightclub enterprise a German Expressionist seriousness. If her latest show is entirely different from the program of original songs she performed last year at Le Jazz au Bar, its attitude is similar. Most of the material doesn't deal directly with politics, history and literature like the sprawling topical broadsides of the earlier show. But she still invests it with a ferocity that infuses the art (and artifice) of cabaret with an unrelenting dramatic intensity. Tonight and tomorrow night at 8:45 and 10:45. Cover: $65; $40 at the bar; no minimum.
HOLDEN

*'SINGING ASTAIRE,' Birdland, 315 West 44th Street, Clinton, (212)581-3080. With Eric Comstock, Hilary Kole and Christopher Gines. The vocal trio that created the smart revue ''Our Sinatra''' has outdone itself with this lightly swinging 70-minute compendium of songs and lore associated with Fred Astaire. Suave and dry, and fleet on the piano, Mr. Comstock is a close stylistic relative of his idol, while Ms. Kole's pop-jazz singing has a Ginger Rogersesque edge. Mr. Gines fills in the difference with creamy vocal custard: witty, informative and fast-paced. Tomorrow and Sunday at 2:30 and 5:30 p.m. Cover: $30; $20 at the bar; $10 minimum.

Jazz

*CLAUDIA ACUNA QUINTET, Jazz Gallery, 290 Hudson Street, South Village, (212) 242-1063. Claudia Acuna, a young jazz singer from Chile, is committed to the idea of a jazz singer as an inseparable part of the band -- or, better yet, as a bandleader. She is working with a great crop of New York musicians, and they play around with mambos, South American jazz and folk music, Middle Eastern scales and improvising that goes far beyond mere accompaniment. In short, they're contemporary. Sets are tonight and tomorrow at 9 and 10:30; admission is $15 per set, $10 for members.
BEN RATLIFF

JERRY BERGONZI QUARTET, Smith's Bar, 701 Eighth Avenue, at 44th Street, Midtown, (212) 246-3268. Jerry Bergonzi is a post-Coltrane tenor saxophonist of incredible technical facility; he's an inspiration for music students, though he hasn't broken through to reach the ordinary jazz listener on a broad scale. Tonight at 9; there is no cover.
RATLIFF

THE BLUIETT BAND, Sweet Rhythm, 88 Seventh Avenue South, at Bleecker Street, West Village, (212)255-3626. What a sound Hamiet Bluiett has on the baritone saxophone, and what a ruckus he can kick up when he's stalking a good time. A longtime member of the World Saxophone Quartet, he has been a local favorite since the 1970's; he is still hiring good young musicians and creating converts. Sets are tonight and tomorrow at 8, 10 and midnight; cover charge is $20 and there is a $10 minimum.
RATLIFF

BRAZILIAN CARNAVAL UNIVERSAL WITH CYRO BAPTISTA AND FRIENDS, Dizzy's Club, Frederick P. Rose Hall, Broadway at 60th Street, Manhattan, (212)258-9595. New York-based, Brazilian-born Cyro Baptista builds loud and mirthful percussion ensembles; he'll be celebrating carnival time in Brazil with his sphere of colleagues from the worlds of Brazilian music and jazz. Sets through Sunday night at 7:30 and 9:30, with an 11 set tonight and tomorrow; cover charge is $30 and there is a $10 minimum.
RATLIFF

CHICK COREA AND TOUCHSTONE, Blue Note, 131 West Third Street, West Village, (212)475-8592. Armed with new music, the impressively prolific pianist Mr. Corea re-activates the neo-flamenco/jazz-fusion sound of his early-90's record, ''Touchstone.'' The band includes Jorge Pardo on saxophone and flute, Carles Benavent on bass, Tom Brechtlein on drums and Rubem Dantas on percussion. Sets through Sunday night at 8 and 10:30; cover charge is $45, and there is a $5 minimum.
RATLIFF

*DAVE DOUGLAS AND NOMAD, Village Vanguard, 178 Seventh Avenue, West Village, (212)255-4037. The first release on Greenleaf, the trumpeter Mr. Douglas's new label, is his new band Nomad, a quintet including tuba and clarinet; the band plays earthy, gregarious jazz chamber music, a cross between the energetic Balkan-tinged improvisation heard in Mr. Douglas's Tiny Bell Trio and the hushed dynamics of another of his bands, Charms of the Night Sky. For its week at the Vanguard, this Nomad has a different lineup than the record's. Besides Mr. Douglas, it includes the saxophonist Myron Ewalden, the cellist Rubin Kodheli, the tubaist the Marcus Rojas and the drummer Tyshawn Sorey. Sets through Sunday are at 9 and 11; cover charge is $30.
RATLIFF

OLIVER LAKE STEEL QUARTET, Jazz Standard, 116 East 27th Street, Manhattan, (212)576-2232. Oliver Lake, an original member of the World Saxophone Quartet, claims Eric Dolphy as a stylistic father in his acidic tone and in the darting movements of his playing. But his structural mindset has led him all over the place: toward reggae, big-band exercises and steel-drum music, the focus of his Steel Quartet. Sets are tonight and tomorrow at 7:30, 9:30 and 11:30; cover charge is $25.
RATLIFF

*JOE LOVANO STREET BAND, Birdland, 315 West 44th Street, Midtown, (212) 581-3080. The last time I heard it, this unusual jazz septet was playing themes associated with Enrico Caruso as intimate, casual, nonconcert-hall music, a spontaneous gathering of players piling layers on to the same melody. It may have evolved slightly since two years ago, but at that time it consisted of Mr. Lovano on tenor saxophone, two bassists, one plucking and the other bowing; a singer (Judi Silvano) intoning wordless melodies and improvising; a drummer; an accordionist; and a clarinetist, sitting-cross-legged, who also played percussion on cookie tins, take-out containers and cymbals and frame drums lying flat on the floor. It was brilliant. Sets are tonight and tomorrow at 9 and 11; cover charge is $35, and there is a $10 minimum.
RATLIFF

MARK MURPHY, Iridium, 1650 Broadway at 51st Street, Midtown, (212) 582-2121. Since the late 1950's, the singer Mr. Murphy has been exploring new ways to distinguish himself from the rest of the jazz singers out there, and though some might wince at his extremism with phrasing and rhythm, he's still working at an impressively high level on all sorts of repertory, from the standard jazz-singer's ballads to newer pop to Dave Frishberg's darkly humorous songs. Sets tonight and tomorrow night at 8 and 10, on Sunday night at 8:45 and 10; cover charge is $30, and there is a $10 minimum.

Opera

'PELLEAS ET MELISANDE' The dream-like music of Debussy's opera flows extra-gorgeously and extra-heavily from the Metropolitan Opera pit under the baton of James Levine, poising the work somewhere between Wagner and Italian opera; while Jonathan Miller's production lends a touch of Edward Gorey to the whole. What's missing in the singing is Frenchness: Anne Sofie von Otter is a lovely mezzo Melisande; William Burden, an adequate tenor Pelleas; Roberto Scandiuzzi, a warm and dark yet slightly out of tune Arkel; Felicity Palmer, an elegant Genevieve. The exception is Jose van Dam's Golaud, sung so that every word is clear and every note is felt. Tomorrow afternoon at 1:30, Metropolitan Opera, Lincoln Center, (212)362-6000. Tickets: $145 and $215.
ANNE MIDGETTE

'MADAMA BUTTERFLY' This Puccini favorite continues its run at the Met with fresh singers in the principal roles, including Cynthia Lawrence as Cio-Cio-San, Marco Berti as Pinkerton and Charles Taylor as Sharpless. In his traditional production, Giancarlo del Monaco paints the stage with storybook images of rural Japan. Emmanuel Villaume conducts. Tonight at 8, Metropolitan Opera House, Lincoln Center, (212)362-6000. Tickets: $35 to $200.
JEREMY EICHLER

TURANDOT The American soprano Andrea Gruber takes on the daunting title role of Puccini's ''Turandot'' in the Metropolitan Opera's revival of Franco Zeffirelli's gargantuan and glittering 1987 production, so popular that it's critic-proof. Ms. Gruber has been singing some formidable repertory since returning to the fold of the Met in 2001, and her enormous voice shows signs of wear and stridency. Still, her singing is fearless and impassioned and through sheer force of will she excels in the role. The tenor Johan Botha is a heroic Calaf; the soprano Krassimira Stoyanova brings affecting vulnerability and throbbing richness to the role of Liu. Bertrand de Billy conducts a colorful and exciting account of Puccini's final opera. Tomorrow at 8 p.m., Metropolitan Opera House, Lincoln Center, (212)362-6000. Remaining tickets: $215; returns, if available, are sold before the performance.

Classical Music

BARGEMUSIC Moored in the shadow of the Brooklyn Bridge, this intimate floating concert hall is a charming place to hear solo recitals and chamber music while rocking gently on the waves of the East River. Tonight, in addition to works by Chopin and Liszt, Doris Stevenson will take on Frederic Rzewski's intensely wrought setting of Oscar Wilde's ''De Profundis,'' which requires as much theatrical skill (speaking, shouting, etc.) as it does keyboard dexterity. Tomorrow night and Sunday, the angst turns Schubertian as the baritone Chris Pedro Trakas is joined by the pianist Michael Barrett for ''Die Winterreise.'' Tonight and tomorrow night at 7:30 and Sunday afternoon at 4, Fulton Ferry Landing, under the Brooklyn Bridge, Brooklyn, (718) 624-2083. Tickets: $35; students, $25; an additional free concert takes place tomorrow at 1 p.m.
EICHLER

CLEVELAND ORCHESTRA Tonight's third of four concerts by the Cleveland Orchestra at Carnegie Hall this week offers contrasts between contemporary composers: the darkness and melancholy of Harrison Birtwistle's ''Night's Black Bird'' and Henri Dutilleux's light-filled Second Symphony, ''Le Double.'' Radu Lupu will continue his survey of the Beethoven Piano Concertos with the ''Emperor.'' Franz Welser-Most, the orchestra's young music director, conducts. Tomorrow brings more standard programming: Mr. Lupu with the Beethoven Fourth Concerto, then the Schubert ''Unfinished'' Symphony and Berg's ''Three Pieces for Orchestra.'' Tonight at 8, Carnegie Hall, (212)247-7800. Tickets: $29 to $116.
BERNARD HOLLAND

DVORAK ANNIVERSARY TRIBUTE Do you need proof that the tendency to link performances to anniversaries has gotten out of hand? Here is a chamber program that doesn't really cry out for special justification, but is being offered as a celebration of the 110th anniversary of Dvorak's arrival in New York to teach at the National Conservatory of Music, in New York. As it happens, the performance is taking place at Washington Irving High School, which was built on the site where the National Conservatory was once located. The program includes Dvorak's Sonatine in G for Violin, the Romantic Pieces (Op. 75), and selections from the Biblical Songs (Op. 99), as well as Josef Suk's Song of Love (Op. 7, No. 1) and arrangements of spirituals by Henry T. Burleigh, who introduced Dvorak to this music. The performers are Anna Polonsky, a pianist, Soovin Kim, a violinist and Charles Mays Jr., a baritone. Tomorrow at 8 p.m., Washington Irving High School, Irving Place at 16th Street, (212)586-4680. Tickets: $9.
ALLAN KOZINN

FREIBURG BAROQUE ORCHESTRA Petra Mullejns conducts a program of Bach and Handel with the distinguished German soprano Christine Schafer as a guest. Ms. Schafer sings Bach's cantata ''Weichet nur, betrubte Schatten'' and excerpts from Handel's ''Alcina.'' Bach's C-major Orchestral Suite and the Handel Concerto Grosso Op. 3, No. 2 are also on the program. Sunday at at 5 p.m., Alice Tully Hall, Lincoln Center, (212)721-6500. Tickets: $56.
HOLLAND

KRONOS QUARTET Premieres are what makes this iconoclastic quartet's engine purr, and tomorrow night it is playing a program's worth of them. Included are the United States premiere of Meredith Monk's ''Stringsongs'' and the New York premieres of Michael Gordon's ''Potassium,'' Tamburi Cemil Bey's ''Evic Taksim,'' Willem Jeths's ''Intus Trepidare'' (''Trembling From Within''), Alexandra Du Bois's ''Oculus pro Oculo Totum Orbem Terrae Caecat'' (''An Eye for an Eye Makes the World Go Blind'') and Felipe Perez Santiago's ''CampoSanto'' (''Holy Ground''). Tomorrow at 7:30, Zankel Hall, Carnegie Hall, (212)247-7800. Tickets: $30 to $45.
KOZINN

CHRISTINE SCHAFER In the huge opera houses of the United States, small, intense voices don't come off to best advantage, which may be a reason New York hasn't heard even more of the German soprano Christine Schafer, who has sung at the Met but appears more regularly in Berlin or Salzburg, as everything from Berg's Lulu to Mozart's Konstanze to Verdi's Violetta. Tonight's recital features a couple of characterizations: Schubert's settings of Mignon's songs from ''Wilhelm Meister'' and Richard Strauss's three Ophelia songs. Also on the program are other Strauss songs and -- a highlight -- Berg's ''Seven Early Songs.'' Ted Taylor is the accompanist. Tonight at 8, Alice Tully Hall, Lincoln Center, (212)721-6500. Tickets: $48.

ELISA MONTE DANCE A choreographer known for physically intense and often sensual choreography offers two premieres. ''A Woman's Way (To Nancy, With Love from Tom),'' an ode to love, shares programs with pieces from the repertory (Tomorrow at 8 p.m., Sunday at 7:30 p.m.). ''Via Sacra'' is a three-act work that concerns the mutability of life and the struggle to work through loss. Ms. Monte's sources of inspiration for it include the Greek myth of Cupid and Psyche and the color theories of the artist Josef Albers (Tonight at 8, Sunday at 2 p.m.). Tonight and tomorrow at 8, Sunday at 2 and 7:30 p.m., Joyce Theater, 175 Eighth Avenue at 19th Street, Chelsea (212)242-0800. Tickets: $40.

*NEW YORK CITY BALLET The big news of the weekend is the return to the company repertory of Jerome Robbins's ''Fanfare'' (tonight and tomorrow afternoon), danced to and inspired by Benjamin Britten's Young Person's Guide to the Orchestra, a festive piece d'occasion choreographed for the coronation of Queen Elizabeth II in 1953. In addition to learning, at last, how to distinguish the oboe from the harp, balletgoers will get a chance to see several young up-and-comers in new roles. tk, New York State Theater, Lincoln Center, (212) 870-5570 or www.nycballet.com.Tickets: $30.-$80.

Museums

'THE AZTEC EMPIRE,' Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum, 1071 Fifth Avenue, at 89th Street, (212)423-3500, through Feb. 13. When a big survey of Aztec art opened in London in 2002, everybody flipped out. It was one of the hottest ancient-art events since Tutankhamen. Now an expanded version of the London show is at the Guggenheim, and it's a stunner. Objects from pre-Aztec Mexico set the stage, but it is material from the bloody-minded, deity-besotted Aztec culture that fills the museum's darkened ramps. Set on jutting platforms and dark recesses are a skull-headed earth goddess in a skirt of writhing snakes, a warrior metamorphosing into a bird and a god of spring and fertility shedding his skin. Funky clay images of domestic life alternate with ultrasophisticated gold jewelry. The show may be a little too heavy on theater and too light on information, but it's totally mesmerizing. Hours: Saturdays through Wednesdays, 10 a.m. to 5:45 p.m.; Fridays, 10 a.m. to 8 p.m. Admission: $18; $15, students and 65+.
HOLLAND COTTER

*'FROM FILIPPO LIPPI TO PIERO DELLA FRANCESCA: FRA CARNEVALE AND THE MAKING OF A RENAISSANCE MASTER,' Metropolitan Museum of Art, 1000 Fifth Avenue, at 82nd Street, (212)535-7710, through May 1. The Italian Renaissance artist-priest known as Fra Carnevale was an art-world somebody in his day, but a shadowy figure to modern historians, known primarily for two extraordinary paintings of tiny figures in fantastic architectural settings. Both paintings are in this intricate think-piece of a show that tries to reconstruct his career by bringing his known paintings together. At the same time, it uses his work, along with that of major figures like Filippo Lippi and Piero della Francesca, to explore larger ideas about self-created professional identity in a cultural epoch far more diverse than it is sometimes thought to be. A few of the paintings mustered as evidence are pretty strange; many are glorious. Hours: Sundays, Tuesdays through Thursdays, 9:30 a.m. to 5:30 p.m.; Fridays and Saturdays until 9 p.m. Admission: $15; 65+, $10; students, $7.

'IMAGES OF DON QUIXOTE: THE ART OF ILLUSTRATION AND PRINTMAKING,' the Hispanic Society of America, 613 West 155th Street, (212)926-2234, through Feb. 20. A few years back, a poll of international writers voted ''Don Quixote'' the greatest book of all time. This year Cervantes's novel is four centuries old, and the Hispanic Society is celebrating the occasion with this exhibition of illustrations of the story printed from the 17th through 20th centuries. Despite its small size, the show demonstrates how attitudes toward the book changed in different eras, from raucous comedy to Romantic tragedy. And in designs by artists like Fragonard and Gustave Dore, there are fascinating images and ideas to consider. Hours: Tuesdays through Saturdays, 10:30 a.m. to 5 p.m.; Sundays, 1 to 4 p.m. Free.

'I WANNA BE LOVED BY YOU: PHOTOGRAPHS OF MARILYN MONROE,' Brooklyn Museum, 200 Eastern Parkway, Brooklyn, (718)638-5000, through March 20. Monroe was one of the great movie stars of the 20th century, but does that make her a good subject for a museum show? Fans might enjoy the almost 200 photographs from a private collection presented in this exhibition, but though many are by famous photographers, including Richard Avedon, Cecil Beaton and Henri Cartier-Bresson, the show as a whole is like a walk-in special issue of People magazine: diverting but superficial and enervating. Hours: Wednesdays to Fridays, 10 a.m. to 5 p.m.; Saturdays and Sundays, 11 a.m. to 6 p.m. (to 11 p.m. on the first Saturday of every month). Admission: $8; students and 65+, $4.

'WILD: FASHION UNTAMED,' the Costume Institute of the Metropolitan Museum of Art, Fifth Avenue at 82nd Street, (212)535-7710, through March 13. This sumptuous assemblage of fur, feathers, leather and such used to keep humans warm, make them look good and ratchet up their social status displays more than 100 costumes and accessories by big-name designers, from the House of Worth to Karl Lagerfeld. The show, certainly one of the most politically incorrect exhibitions the Met has ever mounted, confidently assures us in its catalog that animal-rights protests peaked in the 1980's and that since the mid-90's we have seen a revival of wearer interest in fur in its natural state. But whether or not you dig the notion of ''faunal apparel,'' as its organizers refer to outside skins, the show has this to impart: from the moment you encounter the entryway exhibit, a Ziegfeldesque mannequin on a trapeze swing dramatically enveloped by a Roberto Cavalli cascade of pink ostrich feathers, to the outrageous Stephen Jones hat adorned with a crocodile head in the last case, you are on message that fashion is theater, and sometimes theater of the absurd. Hours and admission: see above.

Galleries: Uptown

RODNEY MCMILLIAN, Triple Candie, 461 West 126th Street, (212)865-0783, through Feb. 13. Based in Los Angeles, Mr. McMillian studied with the conceptual artist Charles Gaines, and like his mentor, he fuses appropriated images and objects with enigmatic touching on science, sociology and contemporary art history. At the center of the spare exhibition is an installation of mattresses and box springs that the artist collected on streets of New York City and arranged in five sequential stacks of increasing height. Most of the beds are in decent shape, still covered with brightly patterned fabric, but some are some badly stained, battered and torn. Piled up, they're like geological strata: urban life as seen through the furniture of sleep, sex and death, an entropic image that Robert Smithson would have appreciated.

*'UNICA ZURN: DRAWINGS FROM THE 1960S,' Ubu Gallery, 416 East 59th Street, (212)753-4444, through April 16. The German artist and writer Unica Zurn (1916-1970) was a lover of Hans Bellmer, through whom she met many mebers of the Surrealist circle in Paris. Despite repeated confinements to psychiatric hospitals, she wrote books of poetry, fiction and autobiography, and during a brief period in the 1960's produced drawings, a cross between elaborate doodles and minutely controlled images of fantastic beings: half figurative, half abstract; human and bestial; composed of webs of delicate pen strokes. Like run-on dreams, they are as varied in detail and crushingly similar in tone. In 1970, with an aubiographical novel, ''Dark Spring,'' completed, she left a clinic to return to Bellmer, who ended the relationship. Having nowhere to go, Zurn jumped from the window of his apartment to her death.

*'LOG CABIN,' Artists Space, 38 Greene Street, (212)226-3970, through Feb. 26. Given the cultural climate, wedding bells won't be playing ''Over the Rainbow'' any time soon, and men and women won't be coming out of the closet and going in the Army. So what can Log Cabin Republicans, gay supporters of the ruling party, be thinking? This is one of the questions posed, however indirectly, by the 33 participants in a snappy, discursive group show that serves as a field report on what art with queer identity as a theme is looking like these days. As surveyed by the curator, Jeffrey Uslip, it's looking good and heterogeneous: ambisexual, interracial and multi-generational, though short on lesbian artists, who are making some of the best work anywhere.

Galleries: Chelsea

JULIAN STANCZAK: 'CONSTELLATIONS AND COLORS: FOUR DECADES OF PAINTING,' Stefan Stux Gallery, 530 West 25th Street, (212)352-1600, through Feb. 19. One of the Op artists in the Museum of Modern Art's famous ''Responsive Eye'' exhibition of 1965, Mr. Stanczak has not strayed from the fold in the 40 years since. Along the way, his work has steadily become more refined and ingenious. In this display of 10 works going back to the 1970's, the centerpiece is ''Niania's Multiples'' (2003-04), a wall work of 36 square modules. A softly defined square of glowing hue that sometimes generates an X shape sits at the center of each module, its radiance spreading out to create a kind of color harmonics. The more you look, the more affecting the work becomes overall. Other carefully conceived works offer other perceptual delights. Who says Op art is dead?
GLUECK

'URBAN LEGENDS,' Artek Contemporaries, 526 West 26th Street, Suite 312, (212)463-8500, through Feb. 15. The three artists in this small show all take the city, whether gritty or abstract, as a theme. In paintings of bent grids, Mike Childs offers what look like closeups of glass-and-steel high rises, and Joseduardo Granados displays finely drawn, intense crosses between landscapes and cityscapes. Mark Chamberlain claims the Gotham of ''Batman'' fame as his turf and explores the hitherto closeted relationship between the masked hero and his younger sidekick and longtime companion, Robin.

Other Galleries

*'MAPPING SITTING: ON PORTRAITURE AND PHOTOGRAPHY,' Grey Art Gallery, New York University, 100 Washington Square East, Greenwich Village, (212)998-6780, through April 2. The commercial photographs in this show -- passport head-shots, formal group portraits of police academy graduates, casual pictures of guys showing off on the beach -- are among some 150,000 from Lebanon, Egypt, Iraq, Iran, Jordan, Morocco, Palestine and Syria in the collection of the Arab Image Foundation, a research archive and cultural salvage operation established in Beirut in 1997 to gather and preserve photography from the Arab World. The selection at Grey Gallery suggests how photographs have been used and valued in Middle Eastern cultures, and it replaces Western stereotypes of bearded gunmen, black-shrouded women with a sense of the complicated ordinariness that is the reality of modern Arab life as it is of modern American life.
COTTER

*EVAN SCHWARTZ AND MICHAEL WAUGH, Schroeder Romero, 173A North 3rd Street, Williamsburg, Brooklyn, (718)486-8992, through Feb. 14 . Evan Schwartz's New York solo debut, ''Reclaiming Puberty,'' is a document of transition from one gender to another. The series starts with family snapshots of the artist as a pre-adolescent girl and as a teenager in a floor-length gown on her way to a high school prom, then picks up as he assumes a male identity, through a regiment of hormone treatments and a double mastectomy. Celebratory in spirit, the show ends with a second prom photo, this one of Mr. Schwartz, handsome in a tux, with his arms around a young woman, his date. Also of interest is a small show of labor-intensive drawings by Michael Waugh. Most of them composed in lines of minute hand-written script, the text being a composite of presidential inaugural addresses from the past.

Last Chance

THOMAS ALLEN: 'UNCOVERED,' Foley, 547 West 27th Street, Chelsea, (212)244-9081, closing tomorrow. Mr. Allen creates ''pop-up'' scenarios by cutting and folding selected figures from the covers of old paperbacks and other books; he then makes surprisingly dimensional color photographs of them. The screaming man at the top of a leaning stack of books looks like he is about to fall off a cliff. In ''Thirst,'' a sultry woman reaches from the cover of one book for the liquor bottle held by the man on a nearby volume.
JOHNSON

CHARLOTTE BECKET, Taxter & Spengemann, 504 West 22nd Street, Chelsea, (212)924-0212, closing tomorrow. Ms. Becket's ''Wishing Well'' is a notable contribution to the department of extreme trash accumulation, kinetic division. Stacked tiers of paper, cardboard, bottles and other sorts of refuse sandwiched between sheets of plywood rise 10 feet in the air. In the middle of this tower of garbage, a vertical conveyor continuously churns up loose debris. It owes a lot to the work of Phoebe Washburn but has its own wacky humor and inventiveness.
JOHNSON

CHARLES DE WOLF BROWNELL: 'A DECADE OF TRAVEL, 1856-66,' Hirschl & Adler Galleries, 21 East 70th Street, (212)535-8810, through tomorrow. Brownell (1822-1909), a New England-born landscapist, did watercolors in Cuba over a 10-year period, while wintering on sugar and coffee plantations owned by his family there. His detailed record of the Cuban landscape ranges from close-up renditions of plants and foliage to a panoramic view -- the largest work in the show -- of the Bay of Matanzas, the region that was the center of the sugar industry. After his intensive Cuban period, he turned to views of the New England region where he grew up. Like his Cuban work, these are delicately painted, pleasant views that capture the flavor of the New England countryside, its mountains, trees, rivers and farms.
GLUECK

'THE CASTELLANI AND ITALIAN ARCHAEOLOGICAL JEWELRY,' Bard Graduate Center for Studies in the Decorative Arts, Design and Culture, 18 West 86th Street, (212)501-3000, closing on Sunday. A dazzling look at the redoubtable Castellani jewelry firm that lasted in Rome from 1814 to 1927 and its production of exquisitely wrought jewelry modeled on the Etruscan, Greek and Roman relics being dug up all over Italy. This is not a show for dilettantes, requiring strength of eye and the patience of Job for exquisite detail. But it's a spectacular, even for over-the-top, bling-bling-y New York. Hours: Tuesdays through Sundays, 11 a.m. to 5 p.m.; Thursdays to 8 p.m. Admission: $3; students and 65+, $2.
GLUECK

TONY FITZPATRICK: 'THE WONDER: PORTRAITS OF A REMEMBERED CITY,' Pierogi, 177 North Ninth Street, Williamsburg, Brooklyn, (718)599-2144, closing on Monday. These densely knit concoctions of words and images may be nothing new, but they win you over with their emotion and erudition, both illuminating the greatness of Chicago, as well as their physical solidity. Bristling with an undiluted palette of red, black, white and marigold and dotted with images cut from old matchbook covers as well as poems and personal reminiscences, they conjure up the glamour of bygone hotels, clubs and sports legends while evoking everything from quiltmaking and tattooing to cloisonne and Neo-Expressionism. These works count as highly disciplined exercises in nostalgia: their specificity reveals something new about the time and place they yearn for, as well as the medium they so deftly explore.
ROBERTA SMITH

JIM GOLDBERG: 'TWO STORIES,' Pace/MacGill, 32 East 57th Street, (212)759-7999, closing tomorrow. For a series of photographic portraits called ''Rich and Poor'' that he made in the late 70's and early 80's, Mr. Goldberg had his visibly rich or poor subjects write their thoughts on the prints. The vivid sense of real persons that emerges is as compelling as anything you might learn about wealth or poverty. Another project, a kind of wrap-around bulletin board, is obscurely autobiographical.
JOHNSON

EMILE GUEBEHI AND MALICK SIDIBE, Jack Shainman, 513 West 20th Street, Chelsea, (212)645-1701, closing tomorrow. Lively studio portraits from 40 years and curious new photographs of heavy women seen from behind by Mr. Sidibe, the celebrated photographer from Mali, nicely complement the striking painted sculptures by the Ivory Coast-based Mr. Guebehi. Representing big, buxom women naked or partly naked and, in some cases, visibly pregnant, the sculptures look like the works of a self-taught artist with a thing for maternal women.
JOHNSON

*'A HEAVENLY CRAFT: THE WOODCUT IN EARLY PRINTED BOOKS,' Grolier Club, 47 East 60th Street, (212)838-6690, closing tomorrow. A lively overall view of the development of the woodcut is provided by this show of 15th- and 16th-century books acquired in the mid 1940's by Lessing J. Rosenwald, the Sears Roebuck heir, from the noted C.W. Dyson Perrins collection in England. Ranging from primitive to elegant in style, the books -- in themselves works by master printers -- contain illustrations by artists like Albrecht Durer, Urs Graf and Hans Burgkmair, along with lesser names and the more frequent anonymities of the period. Among them are three rare editions of Aesop's fables; the ''Revelationes'' of St. Birgitta, produced in 1500 by the Nuremberg printer Anton Koberger; and the 1495 Florence folio edition, one of two in existence, of ''Epistolae et Evangeli,'' a book of Gospels and lessons of the Mass.
GLUECK

JAMES HYDE; RACHEL BERWICK, Brent Sikkema, 530 West 22nd Street, Chelsea, (212) 929-2262, closing tomorrow. Mr. Hyde presents rectilinear wall-hung compositions made of raw lumber, chromed steel panels, clear vinyl, paint, photographs and other materials in his continuing, rigorously playful analysis of formalism, materialism and Modernist painting. Ms. Berwick's vivid wall-size video portraits of a rare Galapagos tortoise and a life-size cast in volcanic glass of a tortoise shell obliquely explore the intersection of natural and human histories.
JOHNSON

CHRISTIAN MARCLAY: 'SHAKE RATTLE AND ROLL (FLUXMIX),' Paula Cooper, 534 West 21st Street, Chelsea, (212) 255-1105, closing tomorrow. In an installation by an artist known for hybridizing art and music, each of 16 video monitors in a circle show white-gloved hands gently playing with boxes, books, toys, photographs and other things belonging to a collection of works by Fluxus artists at the Walker Art Center. The various low-level noises produced by the hands and the objects generate a quiet, John Cage-style, surround-sound concert.
JOHNSON

'QUEENS INTERNATIONAL,' Queens Museum of Art, Flushing Meadows-Corona Park, (718)592-9700, closing on Sunday. The 40 artists here are all residents of the city's most cosmopolitan borough, though nearly a third were born outside the United States. In line with current curatorial trends, overt displays of ethnicity are played down and a certain blandness prevails. But there is some interesting work, including paintings by the Japanese-American Hideo Date, now 97 and a Queens resident for more than half a century. His two soft-grained figurative paintings from the 1930's and 40's emanate from a distant stylistic world, one that looks fine right now. Hours: Wednesdays through Fridays, 10 a.m. to 5 p.m.; Saturdays and Sundays, noon to 5 p.m. Admission: $5; $2.50 for students and 65+.

HEADLINE: Hospital's Closing Not Seen as a Public Peril

BYLINE: By LISA W. FODERARO

DATELINE: PORT CHESTER, N.Y. 

 BODY:
When New York United Hospital Medical Center announced in December that it planned to close after years of losing money, there was hand-wringing among the hundreds of staff members over their livelihoods and a deep sense of loss among residents of this Westchester County village who had grown up with the hospital. 
 But while residents and employees may have been surprised by the seeming suddenness of the decision, representatives of the hospital industry were not. For years, hospitals in New York State have complained that they are teetering on the edge financially because of a general decline in hospitalizations combined with sharply rising costs and stagnant reimbursement rates. 
 And in the last two years, the doom-and-gloom predictions have started to come true, as a dozen hospitals across the state have shut their doors for good. 
 What has changed, however, is the reaction to the closings. There was a time when even rumblings of a possible hospital closing set off fierce and prolonged community and political battles. But these days, with so many hospitals in financial trouble, the hospital industry, its unions and patient advocates are conceding that shrinkage is not only inevitable but in some cases healthy. 
 ''I get paid dues for every hospital that stays open,'' said Daniel Sisto, president of the Healthcare Association of New York State, a membership organization representing 550 hospitals, nursing homes and health care agencies. ''But the reality is that these closings by and large have not created major havoc in the community.'' 
 ''What I see happening in many parts of the state is that where we have excess capacity, the boards of trustees have such a vested interest in maintaining their own hospital that there might be two hospitals in a town that only needs one. Both hospitals continue to erode, and they each hang on well past the point that closure by either one would benefit the community.''
 That is the argument that officials in New York State have long been making. Looking to save money on health care, they have portrayed the network of hospitals stretching from Brooklyn to Buffalo as costly and bloated, with too many beds over all. That assessment was reiterated last fall in a report commissioned by Gov. George E. Pataki urging the state to stop pumping money into failing hospitals. Mr. Pataki plans to name a commission to identify hospitals to close.
 But even as hospitals throughout New York State have reported various degrees of distress -- a survey in 2003 by a national health industry group and a financial services company found that hospitals in New York State were by far the nation's weakest financially -- closings were few through most of the 1980's and 1990's. 
 So far, United Hospital's demise does not seem likely to plunge Port Chester and the surrounding community into turmoil. Patients have already been making their way to Greenwich Hospital, only three miles northeast, in Connecticut, or to White Plains Hospital Center, just six miles northwest. Many low-income immigrants from Port Chester have for years used a community health center in Rye Brook operated by the Open Door Family Medical Centers. The center plans to move to Port Chester this year. 
 Many nurses and other professional employees have already been hired by nearby hospitals. 
 Though the board of United is talking about replacing the hospital with a scaled-down outpatient center with a free-standing emergency room, as well as support services like radiology, respiratory therapy and laboratory testing, its president and chief executive, Philip G. Dionne, acknowledged that it was not at all clear whether such a center would thrive financially or break even.
 Hospital employees, people with ties to the hospital and Port Chester officials are still trying to stop the closing -- the date is not yet set -- arguing that it is vital to the economic and health care interests of the community. But other local officials say that, whatever happens, residents of Port Chester -- a gritty village known for its dozens of ethnic restaurants -- and those in the more affluent communities of Rye, Rye Brook and Harrison will still have access to hospital care.
 ''While you hate to see an institution such as this close, from a health care delivery point of view, you may not be losing anything,'' said Lawrence A. Rand, mayor of the village of Rye Brook, which has a population of 9,600. ''You're talking about a community that is blessed with health care services.'' Nonetheless, he said, he would welcome United's plan to convert to an outpatient center.
 What does concern health and hospital officials is the haphazard way these closings are occurring. For one, most hospitals that have closed were in struggling communities with many immigrants. The number of Hispanic residents in Port Chester, which has a population of 28,000, has ballooned in recent years, to 46 percent of the overall population in 2000, from 16 percent in 1980. United Hospital officials say that 49 percent of its patients are on Medicare and 23 percent on Medicaid.
 ''There are ways of reducing duplication in hospitals and pursuing consolidation, but random failure is not the answer,'' said Kenneth E. Raske, president of the Greater New York Hospital Association, a trade group that lobbies on behalf of the state's major hospitals.
 Even officials at 1199/S.E.I.U., the powerful hospital and health care workers' union, with 250,000 members across New York, are sounding resigned to the idea that some hospitals must close, though concerned about which ones.
 ''We may need to look at downsizing, but it's not being done in any planned way,'' said the union's political director, Jennifer Cunningham.
 At the same time, however, 1199/S.E.I.U., industry lobbyists and other health care lobbyists are gearing up to vigorously battle Governor Pataki's proposal to rein in the rising cost of Medicaid, the $44.5 billion-a-year health insurance program for the state's low-income residents. Mr. Pataki announced $1 billion in spending cuts for health care and Medicaid, as part of his proposed budget. Union leaders and hospital officials forecast a devastating impact on patient care if the cuts go through.
 ''We don't have Medicaid nurses, we have nurses, and they take care of everybody,'' Mr. Raske said.
 Jim Tallon, president of the United Hospital Fund of New York, a nonprofit policy group, said those hospitals that served large numbers of uninsured and low-income patients were most vulnerable. 
 ''If you have a concentration of nonpaying patients and you are not simultaneously making it up with paying patients,'' he said, ''there's not the opportunity to make up for your losses.''
 But with the costs of labor, malpractice insurance and drugs rising, and insurance reimbursement rates lagging, even hospitals in well-off communities are having a hard time, industry representatives said.
 ''I have 209 members, and two-thirds of them are hanging on the side of the cliff, holding on with their hands,'' said Mr. Sisto, president of the Healthcare Association. ''When one of them falls, we shouldn't ask, why them? We should ask, how many more?''
 According to the Healthcare Association, the 209 nonprofit hospitals in New York lost $2 billion collectively in the last six years. The last time the hospitals as a group made money was in 1997, the association said. The hospitals that have closed in recent years include St. Agnes in White Plains, Caledonian campus of Brooklyn Hospital Center, Our Lady of Mercy's Florence D'Urso Pavilion in the Bronx, Bayley Seton on Staten Island, St. Joseph's in Queens, Beth Israel's Singer Division (the former Doctors Hospital) on the Upper East Side and a few upstate.
 ''An aging hospital that has been drained of financial resources for decades and that isn't in a community with a capacity for philanthrophic giving is more likely to die than one which may have just recently endured losses,'' Mr. Sisto said.
 United has had financial troubles for years. It opened in 1889 in two rented rooms on the second floor of Scott's Dry Goods Store here. Its 14-acre campus, nestled close to both Interstate 287 and Interstate 95, grew to 255 beds and 633 staff members. It posted operating losses every year since 1990, with deficits recently in the $10 million range.
 The hospital's creditors, from Con Edison to its food-service provider, were angry with the late payments -- some $13.5 million was more than 200 days past due -- and demanded cash up front.
 The hospital, unable to invest in the latest technology or renovate its aging center, had trouble recruiting new doctors. It managed to raise $4 million for a new emergency room, but the board canceled the plan because the rest of the hospital was so antiquated that it could not support an updated emergency room.
 ''There's a decline in reimbursements, an increased need for equipment, aging buildings,'' said Mr. Dionne, United's president, who is also a principal of Kurron Shares of America, a hospital management company on Long Island hired by United's board in September. ''And the most telling decline was that patients were simply choosing other places to go for their emergency care. In urban high-growth areas, that's a red flag for other problems.'' 
 In December, the administration sought Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection, and the hospital stopped admitting patients for elective treatment on Christmas Eve. By Thursday, only two inpatients remained. The emergency room will stay open until the end, but no one knows exactly when that will be. The hospital submitted a ''plan of closure'' to the State Health Department, and a specific date will be set once the state signs off, Mr. Dionne said.
 Officials from both United and local towns and villages are working with hospital administrators in the area to ensure a smooth transition for emergency care. ''United has in the past done 16,000 E.R. visits a year, which is significant,'' Mr. Dionne said. ''That need will continue.''
 Greenwich Hospital, for one, says it is ready to pick up the slack, even if it means treating more patients without insurance. ''We want to do whatever we can to help that community,'' said George G. Pawlush, a hospital spokesman. ''We're here to serve the patients regardless of their ability to pay.''
 In the newly competitive health care environment, United's loss was Greenwich's gain. In 1998, 15.7 percent of Greenwich Hospital's patients came from Westchester. Last year, 28.7 percent of patients were from Westchester, specifically the communities served by United.
 And Greenwich has not been shy about advertising its services in Westchester County newspapers and stepping up mailings to Westchester residents.
 ''One of the reasons United got caught was competition,'' Mayor Rand of Rye Brook said. ''When you look at it from an intellectual plane, you ask: 'How can it survive?' The answer is: 'It can't, because of the numbers.' And it doesn't need to.''
 But that assessment does not make the imminent closing any less agonizing for many of the hospital's employees. Clarence Medley, 58, worked at United for 28 years, most recently in the mailroom. He is one of 133 employees who live in subsidized housing on the hospital's campus. Though he has already been laid off, United is letting him and other tenants remain in their homes until the property is sold. 
 ''Now I have to find a job and find a place to live,'' he said. ''We heard rumors, but we didn't believe them. Finally it hit home.''

HEADLINE: Gambling With Your Retirement

BYLINE: By PAUL KRUGMAN. 
E-mail: krugman@nytimes.com

 BODY:
A few weeks ago I tried to explain the logic of Bush-style Social Security privatization: it is, in effect, as if your financial adviser told you that you wouldn't have enough money when you retire -- but you shouldn't save more. Instead, you should borrow a lot of money, buy stocks and hope for capital gains. 
 Before President Bush's big speech, a background briefing by a ''senior administration official'' (which can be found at www.nytimes.com/opinion) made it clear that the plan calls for exactly the ''borrow, speculate and hope'' strategy I described -- not just for the system as a whole, but for each individual.
 Here's the money quote: ''In return for the opportunity to get the benefits from the personal account, the person forgoes a certain amount of benefits from the traditional system. Now, the way that election is structured, the person comes out ahead if their personal account exceeds a 3 percent rate of return'' -- after inflation -- ''which is the rate of return that the trust fund bonds receive. So, basically, the net effect on an individual's benefits would be zero if his personal account earned a 3 percent rate of return.''
 Translation: If you put part of your payroll taxes into a personal account, your future benefits will be reduced by an amount equivalent to the amount you would have had to repay if you had borrowed the money at a real interest rate of 3 percent.
 Peter Orszag of the Brookings Institution got it exactly right: ''It's not a nest egg. It's a loan.'' 
 For years, privatizers -- including Mr. Bush -- have claimed that people would do better with private accounts than with traditional Social Security even if they played it safe and invested in U.S. government bonds (which yield 3 percent after inflation).
 But the official at the briefing made it clear that his boss was fibbing: if you invested your private account in government bonds, you would face benefit cuts equal in value to your investment, so you would be no better off than under the current system.
 The only way to get ahead would be to invest in risky assets like stocks, and hope for higher yields. But if the investment went wrong and you earned less than 3 percent after inflation, your benefit cuts would leave you poorer than if you had never opened that private account. 
 So people are expected to take a loan from the government and use it to buy stocks, and if that turns out to have been a mistake -- well, too bad. 
 Experts usually tell people to plan for their retirement by investing in a mix of stocks and bonds. They disapprove strongly of speculation on margin: borrowing to buy stocks. Yet Mr. Bush wants tens of millions of Americans to do exactly that.
 Meanwhile, what does any of this have to do with the ostensible purpose of the whole thing: saving Social Security?
 Here's the senior official again: ''In a long-term sense, the personal accounts would have a net neutral effect on the fiscal situation of Social Security.'' The government would have to borrow huge sums up front to create the personal accounts -- $4.5 trillion in the first two decades -- but it would supposedly make up for all that borrowing with offsetting cuts in account holders' benefits many decades later. 
 Color me skeptical: will retirees with private accounts that performed badly really be forced to repay their loans in full? Even if they are, private accounts will at best have a ''net neutral effect'' -- that is, they will do nothing to improve Social Security's finances. Mr. Bush says the system faces a crisis; what does he propose to do about it?
 The answer, presumably, is that his plan will also involve major benefit cuts over and above those associated with private accounts. And it's true that you can improve Social Security's finances with privatization, as long as you also slash benefits -- just as you can kill a flock of sheep with witchcraft, provided you also feed them arsenic. (Thanks, M. Voltaire.)
 Do you believe that we should replace America's most successful government program with a system in which workers engage in speculation that no financial adviser would recommend? Do you believe that we should do this even though it will do nothing to improve the program's finances? If so, George Bush has a deal for you.

HEADLINE: Boeing Hires a Legal Team To Handle Scandal Cases

BYLINE: By TIM WEINER

 BODY:
The Boeing Company, facing legal problems at the Pentagon and the Justice Department, has hired two politically experienced outside lawyers in several highly charged cases, a company official said Thursday.
 Boeing is the one of the nation's biggest military contractors. It is under fire for unethical handling of Pentagon contracts and trade secrets obtained from the Lockheed Martin Corporation, its biggest corporate rival in the weapons business. 
 Dan Beck, a Boeing spokesman, said in an interview yesterday that the company had hired Jamie S. Gorelick, who was deputy United States attorney general and general counsel of the Pentagon in the Clinton administration, and Richard Cullen, who is a former Virginia attorney general and an experienced white-collar defense lawyer. The company's decision to hire them to handle potential settlements in criminal and civil cases was first reported yesterday by The Wall Street Journal.
 ''These are extremely complex issues we're dealing with and it's just good litigation management to bring in that outside counsel to help us navigate,'' Mr. Beck said.
 For the last 18 months, Boeing has been under a criminal investigation and the Air Force has barred it from new rocket contracts. The actions occurred after Peter B. Teets, the Air Force under secretary, said the company had ''committed serious and substantial violations of federal law'' by obtaining thousands of pages of proprietary Lockheed documents on the rocket launch business. The matter is in the hands of federal prosecutors, although no criminal charges have been filed. 
 The Air Force also revoked $1 billion worth of scheduled Boeing rocket launches as a result of the case and awarded those contracts to Lockheed, which filed a civil suit charging Boeing with practicing ''economic espionage.'' Boeing denies the accusation.
 Another continuing investigation involves Boeing's central role in the Pentagon's biggest weapons procurement scandal since the 1980's.
 Michael M. Sears, Boeing's chief financial officer until he was implicated in that case, is to be sentenced Feb. 18 in federal court in Alexandria, Va. He pleaded guilty to offering a job to the Air Force's chief weapons buyer, Darleen A. Druyun, while she was overseeing billions of dollars in Boeing contracts.
 Ms. Druyun said she favored Boeing with $5 billion worth of preferential contracts in exchange for hiring her in 2003. She is serving nine months in prison for conspiracy. The judge in the case has indicated that Mr. Sears might receive a six-month term. The Pentagon has started auditing Boeing work approved by Ms. Druyun and has already found a $10.3 million overcharge on a contract to upgrade NATO surveillance aircraft.
 One of Boeing's biggest critics in Washington, Senator John McCain, Republican of Arizona, is expected to intensify his war of words against the company after Congress reconvenes. Mr. McCain, a member of the Senate Armed Services Committee, helped kill a $23 billion Air Force plan to lease Boeing aircraft tankers after Ms. Druyun admitted she had fixed a higher price on the contract as a gift to Boeing.
 This year the committee is likely to examine Boeing's role as the lead contractor on the Army's $127 billion program to build a fighting force called the future combat systems. The size and complexity of the contract is beginning to draw attention on Capitol Hill.
 The Army is expected to seek more than $3 billion in new research and development funds for the program in the Pentagon budget, to be released next week. Mr. Beck, the Boeing spokesman, said that the program was proceeding smoothly.

HEADLINE: Shares Lower as Wall StreetAwaits Data on Jobs Today

BYLINE: By The Associated Press

 BODY:
Investors disappointed with slim productivity gains from American workers and lower-than-expected earnings from Amazon.com pushed stocks down yesterday, ending three days of gains on Wall Street.
 The losses, for the most part, were minimal, an encouraging sign after a difficult January. Analysts said that most investors simply sat out trading while waiting for today's report from the Labor Department on January employment, an important vantage point on the prospects for economic activity. 
 But the Amazon earnings report dragged technology stocks down. ''Today's trading is overwhelmed by Amazon.com,'' said Arthur Hogan, chief market analyst at Jefferies & Company.
 The Dow Jones industrial average was barely lower, closing down 3.69 points, or 0.03 percent, at 10,593.10. The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index declined 3.3 points, or 0.28 percent, to 1,189.89. The technology-focused Nasdaq composite index dropped 17.42 points, or 0.84 percent, to 2,057.64. And the Russell 2000 index of smaller-capitalization companies closed down 2.66 points, or 0.42 percent, at 629.32.
 On the New York Stock Exchange, declining issues outnumbered those advancing, 8 to 7. Volume fell to 1.56 billion shares from 1.61 billion on Wednesday.
 The Labor Department reported that productivity, or output for each worker, rose at an annual pace of just 0.8 percent in the last three months of 2004 -- the smallest quarterly increase in almost three years.
 The Institute for Supply Management's index for the service sector for January was 59.2, down from 63.9 the previous month and lower than expectations. Readings above 50 indicate growth in services.
 Philip Dow, managing director of equity strategy at RBC Dain Rauscher in Minneapolis, said the day's news was not too bad, given an otherwise fairly strong economy. ''It's hard to cast the news we've seen recently with regards to the economy and earnings as negative,'' he said.
 Mr. Dow said he was surprised that investors were not focusing more on strong January sales reported by retailers yesterday, generally surpassing expectations.
 But at Amazon, the online retailer, higher costs offset holiday sales gains. Its shares tumbled $6.13, or 14.6 percent, to $35.75, after the company fell short of Wall Street earnings expectations by 5 cents a share.
 Higher sales did not help Starbucks, either. The company said sales at shops open at least a year rose 7 percent in January, but analysts surveyed by Thomson First Call had expected slightly faster growth. Shares of Starbucks skidded $4.43, or 8.2 percent, to $49.57.
 The new wave of corporate mergers and merger talks affected some telecommunications stocks. MCI rose 47 cents, to $20.15, after news reports said that Qwest Communications International might bid for the company, formerly known as WorldCom. Qwest, a regional Bell company, climbed 20 cents, to $4.40. 
 CarMax rose $3.82, or nearly 13 percent, to $33.35, after strong sales at the big auto retailer led to a quarterly profit forecast well above analysts' forecasts.
 Among leading technology issues, Cisco Systems fell 63 cents, to $17.52, in trading of more than 85 million shares. 
 In the bond market, the benchmark 10-year Treasury note lost 5/32, to settle at 100 22/32. The note's yield, which moves in the opposite direction from the price, rose to 4.16 percent from 4.14 percent Wednesday.

HEADLINE: Ebbers Is Gone, And Forgotten, In Hometown

BYLINE: By BARNABY J. FEDER

DATELINE: JACKSON, Miss., Jan. 28 

 BODY:
Here in central Mississippi, where Bernard J. Ebbers gained celebrity status during the 1980's and 1990's by knitting scores of companies into WorldCom, a global telecommunications giant, the prosecution of Mr. Ebbers on federal conspiracy and securities fraud charges for his role in WorldCom's bankruptcy in 2002 has been daily front-page news.
 It seems unlikely readers will be begging the local papers to keep it up.
 It is certainly true that plenty of people are watching to see how Mr. Ebbers fares as the trial progresses to an expected verdict in March. But evidence is scant that many of them care deeply about the outcome. 
 ''No one's talking about it,'' said Charles Gibson, a lawyer who represented several hundred local WorldCom investors in lawsuits that were swept aside by the company's bankruptcy filing. ''People have licked their wounds and moved on.''
 Some have even founded new telecommunications ventures. Air2Lan, founded by the former top managers of SkyTel, a paging company acquired by WorldCom in 1999, is developing wireless broadband networks across the Southeast. Source One Video is a two-year-old venture that provides streaming video equipment and software, like systems that allow parents to monitor their children in a day care center.
 ''The talent available is phenomenal,'' said Heidi L. Herbert, a former WorldCom executive who became chief executive of Source One in June 2002 and has since hired a number of former colleagues. ''I'm too swamped with my company to look into Ebbers's trial.'' 
 Not looking is quite a bit harder for some Mississippians who have been notified that they may be called to New York as witnesses in the trial. C. Scott Hamilton, who was head of investor relations at WorldCom and is communications director for the Mississippi Development Authority, said that he was on the witness list but had not been told if or when he would have to go to New York.
 ''I wish it was on Court TV every day, although I'm not sure the prosecutors would let me watch it,'' Mr. Hamilton said.
 Still, opinions abound about the case even among those not paying close attention. Mr. Ebbers, 63, is a charismatic 6-foot-4 native of Canada who put down deep roots after coming here in the 1960's to play basketball at Mississippi College, a Baptist college in nearby Clinton. A high school coach and hotel operator before becoming a telecommunications entrepreneur, Mr. Ebbers's story is so widely known here that it is easy to come by people who have already decided how it should end. 
 Some say, but only on condition of anonymity, that Mr. Ebbers has ''destroyed the lives'' of people who trusted him and that the maximum jail time of 85 years and financial penalties, including fines and restitution orders, that he faces are far too kind. 
 But many say they are convinced that the mastermind of the fraud was Scott D. Sullivan, WorldCom's former chief financial officer, who has pleaded guilty to charges in the case and is expected to be the government's major witness against Mr. Ebbers.
 ''His close acquaintances don't think Bernie committed a crime,'' said William Waller, a former Mississippi governor who had worked with Mr. Ebbers on charitable activities. ''He may have been guilty of negligence.''
 Many Mississippians feel removed from the fate of Mr. Ebbers partly because the trial is in New York, which contrasts sharply with the fraud case against Richard M. Scrushy, the former chief executive of HealthSouth, which is being tried in his company's hometown of Birmingham, Ala. 
 In addition, Mr. Ebbers, who had been highly visible during WorldCom's growth years both here and in Brookhaven, the small town 45 minutes south of here where he lives, has been increasingly reclusive. He stopped going to the local barber shop more than a year ago, and quit sitting down in the dining area of the Shell station near his home to eat the fried chicken he often picked up on the way home from church, according to several local residents. 
 Brookhaven residents also said that he had stopped teaching Sunday school at the Easthaven Baptist Church, often referred to as ''the church Bernie built'' because of donations locally reported to be close to $1 million. A church official said that none of the staff would comment. 
 The trial also happens to be unfolding at a time when newer, albeit more local, financial scandals are competing for attention. Last week, Mr. Ebbers shared the front page of The Clarion-Ledger newspaper with the latest twist in a suburban land deal based on a fraudulent appraisal and a report that the F.B.I. had joined the state's investigation into the abrupt shutdown in November of a new beef processing plant built with $54 million in state subsidies. State legislators are also battling over how to cope with a huge Medicaid deficit that affects health coverage for 25 percent of Mississippians.
 Even before the trial, WorldCom had faded as a topic of conversation with the passing of fears that its woes might deal a harsh economic blow, not just to individuals who lost investments, jobs or pensions, but to the entire region. Michael D. Capellas, who became chairman and chief executive in late 2002, renamed the company MCI after its largest subsidiary and moved its headquarters to Ashburn, Va. But employment here and at the suburban campus in nearby Clinton that had been WorldCom's headquarters since 1998 appears to have stabilized at about 850.
 The new employment levels leave the three-building Clinton campus roughly two-thirds empty and represent the loss of more than 2,100 jobs from the company's peak employment in the region at the beginning of 2001. In the meantime, other companies have been expanding. Nissan, which opened an auto assembly plant just north of here in Canton in 2003, employs 4,200 workers and an additional 1,900 contractors, according to Mr. Hamilton of the Mississippi Development Authority. 
 Rosemary Aultman, mayor of Clinton, conceded that the town suffered a blow to local pride in losing its status as home to a Fortune 500 company -- the only one in Mississippi. But the official move of what is now MCI to suburban Washington has not halted the steady rise in Clinton's population, now close to 25,000, or in its tax receipts.
 The decline in the personal fortune of Mr. Ebbers has already been felt in some quarters. The local hockey team, the Jackson Bandits, in which Mr. Ebbers shared majority control with J.L. Holloway, a local businessman, folded in 2003. 
 Some beneficiaries of his largess decline to associate with him. Mississippi College, for example, where Mr. Ebbers served on the board and led a fund-raising campaign that brought $100 million to the school, not only declined to discuss the projects enabled by his support, but said it had closed its campus to all reporters. 
 As time has passed, locals are also reassessing what WorldCom actually brought to the region. Mr. Hamilton, the former investor relations director at WorldCom, said that although the company had a reputation for being a leader in a high-technology industry, most of the operations and entrepreneurs who generated that reputation were based elsewhere.
 ''The creativity there was mostly in accounting,'' Mr. Hamilton said wryly.

PERSON: Wayne Smith

HEADLINE: Host, Salesman, Adviser and Mayor

BYLINE: By DAMIEN CAVE

DATELINE: IRVINGTON, N.J. 

 BODY:
MAYOR Wayne Smith admits that the rat removal program he started last year attracted bad publicity to a township already notorious for urban decay. And last summer, when residents marched to protest the gang-related slayings of seven teenagers, the mayor acknowledged the scope of the violence and walked quietly alongside his constituents. 
 ''We try to tackle problems head-on,'' Mr. Smith said, sitting in a conference room at the town's municipal headquarters, where the paint was chipping from the windowpanes. ''Smoke and mirrors don't really work. People are not stupid.'' 
 Perhaps not. 
 But among mayors of struggling municipalities, Mr. Smith's direct approach is about as common as a summer snowstorm. Even if the candor reflects insights gained from Mr. Smith's other job, as the owner of a public relations firm, it contrasts sharply with the style of his predecessor as mayor, Sara B. Bost. She bragged about civic accomplishments and then was indicted in 2002 on corruption charges. She pleaded guilty to a single witness-tampering charge. 
 Mr. Smith's straight-shooter tendencies also won praise from Bill Cosby, who had been lecturing African-American parents to get more involved with their children. He sought Mayor Smith out and spoke in Irvington last October. 
 His most significant achievement, however, might be financial. The town, a suburb of Newark, recently graduated from New Jersey's distressed cities program, in which the state oversaw Irvington's hiring and spending. For the first time since 1999, the town, with its 60,000 residents, is financially on its own. 
 Mr. Smith, ever frank -- a trait he says he picked up from reading autobiographies by everyone from Donald Trump to Ronald V. Dellums, the former congressman from California -- seems slightly ambivalent about the newfound independence. He calls it a major accomplishment, but also a challenge. When Irvington was a part of the distressed city program it got millions of dollars in extra state aid. Now, with its financial books in order, that help is gone. 
 Mr. Smith, a Democrat, likens it to a shift that he has witnessed in many black neighborhoods. ''When I grew up poor in Newark, our parents were in a community that encouraged us to advance,'' he said. His father, a factory worker, and his mother, a cook, separated when Mr. Smith was 7 and divorced when he was 13. People outside his family -- a coach here, a neighbor there -- often picked up the slack.
 ''Everyone encouraged us to advance to a new level,'' Mr. Smith said. ''There was a sense of striving. We don't see that as much anymore.'' 
 Mr. Smith, 47, got his political start in 1990 when he was hired as chief of staff for Michael G. Steele, then Irvington's mayor. He won a seat on the City Council in 1996 and six years later beat Assemblyman Craig Stanley by fewer than 100 votes to become mayor. 
 HIS office, with ''Walk in'' painted on the door, is one of the few things he tries to hide from public view. It contains a desk strewn with books, a photograph of his mother and at least two gym bags. An avid basketball fan, he strolls through City Hall with a deliberate stride, mulling which department needs attention. 
 His decisions tend to be quick. During his first week as mayor, a developer wanted to tear down a condemned building, but no process existed for permits, street closings or the other details necessary to make it happen. A member of his staff called him to say that the demolition would be delayed. 
 ''So I told them, 'You all go back out there and work with this guy,''' he said, recalling the trouble. '''Get the police, cordon off the street. Just don't delay this guy.'''
 The staff member complied. Two years later, about 50 buildings have been demolished, most of them abandoned multifamily homes. 
 The demolitions have sparked new development, injecting vitality and money into the town. Mr. Smith now spends much of his time with would-be builders, as he did on a recent afternoon: one man, a Newark restaurant owner, wanted a permit to build three two-family homes; others sought permits for businesses.
 With each suitor, Mr. Smith played the cordial host and knowledgeable salesman. After an Irvington official needled the Newark restaurant owner because he did not plan to also open a restaurant, the mayor came to his defense. ''He's building customers first,'' he said. 
 Mr. Smith counseled another man hoping to open a convenience store that the building code required that a heater be added to his design. Doing so, the mayor told him, would speed up the permit process. 
 ''We want to get you going,'' he told the man. ''We want to get that corner up and running. We want to help you make some money.''
 Construction is to begin soon on two auto parts stores, a delicatessen, and several new apartment buildings, Mr. Smith said. Property values are up at least 22 percent since 2003. Financing for at least one project, a strip mall and day care center, came from an unusual source, Lagos, Nigeria, which became Irvington's sister city after a Nigerian prince worked as an intern in Mr. Smith's office. 
 ''Usually government is about saying 'no, this won't work,''' Mr. Smith said. ''We're trying to help people through the process.''
 Violent crime, which Mr. Smith believes is partly rooted in drugs and unemployment, has proven more intractable. Irvington had 26 murders in 2004, making it, per capita, one of the state's most dangerous communities. In 2002, Mr. Smith helped create an anticrime partnership that included the local police department, the state police and other law enforcement agencies. His goal this year is to get more churches involved with troubled youth. 
 ''Sometimes it's like pushing a rock uphill,'' he said. ''But we're getting there.''

HEADLINE: BUSH, ON ROAD, PUSHES WARNING ON RETIREMENT

BYLINE: By RICHARD W. STEVENSON

DATELINE: GREAT FALLS, Mont., Feb. 3 

 BODY:
President Bush took his proposal for a new Social Security system on the road on Thursday with a stark warning to younger workers that the retirement program will go ''bust'' within four decades if it is not overhauled and with a call for his supporters to demand action from Congress.
 But a day after he made overhauling Social Security the centerpiece of his State of the Union address, Mr. Bush ran into a brick wall of opposition from Democrats in Washington and skepticism even from influential members of his own party in Congress, leaving him facing perhaps the toughest and highest-stakes legislative battle of his presidency.
 Mr. Bush made some gestures to bipartisanship as he traveled to Montana and North Dakota on the first day of a two-day, five-state swing intended to impress on voters and members of Congress a need for action this year on Social Security. But he showed no signs of backing down, even as he prepared to plunge into another partisan battle next week, over his call for a new effort to hold down government spending and cut or eliminate scores of domestic programs. 
 ''I've heard all of the complaints -- and you'll hear a lot more -- how this is going to ruin Social Security,'' he said at his first stop, in Fargo, N.D. ''Forget it, it's going to make it stronger.'' 
 At a later stop here he said, ''This is doable. It's just going to take some political will.''
 In sketching out in his State of the Union address how he envisioned a new system working, Mr. Bush was trying to jump-start negotiations with Congress, reassure Republicans that he would give them political cover and win over at least a few Democrats, his aides and advisers said.
 But the response from within both parties on Thursday suggested that Republicans did not feel much safer politically and that Democrats had been emboldened to fight back. And it highlighted the difficulty Mr. Bush faces as he puts his political fortunes on the line in an effort to reshape an immensely popular and successful program whose problems, despite the dire picture he painted, are not projected to become acute for years.
 He tried to clarify his approach. Responding to questions from the audience here, he told the mother of a mentally retarded adult daughter that there would be no change to the disability portion of the system. 
 But as economists and elected officials pored over what details were available of the president's approach to establishing individual investment accounts and ensuring Social Security's financial health for the long term, the White House still had not answered fundamental questions. 
 Mr. Bush did not address whether or how the nation could afford to borrow the trillions of dollars that would be necessary over the next few decades to set up the accounts at a time of historically high levels of government and personal indebtedness. The White House has said its plan to phase in private accounts starting in 2009 would require more than $750 billion in additional government borrowing by 2015, and analysts said that in the decade after 2015, with the accounts fully up and running, the additional borrowing would run into the trillions of dollars.
 And although Mr. Bush repeated that raising the retirement age and other ways of cutting benefits would have to be part of the debate over how to meet his goal of making the system permanently able to pay all promised benefits, he provided no sense of which ones the administration might be willing to embrace. Over the next 75 years, the system faces a $3.7 trillion gap between what it can afford to pay and what current law promises to future retirees, and the establishment of personal accounts by itself would do nothing to eliminate that shortfall.
 Still, Mr. Bush got a rapturous reception from a carefully screened crowd of ticket holders at his first stop of the day, in North Dakota, a state he won easily in November. 
 Flanked by people selected by the White House to bolster his argument and charts illustrating Social Security's problems, Mr. Bush sought to reassure one powerful constituency -- the elderly and people approaching retirement -- that nothing would change for them and that they would get all the benefits promised to them.
 For everyone else, he extolled the benefits of individual accounts as a way to build wealth for retirement. He went on to paint a bleak picture of the costs of inaction for younger workers, the group he is most counting on to give him the popular backing he needs to persuade Congress to join him in making the first fundamental changes to Social Security since it was created in 1935. 
 ''She's fine,'' he said, referring to Mary Bond, a 60-year-old woman who was on stage to discuss the issue with him at his first stop. Then he pointed to a group of college-age people in the audience at North Dakota State University and told them they were ''not fine.''
 ''You got a problem,'' he said. 
 He went on to urge younger workers to tell Congress of the need to act now, saying that Social Security would be ''broke'' by 2042.
 Mr. Bush's critics have accused him of deliberately exaggerating the threat to the current Social Security system by using phrases like ''broke,'' ''bust'' and ''bankruptcy.''
 Social Security's actuaries project that the system will begin paying out more in benefits than it takes in through payroll taxes starting in 2018. Until 2042, under the projections, the system would be able to pay all the benefits promised under current law by drawing on its trust fund of government bonds.
 After that, it would be able to pay around three-quarters of the benefits promised by current law.
 But the fight is as much about the ideological struggle over the relative roles of government and market forces as it is about money.
 Interest groups have begun lobbying campaigns. David Certner, the chief lobbyist for AARP, the 35-million-member organization of middle-aged and older Americans that is going all out to block the plan, said his members had made hundreds of thousands of contacts by telephone and e-mail with lawmakers.
 USA Next, an organization that was instrumental in supporting Mr. Bush's Medicare plan, is planning full-scale combat with AARP. ''We are going head to head to defeat AARP on this,'' said Charles W. Jarvis, the group's chairman.
 In traveling to North Dakota and Montana, Mr. Bush chose two states that he carried by large margins but that have Democratic senators -- two in the case of North Dakota and one from Montana -- who the White House thinks might be susceptible to pressure for a deal. 
 One of those Democrats, Kent Conrad of North Dakota, flew in from Washington on Air Force One with the president, and afterward sounded more open to a deal with the White House than the Democratic leaders in the House and Senate have been, but only if Mr. Bush is willing to change his approach substantially. 
 Mr. Conrad said there was a ''kernel of a good idea in individual accounts.'' 
 ''But,'' he said, ''I don't think it's a good idea if it's financed by massive borrowing, and I don't think it's a good idea if it's financed by a cut in benefits.''

HEADLINE: Refiguring Social Security Plan: Economists Add Their Numbers

BYLINE: By DAVID E. ROSENBAUM

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Feb. 3 

 BODY:
Morning-after scrutiny of the bold Social Security plan President Bush outlined in his State of the Union address on Wednesday night turned up details that were not immediately apparent.
 The president said that in 2018 the system would begin paying out more in benefits than it was receiving in taxes. By 2027, he said, the shortfall would be $200 billion. By 2033, he said, it would be $300 billion. 
 Here is what he did not say, according to calculations by Jason Furman, an economist who worked on Senator John Kerry's presidential campaign: Under Mr. Bush's plan, Social Security benefits would begin to exceed tax revenue six years earlier, in 2012. 
 That is because some tax money would go not into Social Security, but into workers' individual investment accounts.
 On the benefits-revenues gaps of $200 billion in 2027 and $300 billion in 2033, the differences would actually be considerably larger: $300 billion in 2027 and $400 billion in 2033. 
 Mr. Furman also figured that assuming that the tax cuts of 2001 and 2003 became permanent, their cost in lost revenue would also exceed the Social Security shortfall. The cuts would cost $344 billion in 2027 and $377 billion in 2033.
 Mr. Bush's plan would not start until 2009. Asked the reason for the four-year delay, a senior administration official who explained the proposal to reporters said, ''We spent a lot of time going over the administrative aspects of setting up the accounts, and that seemed to us a realistic schedule for getting people into the accounts.''
 Skeptics suggested another possible reason. The administration makes economic projections just 10 years in advance, so forecasts are available up to 2015. 
 By not starting until 2009 and figuring the cost for six years, the administration was able to say the cost in the next 10 years would be $754 billion.
 If another year or two had been counted, the administration might have had to show the cost and, thus, the increase in the budget deficit to be more than $1 trillion, a round number that could have provided a bull's-eye for opponents to aim at.
 An economist who worked in the Clinton administration, Peter R. Orszag, calculated that in the first 10 years of Mr. Bush's plan, it would cost more than $1 trillion and that in the second 10 years, it would cost more than $3.5 trillion, all of which would have to be borrowed.

HEADLINE: Carbon Monoxide From Heater Kills Georgia Premier

BYLINE: By STEVEN LEE MYERS

DATELINE: MOSCOW, Feb. 3 

 BODY:
Prime Minister Zurab Zhvania of Georgia, a youthful reformer and ally of President Mikhail Saakashvili, died early Thursday in what officials described as a bizarre but accidental poisoning.
 Mr. Zhvania, 41, was asphyxiated by carbon monoxide apparently released by a space heater in an apartment in Georgia's capital, Tbilisi, that belonged to a political acquaintance, Raul Usupov, the officials said. Mr. Usupov, 25, a deputy governor from the Kvemo Kartli region, also died. 
 Mr. Zhvania's death unsettled the country's politicians and raised questions about Mr. Saakashvili's efforts to push through economic and political reforms in the turbulent and impoverished country without one of his most influential and popular aides.
 ''Georgia has lost a great patriot,'' Mr. Saakashvili said at a meeting of government ministers, according to a transcript provided by his office. He added, ''I have lost my closest friend, most trusted adviser and greatest ally.''
 Mr. Saakashvili later announced that he would assume the duties of prime minister as well as president, though it is unclear for how long. By law he has a week to announce a replacement.
 The interior minister, Nano Merabishvili, said at a news conference that Mr. Zhvania had arrived at Mr. Usupov's apartment around midnight on Wednesday, according to news reports from Tbilisi. Some four hours later, after he did not respond to phone calls, his guards broke in and found him slumped in a chair. Mr. Usupov was found in the kitchen. There was no indication of violence or foul play, he said.
 ''It all happened suddenly,'' Mr. Merabishvili said, calling the deaths a ''tragic accident.''
 The circumstances nonetheless gave birth to rumors and conspiracy theories, despite the official version.
 A member of Parliament, Alexander Shalamberidze, insinuated that Mr. Zhvania's death was part of a plot, orchestrated by ''certain forces'' in Russia, that included the bombing of a police station in the city of Gori that killed 3 and wounded more than 20 earlier this week. His statement prompted a pointed protest from Russia's foreign minister, Sergey V. Lavrov.
 A backgammon board was lying open on a table near an Iranian-made gas heater. Portable gas or wood-burning heaters are common in Georgia, where central heating is scarce, even in the capital. The official Russian Information Agency reported that 45 Georgians had died of carbon monoxide poisoning in the last three years.
 Guram Donadze, a spokesman for the Interior Ministry, said the heater was installed two days ago and appeared to work properly. It seemed, though, that the room lacked proper ventilation. ''There are many rumors, suspicions, various versions,'' Mr. Donadze said in a telephone interview. ''However, what actually happened was gas poisoning -- nothing else.''
 Mr. Zhvania was one of the leaders of the popular uprising in the fall of 2003 that toppled President Eduard A. Shevardnadze and swept Mr. Saakashvili to the presidency. He became prime minister barely a year ago and was a driving force in many of Mr. Saakashvili's efforts to establish order in the country's economy, government and foreign policy.
 Like Mr. Saakashvili, he was once allied with Mr. Shevardnadze, but broke with him and became an opposition leader, though one considered more temperate than Mr. Saakashvili, who is 37. He often acted as a mediator in Georgia's tense disputes with two breakaway regions, Abkhazia and South Ossetia, and the country that offers them succor, Russia.
 The European Union's foreign policy chief, Javier Solana, said in a statement that Mr. Zhvania had ''played a pivotal role in consolidating the political life in Georgia and placing the country on the road to democracy.'' President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia, whose relations with Georgia have cooled under Mr. Saakashvili's presidency, expressed condolences in a statement that called Mr. Zhvania ''a champion'' of friendly relations between the countries.
 Mr. Zhvania, a biologist by education who joined the country's Green Party in the 1980's, is survived by his wife and three children. He went on to become a chairman of the newly independent country's Parliament in 1995, a post he held until 2001. He has been credited with recruiting Mr. Saakashvili into politics.
 Alexander Rondeli, president of the Georgian Foundation for Strategic and International Studies, said Mr. Zhvania's death would not be likely to alter Mr. Saakashvili's policies but would complicate his ability to govern.
 ''He was, I would say, the most important person, the most important adviser of the president,'' Mr. Rondeli said in an interview. ''He was in charge of the economy, of investment. At the same time, he was very active in foreign affairs. It is a big loss for the president personally.''

HEADLINE: Bush Officials Spell Out Cuts in Money for Housing

BYLINE: By ROBERT PEAR

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Feb. 3 

 BODY:
Facing the prospect of record deficits, Bush administration officials laid out proposals on Thursday for deep cuts in spending on housing and community development.
 At the same time, the nation's top health official fleshed out proposals to cut $60 billion from the projected growth of Medicaid, the federal-state health program for low-income people, in the next decade. 
 But the official, Michael O. Leavitt, the new secretary of health and human services, said 12 million to 14 million people could gain health insurance if Congress approved President Bush's proposals to provide tax credits for such coverage and helped small businesses band together to buy coverage.
 Donald L. Evans, the commerce secretary, and Alphonso R. Jackson, the secretary of housing and urban development, said Mr. Bush wanted to consolidate 18 local assistance programs scattered among five departments into one new grant program, to be run by the Commerce Department. 
 The government is now spending more than $5.6 billion a year on the 18 programs, which include the Community Development Block Grant, a lifeline for many impoverished urban neighborhoods. For the new program, Mr. Bush will request $3.7 billion, a cut of about 33 percent.
 ''The current system forces communities to navigate a maze of federal departments, agencies and programs, each imposing a separate set of standards and reporting requirements,'' Mr. Jackson said. The programs, he said, ''duplicate and overlap one another and have different eligibility criteria,'' with little accountability for the way money is used.
 But Jim Hunt, a city councilman in Clarksburg, W.Va., who is first vice president of the National League of Cities, said the president's proposal would have ''a dire negative impact on cities of all sizes.'' For three decades, Mr. Hunt said, cities have used the federal money to create jobs, stimulate private investment and revitalize distressed communities.
 Sherry Conway Appel, a spokeswoman for the league, said, ''We want the Community Development Block Grant to remain a separate and distinct program,'' with no reduction in its budget.
 Don Plusquellic, the mayor of Akron, Ohio, who is president of the United States Conference of Mayors, said: ''The new proposal in unconscionable. It will cut programs that help the poorest and the neediest.'' 
 Mr. Plusquellic, a Democrat who has led his city for 18 years, said the reshuffling of federal programs obscured the likely effects. ''It would be more honest if the federal government simply said, 'We don't care about these poor people,''' he said.
 A summary of the proposal, prepared by the White House Office of Management and Budget, says Mr. Bush believes that communities must not ''rely on perpetual federal assistance.''
 The Department of Housing and Urban Development, which now runs the Community Development Block Grant, said the program provided $393 million this year to New York State, including $207 million for New York City, $17.6 million for Nassau County and $10.9 million for Rochester. New Jersey gets $113 million, and Connecticut $46.6 million. 
 Under the same program, Chicago is receiving a grant of $95.5 million, while Los Angeles is getting $82.8 million and Houston is getting $34.2 million, the department said.
 The proposal could face bipartisan resistance in Congress, because lawmakers take pride in earmarking some of the money for hometown projects.
 Bush administration officials said the community development program was poorly focused. Eligibility for the new grant program will be based on factors like poverty and unemployment levels.
 Among the programs that would be folded into the new initiative is the Community Services Block Grant, which helps pay for community action agencies begun more than 35 years ago as part of what was called the war on poverty. These agencies provide a wide range of housing, nutrition, education and employment services to low-income people.
 Mr. Bush said in his State of the Union address on Wednesday that his budget, to be unveiled on Monday, would reduce or eliminate more than 150 government programs. White House officials said the new blueprint for federal spending would be the tightest budget since Mr. Bush took office in 2001.
 Other programs to be consolidated under the president's plan include urban and rural empowerment zones, a program to foster development of contaminated industrial sites and a pot of money known as the Community Development Financial Institutions Fund, run by the Treasury.
 The White House predicted last week that the federal budget deficit would rise to $427 billion this year, from $412 billion last year. If Congress adopts his proposals, Mr. Bush says, the deficit will be less than $260 billion in 2009.
 Mr. Leavitt, the health secretary, said the president's budget would crack down on the ability of middle-income families to get Medicaid coverage for nursing home costs, which average more than $55,000 a year.

HEADLINE: Rice Says U.S. Won't Aid Europe On Plans for Incentives to Iran

BYLINE: This article is by Steven R. Weisman, Elaine Sciolino and David E. Sanger.; Steven R. Weisman reported from London for this article, Elaine Sciolino from Paris and David E. Sanger from Washington.

DATELINE: LONDON, Feb. 3 

 BODY:
Less than a day after President Bush declared he was ''working with European allies'' to persuade Iran to give up its nuclear program, Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice said the United States would continue to rebuff European requests to participate directly in offering incentives for Iran to drop what is suspected of being a nuclear arms program.
 Opening her first overseas trip as secretary, Ms. Rice also declared that the Tehran government's record on human rights was ''something to be loathed'' -- a harsh comment that comes at a time when many European leaders have asked the United States to help lower tensions with Iran.
 ''I don't think anybody thinks that the unelected mullahs who run that regime are a good thing for the Iranian people or for the region,'' Ms. Rice said to reporters on her plane to London. ''I think our European allies agree that the Iranian regime's human rights behavior and its behavior toward its own population is something to be loathed.'' 
 Ms. Rice made her remarks as the Iranians, the Europeans and many in Washington were dissecting Mr. Bush's comments about Iran -- and far gentler words about Saudi Arabia and Egypt -- in his State of the Union address on Wednesday night. In the address, Mr. Bush seemed to invite the people of Iran to liberate themselves from their clerical rulers, for the first time matching a specific nation to his Inauguration Day call for an end to tyranny around the world.
 But he also sounded willing to support the Europeans in their initiative to negotiate an end to a key part of Iran's nuclear program.
 ''Today, Iran remains the world's primary state sponsor of terror, pursuing nuclear weapons while depriving its people of the freedom they seek and deserve,'' Mr. Bush said. ''We are working with European allies to make clear to the Iranian regime that it must give up its uranium enrichment program and any plutonium reprocessing, and end its support for terror. And to the Iranian people, I say tonight: As you stand for your own liberty, America stands with you.''
 But he made no effort to urge the people of Egypt or Saudi Arabia to challenge their governments, even though both countries have turned aside Mr. Bush's past calls that they allow democratic forces to determine who will rule their governments. ''The government of Saudi Arabia can demonstrate its leadership in the region by expanding the role of its people in determining their future,'' he said in the speech, and Egypt ''can now show the way toward democracy in the Middle East.''
 In Washington on Thursday night, a senior administration official said the reason for the difference was simple. ''We do not have relations with the government of Iran, and it is not a government moving in the direction of giving its people greater participation in their affairs,'' the official said. ''If anything, they have cracked down on the opposition.'' 
 But the official argued that ''Egypt and Saudi Arabia are a contrast with Iran, because we do have good relations with those governments, and while they are not perfect they are nonetheless making steps toward greater participation.''
 The official, who was involved in the decisions leading up to the address, said Mr. Bush ''wanted to answer the question asked after his inaugural: What do you do with countries that are allies in the war on terror but need to do more?''
 In Iran on Thursday, the country's supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, predicted that Mr. Bush, like every other American president since Iran's 1979 revolution, would fail to overthrow the Islamic republic. 
 ''Bush is the fifth U.S. president who wants to destroy the Islamic republic,'' the ayatollah told university students. ''But he will fail as did Jimmy Carter, Reagan, Bush senior and Clinton.'' Branding the United States ''one of the heads of the dragon of world oppression,'' he charged that Mr. Bush had been installed in the White House by ''Zionist and non-Zionist companies and capitalists to serve their interests.''
 Mohammad Sadegh Kharazi, Iran's ambassador to Paris, said in an interview on Thursday that Iran should be rewarded, not punished, by the United States for supporting the democratic electoral process in Iraq. ''We were the only country in the region to fully support elections in Iraq,'' Mr. Kharazi said. ''And in return we get President Bush's negative body language. America just doesn't want to understand our reality. Is it fair? No.''
 Iran has also made clear, at least in its public statements, that it has no intention of trying to export an Islamic republic to Iraq.
 The questions about America's stance toward Iran coincide with fresh evidence that Iran may be violating the spirit, if not the exact terms, of its Nov. 15 agreement with France, Germany and Britain to temporarily freeze its program to enrich uranium. Enriched uranium can be used to produce energy or, at high enrichment levels, as fuel for nuclear weapons. 
 Last month, new negotiations began that could give Iran generous rewards on nuclear energy, trade and economic, political and security cooperation if it provides firm guarantees that it is not developing a nuclear weapon.
 But the three European countries have uncovered evidence that Iran is doing maintenance work on centrifuge piping at an enrichment plant at Natanz in southern Iran, according to a British official.
 The issue is regarded as serious enough that John Sawers, the senior British Foreign Office official involved in the negotiations, protested in meetings in Tehran on Wednesday with Iran's senior nuclear negotiator, Hassan Rowhani, and Foreign Minister Kamal Kharrazi, a British official said.
 The United States also has formally complained to the European negotiators about the issue, in a Jan. 28 letter from John Bolton, the under secretary of state for arms control and international security, the British official said. ''We are taking this issue extremely seriously,'' the official said. ''We are reminding Iran of its obligations.'' 
 But it is not at all clear that the Iranian action actually violates the accord.
 ''It's a bad sign that the first time Iran is supposed to do what it agreed to that it looks as if it is trying to get away with something,'' said David Albright, president of the Institute for Science and International Security, a nonpartisan arms control group in Washington. ''This is something that makes everyone nervous.''
 Each revelation about Iran's nuclear program, however mild, is likely to make the Bush administration more hesitant to embrace the European view that the way to curb Iran's nuclear program is with engagement, not threats.
 Mr. Bush has harshly criticized Iran's clerical rulers and, in the past, even suggested that he favored a change of government. In linking Iran with North Korea and Iraq as an ''axis of evil'' in his State of the Union address three years ago, he charged that Iran ''aggressively pursues'' weapons of mass destruction and exports terror ''while an unelected few repress the Iranian people's hope for freedom.''
 But the administration has left its policy on regime change deliberately ambiguous. While a former deputy secretary of state, Richard L. Armitage, had once said the administration did not favor regime change in Iran, Ms. Rice said on Thursday that ''what we support is that the Iranian people should have a chance to determine their own future.'' She said she hoped her trip would send ''a very clear message'' that Europe and the United States were united in their approach.
 But in tone and substance, her comments suggested that a wide rift remained; Europeans continue to complain that the Bush administration was overly confrontational. Some Europeans fear that the American approach could lead to eventual attacks on areas suspected of being Iranian nuclear sites. The foreign ministers of several European nations have recently begun to warn that without American participation in an incentive package for Iran, their efforts could founder.
 ''There has to be a sense that there will be a U.S. buy-in to the solution,'' John Bruton, the European Union's representative to the United States, told reporters earlier this week, adding that the administration was ''not engaged in the way we would like.''
 But Ms. Rice said Thursday: ''It's not the absence of anybody's involvement that is keeping the Iranians from knowing what they need to do. They need to live up to their obligations.''

HEADLINE: A Town's Older Residents Offer Praise (and Concern)

BYLINE: By JOHN M. BRODER

DATELINE: HEMET, Calif., Feb. 3 

 BODY:
President Bush's plan to remake Social Security elicits relief from Barbara Law, who lives in this town heavily stocked with retirees of modest income.
 ''I've been hearing for years now that Social Security was definitely headed for trouble, that it wouldn't be there when I was ready to retire,'' said Mrs. Law, a home health care nurse who is 59. ''Last night's speech took that fear away. It was a weight taken off my shoulders.'' 
 This area in the San Jacinto Valley, about 90 miles southeast of Los Angeles, is relatively poor, dotted with trailer parks and inexpensive retirement communities. Its desert air and cheap land attract many retirees for whom Social Security benefits are a substantial part of monthly income. 
 And interviews with about a dozen of those older residents found general approval for that aspect of Mr. Bush's plan that would leave unaffected anyone currently receiving Social Security benefits and all those now age 55 or over. 
 But many who were interviewed shared concern about the generations to come, expressing little faith that younger people, including their own children, would have the good sense or discipline to handle the private accounts of stock and bond funds that Mr. Bush is proposing for them.
 ''I worked around kids and young parents for 35 years,'' said Elmer Perez, 83, a retired public school maintenance worker who lives on his Social Security benefits and a small pension from a California teachers' union. ''They don't know anything about money. They live for today. They are not reliable.'' 
 Besides, Mr. Perez said, most workers should not risk any retirement savings in the stock market.
 ''I like something sure for that sort of thing,'' he said. ''If I want to gamble, I'll go to Las Vegas. And you know what happens there.''
 Mrs. Law said she wished that she and her husband, Bob, had had the opportunity to invest part of their Social Security taxes in the financial markets over the last 30 years. But she is not so certain that her children, who are in their 30's and 40's, will plan wisely for their retirement.
 ''The younger generation, they don't think anything of going out and spending $40 or $50 on a dinner or going to the gambling joints,'' she said in an interview at a table outside her prefabricated home in the Panorama Cove development for retirees. 
 ''It's going to have to be planned out so they don't just take out the money and spend it,'' she said, endorsing that provision of the president's proposal.
 Reaction here to Mr. Bush's plan did not seem to correlate with people's politics. Democrats and Republicans alike not only expressed concern about the private accounts but also said they were disappointed in policies that had led to what many perceived as a looming crisis in Social Security.
 Raymond Bush, who lives up the street from Mr. Perez in the Royal Holiday trailer complex, is a loyal Republican who voted twice for the president. But he said he was angry that ''them boys'' in Washington had drained the Social Security vault by using its assets for general government spending and were now, he said, covering their sins by trying to move workers into private accounts.
 ''I wouldn't want to be 40 years old and have someone tell me I have to put this money in the stock market,'' said Mr. Bush, a retired salesman for an industrial heater company who gave his age only as ''over 55.''
 ''If those government officials had kept their hands off it,'' he said, ''we wouldn't need to fix it. As far as I'm concerned, to put money in this market is like changing chairs on the Titanic.''
 His neighbor Gary Foley, 68, a retired law firm administrator who said he too voted for the president in both 2000 and 2004, has looked carefully at the sketchy details of the Bush plan, and largely approves. While Mr. Foley is certain it will not mean a windfall for younger workers, ''it has the possibility,'' he said, ''of saving some of the burden taxpayers would have to endure if we don't do anything.''
 Mr. Foley said he believed projections that show the Social Security trust fund headed for deep trouble around 2040. He said that it made sense to make changes now to avoid a collapse later and that the president's plan was as good as any other he had heard.
 ''If you have any faith in the stock market and the American economy, you have to give it a chance,'' he said. ''I guess I'm one of the optimists.''

HEADLINE: Hope, Fear and the State of Social Security

 BODY:

To the Editor:
 Re ''Mr. Bush's Two Big Ideas'' (editorial, Feb. 3):
 President Bush's State of the Union address was the first time many Americans heard some of the basic truths about the Social Security program: how many workers once financed each retired person (16 to 1), where it is now (3 to 1), where it is headed (2 to 1) and when its cash flow goes negative (2018). All those are facts as the program is currently structured. 
 Of course we can keep raising the tax rate on employer and employee, raising the taxable wage base and raising the retirement age, but all these do is add a few years to the predictable outcome at the cost of economic sluggishness. 
 When you see a head-on train wreck coming, and you control the track switches, it isn't O.K. to sit around and let it happen -- you're supposed to throw the switch and divert one train so the other can pass. That is what the president is challenging Congress to do. 
 Now that this has gotten its first airing, everybody has a chance to contemplate facts, not just rhetoric.

HEADLINE: Honda Urges Toughening Of Fuel-Economy Rules

BYLINE: By DANNY HAKIM

DATELINE: DETROIT, Feb. 4 

 BODY:
Honda Motor urged the federal government on Friday to impose tougher fuel- economy regulations, an unheard- of request from an automaker. 
 The request was meant as a gesture to environmental groups after the Thursday decision by Honda and Nissan to join an industry lawsuit against California, which is seeking to regulate the emissions from cars and trucks of gases that are said to worsen global warming. 
Most other automakers have already sued the state to block what would be the first such effort in the nation. 
 ''Honda is taking one step forward and one step back,'' said Daniel Becker, the top global warming strategist at the Sierra Club. ''They are recognizing the need for cleaner cars, but it is unfortunate they are joining the retrograde caucus of automakers in opposing California's effort to require cleaner cars.''
 Honda has long been the most independent automaker on environmental policy and has not joined Toyota and the Big Three domestic automakers in many lobbying efforts against tougher fuel economy rules. But several environmentalists who follow the industry said they could not recall any company actually asking to tighten fuel economy regulations. 
 Honda officials would not say how much of a gas mileage increase they would support. They said that they made the statement to show they did support regulating greenhouse gas emissions, which are closely tied to fuel consumption, while they also object to action being taken by states. 
 ''We are not seeking to block greenhouse gas standards,'' said Ed Cohen, Honda's vice president for governmental affairs. ''We simply are wanting to be sure it's addressed in the correct forum.''

Pfizer Says Internal Studies Showed No Celebrex Risks
Pfizer has told federal regulators that the company's analysis of 41 of its patient trials of the arthritis and pain drug Celebrex found no evidence that the drug increases the risk of heart problems.
 The analysis is one of many documents that the Food and Drug Administration released ahead of hearings at which the agency will assess the safety records of Celebrex and similar drugs. The Pfizer analysis covered tests involving 44,000 patients but did not include results from studies conducted by independent researchers or those at other drug makers. [Page C2.]

Court Victory for Tobacco Industry
A federal appeals court delivered a victory to the nation's leading tobacco companies, ruling that the government cannot force them to turn over $280 billion in profits if a trial court finds the companies engaged in a conspiracy of fraud and deceit to promote smoking. [A1.]

Profit Jumps 47% at Matsushita
Matsushita Electric Industrial, the world's largest consumer electronics maker, said profit jumped 47 percent last quarter on demand for flat-panel TV's and DVD recorders. Matsushita, the maker of Panasonic products, said strong sales of the products, along with digital cameras, more than offset dwindling sales of VCR's and stereos. Matsushita's strong profit growth made it a standout among its Japanese peers. [C3.]

At the Top, Assistants Are Pricey
After this week's disclosure that the personal assistant for Richard A.

HEADLINE: Navy Carrier That Helped Tsunami Victims Leaves Aceh

BYLINE: By JANE PERLEZ

DATELINE: JAKARTA, Indonesia, Feb. 4 

 BODY:
The United States aircraft carrier that provided the base for dozens of daily helicopter flights carrying food and water to tsunami victims in Aceh left the area Friday, American officials said. 
 The departure of the Abraham Lincoln, the centerpiece of the American effort in devastated Aceh, signaled the Indonesian government's desire to move from the delivery of emergency relief to plans for reconstruction of the devastated province. 
 Indeed, the airport at Banda Aceh, which several weeks ago was a hub of frenzied activity with cargo planes and helicopters packed on the tarmac, has fallen back to a more normal pace. Most tents that sheltered foreign soldiers and a variety of volunteers at the airport have disappeared. 
 The Indonesian president, Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono, has urged his government's National Development Planning Agency to step up its reconstruction plans for Banda Aceh, the capital of Aceh Province, the destroyed towns on the west coast, and the city of Meulaboh. The plans should be ready in three weeks, he said. 
 That is a much faster timeline than was anticipated in the immediate aftermath of the Dec. 26 tsunami, when it seemed clear that the intense emergency relief effort -- dependent on soldiers to deliver food, water and medicines -- would continue for many months. 
 The aid deliveries will continue, relief officials said, but will be handled primarily by the United Nations, foreign nongovernmental agencies and national groups like the Indonesian Red Cross.
 In an effort to show that Indonesia appreciated the American military assistance, the commander of the Indonesian armed forces, Gen. Endriartono Sutarto, attended a farewell ceremony on board the aircraft carrier on Thursday.
 The United States military's efforts included flying more than 2,800 relief missions and treating 2,200 patients, the American Embassy here said. 
 In place of the aircraft carrier, an American naval hospital ship, the Mercy, arrived off Aceh on Friday, American officials said. The ship, which has about 1,000 hospital beds, headed for Aceh from San Diego soon after the tsunami struck. 
 With the need to treat tsunami victims diminished, the ship's medical personnel will try to help with public health care, American officials said. 
 Less than three weeks after the tsunami struck, the Indonesian military announced a March 26 deadline for the departure from Aceh of all foreign troops that had come to help, a move that was interpreted by some as ingratitude. 
 The Minister for People's Welfare, Alwi Shihab, said the government was asking that civilian workers replace foreign military personnel still in Aceh.
 ''The government would like to see that we can stand on our own feet and resolve all the matters in Aceh by ourselves,'' he said. 
 Mr. Shihab said that the request for foreign soldiers to leave was not an edict and that the transition to civilians did not have to be immediate. 
 Some countries that rushed their soldiers to deliver food, purify water, remove rubble and tend to the wounded withdrew their forces during the past two weeks. 
 Singapore's substantial contingent of soldiers left more than a week ago. The nearly 1,000 troops from Australia, the largest foreign group of soldiers, will leave ''within weeks,'' the Australian prime minister, John Howard, said Thursday. 
 Whether President Yudhoyono's request for a fast reconstruction plan could be met was unclear, officials said. 
 The plan must cover replacing destroyed roads, bridges, public buildings, water supply and sanitation, as well as solving difficult problems like missing land titles. 
 But several factors made a speedier move away from relief and toward reconstruction necessary, the officials and other experts said. 
 Unlike some other major disasters where entire towns were wiped out, significant parts of Banda Aceh were left intact. In those areas, markets, banks, even restaurants and Internet cafes are operating as before. 
 Those factors indicated that there was somewhat less demand for emergency relief than had been anticipated, a Western economist said. Further, many of the 150,000 people who have been living in tented camps since Dec. 26 are restless and demanding permanent housing.
 The government has issued contracts for the building of wooden barracks where the homeless would be relocated to await more permanent housing, Mr. Shihab said. 
 Some of those barracks, with tiny rooms roughly 9 feet by 12 feet for a family, are nearly completed, he said, with about half of the total to be completed by mid-February. 
 However, many say they would prefer government assistance to rebuild homes rather than cramped barracks with poor sanitation. 
 Many Acehnese carry harsh memories of relocation camps that were established by the Indonesian military during martial law in the 1990's, when the government made an all-out effort to defeat separatist rebels in the province. 
 During that time, soldiers guarded the relocation camps. The new barracks would also be protected by the Indonesian military, government officials said.
 The White House announced Friday that former presidents George Bush and Bill Clinton would lead a delegation to tsunami-struck countries, including Indonesia, Sri Lanka, Thailand and the Maldives, on Feb. 19, Reuters reported.

HEADLINE: For Miller, A Soft Toss Of His Hat For Mayor

BYLINE: By DIANE CARDWELL

 BODY:
City Council Speaker Gifford Miller, surrounded by a dozen Brooklyn officials on the steps of Borough Hall, announced his candidacy for mayor yesterday, and appeared intent on displaying his support within the 718 area code.
 Mr. Miller's mayoral intentions have been clear for many months, but until yesterday's event -- more of a soft opening for the campaign than a formal announcement with backdrops and fanfare -- he had not given them public voice. 
 ''I want to say this clearly: I intend to run for mayor of this great city because we need new leadership and the right priorities,'' Mr. Miller said. ''I'll be making a formal announcement later in this year, but I wanted to make my intentions clear here today with this terrific group of public officials who represent so much of what's right with our city.''
 Those officials, a multiracial group drawn mainly from the State Assembly and the City Council, gave a variety of reasons for their endorsements, including the fact that Mr. Miller routinely serenades the elderly on visits to centers for the elderly.
 ''For the past four years I have experienced a City Council that has been very aggressive and very progressive in its efforts to preserve and protect the interests and welfare of Brooklynites and New Yorkers,'' said Councilman Albert Vann, who represents parts of Bedford-Stuyvesant and Crown Heights. ''We've done it successfully because there's been a leader, a speaker, who from Day 1 had the remarkable ability to bring disparate members together as a unit.''
 Although the event was intended as a show of strength, Mr. Miller's campaign appeared to lose its footing in recent days as a strategist decided to help re-elect Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg instead and Councilman Lewis A. Fidler announced his support for Fernando Ferrer, the Democrat leading in most polls. Mr. Miller did not mention any of his rivals, but the choice of cast and stage suggested that at least some were weighing heavily in the minds of campaign strategists.
 Mr. Vann, for instance, endorsed Mr. Ferrer when he ran in 2001. And several of the officials present are representing the same South Brooklyn territory as Representative Anthony D. Weiner, who is positioning himself as the mayoral candidate of boroughs other than Manhattan.
 For his part, Mr. Miller used his Brooklyn platform to outline what he said would be the main themes of his campaign: focusing on improving schools, getting more money back from the state and federal governments and lowering unemployment, especially among minorities.
 ''I won't cut billions of dollars out of the budget earmarked to reduce rampant classroom overcrowding to protect funds for a stadium that most New Yorkers don't want and don't need,'' he said. ''We need a mayor who will fight for this city's fair share, a mayor who will put the interests of all New Yorkers in front of the interests of his Republican allies,'' he continued, ''a mayor who doesn't declare victory until every New Yorker can access a job that allows for them to provide for their families.''

HEADLINE: Two Visions and the Challenge of Making a Choice

BYLINE: By CHARLES V. BAGLI

 BODY:
The Ile de France and other grand ocean liners once tied up there before steaming off to Europe, and later the location served a far grittier purpose as a garage for transit buses. But Pier 57, a vacant finger of Manhattan jutting far into the Hudson River off 15th Street, is suddenly hot again, the focus of a furious rivalry between two powerful developers with ties to the mayor, the governor and even President Bush.
 One group, led by Steven C. Witkoff, a developer, and Giuseppe Cipriani, the banquet king of Manhattan and scion of the family behind Harry's Bar of Venice, wants to convert Pier 57's dilapidated two-story structure into what it calls the Leonardo. The plan would combine a branch of the Triennale di Milano design museum with stores, cultural workshops by Italian-owned companies and the largest banquet and event space in the city. They have also proposed a marina and a 46,000-square-foot rooftop park.
 The other group, led by Roland Betts, an owner of the large Chelsea Piers complex three blocks to the north and a friend of the president's, wants to turn the 880-foot pier into a family swimming center and a marina, with space for art galleries, studios for WNYC, the public radio station, and dance companies, as well as a tennis bubble on the roof and a small community garden. 
 Local politicians and many residents in the neighborhood have lined up behind the Leonardo, but the heated debate over the relative merits of the two proposals has become entwined in speculation over the city's bid for the 2012 Olympics, allegations of mob ties and potential traffic snarls on the West Side Highway.
 The choice will be made by the Hudson River Park Trust, the city-state organization that oversees Pier 57 and a five-mile stretch of the waterfront from Battery Park to 59th Street. The pending decision has made the agency the target of intense pressure.
 Supporters of the Chelsea Piers proposal have been circulating testimony from the recent trial of Peter Gotti, the mobster, that Mr. Cipriani had paid a $120,000 bribe to settle a dispute with union waiters, an allegation that the restaurant owner dismissed as nonsense.
 Supporters of the Cipriani plan charged that Daniel L. Doctoroff, vice chairman of the park trust and the deputy mayor for economic development, is too close to Mr. Betts, who has assisted the city's bid for the 2012 Olympics and could put in a good word at the White House.
 A spokeswoman for Mr. Doctoroff said the choice between the proposals would be made strictly on the merits.
 Three board members said the trust was leaning toward the Cipriani proposal, but the matter was not on the agenda when the trust met on Jan. 27. Charles Dorkey, chairman of the trust, said that was because it was still scrutinizing a number of issues, including financial terms and potential traffic problems connected to a large banquet and event space. 
 ''We're trying to get the best possible project,'' Mr. Dorkey said. ''Waiting a couple of months isn't a big deal. I look at this as a 50-year gift to the people of New York. I want it done right.''
 Franz S. Leichter, who is also on the 13-member board, agreed, but added that politics is never far off.
 ''There were just too many outstanding issues,'' said Mr. Leichter, a former state senator. ''But I also think that the political decisions haven't been made yet in Albany or at City Hall.''
 Jennifer Falk, a spokeswoman for Mr. Doctoroff, said that the Bloomberg administration had not made a decision on Pier 57.
 ''While both finalists present strong proposals,'' she said, ''they also present significant issues, including the impact on traffic, commitments from subtenants and issues related to design and open space that the trust needs to completely evaluate before making a decision.''
 Both bidders said that the trust had asked them not to discuss their projects publicly.
 The Witkoff-Cipriani group appears to be offering a bigger economic deal. An internal review of the proposals by the trust staff indicates that the group would invest $154 million in the project and pay a starting annual rent of $1.5 million, rising to $2 million six years later. The Chelsea Piers plan calls for a $65 million project, offering annual rent payments starting at $300,000 and rising to $900,000 three years later.
 If successfully developed, Pier 57 would become the latest element in the development of a five-mile waterfront park along the Hudson River. But in opening up the waterfront to the public, tension has risen between the cultural and recreational uses the trust wants to promote, and the commercial uses needed to pay for them.
 The trust hopes that Pier 57 will generate enough rent to allow the group to maintain and expand Hudson River Park, even though board members say they prefer educational and maritime uses for the pier, which is as large as an 80-story building placed on its side.
 With the Leonardo group gaining momentum among board members, Mr. Betts and Chelsea Piers Management peppered the trust with a series of angry letters, criticizing the competing proposal as a ''thinly disguised knockoff of the Chelsea Piers.'' At the same time, they commissioned a transportation study showing that the 3,000 or more people traveling to the Leonardo's ''massive banquet halls will stop the West Side Highway in its tracks.''
 Mr. Betts also chided the trust for even considering a proposal to build a huge banquet hall that would compete with his own, a few blocks away. The banquet hall at Chelsea Piers is one of the most profitable elements of the complex, but Mr. Cipriani's proposed hall would be roughly three times larger. 
 While the trust assessed the traffic issues, an uglier issue surfaced. The board received letters describing the Dec. 8 testimony of Michael DiLeonardo in the racketeering trial of Peter Gotti, the head of the Gambino crime family. At one point, Mr. DiLeonardo, a Mafia turncoat, testified that he had met Mr. Cipriani through Mickey Rourke, the actor. He said that in the spring of 1998, Mr. Cipriani ''wanted to know if we could help keep the unions off his back.''
 According to a transcript of the testimony, Mr. DiLeonardo said he had Mr. Cipriani funnel $120,000 through Francis Leahy, a contractor known as Buddy who was doing work for Mr. Cipriani, in return for helping him with his labor problem.
 Mr. Cipriani, in an interview last week, dismissed the testimony as nonsense. He said he knew Mr. Leahy, a contractor who did work for him at three banquet halls. ''It's true we gave him a lot of money,'' he said, ''but it was for construction.''
 The hotel and restaurant workers union did wage a bitter eight-month campaign against Mr. Cipriani in 1999, after he took over the Rainbow Room and fired hundreds of union workers. Peter Ward, the current union president, said the union stopped its picketing only because Mr. Cipriani gave in and agreed to rehire the workers and sign a union contract.
 Asked if Chelsea Piers had distributed the trial transcripts, Tom Bernstein, the company's president, declined to comment.
 According to a director of the trust, the testimony regarding Mr. Cipriani was referred to the city's Department of Investigation, which declined to comment.

HEADLINE: A Global Culture War Pits Protectionists Against Free Traders

BYLINE: By ALAN RIDING

DATELINE: PARIS, Feb. 4 

 BODY:
The idea of promoting cultural diversity around the world seems reasonable enough. It recognizes that everyone profits from the free flow of ideas, words and images. It encourages preservation of, say, indigenous traditions and minority languages. It treats the cultures of rich and poor countries as equal. And most topically, it offers an antidote to cultural homogeneity.
 Try turning this seemingly straightforward idea into an international treaty, though, and things soon become complicated. Since October 2003, Unesco's 190 members have been working on what is provisionally called the Convention on the Protection of the Diversity of Cultural Contents and Artistic Expression. It is intended to be approved by consensus this fall, but don't count on it. There is still no agreement on its final name. 
 But that is a minor issue compared with more fundamental differences. Led by France and Canada, a majority of countries are asserting the right of governments to safeguard, promote and even protect their cultures from outside competition. Opposing them, a smaller group led by the United States argues that cultural diversity can best flourish in the freedom of the globalized economy.
 A bid to break the deadlock is now under way at the Paris headquarters of Unesco, where delegates and experts are wrestling with hundreds of proposed amendments to the first draft. Yet the more they advance toward concrete definitions, some delegates say, the less likely they are to reach consensus.
 The reason is simple: Behind the idealistic screen of cultural diversity, weighty economic and political issues are at stake.
 The story began with the last global trade liberalization around a decade ago when France obtained what became known as the cultural exception, which effectively authorized the protection of culture. Now, France and Canada want to go further: by enshrining cultural diversity in a legally binding Unesco convention, they hope to shield culture from the free-trade rules of the Geneva-based World Trade Organization.
 Why France and Canada? Both view cultural independence as an essential part of their political identity. They have also long resisted the imperial reach of American popular culture, notably Hollywood, by using fiscal incentives, taxes, subsidies and quotas to protect their movie, music, publishing and other cultural industries. And under the kind of convention they favor, they would continue doing so without the risk of being challenged.
 So is this another example of anti-Americanism at work? The Motion Picture Association of America, Hollywood's main lobby, has long complained about the protection of the French film industry. But because of that help, France has Europe's only thriving movie industry: Hollywood accounts for about 65 percent of the French box office, compared with 90 percent elsewhere in Europe. Now Denmark, Germany, Britain and Spain are also looking to help their film businesses.
 Certainly, as the world's largest exporter of movies, television programs and other audio-visual products, the United States believes it will suffer from further restrictions on cultural exchanges. When the United States ended a 19-year boycott of Unesco in late 2003, however, plans for a convention were already advanced. Rather than announcing its return to the organization by being obstructionist, it decided to defend its position in negotiations.
 The first draft of the convention, presented by 15 cultural experts last summer, tried to please everyone by endorsing ''the free flow of ideas by word and image'' and by noting that cultural goods and services ''must not be treated as ordinary merchandise or consumer goods.'' The battle was then joined in November when governments presented their responses, many of which are now proposed amendments to the draft.
 The American response was unambiguous. While supporting the principle of cultural diversity, it warned that ''controlling cultural or artistic expressions is not consistent with respect for human rights or the free flow of information.'' It further noted, ''Mounting trade barriers, including efforts to prevent the free flow of investment and knowledge, is not a valid way to promote cultural liberty or diversity since such measures reduce choices.''
 Louise V. Oliver, the United States Ambassador to Unesco, explained: ''We support 'protect' as in nurture, not 'protect' as in barriers. That said, 'protect' remains a highly loaded concept in this cultural diversity context and, for that reason, remains a sensitive issue. If the convention promotes cultural diversity, we are in favor. We're not in favor of anything that prevents the free and open exchange of cultures.''
 Supporters of the convention focused instead on the word ''freedom,'' arguing that freedom of choice means availability of choice, which in turn requires active promotion -- and protection -- of cultural diversity. Canada suggested that the red-flag word ''globalization'' be described as a ''challenge'' rather than as a ''threat.'' But it firmly reasserted its right to preserve and promote any cultural activity that it defined as domestic.
 The French position was backed by the European Commission, which negotiates on behalf of the 25-nation European Union on trade matters. Just as it supported the ''cultural exception'' a decade ago, the commission endorsed the view that trade disputes involving culture should in future be ruled by the Unesco convention, not the W.T.O.
 The battle lines are becoming clearer. France and Canada have the support of China and African countries as well as much of Latin America, although Mexico, Brazil and Venezuela want freedom to export their popular television soap operas. Support for the American free trade view comes from other countries with commercial interests to defend: Japan because of its animated-movie industry and India because of Bollywood, its film powerhouse.
 But inevitably, the spotlight is on the United States. ''The American objective is to have no convention,'' a Latin American diplomat said, speaking on the condition of anonymity, ''but if there is flexibility, it will have no choice but to accept it.'' French officials are less sanguine. They say that, by using amendments to forestall an agreement in the fall, Washington hopes that the entire debate will become muddied next year by negotiations in the next global trade round.
 ''I expect the usual American approach,'' said Garry Neil, executive director of the International Network for Cultural Diversity, an Ottawa-based nongovernmental lobby. ''They'll take a hard line, weaken the text as much as possible and then not sign it.'' Certainly, if the United States finds the final draft unacceptable, it can break the consensus tradition and demand a vote. And even if approved by consensus, the United States Senate would probably not ratify it.
 Does this matter?
 Probably not to France, Canada and a few other cultural nationalists. As long as a convention is adopted and goes into effect, they will claim ample authority to protect their culture. But a more interesting question is whether such a convention will help sustain cultural diversity in countries too poor to do so themselves. That, after all, was one of the proclaimed purposes of this entire exercise. At the moment, it risks being forgotten.

HEADLINE: Shares Surge as Sluggish Jobs Data Ease Inflation Fears

BYLINE: By The Associated Press

 BODY:
Investors found some reassurance in weak job growth figures yesterday, and sent stocks sharply higher on a bet that the numbers will prompt the Federal Reserve to be less aggressive in raising interest rates. The Dow Jones industrials climbed more than 120 points as Wall Street had its best week of 2005.
 The markets opted for a glass-half-full approach to the Labor Department's job creation report, which showed 146,000 new jobs last month, far less than the 200,000 expected. December's job gains were revised downward to 133,000 from the 157,000 reported a month ago. 
 While such a disappointing report has driven stocks lower in the past, the numbers assuaged investors' fears that inflation would become an issue. With the economy growing at a tepid rate, inflation is unlikely to be a factor, and the Fed Reserve's modest stance on raising interest rates would remain unchanged.
 Richard D. Rippe, chief economist at the Prudential Equity Group in New York, said he thought the jobs report provided ''no reason for the Fed to turn more aggressive in its tightening.''
 ''That's because while it's creating jobs,'' Mr. Rippe said, ''the economy is not booming, and there's not a lot of labor-cost pressure in the system.'' 
 The Dow Jones industrial average rose 123.03 points, or 1.2 percent, to 10,716.13. It was the first triple-digit gain for the Dow in 2005 and the best one-day gain since Dec. 1. Broader indicators also moved higher. The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index was up 13.14 points, or 1.1 percent, at 1,203.03, breaking through the 1,200 level for the first time since Jan. 3. The Nasdaq index gained 29.02 points, or 1.4 percent, to 2,086.66, the index's best close since Jan. 18.
 The week's good news -- successful elections in Iraq, no surprises from the Fed on interest rates and falling oil prices -- helped investors put yesterday's jobs report in perspective, analysts said. Economic growth, without inflationary pressures, could be healthier for the economy in the long-term.
 ''It really is the sweet spot,'' said Scott Wren, equity strategist for A.G. Edwards & Sons. ''This economic environment is just very modest and very sustainable, with non-inflationary growth. That's the kind of environment that's good for stocks.''
 For the week, the Dow rose 2.8 percent, the S.&P. 500 climbed 2.7 percent and the Nasdaq gained 2.5 percent. The Dow and S.&P. 500 are only down less than 1 percent for 2005. The Nasdaq, however, remains down 4.1 percent, as small-cap stocks and technology shares have taken the brunt of investors' unease.
 With the bulk of a largely upbeat earnings season over, the jobs report was the main catalyst for investors yesterday. Still, there were some companies releasing earnings, including the media conglomerate Time Warner, which fell 12 cents, to $18.04, even though it beat expectations for profits, excluding one-time items. 
 The medical supplier Cardinal Health fell $1.91, to $58.18, after reporting that its second-quarter profit sank 42 percent and that its controller and other employees had left the company over an accounting inquiry.
 Shares of tobacco companies surged after a federal appeals court said the government could not try to take up to $280 billion in past profits under a racketeering law. The Altria Group, parent of Philip Morris USA, climbed $3.26, to $67.
 In the bond market, the benchmark 10-year Treasury note gained 22/32, to 101 12/32. The note's yield, which moves in the opposite direction from the price, fell to 4.08 percent from 4.16 percent on Thursday.

HEADLINE: Working for Top Bosses on Wall St. Has Its Perks

BYLINE: By LANDON THOMAS Jr.; Eric Dash contributed reporting for this article.

 BODY:
On Wall Street, just about everything has its price, from the commission on a stock trade to the pay package of a top banker. But when it comes to securing the services of an ever-loyal, all-knowing executive assistant, the boss is often willing to disburse cash and a long list of perks -- from unlimited credit at high-end hair salons to nannies.
 After this week's disclosure that the executive assistant for Richard A. Grasso, the former chairman of the New York Stock Exchange, was paid $240,000 a year, the role of the executive assistant has drawn extra scrutiny. 
 But, while her pay was cited as a totem of the culture of excess that Mr. Grasso cultivated, in the very thin air pocket that captures the upper reaches of Wall Street compensation, there are examples of assistants earning packages that at least approach that level. 
 Executive recruiters say that pay for assistants to Wall Street chief executives may range from $100,000 to $150,000 in base salary, with a select few earning as much as $200,000. There is also the potential to earn a bonus in either cash or equity of up to 30 percent of that amount. On top of that, some executives will pay another bonus out of their own pockets, rewarding their assistants for going beyond the call of duty to get a job done. 
 And it is not just Wall Street. Wherever pay and egos collide, executive assistants stand to gain. During the Tyco International trial, for example, Mary Murphy, an assistant to L. Dennis Kozlowski, the former chief executive, testified that she received a $700,000 severance package when she left the company in 1999.
 Then there is the case of Jeffrey Epstein who pays his three executive assistants more than $200,000 a year. A financier who manages the money of a small roster of billionaire clients, Mr. Epstein has an unusual philosophy about the utility of his three-woman executive team, which manages his hectic life of globetrotting and hobnobbing with the likes of former President Clinton.
 He calls them a ''social prosthesis,'' with an intuitive knowledge of his manifold needs and a 24-hour presence that make them virtually indispensable to his personal and business success.
 ''They are an extension of my brain,'' said Mr. Epstein, who rarely talks publicly. ''Their intuition is something that I don't have.'' 
 For example, he said, one of the assistants ''can pick up the stresses in one of my trader's voices and put the call right through; that can save me hundreds of thousands of dollars.''
 Accordingly, Mr. Epstein, who lives and works on a private island in the Virgin Islands but maintains an office in New York, does not stint in compensating them. In addition to the rich payday, he also ladles on the perks: he maintains a charge account at Frederic Fekkai, the society hair dresser, for their unlimited use and pays for all food eaten during his lengthy business hours, including takeout from Le Cirque. On trips on his Boeing 727, he frequently takes two of the assistants with him.
 When one of them, Lesley Groff, who is 38, became pregnant last year and talked of leaving, he bought her a Mercedes-Benz E320 to make her commuting easier and agreed to pay for a full-time nanny so that she could keep working for him.
 ''There is no way that I could lose Lesley to motherhood,'' said Mr. Epstein, who is in his early 50's and is a bachelor.
 There are those on Wall Street who feel that it is hard to attach a true value to such people.
 ''They know everything and they eventually take over,'' said Michael M. Thomas, a former Lehman Brothers partner. Mr. Thomas retained his assistant for 16 years and as a child he remembers receiving personal letters from his father, also a financial executive, that were signed by his secretary. ''You are paying for loyalty as well as indispensability. Grasso took home $139 million and he paid the keeper of his secrets a quarter million. That is a very small economy.''
 In Mr. Grasso's case, his assistant remained loyal to him. According to lawyers close to the case, the assistant, SooJee Lee, 38, was reticent about her boss when she was interviewed by stock exchange lawyers as they compiled a report on Mr. Grasso's pay, which totaled $192.9 million in compensation and paid pension benefits in his eight years as chief executive. 
 Their conclusions, released this week in what is known as the Webb report, noted that comparing the pay of Mr. Grasso as chairman of a self-regulated institution with that of the chief executives of big Wall Street firms was inappropriate; the report said he received $144 million to $156 million in excessive compensation.
 In many ways the role of the assistant as omnipotent gatekeeper has evolved in recent years as the corporate conduct of chief executives has become a target for regulators. A number of chief executives of Wall Street firms shun e-mail these days, not because they are Luddites, but because e-mail messages have ended up as evidence in cases brought by regulators. Now, to send e-mail messages to these men, one has to send a message to his assistant.
 The executive assistant has long been a crucial figure in the busy life of the Wall Street executive, but the nature of the relationship has changed. In the more relaxed time of partnerships and privacy, they tended to be older, with a more circumscribed set of duties. With the increased pressure that came from firms going public, combined with the relentless beat of travel and ceremony, executives have started to attract a younger, more resilient breed of assistant to keep up with them.
 The executives have also gone for quantity. Having two executive assistants is de rigueur for most executives these days. Drivers are also paid hefty sums on Wall Street. According to the Webb report, two of Mr. Grasso's drivers were paid $130,000 each. While that figure would seem high, executives and consultants say that many drivers on the Street, especially those with a law enforcement background, can command such a figure.
 To be sure, the rest of corporate America is less generous. Recruiters say the average salary, not including bonus, for assistants outside of Wall Street ranges from $60,000 to $100,000 a year.
 And a growing number of chief executives command the services of three full-time assistants who divvy up the tasks of fielding calls, typing letters, managing a schedule and other duties. Many have advanced degrees. Ms. Lee, for example, is a law school graduate.
 ''They are trouble-shooters, amateur psychologists, travel consultants, and play a critical role in helping executives achieve personal and company goals,'' said Melba J. Duncan, president of the Duncan Group, a global headhunting firm for executive assistants. ''They are there 24/7 and don't leave until they get the job done.''
 Harking back to a time on Wall Street when gender roles were more stratified, the vast majority of executive assistants are women.
 And there is a long history of chief executives marrying their assistants or attendants. Mr. Grasso's wife worked for a time before their marriage as his assistant at the exchange during the 1970's. His successor, John S. Reed, married the flight attendant on his corporate jet. Carl C. Icahn, the financier, as well as Kenneth L. Lay and Jeffrey K. Skilling, the former chief executives of Enron, also married their assistants.
 Getting such jobs is not easy. Many come from search firms, but in the case of Mr. Epstein assistants must submit to a test that he likens to a graduate exam. Some candidates being considered by him also write a 20-page research report in which they demonstrate their communication and critical thinking skills. 
 Ms. Groff said she thought that both she and Ms. Lee were worth the price.
 ''It comes down to the bond,'' said Ms. Groff, a graduate of the University of Texas who has been with Mr. Epstein for four years. ''I know what he is thinking and I know when I need to be fast. It's a nice roll we are on.''

HEADLINE: The Oil-for-Food Report

 BODY:
A commission investigating the United Nations' oil-for-food program in Iraq has issued an interim report that sheds some light, but not much, on the nature and scope of this much-ballyhooed scandal. The panel has found persuasive evidence that Benon Sevan, who ran the program, used his influence with Iraq improperly to help a small company gain profitable rights to sell Iraqi oil while he was simultaneously urging the U.N. to provide greater help in rebuilding Iraq's oil equipment. That was a clear conflict of interest that raises the possibility that Iraq bribed Mr. Sevan. If the allegations are true -- Mr. Sevan claims that he is being scapegoated -- they would constitute the first real evidence of corruption at high levels of the program. 
 But whether this amounts to small-scale corruption by a greedy official or a large-scale subversion of the entire program is not clear. Nothing in this initial report gets at the core element of the scandal: how was Iraq able to manipulate the program to amass perhaps $2 billion in illicit revenues to sustain the regime and buy embargoed goods? 
 The most disturbing findings, according to Paul Volcker, the panel's chairman, are that Mr. Sevan, a Cypriot, asked senior Iraqi officials to grant oil allocations to Africa Middle East Petroleum, a small company owned by a distant relative of Boutros Boutros-Ghali, the former U.N. secretary general, and was evasive in answering questions about it. The company resold the allocations for a $1.5 million profit. The report does not charge that Mr. Sevan profited personally, but it notes that he claimed to have received $160,000 in cash from an aunt, an elderly woman who lived modestly and would not plausibly have big wads of cash to give away.
 During this period Mr. Sevan also urged the U.N. to increase the funds for oil-machinery repairs in Iraq and release ''holds'' put on oil parts destined for Iraq. The report stops short of accusing him of taking a bribe to do Iraq's bidding, possibly because he had long sought to rebuild Iraq's oil facilities and might have championed that cause even without the oil allocations. But Secretary-General Kofi Annan said he was shocked at Mr. Sevan's behavior. 
 The other major charge in the report is that the U.N. violated its own competitive bidding rules in hiring three major contractors. That seems undeniably true, but how heinous it is remains murky. Mr. Boutros-Ghali, then the secretary general, for example, picked a French bank to handle the program's escrow account because Iraq wouldn't accept an American bank and the United States opposed using a Swiss bank that was deemed the top choice by U.N. procurement officials. 
 The choice of a Dutch company to inspect oil shipments out of Iraq and of a British company to inspect imports of humanitarian goods also violated U.N. bidding procedures. The Dutch may have been favored because they were deemed tough on enforcing sanctions, and the British may have been chosen to spread the contracting around. Whatever the motivation, the U.N. official most centrally involved faces disciplinary action.
 Still to come are a report on the role of Kofi Annan's son in working for a contractor and a final report that will delve into the sensitive issue of whether members of the Security Council knew that Iraq was getting illicit revenues from the oil-for-food program and separate trade protocols but did nothing to stop it.

HEADLINE: Memo Gives New Details on Workings of Bush Social Security Plan

BYLINE: By DAVID E. ROSENBAUM

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Feb. 4 

 BODY:
Under the plan President Bush outlined Wednesday night in his State of the Union Message, retirees' traditional Social Security benefits would be reduced if they had diverted some of their tax money into private investment accounts, according to a memorandum that the chief actuary of the Social Security system sent to the White House on the day of the president's address.
 Mr. Bush's plan would permit workers to put up to 4 percent of their wages into personal accounts, instead of having that money go into the Social Security system. At first, there would be a $1,000 annual limit on investments, but that would be phased out. 
 The Social Security tax is now 12.4 percent, divided equally between employees and employers. So if a worker put the full 4 percent into a private account, 8.4 percent of wages would go to the Social Security system.
 At retirement, workers who had diverted part of their taxes would have two sources of income: a check from the government based on the taxes they had paid into the system, and the money accumulated in their investment accounts. To be better off than retirees who had stayed with the guaranteed benefits, an investor's private account would have had to earn more than three percentage points above the rate of inflation.
 In his speech to the nation, the president never said, although it has always been implicit, that workers' retirement benefits from the government would be lowered if they chose to put tax money into personal accounts. A senior White House official told reporters on Wednesday that there would be such a reduction in benefits, but he did not explain how it would work.
 Now these details of the memorandum from the Social Security actuary, Stephen C. Goss, to Charles P. Blahous, the main White House staff expert on the program, are circulating among policy experts:
 Mr. Goss said a ''shadow account'' would be calculated based on how much the retiree's investment account would have been worth if it had all been invested in bonds with an average yield of three percentage points above inflation. 
 Retirees would be allowed to keep all the money in their investment accounts.
 Those who had low wages in their working years would be required to put at least part of the money in their accounts into lifetime annuities, instruments that make a guaranteed monthly payment for life but then expire and cannot be left to heirs.
 Retirees who were more affluent could invest or spend their accounts as they wished. 
 But the guaranteed monthly payments from the government would be determined as if the tax money they had paid to the government were reduced by the amount in the hypothetical shadow account.
 Mr. Goss assumed that the typical worker would select a portfolio of 50 percent stock funds, 30 percent corporate bond funds and 20 percent Treasury bonds. Such a portfolio, Mr. Goss said, could be expected to earn an average over many years of 4.6 points above the rate of inflation.
 The Democratic staff of the House Ways and Means Committee has estimated that retirees with that size a return would have their guaranteed Social Security benefits reduced by about 70 percent of the amount in their accounts. That would leave them better off than if they had not opted for private accounts. 
 If the actual return in the personal account was only three points above inflation, then the guaranteed benefits would be reduced by 100 percent of the amount in the account; total retirement income would be exactly the same as if the worker had stayed in the traditional Social Security system and had not invested in a private account.
 And if their investments earned only 1.5 points above inflation, then retirees would be worse off than if they had not put tax money into a personal account.
 But in all cases, the money in the private account would belong to the retiree. It would be the size of the government Social Security checks that would be reduced.

HEADLINE: The Social Security Push: 3 Intricate Balancing Acts

BYLINE: By RICHARD W. STEVENSON

DATELINE: TAMPA, Fla., Feb. 4 

 BODY:
In barnstorming on behalf of his Social Security plan, President Bush tried to translate his base's deep loyalty to him -- evident in the rousing receptions he received over the last two days in five states that he carried in November -- into support for one of the most ambitious changes in social welfare policy since the New Deal.
 From North Dakota to Montana, Nebraska, Arkansas and Florida, Mr. Bush was loose and confident, seemingly unperturbed by continued skittishness among Republicans and energized opposition from Democrats.
 ''It doesn't matter how hard the issue is,'' Mr. Bush told thousands of people who had lined up before dawn on Friday to hear him speak in Omaha. ''As a matter of fact, the harder the issue, the bigger the challenge, and the more exciting it's going to be when we get the job done.'' 
 To succeed, he will have to prod Congress into action by mobilizing public opinion, which so far is fluid and in the end will no doubt move toward the side that does a better job of framing the choices. 
 ''He either has to move public opinion such that Republicans in particular feel that they have political cover for what some will term a radical overhaul,'' a Republican pollster, Tony Fabrizio, said. ''Or he needs to convince them that while the medicine tastes bad, they'll feel better afterward.''
 The outcome will be determined in part by how the president fills in the many blanks in his approach and answers some of the more compelling questions about it like whether the United States can afford to borrow the trillions of dollars necessary to pay for personal accounts when it is already debt-heavy.
 ''Until you have an entire plan, you have people debating empty boxes,'' said Senator Ben Nelson of Nebraska, the Democrat judged most likely by many in his party to side with Mr. Bush.
 The outcome will also be influenced by how much flexibility the White House shows in response to the qualms of Republicans on Capitol Hill. Some of them, for example, want to tackle the subject only in conjunction with related economic issues that might have more political appeal or free up money to make the job easier.
 ''I do believe the White House needs to be open to out-of-the box or game-changing options like merging Social Security reform and tax reform to deal with the transition issues,'' said Cesar V. Conda, a Republican lobbyist who is a former domestic policy adviser to Vice President Dick Cheney.
 But the final result will probably hinge to a great degree on how Mr. Bush does on three broader fronts.
 The first is whether the desire of younger workers for changes to Social Security that might help them will outweigh the power of older people who are resistant to change.
 When it comes to the core of Mr. Bush's plan, his proposal to allow workers to divert part of their payroll taxes to individual accounts, younger people tend to like it and older people to oppose it.
 A New York Times/CBS News poll last month found that among 18- to 29-year-olds, 61 percent thought individual investing of Social Security money was a good idea versus 36 percent who said it was a bad idea. 
 Among people 65 and older, one-quarter said it was a good idea, while 69 percent said it was a bad idea.
 On the road this week, Mr. Bush appealed repeatedly to younger workers. 
 ''It's the younger folks that ought to be saying, 'What you going to do about it, Mr. President?''' Mr. Bush said in Little Rock, Ark., after warning that the system would be bankrupt by 2042 and faced disaster. Such phrases, his critics say, exaggerate Social Security's problems. 
 At the same time, he sought to blunt the opposition of older people, reassuring them that his approach would not change a single thing for them. 
 ''I don't care what they tell you, I don't care what the brochures say,'' Mr. Bush said here. ''The Social Security trust fund is sound and solvent for people who are counting on their checks today and people who are going to be counting on the checks who are near retired.''
 AARP, the big lobbying organization for older Americans, is mobilizing to oppose Mr. Bush and may be the most powerful single advocacy group to plunge into the fight.
 ''The president's biggest problem is people who are retired or are about to be retired and are going to be mobilized by the AARP,'' James A. Thurber, director of the Center for Congressional and Presidential Studies at American University in Washington, said.
 The second big battlefield is whether the appeal of personal accounts, with their promise of gains in the stock market, will outweigh the fear of substantial cuts in benefits that would be required to meet Mr. Bush's goal of making the system permanently solvent without raising taxes.
 Mr. Bush acknowledged on Friday that personal accounts would not by themselves solve the Social Security problems, and he repeated that all ideas for cutting benefits could be put on the table without fear of political retribution. 
 ''Bring them on, and we'll sit down and we'll have a good discussion about how to get something done,'' he said.
 But after a re-election campaign in which Mr. Bush avoided any talk about painful choices, he, his party and the country are only beginning to focus on what it would mean to raise the retirement age further, for example, or to set benefits for future retirees at levels that do not replace as much of their preretirement incomes as the current system does. 
 Last, Mr. Bush will have to prevail in an ideological argument over the relative roles of government and the market in social welfare policy. As much as Americans have grown more comfortable with investing and Wall Street, as much as the world has embraced market forces as part of the social equation and an integral element of democracy, even many conservatives still see value in a system that provides an absolute guarantee to the most vulnerable citizens.
 ''This is a tough sell,'' said Senator Chuck Hagel of Nebraska, a Republican who is often mentioned as a presidential candidate in 2008. ''We're talking about probably the most successful and important program we've had in the U.S. government. There should be questions.''

HEADLINE: Greenspan Says Trade Gap May Narrow

BYLINE: By ALAN COWELL; Edmund L. Andrews contributed reporting from Washington for this article.

DATELINE: LONDON, Feb. 4 

 BODY:
Alan Greenspan, the chairman of the Federal Reserve, said on Friday that America's record trade deficit might be poised to stabilize and even fall because of market pressures and belt-tightening by the Bush administration.
 Mr. Greenspan was speaking at a gathering coinciding with a scheduled meeting of the finance ministers and central bank governors from the Group of 7, the leading industrialized nations. His remarks inspired a strengthening of the dollar, which had fallen because of a weak jobs report in the United States. 
 Although Mr. Greenspan acknowledged that America's expanding trade deficits and foreign indebtedness had reached record levels, he sounded more sanguine than he was several months ago. 
 In November, Mr. Greenspan predicted to international bankers that foreign investors would show a ''diminished appetite'' for financing American debt, leading to a sell-off of the dollar. 
 In contrast, on Friday, Mr. Greenspan shifted emphasis to the relentless expansion of global investment flows. 
 ''Deregulation and technological innovation have driven the globalization process by tearing down the barriers that have separated economic agents,'' Mr. Greenspan said, reprising a favorite theme. ''The effect of these developments has been to markedly increase the willingness and ability of financial market participants to reach beyond national borders.'' 
 Though Mr. Greenspan has made similar arguments before, he seemed more intent on easing international anxieties and describing the country's indebtedness as a result of broadly positive trends in globalization and strong American growth.
 The G-7 talks, which end on Saturday, are likely to devote much attention to the federal budget in the United States, trade deficits, the weakness of the dollar and the linkage of China's currency to the dollar. 
 But, according to remarks by participants on Friday, the discussions seemed unlikely to make substantial progress on persuading China to adopt more flexible exchange rates. Indeed, Zhou Xiaochuan, governor of China's central bank, said that his government was not ready to lift its current peg against the dollar. 
 But Chinese officials have hinted that the country may move to a system of flexible exchange rates at some point. 
 Much of the focus Friday was on a speech by Mr. Greenspan that analysts examined for clues as to the most likely way that the United States trade and budget deficits could be reduced. 
 Reflecting the concern of the global financial community, Mervyn King, the governor of the Bank of England, said the international monetary system could be threatened by persistent deficits in the United States and the accumulation of vast dollar assets by Asian central banks. 
 The United States trade gap could narrow by a reduction in imports into the country or by a rise in American exports. Mr. Greenspan said a reason the trade gap would narrow was that foreign exporters selling goods to the United States might no longer be prepared to reduce their profits in the interests of preserving a share of American markets. 
 ''We may be approaching a point, if we are not already there, at which exporters to the United States, should the dollar decline further, would no longer choose to absorb a further reduction in profit margins,'' Mr. Greenspan said. That would mean a reduction in the volume of imports but ''leave the resulting value of imports uncertain.''
 Mr. Greenspan said American exporters' profit margins -- bolstered by the weak dollar, which makes United States goods more attractive to foreign buyers -- ''appear to be increasing, which bodes well for future U.S. exports and the adjustment process.''
 ''Besides market pressures, which appear poised to stabilize and over the long run possibly to decrease the U.S. current account deficit and its attendant financing requirements, some forces in the domestic U.S. economy seem about to head in the same direction,'' he said.
 ''The voice of fiscal restraint, barely audible a year ago, has at least partially regained volume,'' he said, referring to promises by the Bush administration to restrain the spending that has led to the large budget deficit.
 Mr. Greenspan and others have said that the trade gap, estimated at nearly 6 percent of the nation's wealth, cannot be sustained at that level. 
 ''I have argued elsewhere that the U.S. current-account deficit cannot widen forever but that, fortunately, the increased flexibility of the American economy will likely facilitate any adjustment without significant consequences to aggregate economic activity,'' Mr. Greenspan said.
 Mr. Greenspan also noted that Chinese exporters had not labored under the same difficulties as European exporters, whose businesses have become progressively more expensive or less profitable in the United States because of the weak dollar.
 Mr. Greenspan also referred to the ''effect of Asian official purchases of dollars in support of their currencies.''
 ''Such intervention may be supporting the dollar and U.S. Treasury bond prices somewhat, but the effect is difficult to pin down.''
 John B. Taylor, a United States Treasury under secretary, met on Friday with Mr. Zhou, the governor of the Chinese central bank, and Jin Renqing, the finance minister ''We know they are taking steps toward a more flexible exchange rate,'' Mr. Taylor said. Mr. Taylor is representing the United States. The Treasury secretary, John W. Snow, who was ill, did not attend the meeting. 
 Chinese officials gave no clues for a timetable toward a flexible rate.
 China's undervalued currency has propelled an expansion in exports fueling rapid growth in China and a ballooning deficit in the United States, where Chinese imports accounted for more than 25 percent of the trade gap in December. 
 The G-7 ministers represent the United States, Britain, Canada, France, Germany, Italy and Japan. This time, the group also invited representatives of China, India, South Africa and Brazil as guests. The British hosts had hoped the gathering would lead to a breakthrough on financing poverty-relief efforts in Africa and elsewhere. But those ambitions collided Friday with American objections to British proposals to raise funds for the third world by tapping international capital markets and revaluing the gold reserves of the International Monetary Fund.

HEADLINE: Social Security Poker: It's Time for Liberals to Ante Up

BYLINE: By NICHOLAS D. KRISTOF. 
E-mail: nicholas@nytimes.com

 BODY:
Liberals are making a historic mistake by lining up so adamantly against Social Security reform.
 It's impolite to say so in a blue state, but President Bush has a point: there is a genuine problem with paying for Social Security, even if it isn't as dire as Mr. Bush suggests.
 As Bill Clinton declared in 1998 about Social Security reform: ''We all know a demographic crisis is looming. If we act now it will be easier and less painful than if we wait until later.'' Mr. Clinton then made Social Security reform a central theme of his 1999 State of the Union address, saying, ''Above all, we must save Social Security for the 21st century.'' 
 Figures tossed about these days -- such as the system's having to slash benefits in 2042 -- are wild guesses that depend in part on longevity. The Social Security Administration estimates that U.S. life expectancy will increase by only six years by 2075. But life spans grew by 30 years in the 20th century, and if you believe (as I do) that biotechnology will greatly raise life expectancy, then we'll face a huge problem paying for long-lived retirees (touch wood, like me).
 Mr. Bush is also right to try to promote savings -- though financing a savings plan by borrowing is a lousy idea. A crucial economic weakness of America is its low savings rate, and one way to address that would be to finance retirements more out of savings -- with wealth creation rather than wealth transfers.
 Singapore helped pioneer private investment accounts (a good rule of thumb in economic policy is to do what Singapore does), and its system has raised home ownership and alleviated poverty. 
 Democratic senators in the 1990's like Charles Robb, Bob Kerrey, John Breaux and Daniel Patrick Moynihan championed Social Security reform. After Senator Moynihan offered a reform proposal in 1998, The Washington Post noted, ''Republicans want to put Social Security reform on the back burner.'' But now that Republicans want it on the front burner, Democrats are screaming foul.
 One objection has been that Mr. Bush will use his reform as another occasion to soak the poor. But that's a reason for Democrats to participate and suggest progressive alternatives.
 Policy wonks have shown a variety of ways to organize retirement accounts so the poor are better off. ''Our goal should be to eliminate poverty among the elderly'' -- through progressive Social Security reforms -- Mr. Kerrey said. For example, Mr. Clinton favored private accounts as add-ons to Social Security, with the government matching contributions by low-income Americans.
 True, there is one powerful objection to private Social Security accounts: We can't afford them now. Mr. Bush's plan would cost $1 trillion in its first decade and $3.5 trillion more in its second decade. Financing this with debt -- an Argentinian approach -- would be utterly reckless.
 It shouldn't be liberal to oppose wealth-creating savings programs for workers. And it shouldn't be conservative to use loans to launch a multitrillion-dollar program.
 But what if we paid for Social Security reform by keeping the inheritance tax? Or by undoing Mr. Bush's tax cuts for the wealthiest Americans? Rescuing Social Security strikes me as a good use for that money -- while paying for it with debt would not secure our children's future, but mortgage it.
 If it hadn't been for the Monica Lewinsky affair, Mr. Clinton might have achieved Social Security reform. But that didn't happen, and these days both parties are behaving irresponsibly. Mr. Bush is disingenuous -- and perhaps fiscally reckless -- by refusing to explain who will pay the bill, and the Democrats are trying to shout him down without offering solutions of their own.
 As Will Marshall, a founder of the Democratic Leadership Council and now president of the Progressive Policy Institute, said: ''The Democratic Party ought to be developing a vision of a modernized social insurance system for the 21st century and moving beyond the 'just say no' position. If Bush is wrong, then what is right?''
 Bill Clinton was correct that there is a real problem out there. And I'm deeply afraid that we're going to go through this debate as we did the health care battle of 1994 -- by rejecting a White House proposal but agreeing on nothing in its place.
 In that case, it won't just be Mr. Bush who loses. We'll all lose.

HEADLINE: Bush Budget Calls for Cuts in Health Services

BYLINE: By ROBERT PEAR; Eric Schmitt contributed reporting for this article.

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Feb. 4 

 BODY:
President Bush's budget for 2006 cuts spending for a wide range of public health programs, including several to protect the nation against bioterrorist attacks and to respond to medical emergencies, budget documents show.
 Faced with constraints on spending caused by record budget deficits and the demands of the war in Iraq, administration officials said on Friday that they had increased the budget for some health programs but cut many others, including some that address urgent health care needs.
 The documents show, for example, that Mr. Bush would cut spending for several programs that deal with epidemics, chronic diseases and obesity. His plan would also cut the budget of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention by 9 percent, to $6.9 billion, the documents show. 
 The cuts are part of an attempt to control the federal deficit, while increasing spending on certain priority programs. In the budget, to be unveiled on Monday, administration officials said, overall domestic spending, aside from entitlements, will grow less than the rate of inflation next year.
 But the administration is proposing to increase the Pentagon budget by 4.8 percent, to $419.3 billion in the 2006 fiscal year, according to Defense Department budget documents obtained by The New York Times. That sum does not include the costs of operations in Iraq and Afghanistan, now running about $5 billion a month. Within a few weeks, the administration is expected to request about $80 billion to cover those costs.
 The president's approach to domestic programs is illustrated in the way he balances competing claims at the Centers for Disease Control.
 Mr. Bush requests money to expand a national stockpile of vaccines and antibiotics. But the public health emergency fund of the centers, which helps state and local agencies prepare for bioterror attacks, would be cut 12.6 percent, to $1 billion.
 In the event of an attack, states could use that money to distribute drugs and vaccines from the stockpile -- for example, by conducting a mass immunization campaign against smallpox, anthrax or other infectious agents.
 Kim A. Elliott, deputy director of the Trust for America's Health, a nonprofit advocacy group, said, ''It's robbing Peter to pay Paul when you build up the national stockpile at the expense of bioterrorism preparedness activities at the state and local level.''
 Administration officials acknowledged that some of the proposed cuts would affect high-priority programs. But they said that the budget this year was exceptionally tight and that, in some cases, several programs served the same basic purpose.
 Over all, the president's budget would reduce the Department of Health and Human Services' discretionary spending -- the amounts subject to annual appropriations -- by 2.4 percent, to $68 billion, according to the documents, obtained from budget analysts who oppose the cuts. Those figures do not include Medicare costs, which will increase sharply with the addition of a prescription drug benefit in 2006.
 A Public Health Service program for ''chronic disease prevention and health promotion'' would be cut by 6.5 percent, to $841 million in 2006. The program finances efforts to prevent and control obesity, which federal health officials say has reached epidemic proportions. 
 The president's budget would also eliminate a block grant that provides $131 million for preventive health services. Under federal law, the money is used to ''address urgent health problems,'' which vary from state to state.
 Under the president's request, the budget of the National Institutes of Health, which doubled from 1998 to 2003, would rise by 0.7 percent, to $28.7 billion next year. That is much less than what would be needed to keep pace with the costs of biomedical research, which are rising more than 3.5 percent a year.
 For the National Science Foundation, Mr. Bush will request $5.6 billion in 2006, an increase of 2.4 percent, budget documents show. Mr. Bush requested an increase last year as well, but Congress ended up making a small cut in the agency's budget for this year.
 At the Food and Drug Administration, buffeted in recent months by concerns about drug safety, the budget would increase by 4.5 percent, to $1.9 billion. Most of the $81 million increase would go toward the evaluation of prescription drugs and the inspection of food shipments.
 Mr. Bush says he wants a community health center in every poor county. The budget would increase spending for such clinics by 17.5 percent, to $2 billion. Budget officials said these clinics would care for 16.4 million people next year, up from 14 million this year.
 The president is also seeking $718 million for a new effort to enroll more children in Medicaid and the Children's Health Insurance Program. Millions of uninsured children are eligible but not enrolled.
 Budget documents also include these domestic proposals:
The budget for training nurses, dentists and other health professionals would be cut 64 percent, to $160.5 million in 2006. The president would cut $100 million, or 33 percent, from a $301 million program that trains doctors at children's hospitals.
 Mr. Bush seeks a $38 million increase in programs promoting sexual abstinence, which would bring the total to $192.5 million in 2006, an increase of more than 50 percent since 2004. 
 The Low-Income Home Energy Assistance program, which helps people pay their heating bills, would be cut 8.4 percent, to $2 billion. High prices for home heating oil make this a particularly contentious proposal.
 The Centers for Disease Control would receive $306 million, a 4.2 percent increase, for global health activities, including work on AIDS.
 Mr. Bush requests $120 million to deal with the threat of a global flu epidemic. That represents an increase of 21 percent.
 The budget would also eliminate a $9 million program for the treatment of people with traumatic brain injury and a $9.9 million program to collect stem cells from blood found in the umbilical cord after childbirth. Scientists say such cells may prove useful in the treatment of many diseases, and do not raise the ethical issues involved in taking stem cells from human embryos.
 Mr. Bush said Friday that he would curb spending for political as well as fiscal reasons. ''People in Congress on both sides of the aisle have said, 'Let's worry about the deficit,''' he said in Omaha as he campaigned for his Social Security plan. ''I said, 'O.K. we'll worry about it again.' My last budget worried about it. This budget will really worry about it.''
 Echoing a vow made in his State of the Union address, Mr. Bush said: ''We're going to eliminate or vastly reduce 150 programs that aren't meeting needs, aren't meeting priorities and are not getting the job done. It's time to be wise with the people's money.''
 At the Treasury Department, Mr. Bush is seeking an increase of $500 million, or 7.8 percent, to police compliance with the tax laws. That would increase the enforcement budget of the Internal Revenue Service to $6.9 billion. The Treasury said the additional money would be used to examine more tax returns, collect past due taxes and investigate cases of tax avoidance.
 The Defense Department is proposing to cut $55 billion from various programs over the next six years, with most of the reductions in the later years. Even so, the Pentagon budget is projected to exceed $500 billion by 2011.
 The Pentagon intends to buy fewer FA-22 fighter jets, DD(X) destroyers, Virginia-class attack submarines and LPD-17 amphibious ships, used by the Navy to transport marines. It also plans to retire one of the Navy's 12 aircraft carriers, which Navy officials have said will be the carrier John F. Kennedy, based in Mayport, Fla. 
 The cuts are partly offset by $25 billion in increased spending for the Army, as it restructures its forces to rely on more readily deployable brigades instead of much larger divisions.

HEADLINE: Skiing Where Apaches Once Took Refuge

BYLINE: By MARIA FINN DOMINGUEZ

 BODY:
AT Ski Apache, near Ruidoso, N.M., a gondola slips up the mountainside to the highest point of the resort, at 11,500 feet on the north ridge of the Sierra Blanca. To the northwest you can see the Trinity Site, where the first atomic weapons test was conducted in 1945. To the south, on a clear day, Ciudad Juarez at the Mexican border is visible, and looming over Ski Apache like a benevolent guardian is the Sierra Blanca Peak, at 11,973 feet above sea level. 
 Most of the trails from this part of the mountain are intermediate and advanced level, passing through the Apache Bowl or snaking through the spruce forest. Shiny crows fly along the treetops, rustling snow that falls in clumps. The thin dry air smells of pine.
 On the mountain, signs mark the runs with names like Ambush and Geronimo, a reminder of the time just over a century ago when Apache war parties clashed with federal troops nearby. Ski Apache is owned and operated by descendants of Geronimo, perhaps the most famous Apache warrior. 
 For those who want to share the slopes with ace skiers sporting the latest fashions, Ski Apache is not the mountain of choice. But those who prefer to ski in the land where Billy the Kid hid out, Kit Carson worked as a scout and where wild horses and elk still occasionally amble across the ski runs, Ski Apache is the place to go. And watching Apaches teach Texas ranchers how to ski is a pleasure in itself. 
 Indeed, according to Jeanette Lester, a Ski Apache employee, many of the people on Apache's slopes on a weekend in December hailed from flat, dry places not known for downhill skiing. Families often cross the border from Mexico for a weekend of skiing. 
 People from the military drive over from White Sands Missile Range, Cannon Air Force Base near Clovis, N.M., and Fort Bliss, in El Paso. Second Lt. Glenn Simpson, 24, who returned from a tour in Iraq in late September, is based at Fort Bliss. He drove up on a day off. ''When I'm not laying in the snow, I love this,'' he said. ''But I found that falling is the fastest way to stop.''
 Skiing is not a part of the traditional culture of the Apaches, who lived in the desert and went into the mountains for water and game, as well as for healing and rite-of-passage ceremonies. ''Apaches were nomadic desert people,'' said Ronald Cheromiah, known as Moose, a member of the tribe who is manager of the mountain's ski rental shop. ''So imagine what mountains meant. They were a refuge, a place to replenish. Not so different than now.''
 The Mescalero purchased the ski resort, then called Sierra Blanca, from a private owner 41 years ago to create more economic opportunity for the tribe. The resort is partly on the Mescalero Reservation and partly on United States Forest Service property. Brian Parrish, director of marketing for the Mescalero hospitality industry, said that Ski Apache trains Apaches about the business and nonmembers of the tribe about Apache culture.
 These days, Ski Apache is just one of a number of Apache holdings in the Ruidoso area, including the Apache Casino, the Inn of the Mountain Gods resort, which has currently been rebuilt with an 18-hole golf course, among other amenities. The tribe also operates cattle ranches, a saw mill, a fish hatchery and a telecommunications business on the reservation. 
 The Mescalero Reservation is just over 460,000 acres of mostly forested land; it is adjacent to the Lincoln National Forest. The ski resort is approximately 34 miles by road from the town of Mescalero in the reservation. 
 Mr. Parrish estimates that members of the tribe make up 38 percent of the tourism workforce. But some local people say that tourism and Apache customs don't always naturally mesh.
 ''People think that natives aren't friendly,'' said Ms. Lester, a 54-year-old Mexican American who married into the tribe. She works as a kind of mobile concierge for Ski Apache.
 ''But it is considered rude to look people in the eye and address them directly,'' she said, referring to the Apaches. ''There's no greeting like 'How are you?' since an Apache doesn't answer for him or herself, but for their entire family -- that's what being part of a tribe is, you think of everyone who came before you.''
 The Apache tribes, who once roamed much of the territory northern Mexico, West Texas, Arizona and New Mexico, were hunters, well adapted to their desert environment. They earned a reputation as fearless warriors with remarkable endurance. 
 Geronimo battled both United States and Mexican forces in the 1870's and 1880's, after the Apaches' original reservation was abolished and the tribe was removed to the San Carlos Agency in New Mexico. He eventually became a national celebrity, appearing at the St. Louis World's Fair in 1904 and in Theodore Roosevelt's inaugural procession the next year; he wrote an autobiography and died under military confinement in Fort Sill, Okla. 
 In 1936, under the Reorganization Act of Congress the three Apache tribes -- the Mescalero, the Lipan, and the Chiricahua -- were consolidated onto the Mescalero Reservation. According to Mr. Parrish, there are 4,000 Apaches on the reservation. 
 Ellen Bigrope, 65, is a tribal elder and curator at the Mescalero Cultural Center on the reservation. Located on U.S. 70, 17 miles southwest of Ruidoso, this small museum houses varied collections of the area's plants along with brief descriptions on how they were used by the tribe for religious and medicinal purposes. 
 A collection of woven baskets for storage and rifles used during the Apache resistance to the United States troops are also on display, along with vintage and more current photos of the tribe.
 ''I think tourism is good for the tribe,'' Ms. Bigrope said. ''It creates jobs, and it helps us economically, which helps us educate our children. Our language was always oral, but those of us who speak Apache got together and created a dictionary, so that our young people can learn the language. Knowing the language and religion kept us strong in the past.''

FOOD, SHELTER AND SLOPES
 Ski Apache is six miles north of Ruidoso, N.M., on Highway 48. The season runs from Thanksgiving until early April, with the best conditions generally January through March. Lifts are open from 8:45 to 4. For updates on snow conditions, go to www.skiapache.com. Lift tickets for a full day, $49; age 12 and under, $31. On Feb. 19 and 20, add $3 to the lift rates. Ski rental is $19 a day; children, $12. 

WHERE TO STAY
 The Upper Canyon area in Ruidoso has lots of lodges and plenty of cabins that include kitchenettes and wood-burning fireplaces. More information is on the Web at www.uppercanyon.com. One good option is the Story Book Cabins, 410 Main Road, Ruidoso, (888) 257-2115, or at www.storybookcabins.com. Prices range between $99 and $189 and include cabins with one to six bedrooms, with fireplaces; some have Jacuzzi baths. 

WHERE TO EAT
 Tucked into a back road on the Mescalero Reservation is Old Road Restaurant, (505) 464-4674, which may serve the best huevos rancheros ($4.25) in the Southwest. When traveling south on Highway 70, look to your right for a small green sign that says ''Old Road,'' turn right and drive until you come to a small adobe restaurant decorated with clusters of dried chili peppers.
 For more Southwestern-style food, Casa Blanca, 501 Mechem Drive in Ruidoso (505) 257-2495. With a choice of green chili, chipotle and red chili sauces over enchiladas ($6.95 to 8.95) or as sauces for carne asada, $19.95, this food is a great way to warm up. Margaritas run between $4 to $6.50.
 The Texas Club Grill and Bar on 212 Metz Drive, (505) 258-3325, in Ruidoso offers Angus beef prepared in almost every possible way. Entrees range from a ''top rail sirloin'' at $15.95 to porterhouse at $31.95. Open Wednesday to Sunday for dinner only.

GETTING THERE
 Ruidoso has a small regional airport for private planes, but most people travel from either Albuquerque to the north, via I-25 and U.S. 380, or El Paso to the south, using U.S. 54 and U.S. 70. MARIA FINN DOMINGUEZ

 CORRECTION:
Because of an editing error, an article on Feb. 6 about an Apache-run ski resort near Ruidoso, N.M., misstated the location of the San Carlos Agency in the 1870's. The agency, a unit of the Bureau of Indian Affairs that provides services to the White Mountain Apaches, was in the Arizona Territory, not New Mexico.

HEADLINE: The Sport of the Deal

BYLINE: By PETER BONEPARTH; As told to Patricia R. Olsen.

 BODY:
I GREW up a mile from where I now live in Lawrence, N.Y. My children attend the same private school I did. My father was in the retail furniture business. During most vacations and many summers, I worked in his stores, either on the sales floor or delivering goods. Those experiences gave me an appreciation of the value of hard work and a general feeling for retail, customer satisfaction and the importance of execution in any business. 
 I never entered law school out of a burning desire to enter a courtroom. I attended for the legal training, which I knew would round out my economics and political science undergraduate education. In 1984, when I graduated from the University of Virginia Law School, there were four or five opportunities for every law school graduate. I accepted a position with Shea & Gould because I'm a big sports fan and they represented the Yankees. 
 I learned how to negotiate in that position. Donald J. Trump has referred to the negotiating process as the art of the deal; I would call it the art of compromise. 
 In 2001, when I was chief executive of McNaughton Apparel Group, we were in talks to sell the company to Jones. I was negotiating with Wes Card, the chief financial officer at Jones. The bankers put us in an airless room with no windows and pitiful food and basically said, ''Don't come out until you reach an agreement.'' Both of us were bluffing. We were down to a 50-cent difference in share price, and it was a question of who would blink first. In the end, we split the difference. Wes is still chief financial officer at Jones, so now we're on the same team. 
 But I always think back to 1987 and my first job on Wall Street, when I was part of a transaction that failed. I helped raise money for a transportation company that went bankrupt within the year. I was 26 and I thought, ''Oh my God, are they going to can me?'' But they didn't. You learn so much more from failure than from success. I learned that projections are just projections, and that management is critical. 
 Recently I had a lesson in how things can get misinterpreted in different cultures. We're developing an office in Hong Kong, and it's clear that the employees there are trying to please. But one of the American-educated managers took me aside and said the staff was having problems with e-mail from the United States. They weren't picking up on the nuances in e-mail. As a result, we decided to have more face-to-face meetings. 
 I try to show Jones employees that everyone needs a life. If people see a boss chained to a desk, it makes them feel uncomfortable about doing other things. Saturdays and Sundays are totally devoted to my family. All three of my children play sports, so my wife and I spend our weekends traveling to their games. During part of the McNaughton Apparel Group meetings, I was at my older daughter Caroline's soccer game when my cellphone rang. It was from an investment banker who was in the thick of negotiations with Jones. 
 My daughter was 13 at the time, and the score was 0 to 0 in overtime. Just then she got the ball and started on a breakaway down the field. I told the banker, ''I can't talk to you now,'' and hung up. 
 I used to coach her soccer team, but there came a point where I had to step out. When I saw how serious she had become, I knew it was time for someone else to take over. 
 My wife, who was my first and only girlfriend in my adult years, worked in investment banking. While we talk about Jones's acquisitions, the only opinion she might offer is on the fit of a certain pair of Anne Klein pants. 
 Both my teenage daughters are athletes first and fashionistas second, but they thought our recent acquisition of Barneys was cool. All my 10-year-old son wants to know is when we're going to buy Nike.

HEADLINE: The Dragon for Trade, the Eagle for Safety

BYLINE: By JAMES BROOKE

DATELINE: TOKYO 

 BODY:
IN the eyes of Shintaro Ishihara and others here, Japan used to be too meek and mild, allowing an overbearing United States to push it around. Mr. Ishihara was one of the authors of the best seller ''The Japan That Can Say No,'' a call for national spine-stiffening that framed the foreign policy debate here in the 1990's. One of Japan's responses was to build a thriving relationship with China, whether Washington liked it or not.
 Now Mr. Ishihara and Japanese nationalists like him are at it again, but in reverse. It's an overbearing China that needs to be told no, they say; the alliance with America should be nurtured. 
 The latest rallying point involves the economic rights to a large swath of the Pacific Ocean around an uninhabited Japanese atoll 1,100 miles southwest of Tokyo. Mr. Ishihara, now the governor of Tokyo, briefed Prime Minister Junichiro Koizumi last week on a plan to cement Japan's claim to the ocean rights by building a power plant near Okinotori Island and encouraging commercial fishing. 
 ''We will conduct economic activities there,'' the governor said. ''We will not let China say anything about it.''
 That kind of talk breaks with the stereotype of modern Japan's make-no-waves foreign policy and is all the more remarkable considering the huge economic stake Japan has in China. Long the leading destination for Japanese foreign investment, China last week displaced the United States as Japan's biggest single trading partner.
 But China's ''peaceful rise'' makes Japan nervous. It has reacted by building up its lukewarm partnership with the United States into a rock-solid alliance. One major step was to send troops to help the American-led coalition in Iraq, overcoming deep qualms about overseas deployment. 
 ''The Japanese government has been greatly emboldened by the perceived success of the alliance with the United States in the last few years,'' said Takashi Inoguchi, a Tokyo University professor of international politics.
 There is little love lost between Asia's two economic titans. Japan lobbies Europe and Russia not to sell advanced weapons to China's military; China opposes Japan's aspirations to a seat on the United Nations Security Council. China fumes at Japan's friendly relations with Taiwan; Japan wonders why it is giving aid to a nation that has a program to put a man on the moon. 
 For years, Japan reflexively smoothed over any frictions with China. But its patience may be spent. Last November, Japanese destroyers chased a Chinese submarine from the waters around Japan's southernmost islands; in December, Japan formally identified China as a potential military threat. Ignoring Chinese objections, Japan welcomed Lee Teng-hui, a former president of Taiwan, on a visit last month, and the Dalai Lama is expected in April. 
 Over the last 25 years, Japan has provided China with nearly $30 billion in development loans, a fact rarely mentioned in China's press. During his four years in office, Mr. Koizumi has cut development aid to China in half, and he is now considering halting it entirely: ''I think it's graduation time,'' he told reporters recently.
 Behind Japan's new attitude is a new postwar generation of politicians, led by Mr. Koizumi and Shinzo Abe, currently his most likely successor. They believe World War II should no longer haunt Japan's relations with its neighbors. But they see in China a growing unwillingness to let it go. 
 The 1989 Tiananmen Square crackdown and its aftermath led many Japanese to conclude that China's leadership intends to hold on to power by replacing Communism with a distinctly anti-Japanese nationalism. Surveys of Chinese teenagers and young adults find them much more anti-Japanese than their parents and grandparents. 
 Those attitudes and China's bias in favor of sons, which by 2020 may produce a population with 40 million more young men than young women, could be a combustible mixture. A taste of the danger came at a China-Japan soccer match last August in Beijing. Chinese fans screamed, ''little Japan, petty Japan'' at television cameras and then rioted after the game, burning Japanese flags and spitting at Japanese fans. 
 Many Japanese suspect that the Chinese authorities allow such incidents as a way to let off steam in a politically closed society. ''The masses sense they can pretty much get away with anything when Japan is the target,'' wrote Yoichi Funabashi, Japan's leading foreign affairs columnist.
 Ma Licheng, an independent Chinese academic, wrote in Japan Echo magazine: ''The fact is that China has nothing to fear from Japan today; indeed, it is the Japanese who regard China with trepidation. The doctrine of the 'Chinese threat' is gradually taking hold in Japan.''
 Japanese leaders increasingly talk of the relationship with the United States as overridingly important. ''The future of Asia will be decided by the two-way balance between China and the U.S.-Japan alliance, not a trilateral balance among the three countries,'' Hisahiko Okazaki, a retired Japanese diplomat, said in an interview. ''What is Japan's China policy in the future? Strengthen the U.S.-Japan alliance. What do to about North Korea? Strengthen the U.S.-Japan alliance.''
 The emerging dynamic with China is often described here as ''cold politics, hot economics.'' Some 18,000 Japanese companies have operations in China now, about twice as many as a decade ago. Matsushita Electric Industrial, parent of Panasonic, expects to hire more Chinese college graduates this year than Japanese graduates. 
 But Japanese business leaders worry that frosty political relations and street-level hostility are undermining Japan's economic appeal in China. Beyond sporadic calls for boycotts of Japanese goods, they see a threat to big contracts. Last fall, an order for high-speed trains was cut to $1 billion, half the expected amount, after a lightning Internet campaign protested Japan's ''involvement in China's railway industry.'' Unnerved officials in Beijing ordered the protest Web site shut down.
 Over the long term, the economic trajectories of the two countries are clear. Barring catastrophes, ''China will become the sole leader in Asia, with Japan as an important subordinate,'' Toyoo Gyohten, a Japanese business leader, warned in a speech last fall. 
 Mr. Gyohten questioned the wisdom of antagonizing China out of pique over Chinese harping on World War II. ''Many Japanese believe they have already apologized,'' he said. ''But I, for one, believe that we should apologize as many times as possible.'' 
 But for Mr. Koizumi, Mr. Ishihara and their generation, there is a statute of limitations on contrition. As Jeffrey Kingston, director of Asian Studies at Temple University Japan, said in an interview: ''This is a Japan that doesn't flinch any more.''

HEADLINE: Where All the Neighborhood Is a Stage

BYLINE: By ADA CALHOUN

 BODY:
THE industrial corner of Brooklyn located about five minutes from the East Village by L train is known as a haven for Orthodox Jews and art school hipsters. In the 1990's, it became home to an alternative gallery district. But over the past few years, Williamsburg, Brooklyn has also evolved into something else: a full-fledged theater district. Call it Off Off Off Broadway.
 A decade ago, there were loft parties and shows by the fledgling Bindlestiff Family Cirkus, a neo-vaudeville troupe that now has a national following, but that was about it. Now, within this ten-block radius of nondescript warehouses, there are more than a dozen spaces devoted to theatrical work, showcasing nearly every type of theater, dance or performance. Indeed, the area is becoming so popular, that some habitues are worried that they will soon be priced out. ''When I saw the bodega across the street turn into a realty office last week, I started to get nervous,'' says Michael Gardner, a co-founder of The Brick Theater.
 Perhaps. But for now, Williamsburg is having its avant-garde moment, showing off edgy work and barely advertising it, confident that the in-the-know 20- and 30-somethings will still show up. 
 The Charlie Pineapple Theater on North Eighth Street, with its dedicated young founders, its tiny makeshift atmosphere and multiple personalities, is an example of one type of new venue. The theater's founders, Sarah and Mark VanDerBeets, are a disarmingly earnest couple devoted to dramatic revivals. Sarah, a dancer, and Mark, an actor, met at college in Santa Cruz, Calif. in the early 90's and moved to New York in 2000, settling in Williamsburg after a brief stay in a Brooklyn Heights sublet and then a year or so in East Harlem. A year and a half ago, they found this building, turning one of the front rooms into a theater and the back studio into an apartment where they now live with their two-year-old son, aptly named Charlie.
 The 45 plush red seats were donated by a theater in Alabama, the shiny wood floors by their ''fantastic landlords'' and the name, from an enigmatic card that Ms. VanDerBeets found among her grandfather's belongings, that read: ''Ask for Charlie Pineapple.'' The couple raised the money for the space using credit and savings, and they sustain it through donations and local advertisements (the program for the theater's recent production of ''Of Mice and Men'' could serve as a Williamsburg Yellow Pages). Mr. VanDerBeets says of their advertising scheme: ''We're pretty heavy on the sandwich board and chalk.'' Also to raise money, they sublease one of the front rooms to a lighting designer and by day offer dance and yoga classes in the theater. 
 Next month, they plan to stage Sam Shepard's ''True West,'' which had an abortive run two years ago at the couple's first theater, a block away. That space was shut down, midseason, for fire-code violations. (Now they point repeatedly to the new theater's clearly marked exits.) 
 The Brick, a 75-seat theater on Metropolitan Avenue, is a production by another energetic duo, Robert Honeywell and Michael Gardner. The space, which was at one time an auto-body shop, shows dance and theater as well as a monthly performance series called ''Brick-a-Brac'' featuring local performers. This summer they hosted the Hell Festival, which included original work in addition to readings of Hell-related texts like ''Faust;'' the Moral Values Festival -- listed as a performance festival for the morally questionable, morally perverse and morally bankrupt -- is on deck for next summer, inviting work from synchronized swimmers as well as playwrights. 
 Williamsburg is also headquarters to two experimental theater groups cultivated by members of the now legendary Wooster Group: Radiohole and Collapsable Giraffe. Collapsable Hole, as the groups have named their shared space, is a spare industrial box except for all the techie gadgetry. A dazzling array of video equipment makes possible shows like Collapsable Giraffe's ''Meat Is Floating By,'' in which company members acted out a nonlinear play in a camera-lined room that had been constructed onstage. 
 The audience, seated on risers not far from the action, caught only occasional glimpses of the performers, but had constant view of them on a live video feed. At one point, the garage door leading out to the street was thrown open and the audience had to figure out that the show was over. When they wandered out to the deserted street, the actors had vanished except for a message on the sidewalk in chalk that signaled their departure. The group's next show, ''Letters from Earth,'' an experimental theater piece inspired by interviews with conspiracy theorists and by Mark Twain's novella ''Letters from the Earth,'' in which Satan writes to Michael and Gabriel about how strange humans are, opens in March.
 With no signage, the Hole is also almost impossible to find if you don't know where you're going. While the theater sometimes shows up in listings magazines, many other Williamsburg spaces publicize only through insider e-mail blasts from sites like Jeff Stark's Nonsense NYC (www.nonsensenyc.com). 
 The exception may be the neighborhood's most successful venue, Galapagos Art Space,the Williamsburg version of P.S. 122 and its Show Nightclub rolled into one, with a reflecting pool at the entrance and fresh lilies in the restrooms. The club's two stages feature musicians, films, performance art and variety shows, like the long-running Monday Night Burlesque.
 Meanwhile, the choreographer Elizabeth Streb, who has been presenting what she calls ''action work'' in New York City since 1976 and is the recipient of a MacArthur grant, has taken up residence in a huge warehouse on North First Street. The Streb Laboratory for Action Mechanics, or SLAM, has 30-foot ceilings, from which hangs a flying trapeze. 
 SLAM is nearly always open to the public. On one recent week day, a drop-in audience member was treated to rehearsals of Ms. Streb's company's next show. Dancers were flinging themselves onto spring-based tumbleboards and bouncing off like rubber balls. Ms. Streb watched from a table as dancers tried running from opposite directions and throwing themselves onto the boards simultaneously without killing each other. 
 The performance space Monkey Town will reopen in May after renovations are completed on a its fancy new space, which boasts a minimalist Japanese aesthetic. Montgomery Knott, the handsome, hatted man who runs that space, says his new theater will seat only 32 in order to give audiences that lovely feeling of being nearly alone with artists. ''Anyone who's gone to a huge rock show or a giant museum exhibit knows that unless you have the perfect seat or the backstage pass or the preview ticket, your experience is colored by your level of discomfort,'' explains Mr. Knott. ''In our space, every seat is privileged by our economy of scale.'' 
 On the other end of the size spectrum, a 7,500-square-foot club called Supreme Trading opened across from Charlie Pineapple in October with a pledge to stage all manner of entertainment, including theatrical work. And as recently as late January, the concert organizer Todd Patrick (better known as Todd P.) announced on his Web site (http://toddpnyc.com) that he is starting a new, as yet unnamed, ''DIY art/show'' space in Williamsburg.
 Some worry that Williamsburg's success as a new theatrical hot spot contains the seeds of its own demise, as the neighborhood becomes increasingly expensive. 
 ''Ultimately, and sadly, the struggle boils down to finances,'' said Marisa Beatty, the Executive Director of Williamsburg Art Nexus (or WAX), which recently closed after five years. ''I believe that the work of even the most promising creators suffers under the pressure to be the uber-manager -- choreographer, costume designer, public relations director, dancer, producer and technical director -- of your own show. Our cost of living directly feeds this cycle by making it nearly impossible to outsource these roles.'' While Ms. Streb has eight years left on her lease, most of the others' leases expire in the next two or three years, by which time, many believe, certain regions of Williamsburg will have been rezoned into residential areas. That proposed change would increase the already rampant construction of condominium apartments, and the march of the MacLaren strollers.
 Theater companies and producers in search of cheaper rents have already begun to move further and further east along the L line to Bushwick (referred to as ''East Williamsburg'' by residents in denial). It's a different, less diversified scene -- more slapdash, more rock 'n' roll. The two most important of these spaces are Asterisk and OfficeOps (a converted office building best known for its ''Rock 'n Rollerskate'' parties). 
 It's probably just a matter of time before Bushwick becomes the new Williamsburg, just as Williamsburg has arguably become the new Lower East Side.
 Ms. Huggans of Collapsable Giraffe is philosophical about the her group's near-inevitable exile: ''We love our space in Williamsburg,'' she says, ''but the second we can no longer find a good dive bar to drink at after rehearsal, we're out of here.''

HEADLINE: Abundant Energy Fuels Alberta's Economic Development and Growth in Influence

BYLINE: By CLIFFORD KRAUSS

DATELINE: CALGARY, Alberta 

 BODY:
There is an old joke in this oil-rich province where a cowboy hat and boots are always in fashion: What is the difference between Alberta and Texas? Alberta has better relations with the United States.
 Of course, that may be an exaggeration even in a province where tall tales are still told around the prairie campfire. But it is all the more telling at a time when the rest of Canada seems to be moving away from the United States in social and foreign policy -- and all the more relevant as Alberta comes into its own as an economic powerhouse.
 Alberta's premier, Ralph Klein, is the most vociferous national political figure on opposing same-sex marriage, promoting a partnership with the United States on a missile defense system and contending that the Kyoto Protocol on global warming could smother economic growth. 
 His newest crusade is to seek more private enterprise in Canada's public health care system, which, though ailing, remains an article of faith. 
 In May, he plans to hold an international symposium here to study the best elements of health care systems around the world, trying to spur a national debate over how to deal with growing waiting lists for medical tests and nonemergency surgery.
 Mr. Klein might be seen around the country as a bumptious figure of little consequence if not for the vast oil, natural gas and coal resources of his province. Those resources put Alberta at the center of Canada's economic growth and innovation, and make this out-of-step province an increasingly powerful cultural and social force to be reckoned with. 
 Alberta's 176 billion barrels of oil reserves are the greatest proven stock outside Saudi Arabia. But most of those reserves are in oil sands, a thick substance only profitable to extract and process when world energy prices are high as they are now. 
 With conventional oil reserves declining, demand in China growing rapidly and new extraction methods making oil sands cheaper to process, Alberta officials say time is on the side of a province that stands to grow all the more confident and assertive in Canadian politics.
 They predict that the one million barrels of oil a day produced from oil sands last year will rise to two million by 2010 and to three million by 2020. 
 ''You can paint a picture that sees Alberta doing better and better,'' said Charlie Fischer, president and chief executive officer of Nexen Inc., a global oil company based in Calgary that is investing in the latest technology to extract oil sands. ''As Alberta becomes stronger financially it will have more influence overall in Canada.''
 For now, Alberta appears increasingly at odds culturally and politically with liberal Canada. Its Bible Belt is alarmed by same-sex marriage, making the province one of only three in Canada that have so far not changed the definition of marriage to include gay and lesbian unions. It is the only province with a flat tax and no retail sales tax, and it proudly lowers personal and corporate rates year after year. The provincial government has privatized many public services and reduced social services to create the country's only provincial budget surplus in recent years.
 Alberta has the money to be innovative, and whatever direction it takes the rest of North America will be watching. The high oil prices and huge building projects to develop the province's oil sands are encouraging all sorts of economic activity.
 Calgary and Edmonton are already two of the fastest-growing Canadian cities, with sprawling suburbs, snarling traffic and growing research centers. Engineers, doctors, teachers and architects from around Canada are moving here for higher salaries. With the price of oil at almost $50 a barrel, Alberta received royalties of $7 billion last year. The amount is so large that the province can risk experimenting and a cutoff of federal health care money for breaking guidelines prohibiting the privatization of health care, a course Mr. Klein has hinted he may try.
 ''The province has a government with more money than it can spend,'' said Roger Gibbons, president of the Canada West Foundation, a policy research group in Calgary. ''Alberta has the chance to lead the country in health care reform. If the federal government cuts funding in retaliation, that's a financial loss Alberta can absorb.''
 With 3.2 million people, or slightly more than 10 percent of the Canadian population, Alberta remains far less influential than political powerhouses like Ontario and Quebec. But no province came close to its 10.3 percent population growth between the 1996 and 2001 censuses, and political scientists and businesspeople here predict that it is only a matter of time before Alberta reaches a tipping point of national influence.
 The newly united Conservative Party, the main opposition to the governing Liberals, was born out of Alberta politics, and its leader, Stephen Harper, comes from Calgary.
 ''I have a hunch that what you saw in the United States with power moving out from east to west and south, you'll see a little more here the emergence of a different power base,'' predicted Kevin Libin, editor of Western Standard, a new Calgary-based conservative magazine.
 The swing toward the west accelerated in the 1960's and 1970's, when corporate headquarters fled Montreal as Quebec threatened to secede from Canada. Toronto benefited most, and remains the national financial center. But Calgary also grew, though it had a deep recession when oil prices slumped in the late 1970's and early 1980's.
 Now, with Canadian business looking to Asia for markets, investment is moving west again -- to Vancouver, British Columbia, and to Calgary.
 The China connection is likely to grow in importance as Enbridge Inc. proceeds with a $2.2 billion pipeline to move 400,000 barrels of Alberta crude a day to the Pacific coast for export. Chinese investment in the project is considered likely.
 The biggest potential risk to Alberta's plans appears to be environmental concerns about global warming. Because oil sands require huge amounts of energy to extract, the provincial government and several energy companies are stepping up efforts to make the process cleaner.
 They include proposals to reuse and store greenhouse emissions like carbon dioxide, to recycle the byproducts of oil sands development and to produce cleaner burning natural gas from coal. ''That is the vision,'' said James Dinning, a former provincial treasurer and a businessman. ''The beautiful thing about Alberta is we like to experiment and try new and different things.''

A picture caption on Sunday with an article about economic growth in the Canadian province of Alberta referred incompletely in some copies to the location of the undeveloped land that was shown. And a correction in this space yesterday referred incorrectly to the city involved. The land is near Calgary; while that is one of Alberta's largest cities, the capital is Edmonton.

BYLINE: By DAVID CARR

DATELINE: MONTREAL 

 BODY:
THE search for the next big thing frequently ends up in small places. Hidebound by cloying commercial radio and clueless record executives, the American pop music scene has frequently depended on cities at the edges of the cultural map to provide a much-needed shot of originality. Seattle, Minneapolis, Austin, Tex., and Athens, Ga., have all served as temporary pivot points, churning out bands and defining the sound of the moment. Even Omaha had its 15 minutes not so long ago. The momentary consensus seems to come out of nowhere -- as if someone blows a whistle only those in the know can hear, and suddenly record executives and journalists are crawling all over what had previously been an obscure locale. 
 So which American city is the next stop on this fickle, itinerant history? It's a trick question for the time being, because the answer seems to be Montreal. 
 Not French Montreal, either: the next big pop movement will not involve accordions accompanied by crooning chanteuses. This one involves a coven of English speakers who have banded together up and down Boulevard St. Laurent in the Mile End neighborhood, filling lofts, community centers, bars and restaurants with sumptuous noise. Montreal, which leaves serious business to Toronto and revels its a work-to-live ethic, has drawn Anglophone from all over Canada to form bands, record labels and a full-blown scene. 
 The French speakers may own the town -- they are a 60 percent majority -- but English-speaking bands are the ones being heard beyond the city limits. Locked out for the most part by Quebec radio and television, at least a dozen Montreal acts are reversing the normal United States-Canadian cultural polarity, producing records that have American audiences and record companies paying rapt attention. The band Arcade Fire stormed into American consciousness last year with a grand, swelling, choir-inflected sound. Their transnational incursion has been accompanied by the catchy lyricism of Sam Roberts, the oddball pop of the Unicorns and the romantic goth-pop of the Dears, along with a host of other local bands. Vice magazine, a foul-mouthed, hilarious Montreal-bred phenomenon, is now in Brooklyn with a record label that includes hometown acts like the Stills and Chromeo. Toss in the more mainstream success of Simple Plan -- about two million units sold -- you can hear music with a Montreal address on any radio in America.
 The city shares a few key elements with temporary-musical-capital predecessors like Austin and Seattle. Being the biggest destination in a region almost guarantees an influx of musically inclined, disaffected young people to both play in and listen to bands. Bad weather helps, because it keeps songwriters inside and bands rehearsing. And perhaps most important, a nascent musical scene requires lots of cheap real estate for musicians and their fans to hang out and play in. 
 But in Montreal, those durable elements of musical invention are accompanied by a surprising political twist. Ten years ago, Anglophone-oriented money, people and resources pulled out -- much of it for Toronto -- leaving vacant buildings and a simmering conflict between the French and English speakers of Montreal. The threat of succession was supposed to end Anglophone viability in a majority French culture. 
 Instead, it seems to have led to an artistic regenesis. Minority groups working against a dominant culture have created lots of great music -- think of Jim Crow America or apartheid-era South Africa. But unlike those groups, Anglophones aren't so much oppressed as irritated by their inability to get booked in local clubs or played on Quebec radio. In the lexicon of high school cliques, the French speakers, who are bilingual whenever they want to be, are the cool kids. Anglophones are outsiders as a matter of course, always promising to work on their French, but mostly finding succor and affinity among other English-only speakers, who compose seven percent of the population of the city. 
 At the same time, Montreal's vaguely socialist and communitarian politics, along with the city's reputation for hedonism, has produced off-the-grid parties in lofts and musician-run clubs, and plenty of opportunities for new and challenging music to find an audience. On an absolutely frigid recent Tuesday -- a quiet night in the quietest time of year -- three no-name bands were creating a racket at the recently opened Le Divan Orange, en Anglais, merci. Hundreds of fans jammed their puffy coats in various corners. Even though Canadian liquor stores were on strike and the cigarette packs featured vivid portraits of diseased lungs, people were consuming both like recently escaped convicts. The bands shouted into the din, and the audience -- mostly -- listened. Dan Seligman, creative director of Pop Montreal, a four-year-old festival, suggested it was just another night in the city that cannot get enough of its musicians. ''We are a minority within a minority in Quebec,'' he said. ''Living inside a French bubble, the music is very important to the kids here.'' 
 Despite its countercultural vibe, Montreal's Anglophone music explosion enjoys government support. Through an agency called Factor -- the Foundation to Assist Canadian Talent on Records -- the government finances demos, videos and tours. Government-sponsored rock may sound like an oxymoron, but the Dears, the Stars and the Unicorns have applied for and received Factor funds. That kind of protective oversight, oddly juxtaposed with a punk rock, do-it-yourself ethic, makes Montreal a nice place for a young person with a guitar to land.
 In fact, most of the city's rock clubs on the Plateau, a historically immigrant neighborhood north of Sherbrooke, are filled with the work of artists -- the tax credit given to gallery space does not hurt -- and many of the people who play bass or spin records also paint. ''The Plateau is a little breeding ground,'' said Gene Pendon, a founder of the Heavyweight Art Installation, an artistic collaborative that paints pictures on the spot for various festivals and shows. 
 Of course, painter-bassist-performance artists don't earn much, but in Montreal, they don't need to, according to Daniel Webster, a local producer for more than 20 years who runs two clubs and a production company, and something of a godfather to the alternative rock scene. ''You can get by on very little here and put a lot into making your art,'' Mr. Webster said. And he said the conflict over language is overblown: ''It is our little secret that there really ended up being no insurrection here,'' he said. ''It's been peace, love and Jack Frost.''
 It helps that most musicians could care less about ''making it'' in the traditional sense. In fact, rather than lunging for a lavish advance, many of Montreal's most successful bands seem to resist the trappings of big industry. Consider the case of what may be Montreal's seminal musical success: GodSpeed You! Black Emperor, a dark-sounding, orchestral rock collective that has used its success to finance several local clubs and a record label. The band first emerged out of lofts and small bars, and despite a third record that sold 70,000 copies in the United States, they still have no major label contract, no management and no press agent. What the band does have is custody of their career.
 Efrim Menuck, a band member, suggested that Godspeed had achieved success in part because they kept their goals realistic.
 ''We are still paying the rent doing this silly music thing,'' he said. ''With all this attention, I worry for the bands. Someone who nails it right out of the gate and gets all of this attention, well, I rack my brain and I still can't think of a happy end to that story.''
 Howard Bilerman, a former drummer for Arcade Fire, an engineer and the overseer of Hotel 2 Tango, a recording space owned by members of GodSpeed You! Black Emperor, is similarly unimpressed by the current attentiveness of the American marketplace -- including an article in the February issue of Spin magazine that described the Montreal scene as ''officially cool.'' ''What is going on here will continue to go on long after the attention has gone elsewhere,'' he says. ''Giving back is an important part of cultural life here. History has shown that if you don't participate in the big music industry, you will have a much longer musical career.''
 And if you do, you may have a much shorter local career. Take the case of the Stills, alt-rock darlings who moved to New York for a stint and toured with the Yeah, Yeah, Yeahs, all of which earned them great American reviews, 83,000 American album sales and the enmity of their old, hometown fans. 
 On a recent Wednesday, they were in the midst of working on their next album in a rehearsal space they share with Sam Roberts -- the Dears practice down the hall -- in a massive industrial building that once served as the North American headquarters of manufacturing for RCA. The band is clearly enjoying making a new record and find quite a bit of humor in their current reputation as sellouts. ''It's not like we went gold or anything,'' said Oliver Crowe, the bassist. ''This city is renowned for its leftist politics. Any kind of success is going to be a problem.''
 Dave Hamelin, the guitarist, says he is proud that in a local newspaper poll, the Stills dethroned Godspeed as ''most pretentious local act.'' On their last album, ''Logic Will Break Your Heart,'' the band addresses their artistic and financial ambition on ''Of Montreal:'' with a lyric that suggests, ''Friends getting old, We all dig for gold, the crumbs and pieces.''
 Meanwhile, Montreal has become such a cultural magnet that some Americans are relocating there. ''We are a five hour drive from New York, and most of the flights are about $150,'' said Jon Berry, owner of Regenerate Industries, a public relations firm that works with various dance and electronic acts in Montreal, including Les George Lenigrad. ''From a cultural and economic perspective, it makes perfect sense. It is a cheap place to do business and to live.''
 Mr. Berry, who is from Vancouver, visited Seattle often when it broke through to national prominence, had a taste of Austin when it was bubbling, and says that the current rage in Montreal carries some of the same energy. ''Up until a few years ago, bands were skipping Montreal,'' he said, sitting at Laika, an industrial-feeling lunch spot/club on St. Laurent, where people were dining on pastries and cigarettes. ''But then shows started taking off in the lofts, and suddenly you have a big neighborhood full of people interested in music. It's like Williamsburg, but it hasn't been gentrified.''
 Jeff Waye is the player/coach of the Ninja Tunes Deadly Karate Chops, the hockey team of the North American division of Ninja Tune Records, a dance music label. It sounds like a caricature of Canadian life, but it is one of 25 coed teams, composed of music industry types, that compete every year for the Exclaim! Cup, an oddly shaped but coveted totem of excellence. In an interview before heading to practice, he agreed that Montreal was a paradise for indie musicians and the small labels that sell them. 
 ''You can argue that the push and pull of the two cultures have created something more dynamic than the rest of Canada,'' said Mr. Waye, who describes his own French as awful. ''But I think it's more simple than that. When I moved here in 1991, I was living in a nine-and-a-half room apartment with two other people, and I was paying $175 a month. All of the money left, and all of the art stayed.''

THE BANDS
 There has long been an incredible French-inflected music scene in Montreal. And let us further stipulate that there is a ferocious and vital industrial/dance scene. But right now, the dominant Montreal sound is a majestic kind of Anglo rock. 
 GodSpeed You! Black Emperors is instrumental to the scene and to the core, making baroque mood-rock that almost swings. The Arcade Fire makes American critics go all damp and sparkly. Whenever they show up, people mention the Talking Heads. 
 The Dears, both dismissed and praised as twee rockers, are smart boys and girls who mix dreamy, dancey instrumentation with wan, literate vocals. The Stills, the band their hometown loves to hate, plays guitar-driven, energetically sad songs. Their non-ode to songstress Alison Krauss is a classic. 
 The Unicorns are reportedly on hiatus -- O.K., broken up -- but you could do less well than to buy, their CD, ''Who Will Cut Our Hair When We're Gone?'' Sam Roberts, one of the few basement/loft acts to gain genuine mainstream acceptance, is the Canadian answer to Wilco.
 Les Georges Leningrad is not a threat to end up in heavy rotation on radio stations, unless the signal is coming from another dimension. Their beats are prominent, their screeching more so, but they are extremely charming performers. Wolf Parade produces heavily synthesized art rock, but with catchy choruses. The Stars are the local favorites and unreconstructed romanticists. Pony Up! seems to be composed of five of Liz Phair's little sisters. If you like your girl-rock crunchier, do not forget that Melissa Auf der Maur introduced all her shows on her last tour by proudly announcing she was from Montreal. DAVID CARR


CORRECTION-DATE: October 22, 2005

 CORRECTION:
An article last Sunday about the popular music scene in Montreal misidentified a possible factor in a rejuvenation of English-speaking culture in Quebec. It was the threat of secession, not succession. 
The Critics' Choice column on Oct. 10, about new CD's, included a review of the band Broken Social Scene and the album bearing its name. The review referred to ''other Montreal bands,'' ''the sound of 21st-century Montreal,'' the city's momentum and the band's ''Montreal exuberance.'' While a vibrant Montreal music scene indeed exists -- as described in detail in Arts & Leisure on Feb. 6 -- Broken Social Scene is not part of it; the band is based in Toronto. (An earlier correction, on Oct. 13, omitted an explanation of the Montreal references.

HEADLINE: China's Holiday Homecoming Creates Travel Nightmare

BYLINE: By JIM YARDLEY

DATELINE: BEIJING, Feb. 4 

 BODY:
At 10 p.m., when the hulking Beijing West Railway Station is usually emptying of passengers, Xie Wenzhong has arrived eight hours early for his morning train in hopes of beating the crowds. He can barely find a place to sit.
 Soldiers with bullhorns are shouting ''Move inside! Move inside!'' as passengers spill from stuffed waiting halls into the main concourse. The line for Shenyang in the northeast is five or six wide and nearly 100 yards long -- and that is for just one of 107 trains on the schedule. 
 ''I was afraid that if I came later, there would be no space to even stand,'' said Mr. Xie, 42, who, despite the inconvenience, seemed to enjoy the spectacle. ''It will be like this until morning.''
 Mr. Xie, an air-conditioning repairman, is one of a few hundred million Chinese trying to go home for the holidays. For the 40 days and 40 nights bracketing the Lunar New Year on Feb. 9, Chinese officials estimate that passengers will make nearly two billion total trips by car, bus, train, boat or airplane.
 It is probably the world's worst holiday traffic nightmare. For perspective, consider that the Department of Transportation estimates that the combined number of ''person trips'' Americans take for Thanksgiving, Christmas and New Year's Eve is 202 million.
 The strain is so great on China's transportation system that top leaders are rethinking what is still a relatively new phenomenon -- the vacation. The weeklong Lunar New Year holiday is one of three ''golden weeks'' of vacation introduced in 1999 by the State Council, or China's cabinet, to stimulate domestic spending in the Asian financial crisis.
 But last November, state media reported that a State Council study group was examining whether the weeklong holidays in May and October should be replaced by a more flexible system of paid vacation that would place less burden on the infrastructure. A decision could be made in March at the annual meeting of the National People's Congress.
 Notably, the proposals being floated appear unlikely to change the break for the Lunar New Year, also known as Spring Festival. It is the most traditional and revered Chinese holiday, when the tens of millions of people who have left villages for cities go home for family reunions and celebrations.
 It is also a human stampede from which few cities in this country of 1.3 billion people are spared. 
 In Beijing, the daily number of passengers is expected to reach 280,000 on peak days. In Shenzhen, a southern manufacturing hub, officials last month converted a sports stadium into a temporary ticket office to handle tens of thousands of migrant workers. Railway officials predict that the daily passenger load will exceed the system's capacity by up to 60 percent.
 ''It's like that American expression,'' said Huang Zhi, 22, a university student, describing a past Spring Festival train trip. ''We were packed in there like sardines.''
 This year, Mr. Huang's journey is fairly typical. He left his school in Harbin, the northeastern provincial capital, at 7 p.m. on a Thursday and made the nearly 600-mile trip to Beijing in 11 hours. He secured a seat on that leg of the journey. But in Beijing he could only buy a boarding ticket for the remaining leg to Guilin, his hometown, in the south. 
 That meant he would have to stand or squat in the aisle with hundreds of other travelers for a trip that would take 24 hours. ''There are people everywhere in the hallways, and people even standing in the connecting spaces between cars,'' he said. Others sleep in washrooms, he added.
 Liu Taiguo, 52, is one of the country's 120 million migrant workers, for whom Spring Festival is often the only visit of the year with his family. Last weekend, he clutched his ticket as he stood in a cranny of the Beijing West station that would be his home for the next two days.
 ''I'm staying here until my train leaves,'' he said on a Friday of his train, which was to leave Sunday. It meant he would spend 48 hours pulling his bag through the concourse before squeezing onto a packed train that would take 42 hours to reach his home in Sichuan Province.
 ''The train is so crowded,'' he said. ''There is nowhere to stretch your legs. But Spring Festival is the Chinese custom. For the family reunion, no matter how far away you are, you have to go home.''
 The glut of passengers seems to overwhelm whatever steps the government takes. The Ministry of Railways has increased the number of trains nationwide by a third, and Chinese airlines have added 1,000 extra flights. In Guangzhou in the southeast, officials opened an online train ticketing system that eased sales. Still, the state media reported that the demand for tickets outstripped supply by a ratio of four to one.
 The Ministry of Railways, sensing a public relations opportunity, has called for more money to update the system. It has also increased ticket prices for the holiday period by up to 20 percent, ostensibly to cut demand but driving up profits in the process.
 For most of the passengers pouring through the Beijing West station, the only thing that mattered was getting home. The sound of hundreds of pieces of luggage rolling over the marble floors of the main concourse created a steady hum as migrant workers pushed through carrying their clothes in plastic buckets. The buckets would double as seats for those relegated to the aisles.
 Tao Shiwu, 38, stood in Waiting Hall No.7 with his 3-year-old son, Weixin. The crowd was so thick that guards shouted at groups squatting on the floor to clear enough room for people to walk. Young Weixin wailed.
 Mr. Tao said he had no seat and was faced with holding the boy for more than 30 hours. He said he did not mind. He smiled, even when the boy burst into tears and screams.
 ''I can only stand in the aisle,'' Mr. Tao said, wincing. ''With my son, I'll play it by ear. This is his first trip.''

HEADLINE: Sentenced to Tourism

BYLINE: By SCOTT CHRISTIANSON. 
Scott Christianson, a former New York State criminal justice official, is the author of ''Condemned: Inside the Sing Sing Death House.''

 BODY:
WHEN the Westchester County executive, Andrew J. Spano, last month called on New York's Empire State Development Corporation to spend $5.8 million to convert part of the legendary Sing Sing prison into a museum, news reports around the world presented it as a curiosity piece. 
 Mr. Spano crowed that Sing Sing, while still functioning as a maximum-security prison, could attract tourists from all over the world, just like Alcatraz, the old federal prison in San Francisco that draws 1.5 million visitors per year. He said that a Sing Sing museum could generate $20.5 million a year in revenue, with half of that going directly into Westchester's economy. His news release calling for a museum cited a cannibal and other ''notorious villains'' who were put to death decades ago, before Sing Sing's famous electric chair was dismantled. 
 But the Ossining town supervisor, John Chervokas, who for several years has worked to develop a serious prison museum, winced. ''They make it sound like Madame Tussaud's Wax Museum,'' he said.
 Mr. Chervokas rightly argues that an interpretive center at one of America's oldest and most notorious penal institutions and execution places would, if properly done, prove educational. But given the sensationalist tone of Mr. Spano's announcement, that may not be what the powers that be have in mind. 
 That's unfortunate, because a museum at the institution that pioneered imprisonment for profit and was the site of 614 executions by electric chair, more than at any other American prison, certainly could do more than give a few cheap thrills to visitors. Sing Sing's history includes enlightened leaders like Warden Lewis Lawes, and its staff and prisoners have undergone many struggles for reform, including ending tortures like the ice-cold ''shower bath'' that inmates once routinely endured as punishment. 
 And in the age of Abu Ghraib, and when the United States imprisons more of its citizens than any other country in the world and still defends its use of capital punishment, we Americans have a lot of explaining to do -- not so much to foreign tourists but to ourselves.
 Every museum or theme park requires an underlying narrative. The questions here would be these: What story will be told? Whose voices will be heard?
 Unlike other prison museums, such as South Africa's Robben Island, this one isn't envisioned as a memorial to those who suffered. Instead, it's framed as the embodiment of ''progress.'' 
 According to the Sing Sing prospectus developed by local officials, the closest visitors would get to the real thing is entering the institution's former powerhouse after it's been turned into the Sing Sing Historic Prison Museum. There they could ''experience the power and the beauty'' of the original 1825 granite cellblock with its dark cells measuring 3 1/4 feet wide by 7 feet long and 6 feet 7 inches high.
 According to a detailed plan, ''The Interpretive Experience at Sing Sing Prison,'' prepared in 1999 by the New York-based firm DMCD, the museum would have displays about the institution's ''colorful'' history as well as a replica of the old death house, maybe even including the prison's original electric chair. Audiences would get to see selected images and experience a ''video visit with a condemned prisoner'' (who is an actor). In short, the content would be highly constructed and sanitized.
 Admission would cost $8 to $14. Considering the admission fee, most visitors would be affluent suburbanites and urbanites -- the population in this country who probably are among the least affected by prisons and most likely to benefit from reality-based education about them. The poor, it seems, would be expected to learn by experience.
 New Yorkers would do well to become more informed about Sing Sing's place in American history and culture. But there's more to it than lurid stories about infamous crooks. Prison history and executions shouldn't be treated like some kind of freak show or simplistic inspirational tale. Sing Sing can offer many lessons, provided we're wise enough to look.

HEADLINE: Something in the Air: Inflation

BYLINE: By DANIEL AKST. 
Daniel Akst is a journalist and novelist who writes often about business. E-mail: culmoney@nytimes.com.

 BODY:
IT'S back.
 The data don't necessarily reflect it. The markets don't believe it. Even the experts don't seem to see it coming, although the signs are all around them.
 But make no mistake: inflation is something to worry about again. The Consumer Price Index rose 3.3 percent last year, the most since 2000, when it was 3.4 percent. This time, however, the number really is the start of something. 
 So far, the conventional wisdom apparently hasn't noticed that inflation, though always with us, is gathering steam. Just look at the yield spread between regular Treasury notes and inflation-adjusted Treasury issues. Lately, 10-year Treasuries have been paying around 2.5 percentage points more than the equivalent Treasury inflation-protected securities, or TIPS. That difference is considered to be investors' expectation of the annualized inflation rate over the next decade. The same answer -- an average of 2.5 percent for 10 years -- was given by the professional forecasters surveyed by the Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia late last year.
 The University of Michigan's surveys show that consumers expect annualized inflation of 2.8 percent for the next five years, perhaps because the average consumer is less affluent than most Treasury investors or economic forecasters and pays more attention to the way homes, gasoline, groceries and other things have climbed in price. 
 Indeed, signs of increasing inflation are everywhere. Gold prices are up sharply since 1999 and will probably rise further this year, more than one analyst has predicted. Home prices have been rising for years, and while there may well be a bubble along the coasts, the climb in residential real estate prices will continue to beat 2.5 percent in the long run, driven by a growing population, restrictions on development, the desire for second homes, a real-estate-friendly tax code and inflation fear -- once it takes hold. 
 Energy and meat prices will also rise in coming years, if only because global affluence is spreading and is almost always associated with higher fuel and protein consumption. The price climb for medical insurance and prescription drugs will easily beat 2.5 percent as far as the eye can see, driven in part by an aging population. And college tuition will spiral upward as usual.
 Commodities will keep rising, too, thanks to booming demand from India and China -- itself a likely candidate for some serious inflation. Consider steel. The price of its main ingredient -- iron ore -- is expected to go up 30 to 50 percent in 2005 alone. And the cost of coking coal, used in steel-making, may double. Can anyone doubt that steel, and products made from it, will cost more this year?
 Red ink is also inflationary. The Congressional Budget Office says the fiscal 2005 federal deficit will hit $368 billion, not counting billions in additional military spending sought by the Bush administration -- which also advocates a costly plan for private Social Security accounts. Let's not even discuss Medicare. Does the phrase ''guns and butter'' ring any bells? 
 Speaking of red ink, the twin budget and trade deficits are driving down the dollar's value to levels that will buy us inflation. Sure, a weak dollar offers the comfort of making American exports more attractive, but it also raises the price of what Americans buy abroad -- and domestic substitutes are unlikely to materialize anytime soon because it still won't pay to invest in producing them here.
 Of course, inflation isn't supposed to happen anymore. Ever since Paul A. Volcker's epic conquest of inflation in the early 1980's, we have trusted vigilant central bankers to raise interest rates whenever it seems a threat. But raising rates as sharply as Mr. Volcker did when he was chairman of the Federal Reserve wouldn't be easy politically. A recession would result and, besides, it would be much easier for the government to pay off its mountainous debts in a moderately inflationary environment.
 Globalization is supposed to have killed inflation by always moving production to the lowest-cost area. But globalization has also given us a world awash in inflationary dollars, as well as the inflationary affluence of so many people in China and India. 
 How bad will inflation become? I'm not expecting any kind of run on those old Whip Inflation Now buttons from the Ford administration. Besides, a housing bust, an outbreak of peace in the Middle East or an economic crash in China could derail the inflation train for a while. Still, this may be a good time to ignore the wisdom of crowds by picking up some inflation-adjusted Treasuries.

HEADLINE: With backing from an Israeli billionaire, a Developer finds opportunity in disparate places

BYLINE: By WILLIAM NEUMAN

 BODY:
IN a little over two years, Shaya Boymelgreen, an Israeli immigrant who came to New York in 1969 to study at a yeshiva, has gone from being an obscure builder of low-rise apartment houses to become one of the city's busiest residential developers. 
 In partnership with Lev Leviev, an Israeli billionaire and diamond magnate, Mr. Boymelgreen has plans to build some 2,200 apartments in Manhattan, Brooklyn and Queens, at a total cost of more than $1.3 billion -- with more on the way. His buildings have attracted wealthy buyers and media attention, and along the way he has clashed with the city's powerful construction unions. 
 Three years ago, Mr. Boymelgreen's company had about 20 employees; now, as president of Leviev Boymelgreen, he oversees a staff of more than 200 (including six of his eight children). The new company, jointly owned by Mr. Boymelgreen and Africa Israel Investments -- the holding company for Mr. Leviev's real estate interests -- has also branched out to Miami and Las Vegas, with real estate investments there totaling more than $500 million. 
 But perhaps the most intriguing thing about Mr. Boymelgreen, 53, is his ability to see real estate gold in the most disparate places. In mid-December, Leviev Boymelgreen paid $170 million for 20 Pine Street, a 35-story office tower a block from Wall Street, which Mr. Boymelgreen plans to convert to luxury condominiums. 
 About a month later, the partners paid $8 million for a property on the Gowanus Canal in Brooklyn, the last piece in an assemblage of industrial parcels he hopes to turn into a hip village of 400 apartments beside the still-murky waterway. While he is a long way from getting zoning changes and myriad approvals, he has hired the cutting-edge architect Enrique Norten to start shaping the complex, complete with waterfront esplanade and sidewalk cafe, into a dream of urban reclamation. 
 Not every developer has the imagination to tackle two projects as economically and spiritually far apart. The common thread, it seems, is that, in its own way, each is helping expand what New Yorkers think of as livable neighborhoods.
 Richard Marans, a lawyer who handled the closing on the Gowanus property, said he has seen Mr. Boymelgreen plunge into risky ventures before, in fringe areas shunned by others. ''It's an example of his convictions, his vision for the market and where things are going to go and his ability to stand by those convictions,'' he said. ''You have to be a tough guy to do that. He's not afraid of the risk.''
 After buying their first building in August 2002, Mr. Boymelgreen has taken his partnership with Mr. Leviev from zero to 60 in a New York minute, embarking on an impressive variety of projects. 
 They are building a boutique hotel with 50 luxury apartments at Atlantic Avenue and Smith Street in downtown Brooklyn. And he is building the tallest building in Dumbo in Brooklyn, Beacon Tower, with 23 floors and 79 apartments, at 85 Adams Street.
 They have an agreement with the Empire State Development Corporation to turn the Empire Stores, a group of Civil War-era warehouses in Dumbo, into a Chelsea Market-like complex of shops and restaurants. 
 In Queens, they have plans to build on top of the historic RKO theater in downtown Flushing, to create some 250 apartments.
 And then there is Manhattan. Mr. Boymelgreen has pushed the fringes of TriBeCa, with a 68-unit development called River Lofts at West and Laight Streets. In trendy NoLIta, he is converting the former East River Savings Bank building at 60 Spring Street into 42 condos. He has changed the face of the financial district, hiring the flamboyant designer Philippe Starck to carry out the high-concept conversion of the old J.P. Morgan offices at 15 Broad Street into 326 condos with a view of the New York Stock Exchange across the street. 
 ''Right now he's one of the most active developers in the New York City area,'' said Richard Bassuk, president of the Singer & Bassuk Organization, a real estate investment banking and advisory firm that helped Mr. Boymelgreen put together tax-free Liberty Bond financing for yet another project: a 19-story, 352-unit rental building by the architect Costas Kondylis, under construction at 88 Leonard Street in TriBeCa. ''Shaya is an unusual guy,'' Mr. Bassuk said. ''He hasn't been on the screen for a very long time, but he's able to juggle a lot of things.''
 Pinchas Cohen, the chief executive of Africa Israel Investments, said the company is looking for even more deals in New York. ''We believe the market is strong and we want to be a part of it,'' Mr. Cohen said.
 The transformation of Shaya Boymelgreen began a little more than three years ago, in late 2001, on a Lubavitcher-sponsored cruise from Miami to the Caribbean. A friend introduced him to Mr. Leviev, an Israeli businessman born in Uzbekistan, who, like Mr. Boymelgreen, is a Hasidic Jew who belongs to the Lubavitcher movement.
 In Jewish circles Mr. Leviev is well-known for his philanthropy. In business circles he is known as the man who challenged the powerful De Beers diamond cartel and won. Thanks to his diamond business, which includes mines in Africa and a farflung cutting operation that is one of the largest in the world, Mr. Leviev was ranked at No. 277 last year on the Forbes magazine list of the world's richest people, with an estimated net worth of $2 billion. 
 Part of that fortune comes from Africa Israel, which has diversified in recent years into gasoline stations, swimwear, telecommunications and construction. The company was begun some 70 years ago by a group of Jewish investors from South Africa that bought land in Israel. It now owns property or does business in Israel, Russia, Eastern Europe, the United States, Canada, Angola and Namibia. Mr. Leviev bought a majority stake in the company seven years ago.
 Mr. Leviev and Mr. Boymelgreen hit it off during a walk on the beach in San Juan, Puerto Rico. By the end of the cruise, Mr. Leviev asked Mr. Boymelgreen if he was interested in forming a partnership to do business in the United States, where Africa Israel was looking for real estate opportunities. 
 Until then, Mr. Boymelgreen's real estate ventures had been successful, but on a more modest scale. He was born in Israel and came to New York in 1969 to study. He went into business, opening a religious bookstore in Brooklyn, working a diamond mine in the Brazilian jungle and then, in New York, running an asbestos-removal company. 
 In August 1991, his life intersected briefly with the broader life of the city. He was driving home to his house in Crown Heights, Brooklyn, one evening when he saw a man staggering in the street. He stopped and got out, and the man collapsed against him. ''I feel on my clothes this blood,'' Mr. Boymelgreen said. ''He held my hand and said, 'I'm scared, I'm scared.' I said, 'What's your name?,' and he said, 'Yankel.''' It was Yankel Rosenbaum, the Hasidic student who had just been stabbed in the Crown Heights riots. Mr. Boymelgreen comforted the wounded young man until an ambulance took him away. He wanted to go along to the hospital, but the police would not let him. He said he still blames himself for not being more insistent. Mr. Rosenbaum died after emergency room doctors failed to detect a chest wound and Mr. Boymelgreen feels that if he had been there he might have been able to demand the kind of care that could have saved his life. 
 In the mid-90's, Mr. Boymelgreen turned to real estate. He built his first building, with 35 apartments, on a lot at Avenue A and Third Street in Manhattan. 
 That was followed by another building on Avenue B (on a whim, he wired it with T1 lines for direct Internet connections, making it perhaps the first such apartment building in the city), then a condo conversion in Williamsburg, Brooklyn, a building on the Upper West Side, and the conversion of an old Daily News printing plant on Dean Street, in Prospect Heights, Brooklyn. Next came a conversion in Dumbo and several buildings on the fringes of Park Slope, off Fourth Avenue.
 But with the backing of Mr. Leviev and Africa Israel (they have called their joint company both A.I. & Boymelgreen and Leviev Boymelgreen), Mr. Boymelgreen took his game to another level. In August 2002, he made his first purchase with Africa Israel, paying $26.5 million for a group of adjoining properties between West and Washington Streets, north of Laight Street, in TriBeCa. One of the properties was a 19th-century warehouse that is being converted to condos. The rest of the parcel will hold a new 13-story building. He dubbed the complex River Lofts and hired the architects Ismael Leyva and Calvin Tsao to design it.
 The same month, he signed a contract to pay $36 million for 60 Spring Street, closing the deal the following January. And in May of 2003, he signed a $100 million contract for 15 Broad Street, which is being called Downtown by Philippe Starck. 
 That was only the beginning. Mr. Boymelgreen now oversees 15 projects financed jointly with Africa Israel in Manhattan, Brooklyn and Queens. 
 The former bank building at 60 Spring Street, a creation of the architect Cass Gilbert, is the first of the Leviev Boymelgreen projects to near completion, with 17 owners closing on their apartments last month. The 42 apartments, which were also designed by Mr. Tsao and Mr. Leyva, cost from $895,000 for a 936-square-foot one-bedroom, to $2.98 million for a two-bedroom with 2,063 square feet. They have dark Brazilian oak floors, flush baseboards, marble bathtubs, Bosch stoves with recessed hoods that slide out silently at the touch of a finger, and, in every unit, a safe. 
 Inevitably, however, there are growing pains. The Spring Street apartments were initially to have been delivered last spring, and time is the essential, invisible component of a developer's work. Delays of weeks or months can mean enormous extra costs as interest payments pile up on large construction loans. 
 Time was clearly on Mr. Boymelgreen's mind last month during a visit to River Lofts, the TriBeCa development, where about 125 workers bustled around the two buildings, old and new. ''Every day costs me over here,'' he told Alan J. Krause, his director of operations, urging him to coordinate the work of the many subcontractors to avoid delays. 
 Much of the work at River Lofts and virtually all of it at 60 Spring Street and several other projects has been done without union labor, and this has put Mr. Boymelgreen on a collision course with the city's construction unions. 
 Union members have held almost daily rallies outside 15 Broad Street --sometimes setting up a large inflatable rat -- and during a recent interview they could be heard chanting outside. Mr. Boymelgreen said he decided to handle the conversion of 15 Broad Street without union labor for the simple reason that it was cheaper that way and it allowed him to bring his condos to market at a more competitive price. 
 But pressure from the unions has clearly taken a toll. Mr. Boymelgreen says union protestors have threatened his workers. He accuses them of putting sugar in gas tanks and pouring cement down sewers. He says a bulldozer was stolen from the River Lofts site, and another disappeared from a construction site in Brooklyn. But he has done business with union contractors on some of his projects. Most notable is the building at 88 Leonard Street, an all-union job where work has begun on the foundation. 
 Edward J. Malloy, the president of the Building and Construction Trades Council of Greater New York, said he was unaware of any interference by union workers with Mr. Boymelgreen's projects. He said he hopes the two sides can work out their differences. ''He is a major new player in real estate in New York City,'' Mr. Malloy said. ''We would like to just hopefully convince him that building union has more positives than doing the work the way it's being done today.'' 
 Mr. Boymelgreen combines the bottom-line mind-set of all developers with an almost quixotic sensitivity that reveals itself in unexpected ways. At such moments, he seems blithely unaware of the fact that for many New Yorkers, developer is a dirty word. 
 Mr. Boymelgreen and his partners chose 20 Pine Street to piggyback on the success of Downtown by Philippe Starck, a block away. But instead of tapping Mr. Starck for a reprise, Mr. Boymelgreen said he is in talks with a well-known fashion designer to lead the team that will transform the office building into about 400 luxury condos. 
 It would have been easy, he said, to repeat the formula and simply do another Philipe Starck building. Easy, but boring. And then, too, there's the seduction of the new.
 ''It's second nature to a developer to do new things,'' Mr. Boymelgreen said. ''We're kind of artists, to come up with new things, new ideas. An artist paints the 'Mona Lisa,' he's going to do a second 'Mona Lisa'?''

Sales to Begin on Some of the Apartments
 SALES of apartments in several buildings developed by Leviev Boymelgreen are starting shortly. They are set to begin next month at the Nexus, a 12-story building with 56 condos going up at 84 Front Street, in Dumbo in Brooklyn. Scheduled for completion by the end of the year, the building will include one-, two- and three-bedroom units, from the mid-$400,000's to about $1.6 million, according to Elan Padeh, the chief executive of the Developers Group, which is handling sales. It can be reached at (718)222-1545. 
 Sales are expected to start on April 1 through the Corcoran Group for Beacon Tower, at 85 Adams Street in Dumbo, with 23 floors and 79 condo units. It will have one- and two-bedroom apartments, plus a three-bedroom penthouse, with prices starting at the mid-$500,000's for a one-bedroom. The building is scheduled to be completed in September 2006. 
 In downtown Brooklyn, the 50 condos in a building called the Smith, going up at the corner of Smith Street and Atlantic Avenue, are expected to go on sale in early May, according to Bassie Deitsch, the marketing and sales director for Leviev Boymelgreen. The building, which will also include a hotel, will have studios and one- and two-bedroom apartments and duplex penthouses. The Sunshine Group will market the apartments, which should be ready to be occupied in March 2006.
 In Manhattan, apartments at 20 Pine Street, a financial district office tower being converted to condos, will probably go on sale this summer. One block away, at 15 Broad Street, there are 52 apartments available at what the developer calls Downtown by Philippe Starck. They range from a 2,514-square-foot loft priced at $1.025 million, to a 3,730-square-foot two-bedroom that sells for $4.6 million. The sales office can be reached at (212)344-3200, or at www.downtownbystarck.com.
 In TriBeCa, two three-bedroom penthouses are available in the converted warehouse portion of River Lofts, at 424 Washington Street. A 3,119-square-foot unit is $4.1 million. The other, with 3,892 square feet, is $5.2 million. The Sunshine Group sales office is at (212)219-9700, and at www.riverlofts-tribeca.com. 
 Leviev Boymelgreen can be reached at (718)398-3200. WILLIAM NEUMAN

HEADLINE: An Interest Rate Rises, but Stocks Rally Again

BYLINE: By JEFF SOMMER

 BODY:
The stock market climbed for the second consecutive week, as investors became more sanguine about the Federal Reserve's intentions despite another increase in short-term interest rates on Wednesday.
 Several developments bolstered confidence in the markets. 
While Fed policy makers increased their benchmark short-term rate to 2.5 percent on Wednesday, they said they would remain ''measured'' in raising rates. A weak jobs report by the Labor Department on Friday led some analysts to conclude that the economy was not overheating. And remarks in London on Friday by Alan Greenspan, the Fed chairman, also provided some cheer. He suggested that government restraint combined with market forces could result in a decline in the American current account and fiscal deficits.
 For the week, the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index gained 31.67 points, or 2.7 percent, to close at 1,203.03. The Dow Jones industrial average climbed 288.93 points, or 2.8 percent, to close at 10,716.13. The Nasdaq composite index rose 50.83 points, or 2.5 percent, to close at 2,086.66.
 And even though short-term rates headed higher, the yield on the 10-year Treasury note dropped to 4.08 percent from 4.14 percent the previous week. JEFF SOMMER

HEADLINE: A Little Help on Illegal Aliens

BYLINE: By JAMES R. EDWARDS Jr.. 
James R. Edwards Jr., an adjunct fellow with the Hudson Institute, is co-author of ''The Congressional Politics of Immigration Reform.''

 BODY:
IN December, the Suffolk County executive, Steve Levy, asked federal immigration officials to assign eight immigration officers to his county or to give Suffolk's law enforcement officers direct access to databases that would allow them to determine the immigration status of people they arrested and to transfer custody of illegal aliens to federal authorities.
 Unfortunately, his proposal was met with a pointed lack of enthusiasm. Immigrant advocates and several politicians were outraged. They claimed that such a move would create unnecessary tension between local police officers and the immigrant community. And Washington simply responded to Mr. Levy's proposal with assurances that federal authorities would help the Suffolk police if the department called with a problem. 
 That's a shame. 
 Immigration -- both legal and illegal -- is reshaping Long Island. The 2000 census found that 154,144 Hispanic residents live in Suffolk County, up from 87,852 in 1990. While county-level figures aren't available, census figures show New York State's illegal alien population rising to 489,000 in 2000 from 357,000 in 1990. 
 And with illegal immigration have come problems. Day laborers have flooded the streets, unlicensed contractors have been on the rise and houses and apartments have become overcrowded, with many no longer meeting building code standards. Last year, more than 10 percent of those arrested in Suffolk County were illegal aliens. 
 Many politicians look the other way. Those who try to address immigration's undesirable aspects are quick to back down once words like ''racist'' and ''xenophobe'' enter the mix. 
 But there are human costs to not acting. For starters, tensions are bound to rise -- just look at Farmingville. Four years ago, a Mexican man, fleeing from a car accident, ran a red light and slammed into the side of a car, killing a 38-year-old woman and injuring her 8-year-old daughter. Charged with drunken driving and vehicular manslaughter, the man got his employer to post bail and then became a fugitive after his first court appearance. That same year, two men posing as contractors abducted and beat up two Mexican day laborers. And in July 2003, a group of teenagers firebombed the home of a Mexican family that reportedly was living legally in the United States. 
 There are financial costs, too. While regional figures are hard to come by, the business magazine Barron's recently reported that the nation's underground economy has swollen to almost $1 trillion. Much of the research was based on immigrant communities in the New York metropolitan area. And according to Bear Stearns, whose researchers were cited in the article, Long Island is experiencing serious growth in the undocumented labor force. This shadow economy robs local, state and federal governments of tax revenue -- money that finances schools, roads, libraries and sewers.
 Mr. Levy is one of the few local officials who has been willing to discuss immigration effects -- both positive and negative -- on the region's communities. By suggesting that the local police help to enforce immigration laws, he is trying to devise solutions to changes that are touching millions of lives well beyond Suffolk County. And he's right to do so because without reasonable, official response, citizens could be prompted to initiate strong measures as they did in Arizona.
 Last year, the number of illegal aliens who crossed the southwestern border of the United States rose 24 percent, to 1.14 million from 905,065 in 2003. This past fall, frustrated voters in Arizona, which is the main border-crossing location, passed a ballot initiative to keep illegal immigrants from receiving state services and from registering to vote. Using a state referendum to compel officials to do the right thing certainly beats vigilantism, but it would have been better had local and state officials responded promptly and constructively to people's concerns, instead of dismissing them and passing the buck to insufficient federal action. 
 In making his proposal, Mr. Levy was trying to find a way to address the problem before it gets too out of hand. Enacting solutions like the ones he proposed would add effective new tools to law enforcement. Why? Because simply knowing when someone who is arrested for larceny or robbery is also breaking immigration laws and facing removal from the country would help judges withhold bail. Since those in the country unlawfully are often a flight risk, the police could alert the judge if a suspect is an illegal alien, and the judge could keep the suspect behind bars. 
 Local law enforcement officers already have the authority to assist the federal government in the enforcement of federal laws, but many seldom use it where immigration offenses are concerned. Not only are some local police departments reluctant to get involved in federal matters, but many are not sure if they have the authority to check immigration status. And those police departments willing to take on the responsibility don't have the access to databases that would give them the needed information. The fact is that most immigration violations constitute continuing criminal offenses. Illegally crossing the border is a crime and re-entry after being deported is a felony. Moreover, according to law enforcement officials, unlawful presence in America is often a precursor crime to additional crimes like document fraud, narcotics trafficking and human trafficking. (At least 17 percent of federal inmates are illegal immigrants.)
 Local officials may dismiss the immigration-related problems as a federal responsibility. But allocating local resources and ensuring local public safety rest with local government. Prudent local officials would be wise to check suspects' immigration status routinely as a way to deny bail and keep alien lawbreakers off the streets and get them out of the country. 
 Mr. Levy was right to respond to citizens' valid concerns about immigration's undesirable consequences. It's too bad others didn't see it that way.

HEADLINE: Genius and High Jinks At 7 Middagh Street

BYLINE: By SHERILL TIPPINS. 
Sherill Tippins is the author of ''February House,'' a book about 7 Middagh Street being published this month by Houghton Mifflin.

 BODY:
IT'S fitting that the house at 7 Middagh Street first appeared to George Davis in a dream.
 It was the kind of dream people have in times of stress, full of light-filled rooms and a feeling of transcendence. This was the summer of 1940, when Denmark, Holland, Belgium, Luxembourg and, most incredibly, France had fallen to the Nazis. German troops were patrolling the ghettos of Krakow. Britain would be next.
 Davis, an editor whose friends ranged from Bowery burlesque performers to Virginia Woolf, didn't consider himself political. But he had spent a glorious youth in Paris, mentored by Cocteau, Colette, Man Ray and Janet Flanner, the New Yorker columnist, and he drew on their work in his new job as literary editor of Harper's Bazaar. 
 Now it seemed that the time for words was ending. In Europe, the war had effectively killed free speech. In America, a wave of patriotic zeal was having its own depressing effect. The fight to publish good work grew increasingly difficult, and as a result Davis frequently opted not to show up at the office. Instead, he spent time with his new best friend, 23-year-old Carson McCullers, whose debut novel, ''The Heart Is a Lonely Hunter,'' had just been published.
 Often, to McCullers's delight, Davis took her along on visits to his emigre friends: W.H. Auden, who had recently composed his celebrated poem, ''September 1, 1939''; Auden's close friend, the British composer Benjamin Britten; the singer Lotte Lenya and her husband, Kurt Weill; and Erika and Klaus Mann, the two eldest of Thomas Mann's grown children, who were organizing the rescue of dissident artists from unoccupied southern France. 
 But the bad news kept coming. The bombing of Britain began. In occupied France, known authors had been photographed in concentration camps, while others simply disappeared. At Harper's Bazaar, the arguments continued to escalate. By early September, Davis was out of a job. 
 McCullers sympathized. She had been reading about the early years of the 1920's literary idealists, with their ''little'' magazines and their belief in the power of united action. Wouldn't it be wonderful, she mused to Davis, to be at the beginning of a great cultural movement instead of here at the bitter end? Wouldn't it be wonderful to live, all the time, as part of a creative group?
 It was about that time that Davis fell asleep one night in his Upper East Side apartment and dreamed of the house on Middagh Street in Brooklyn Heights. It was a funny-looking brownstone, not terribly big, but large enough to house Davis, McCullers and their closest friends. He awoke the next morning with a sense of purpose and excitement he hadn't felt in a long time. He promptly took the subway to Brooklyn and found the house, as he had known he would, with a sign reading, ''To Let.'' 

A Stripper as Savior
 Like most residents of Brooklyn Heights, I had heard most of the local legends within months of moving there. I knew of the neighborhood's early days in the early 1800's, when Hezekiah Pierpont marketed it as a rural retreat for families of Wall Street businessmen. The rows of elegant mansions, some now nearly two centuries old, had survived an invasion of mid-19th-century New England liberals with their publicity-savvy abolitionist preacher, Henry Ward Beecher. 
 They had survived working-class New Yorkers arriving via the newly built subways. They had even tolerated a wave of artists attracted by the architecture and abundant light. But the neighborhood's fortunes waxed and waned with the city's economy, and by the onset of the Depression, many of the founding families had fled.
 All this I knew. But after I volunteered with a local program to deliver lunch to the housebound and elderly, I heard many more stories. An artist in her 80's told of a silent film star who lived at the Bossert Hotel and ordered a milk bath every day. A former Navy officer recalled cruising with her friends for cute sailors at Lottie and Jack's Bar on Pineapple Street. 
 The most intriguing story was the one about the house full of artists on Middagh Street, a ramshackle town house dating to the early 19th century, conventional in layout but unusual in appearance with its peaked roof, Tudor trim and carved wooden portico. Perched atop a bluff at the northwest tip of the Heights, it offered a spectacular view of downtown Manhattan as well as the notorious Brooklyn waterfront. In better days, it had been occupied by the widowed Elizabeth Spence Wilson, but her son, James, had let it out as a boardinghouse, and it had succumbed to years of neglect. 
 To Davis, however, 7 Middagh Street was, as he described it in a letter, ''a symbol a risk, a gamble with myself and others.'' Here was a chance to nurture his friends' work on his own terms, just when the mechanism for creating great art seemed to be shutting down. Having leased the house for $75 a month, he invited McCullers to move in, along with Auden and his lover, Chester Kallman, a Brooklyn College student to whom the poet considered himself married. Others, including Britten and his partner, the British tenor Peter Pears, would arrive once the house was sufficiently renovated.
 Serious renovation was required. The furnace was broken. The banisters wobbled. Wind blew through gaps in the window frames. Davis and McCullers moved in early to manage the repairs, but progress was slowed by their habit of drinking and chatting with the repairmen. 
 While Davis furnished the place according to his bizarre Victorian taste (framed Valentines, a sofa with buffalo-horn armrests and a grand piano donated by Diana Vreeland), McCullers made friends with the pharmacist on the corner, the men at the little fire station down the street, and the woman next door who shared her brownstone with a dozen stray dogs and a pet monkey. ''Brooklyn, in a dignified way,'' she decided, ''is a fantastic place.''
 Auden arrived in October to find the house still a shambles. Dirty dishes filled the kitchen sink, and meals were sporadic at best. Worst of all, nothing worked, and there was no more money for repairs.
 ''Dear Harry,'' Auden wrote to an editor at The New Yorker in a desperate note accompanying some poems, ''PLEASE sell this to the New Yorker as I am VERY VERY VERY poor ... I STILL HAVE NO HOT WATER. I STILL HAVE NO HOT WATER. I shall go crazy.'' 
 Auden was then finishing ''New Year Letter,'' a lengthy meditation on the coming war, and believed fervently in the benefits of early bedtimes and regular meals and work hours. He tried to organize the household, with little success. The writer James Stern dropped in one day to find, as he described it to Auden's biographer, ''George naked at the piano with a cigarette in his mouth, Carson on the floor with half a gallon of sherry, and Wystan bursting in like a headmaster, announcing: 'Now then, dinner!'''
 Help arrived in a most unlikely form: that of America's favorite stripper and Davis's close friend, Gypsy Rose Lee. From their first days at Middagh Street, Davis had begun inviting Gypsy to join them for drinks in the waterfront district at the foot of the hill. 
 As they strolled along Sands Street, with its brawling bars, tattoo parlors and male and female brothels, sailors' jaws would drop when Gypsy settled into a booth. Shrugging off her ermines and lighting a Turkish cigarette, she was equally willing to chat about literature in her cultivated ''intellectual'' tones or to entertain her friends with a description of her ideal male companion: ''I like my men on the monster side. A snarling mouth, evil eye, broken nose. A nervous tic excites me and if with all these things he wore green suits -- Bank Night!'' 
 For all her joking, Gypsy revered writers, and had always wanted to be one. In her view, the Middagh Street retreat was too good an opportunity to pass up. She offered to rent a room and even provide the household with a cook, a maid, and money for repairs, if Davis would teach her to write. 

Inventive Days, Inebriated Nights
 Davis described his new house over the phone to Janet Flanner as ''a boardinghouse, really.'' But Flanner thought he had said ''bawdy house,'' which she considered perfectly appropriate for Davis and his friends, all of them under 35. Nevertheless, with the addition of servants and under Auden's strict management, the creative life at 7 Middagh began gathering momentum. 
 By November, Britten and Pears had taken the top floor with Auden. (Kallman visited frequently.) Gypsy and McCullers shared the third floor. Davis took the parlor floor rear, and the poet Louis MacNeice stayed for several weeks on his way home to England. Already, word had spread of the strange ''menagerie'' in Brooklyn Heights where days were spent in creative labor but the evenings were another story. 
 Rumors circulated of Pears and Davis performing ''a ballet to 'Petrushka,' up the curtains and the hot water pipes''; of parties attended by Brooklyn pimps and sideshow performers along with composers, playwrights and painters; and overnight visitors ''raiding the icebox at midnight and eating the cat food by mistake.'' 
 Auden was said to preside over loud literary debates at the communal, multicourse dinners, dispensing advice while consuming enormous amounts of roast beef and red wine. Kallman recited naughty limericks, McCullers told stories of her childhood in her Southern drawl, and Gypsy breezed restlessly in and out of the room ''like a whirlwind of laughter and sex.'' 
 Suddenly, a trip over the Brooklyn Bridge seemed a small price to pay for the chance to gossip about such goings-on, and Broadway producers and Pulitzer Prize winners began vying for invitations. But the Mann children saw the house as potentially more than a lively social scene. To them, it constituted the perfect port of entry for the flood of intellectual emigres arriving from Europe. Here, newcomers would enjoy the sort of free discourse they had been denied for years, along with connections they needed to find meaningful work. 
 But a rift was developing in the house. Some believed, with the Manns, that writers and other artists were uniquely equipped to speak out on political issues. Others agreed with Auden that artists were no more knowledgeable about politics than anyone else, and should focus on the eternal question for every artist: How ought we live?
 To address this question in his own life, Auden had begun slipping out of the house on Sundays to take communion at a nearby Episcopal church. His answer to Hitler's devastation was to return to the Christian faith and to learn to love God through his marriage to Kallman.

Bedbugs and Fallings-Out
 By early 1941, the Brooklyn salon had reached such a level of creative intensity that Denis de Rougemont, visiting author of ''Love in the Western World,'' wrote that ''all that was new in America in music, painting, or choreography emanated from that house, the only center of thought and art that I found in any large city in the country.'' 
 But as the winter wore on and the news from Europe worsened, life at the house began spinning out of control. McCullers's hard work and heavy drinking led to a physical breakdown, forcing her to return home temporarily to Georgia. Gypsy, impatient with the poverty and squalor of a writer's life, had opted for a show-business engagement in Chicago. Her empty room at Middagh Street was occupied by Paul Bowles, then a successful young composer. His wife, Jane, moved into McCullers's empty room next door.
 With the Bowles came an array of visitors whose presence further complicated the atmosphere. Salvador Dali, whose first words when introduced to Auden were ''Do you speak English?,'' parroted apologies for the fascist dictatorship in Spain. The composer Virgil Thomson arrived with so many American colleagues, including Aaron Copland, Marc Blitzstein and Leonard Bernstein, that Britten began to feel outnumbered in his own home. Conflicts between Paul Bowles and Auden escalated, resulting in the Bowleses' eviction. 
 Things got worse. Visiting sailors ransacked suitcases. Someone tried to set the house on fire. Pears announced the presence of bedbugs. Britten's first opera, with a libretto by Auden, was lambasted by the critics. Auden's partner, Kallman, announced that he had fallen in love with someone else. By summer, as news arrived of Hitler's attack on the Soviet Union, the 7 Middagh Street residents seemed to have lost their bearings completely. 
 But this, Auden believed, was the kind of trial by fire that artists must endure if they were to arrive at essential truths. Out of the darkness of this period, a creative transformation had begun. 
 Even before she left, Jane Bowles's conversations with Auden had helped her find the key to her developing novel, ''Two Serious Ladies.'' McCullers, already at work on ''The Member of the Wedding,'' was inspired by an evening with Auden on Sands Street to write ''The Ballad of the Sad Cafe.'' 
 Klaus Mann wrote ''The Turning Point,'' a moving account of the emigre experience. Gypsy's novel, ''The G-String Murders,'' became a smash hit. Britten, who had found the strength to reject Auden's overwhelming influence that spring, discovered the idea for his first great opera, ''Peter Grimes,'' as a result. Auden would draw on the spiritual, sexual, intellectual and emotional crises he had experienced in Brooklyn to create his powerful Christmas oratorio, ''For the Time Being,'' a tale of salvation. 

Ghost House
 Nothing stands there anymore. Not long after the Japanese attacked Pearl Harbor in December 1941, 7 Middagh Street's inhabitants scattered -- to enlist in the Army, perform for the troops, teach, or write somewhere else. Only Davis remained to welcome a new group of artists, including the novelist Richard Wright and the composer Colin McPhee. 
 But the atmosphere had changed. The group no longer dined or partied communally, and most residents led largely separate lives. By the time Anais Nin visited the house in 1943, she referred to it admiringly as a ''museum of Americana,'' having missed the days when it was anything but a museum.
 Soon the ''museum'' itself disappeared. In 1945, the house at 7 Middagh was emptied, then razed to make way for the Brooklyn-Queens Expressway. All that remains now, on the north side of the westernmost block of the dead-end street, is the lopped-off edge of the bluff overlooking several lanes of speeding traffic, a chain-link fence, and a traffic sign reading ''No Standing Anytime.'' 
 Even the old-timers in Brooklyn Heights retain only a glimmering memory of what life was really like at 7 Middagh. Each year, the neighborhood's collective memory fades a little more. With 7 Middagh gone and new generations moving in, the youthful creativity and passion shared by Auden, McCullers, Britten and Bowles seems like nothing more than a dream.

HEADLINE: A Helicopter Town Senses a Snub From Washington

BYLINE: By ROBERT A. HAMILTON

 BODY:
FOR almost a half-century, as long as there has been a presidential helicopter, Sikorsky has built them in Stratford, a point of pride not just for the workers, but for the rest of the town as well.
 So when the Navy announced that the next-generation presidential helicopter will be a European design built in upstate New York, Roger D. Salls, president of the Stratford Chamber of Commerce, said he was worried about what the loss of a $6.1 billion contract might mean to Sikorsky and its local vendors. He was also concerned about the psychological impact on a town that has been synonymous with helicopters since 1929, when Igor Sikorsky opened his plant there.
 ''The first time I see the president lift off in someone else's helicopter, it doesn't matter who that president is, I will feel a sense of betrayal, and I think that's what the whole community of Stratford, and its businesses, will feel,'' Mr. Salls said. ''This is a financial blow to the town, but more important a huge psychological blow.'' 
 Joseph Grabinski of Naugatuck, a union steward who went to work for Sikorsky 20 years ago, said the Navy announcement was a shock, even though the helicopter, designated Marine One when the president is on board, would have been just a small percentage of the company's business.
 ''There's a lot of pride to be the company that builds the president's helicopter, and to have that pulled right out from underneath us, that wound is going to take a while to heal,'' Mr. Grabinski said. ''From a prestige standpoint, it's very hard to swallow.''
 Joseph G. Crudo, the Stratford Town Council chairman, who also works at Sikorsky, said the plant was the town's largest employer and its largest taxpayer, accounting for almost $15 million, or about 8 percent, of the town's budget. But it is not just a question of the money for most people.
 ''It's been a wakelike atmosphere, like we've lost a loved one,'' Mr. Crudo said. ''I know one guy who's worked 20 of his 27 years at Sikorsky on the presidential helicopter program, and he took it like a slap in the face. And the mood in town is the same as it is inside the plant. People can't understand how the president could pick a non-American helicopter to fly around in. People are angry and upset.''
 Sikorsky employs about 7,000 people in Connecticut, most in Stratford and neighboring Bridgeport. The presidential helicopter contract would have been new work, but the company has never said how many jobs it might have added if it had won.
 ''There's always that thought in the back of folks' minds that this is the beginning of the end, that after we lost the Comanche helicopter program last year and the president's helicopter this year, we're losing too much business,'' Mr. Grabinski said, referring to the $39 billion helicopter program that was canceled last year. ''It's going to be difficult for some people to see that we're going to continue to grow. We need to find a way to move on past this.''
 The Navy announced on Jan. 28 that it would spend $1.6 billion to buy 23 modified EH-101 helicopters, to be known as VXX. The aircraft will be built by Lockheed Martin, based on a design by AgustaWestland, a British-Italian venture, to replace the presidential helicopter fleet in 2009. 
 ''This decision truly reflects the best value and capability for the American taxpayer who is funding it, the Marines who will operate it and the future presidents who will fly in it,'' John Young, assistant secretary of the Navy for research, development and acquisition, said in a statement.
 On the day of the announcement, Stephen N. Finger, the president of Sikorsky, issued a statement that he was disappointed with the outcome, because published data by both companies showed its H-92 flies farther and faster than the EH-101. ''We're honored to have flown U.S. presidents for nearly half a century and believe we put forward an exceptionally strong proposal to continue this tradition,'' Mr. Finger said. ''Sikorsky is a growing company committed to providing our customers with outstanding quality and value. We are focused on doubling our business by 2008, with a portfolio of products and aftermarket services for military and commercial customers worldwide. We anticipate achieving this goal even absent the VXX.''
 Sikorsky had also touted its helicopter as the ''Buy American'' brand for the presidential helicopter. AgustaWestland is an Anglo-Italian joint venture.
 ''What kind of message do you send to the rest of the world when a government won't support its own workers?'' asked Rocco J. Calo, secretary-treasurer of Teamsters Local 1150, which represents about 3,500 Sikorsky workers in Connecticut, Florida and Alabama.
 Lockheed Martin had countered, during a hard-fought, yearlong competition, that about two-thirds of the EH-101, which the company is calling the US-101, would be built in the United States.
 Ed Steadham, a Sikorsky spokesman, said the company would not comment on the impact of the decision because the effects were still being calculated.
 Stratford is a community that knows too well how a shift in military spending can disrupt the local economy. The Stratford Army Engine Plant was closed in 1998. Since then, the approximately 1.6-million-square-foot complex has been largely vacant.
 ''This was, at the time the Army closed it, the town's largest employer and the town's largest taxpayer, and now Sikorsky has taken its place, so when you hear about a decision like this, it does cause some concern,'' said Rick J. Norris, who is heading redevelopment efforts for the property.
 But Richard L. Aboulafia, vice president of the Teal Group, a military consulting company in Virginia, said the VXX decision ''wasn't as important to either company as they made it out to be.'' 
 Lockheed Martin has been pushing globalization as one reason for the US-101, stating that the United States has been criticized as promoting its own weapons systems overseas and not allowing allied countries to market their own products here. But Mr. Aboulafia noted that several months ago the Army picked a new spy plane that will be produced by Lockheed with a Brazilian partner. 
 ''That sent a much stronger signal about globalization than anything the 101 will do,'' Mr. Aboulafia said.
 Sikorsky seemed to pin the survival of its H-92 design on the VXX contract, but within the last few months the company has sold 28 of the aircraft to Canada, as well as smaller orders in Turkey, Turkmenistan and Qatar. It now has an order backlog for almost 90 aircraft.
 Mr. Calo acknowledged that the Marine One order wasn't a make-or-break contract for the company, but was worried that Lockheed's win might give it an advantage in winning future work, particularly an Air Force order this year for 200 search-and-rescue helicopters that could be worth $7 billion.
 Union officials said the contract went to Lockheed because of its ties to the British and Italian companies, countries that have backed the United States in Iraq.
 ''It was completely politically motivated,'' Mr. Calo said. ''Our ducks were all in a line, and there was no way we should have lost.'' But while he was meeting on Monday with Connecticut's congressional delegation and the governor, he was not convinced political pressure would help in any appeal.
 ''Once a decision is made like this, it's very seldom overturned,'' Mr. Calo said. ''Also, the Navy is still our biggest customer, so we have to be careful how we handle this, because there's a lot of work out there that we're going to compete for and we don't want to see politics enter those decisions,''
 Ed Machia of Trumbull, an industrial engineer with 27 years at Sikorsky, said he was stunned at the announcement, and there was a sense of bewilderment at what might have driven the Navy decision.
 ''But the Sikorsky work force is professional enough to quickly realize we have other product lines to serve, and we have to move on,'' Mr. Machia said. ''This won't be a deterrent to our dedication to making a great product. We won't lose our focus.''

HEADLINE: Trading Floor Rivals Settle Scores in Ring

BYLINE: By Tanya Mohn. 
This column about the local economy appears every other week. E-mail address: homefront@nytimes.com

 BODY:
SHORTLY before sunrise on a recent Monday, four men arrived at the Trinity Boxing Club in Lower Manhattan to jump rope, run on elliptical trainers and shadow-box, finishing an intense training process: five days a week for over a month, and twice a day for the previous two weeks.
 They were not professional boxers, but colleagues on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange. ''After months of trash talking, they decided to settle it in the ring,'' said Martin Snow, Trinity's owner and manager. ''It's going to be a barn burner.'' 
 The boxing ring seems an unlikely place to sort out workplace differences, but grudge matches have become a popular way to duke it out with co-workers who have gotten on your nerves or with whom you have a bone to pick.
 Andrew J. Patti, 44, a stockbroker from G&L Partners who was training for a fight later that week with Michael J. Mulroy, 38, managing director of Bear Wagner Specialists, said: ''A lot of people want to see me in the ring with Mike Mulroy. He's one of these highfalutin guys, thinks he's better than most people.'' 
 Mr. Mulroy agreed that the fight was a long time coming. ''It's been years of busting each other's chops, getting in my face,'' he recalled. A second fight, between Peter Falotico, 48, and Sean Henderson, 33, who both work for the Banc of America Specialist Corporation, was planned for the same evening, though both men acknowledged that their rivalry was less intense. 
 Mr. Snow began arranging matches several years ago in response to inquiries from people who wanted to rent a gym to fight. He declined, citing safety concerns. But if he could train each combatant for a disciplined fight, he thought, why not? 
 So far, Mr. Snow has organized about a dozen such matches. Fighters must take a minimum of three weeks' training and wear protective gear.
 ''Skills you learn in the ring help in the real world,'' Mr. Snow said. ''Every day is a fight. The key to boxing is to keep cool, persist and overcome adversity and fear. If you can overcome that, what can't you do?'' 
 White-collar workers using boxing to resolve grudges is not as strange as it may seem. Boxing became recognized as an accepted sport in the United States after being practiced at elite colleges in the late 1800's, according to Elliott J. Gorn, a professor of history at Brown University and author of ''The Manly Art'' (Cornell University Press). In professional boxing, rematches between archrivals seeking revenge are called grudge matches, Mr. Snow said, noting that even the most vicious opponents often form deep bonds afterward.
 Mr. Mulroy said colleagues in previous matches had benefited from the experience. ''They walked away with a new respect.'' 
 Previous matches drew about 50 spectators each, and some proceeds went to charity; the most recent matches were the first in which the proceeds after expenses would go exclusively to charity. 
 Two hundred tickets, at $200 apiece, sold out in two days, raising $38,000 for To Love One Another, a new organization founded in honor of the Rev. Mychal Judge, the fire chaplain who lost his life in the Sept. 11 attack on the World Trade Center, and the National Alliance for Autism Research. 
 On the night of the fight, a standing-room-only crowd of colleagues, family and friends packed the club. An Emergency Medical Service truck was on hand, and cold beer flowed from the open bar. 
 The combatants took on colorful nicknames for the evening. Q-Tip (Mr. Henderson), weighing in at 185 pounds, bested Cotton Ball (Mr. Falotico), at 180 pounds, in three two-minute rounds. Next, the big fight: Hamburger Patti, 220 pounds, vs. Hot Dog Mulroy, 155 pounds. Each boxer chose the song that played when his opponent came into the ring. Mr. Patti, 5 feet 4 inches tall, entered to ''Short People'' by Randy Newman; Mr. Mulroy to ''Macho Man'' by the Village People (wearing a cutoff shirt to show off his biceps, one tattooed ''I 3/5oheart 4/5 $'') 
 When the whistle blew after the third and final round, the two fighters, locked in a clinch, hugged. ''They will never look at each other the same way,'' said Mr. Snow, who, as both referee and judge, deemed Mr. Patti the winner. ''It's a great bonding thing.''

HEADLINE: The Imperious Vision Of Cuba's Other Ruler-for-Life

BYLINE: By ERIKA KINETZ

 BODY:
AS the curtain closed on the final gala of the International Festival of Ballet in Havana in November, Alicia Alonso, the aged matriarch of Cuban ballet, stood unsteadily at center stage, her arms outstretched toward the raucous adulation of the crowd. Silent and still, a gracious smile chiseled on her face, she seemed less a woman than a monument. She has presided over the biennial festival since 1960, and her power is such that she -- and perhaps she alone -- is able to draw the globe's best artists to her slight, impoverished nation to dance. 
 Ms. Alonso, who is 83, has ruled the Ballet Nacional de Cuba -- has been the Ballet Nacional de Cuba -- for nearly six decades. Before, ballet in Cuba was a marginalized extravagance. Now, men in one of the world's most macho countries clamor to put on dancing tights. She has trained some of the era's greatest dancers and created a world-class ballet company renowned for its precise classicism and exuberant virtuosity.
 She has accomplished all this despite her nation's poverty. Despite its isolation from the world's great ballet companies. And one other thing: despite the fact that she is, depending on whom you ask, either largely or completely blind. 
 ''I see through here,'' Ms. Alonso said in her Havana office, pressing a neatly manicured hand to her pale, broad forehead.
 Like most dancers, Ms. Alonso has aged with some desperation. She performed into her 60's, but today she is undeniably brittle, with a grandeur so willful it can be frightening. For public appearances, she paints her face with a thick layer of foundation, pencils in high, arching eyebrows and transforms her lips into a broad slash of red. She keeps her hair hidden under an ever-changing series of colorful scarves, bound tightly around her forehead. 
 But despite Ms. Alonso's efforts to keep up appearances, her empire shows signs of crumbling beneath her. The company's repertory is so static -- a lovely but unchanging iteration of ''Giselle,'' ''Swan Lake,'' ''Don Quixote'' and ''Coppelia'' -- that one of her top dancers says he has resorted to making up steps to keep himself entertained. The Cuban choreographers who once worked with the company have, for the most part, left or retired, and the company says it can't afford the work of innovative international choreographers like Jiri Kylian and William Forsythe. Ms. Alonso's own choreography, in its worst moments, is a bit of a bad joke. 
 In addition, her dancers have been leaving at an alarming rate -- more than 20 in the last few years. Former Ballet Nacional dancers now grace American Ballet Theater, the Boston Ballet, the San Francisco Ballet, the Washington Ballet, the Cincinnati Ballet and the Royal Ballet, among others. But she prefers not to acknowledge this diaspora. 
 Cocooned in historical glory, she will neither cede control of her company nor plan for its future after her death. Like all great divas (and for that matter, dictators) she will not countenance talk of succession. ''I am going to live to 200,'' she said, in charmingly accented English. ''Maybe I live longer. I love life.'' 
 Legend has it that Ms. Alonso danced herself blind. She arrived in New York from Havana in 1937 and eked out a living as a Broadway hoofer before joining the fledgling Ballet Theater. Four years later, at 19, she began to lose her sight, and after multiple operations for a detached retina, her doctors prescribed several months in bed. It was there that she first learned the role of Giselle, as her husband, Fernando, helped her mark the steps with her fingers. Doctors warned her that her frail eyes would not withstand the rigors of her whipped turns, but Ms. Alonso went right on dancing. 
 She got her big break in 1943, when Alicia Markova got sick and Ms. Alonso performed Giselle in her stead. (It became her signature role, and she was still dancing it in the early 1970's, when Kevin McKenzie, now the artistic director of American Ballet Theater, saw her perform. He was, he said, ''riveted'' by ''an unfaltering technique coupled with this ethereal quality.'')
 Ms. Alonso was a part of the rich ferment that gave birth to both American Ballet Theater and the New York City Ballet, and she worked with the greats, including Agnes de Mille, Antony Tudor and Jerome Robbins. The demanding role George Balanchine created for her in ''Theme and Variations'' in 1947 terrified later generations of ballerinas. Then, goes the hagiography, she and Fernando gave it all up to take ballet back to their beloved Cuba. In 1948, they founded Ballet Alicia Alonso, which became known as the Ballet Nacional de Cuba after the revolution.
 ''Everybody thought it was crazy that people dance,'' recalled Fernando Alonso, 90, who helped found the Ballet Nacional and ran it from 1959 to 1975. (As a teacher, he largely defined the Cuban ballet style.)
 ''They thought you had to be a doctor or a lawyer or anything else,'' Mr. Alonso said. He used to knock on the doors of his mother's rich friends seeking donations, and the company sold performances to sponsors like Cerveza Polar and Bacardi Rum. ''We had a stage with two big beers on it,'' he said. ''What do we care? We get to make a performance.''
 Soon after Fidel Castro took power, in 1959, he gave the ballet company $200,000, with the admonition that it had better excel. 
 ''The budding revolution wanted to get for the Cuban people all possible good, and not just material good but also spiritual good,'' said Miguel Cabrera, the historian of the Ballet Nacional. Mr. Castro decided that ballet would be part of that gift. The Alonsos dutifully carted their dancers to sugarcane fields, army bases and factories.
 Today in Cuba, ballet is a great career. Dancers can earn more than doctors. And it's cool. Audiences, which are packed with the young and miniskirted, give the dancers the kind of love Boston gives the Red Sox.
 Alejandro Sene, a member of the corps de ballet, is one of many dancers who was pushed into his profession by well-meaning relatives. ''I remember the first time I saw ballet on TV,'' he recalled. ''I was 4 or 5. I said, 'I'll be anything but that.''' His uncle and his grandfather lured him into ballet class with promises that he would get to dress up in neat costumes. Young Alejandro found few costumes and a lot of hard physical work, an injustice he grew to accept once he realized he was marooned in a sea of girls. ''I think I've liked girls since I was one month old,'' he said.
 Cuba has an enviable network of schools that provide students throughout the country with methodical, full-time training from the ages of 9 to 18. Students must pass a battery of physical, musical and psychological tests. Last year 611 students auditioned for 60 spots at the Alejo Carpentier School in Havana, where Jose Manuel Carreno and Carlos Acosta, among many others, first studied ballet.
 But ballet in Cuba is part of a fading world, fueled by a mix of need, desire and boredom. For the time being, the government's control of mass media and the American embargo continue to insulate Cubans to some extent from the speed and sophistication of American visual culture. Life is slower here than it is on ''Gilmore Girls.'' And in this context, ballet is thrilling entertainment, filled with superhuman feats and romance.
 Last November, the Ballet Nacional set up a stage in the Plaza Vieja in Havana and performed ''Shakespeare y Sus Mascaras'' (''Shakespeare and His Masks''), a takeoff on ''Romeo and Juliet'' choreographed by Ms. Alonso. There was not much else to do on the neighborhood's dusky streets. Boys played dominos in disintegrating alleyways. Men sat in their hot living rooms, watching state-run television. The stage was the brightest thing for miles. 
 But lately a sort of torpor has fallen over the Ballet Nacional. Although Ms. Alonso remains the director, the latest generations of dancers -- including high-wattage performers like Joel Carreno, Viengsay Valdes, Alihaydee Carreno and Rolando Sarabia -- only rarely work directly with her. Carlos Acosta, who now dances with the Royal Ballet, actually performed with her once, in 1993.
 ''I was very nervous,'' Mr. Acosta said from London. ''It was a big responsibility. I was only 20 years old, dancing with this living legend. What if you drop her?'' 
 Her poor eyesight made it difficult for her to give corrections. ''She gives you general corrections,'' he said, ''and you try to find whether you can use them, because she cannot be direct with you.'' Current dancers at the Ballet Nacional say Ms. Alonso's choreographic process is similarly vague: she explains her vision to one of her minions, who then builds the work on the company. 
 Like bees around their queen, a cloud of advisers hovers around Ms. Alonso, seeing for her, judging for her, describing for her the daily reality of the Ballet Nacional. Her successor, company insiders say, will probably be pulled from these courtly ranks, which include Loipa Araujo, Aurora Bosch and Josefina Mendez, all ballet masters in their 60's, as well as younger teachers like Maria Elena Llorente, Carmen Hechavarria and Svetlana Ballester.
 The woman most often pointed to as a potential successor is Ms. Araujo. She speaks five languages and says she teaches regularly at the Royal, La Scala, the Royal Danish and the Paris Opera ballets. She has phone numbers in Cuba, London and Spain and has long worked to freshen the repertory. 
 ''My opinion is that it should be Loipa,'' said Joel Carreno, half-brother of Jose Manuel Carreno of American Ballet Theater and one of the biggest stars of the Ballet Nacional. ''And not when Alicia is gone. It should be her already.'' 
 When confronted with that possibility, Ms. Araujo gave a wry, tired laugh and looked away. ''Loipa, Josefina,'' she said. ''Who knows? If Alicia is 200 years old, we'll be 100. I don't think anybody is raising that question. What's important to us is to work every day.'' 
 Even if Ms. Alonso does live to be 200, Mr. Castro might not, and that could spell big trouble for the Cuban ballet. The status of the Ballet Nacional -- the breadth of its audiences and the quality of its school -- derives in no small part from the state's commitment. In fact, despite Cuba's growing economic distress, Mr. Castro has in recent years boosted cultural expenditures.
 In 2001, the National Ballet School, which trains 15-to-18-year-olds, moved into a grand mansion right on Paseo del Prado in old Havana, and the Alejo Carpentier school is undergoing extensive renovations. In 2002, the national school, under a directive from Mr. Castro, auditioned 42,000 students around the country and selected 4,500 for a new vocational program. The objective is not to build dancers but to build audiences and, as Ramona de Saa, the school's director, said, ''to make a correct use of students' free time.'' 
 It's hard to imagine such activities taking place anywhere else in the world today. Large ballet companies in Russia, Europe and China have recently had to wean themselves from state subsidies, and the results -- sometimes frantic touring and shameless corporate sponsorship -- have not always been pretty. 
 In the very long run, Ms. Alonso's miracle may face an even more pernicious threat than poverty: wealth. Jane Hermann, the ICM executive who oversees the Ballet Nacional's American tours, points out that while life as a dancer is a step up in a poor country like Cuba, it can be a step down in a middle-class country like the United States. 
 Ms. Alonso scoffs at the notion that history may someday undo her legacy. ''Are you kidding,'' she said. ''Have you seen the amount of talents we've got? Have you seen the amount of teachers? We have the biggest school that exists today. Do you think that will die like that? No. This is a healthy tree.''
 Determined to show that her body, despite the weight of its accumulated years, still holds the clarity, passion and light that distinguish the Cuban school of movement -- and to prove, by extension, her fitness to lead -- Ms. Alonso rose from behind her desk and began to dance. Her face rapt with some remembered glory, she lifted her unseeing eyes toward a far balcony, gripped the desk with one hand and sent the other wafting gaily into the air. With perfect, flirtatious grace, she pranced like a muse in Balanchine's ''Apollo.'' Then her press secretary walked swiftly over and helped her back into her chair.

HEADLINE: On a Shoestring, Turning Out Literary Gems

BYLINE: By PETER C. BELLER

DATELINE: Noyac 

 BODY:
EVERY publishing house has what is known as a slush pile, a seemingly never-ending stack of unsolicited manuscripts that, if promising, wind their way through various corporate corridors and into the hands of an editor who urges their publication.
 At Permanent Press, the journey from the slush pile is less circuitous: If Judith Shepard, a company founder, likes one of the 6,000 manuscripts she receives each year, she will move it from the two large baskets of mail to a chair stacked high with paper on the first floor of her home, then to the shelves in the kitchen and, as she whittles down her selections, to her office upstairs, where she will read it front to back. If her husband, Martin Shepard, also approves, then they will likely publish it. 
 Since 1978 the Shepards have run the Permanent Press from their home in Noyac, a ramble of buildings on 22 acres west of Sag Harbor, making it a mission to find literary fiction gems worth republishing. 
 ''I think we have a reputation for taking chances,'' Ms. Shepard, 69, said recently at the couple's home, and office. ''We think, 'Is this a book we like?' Not, 'Is this a book that will sell?' Otherwise we'd be mimicking the big guys.''
 Sending only one book a month to market and operating on tiny margins, the Permanent Press and its sister imprint, Second Chance Press, often sell fewer than 2,500 copies of each title, but the house has garnered awards from the publishing industry and a reputation as a standout. 
 Some of their writers, like Mitch Cullin, have moved on to large publishing houses, and others have been in the running for major awards, like Sandra Scofield, who was a finalist for the National Book Award.
 Unlike regional presses that focus on local authors and have strong local sales, the Shepards look for works with a literary bent, often by first-time writers, wherever they may come from.
 This year, however, the Permanent Press will publish three books in a row that have connections to the South Fork: a mystery set in nearby North Sea, a memoir by a gay writer and a book of Mr. Shepard's own recollections and musings with an accompanying CD of original music that he wrote and performed. 
 The mystery, ''The Last Refuge,'' will be the first published novel by Chris Knopf, a Connecticut marketing executive with a home in Southampton, when it is released in May. The memoir, ''The Tall Boy,'' by Jess Gregg, recounts the experiences of the author and playwright as a gay man growing up in California in the mid-20th century before joining the New York theater scene. Mr. Gregg lives in East Hampton and Florida.
 In his own memoir, ''On the Record,'' Mr. Shepard, 70, recalls his transformation from a drug-taking Manhattan psychiatrist in the 1960's to a balding, rambunctious book publisher who goes to work in gym socks and moccasins. It includes a good dose of personal philosophy and is told with the same frank tone that Mr. Shepard used in his first memoir, ''The Psychiatrist's Head'' (Peter Wyden, 1972), which sparked controversy because of its description of his sex life during an open marriage. 
 The new book also details the Shepards' meeting in their Manhattan apartment building while Mr. Shepard was separated from his first wife. Ms. Shepard was an actress with three children from a previous marriage, and Mr. Shepard had three children of his own. Mr. Shepard quit psychiatry and designed homes on the South Fork until the Shepards settled in Noyac. 
 It took seven years of financial juggling before the Permanent Press turned a profit, and the operation is nearly as small as they come, with the Shepards selecting and editing manuscripts and two sisters, Maureen and Elise D'Haene, helping with everything else.
 To recoup the $10,000 cost of publishing a book, the press has to sell around 1,000 copies of that title, though they sometimes keep costs low by printing as few as 500 copies. They also save by doing their own publicity. 
 ''We don't advertise,'' Mr. Shepard said. ''We get covers done economically.''Computers, he added, allow them to do their own typesetting and send manuscripts to reviewers electronically.
 Still, sending a book to print is a gamble, as evidenced by the cardboard boxes containing hundreds of returned books neatly stacked in the Shepards' basement, many destined for the landfill. 
 But the Shepards say the business has its advantages. ''It's very rewarding to take manuscripts that have real merit and bring them out,'' Mr. Shepard said. ''We're very fortunate in that we like our job. It's part of our life. It keeps us thinking.''

HEADLINE: I.park Training Center Closer to Reality

BYLINE: By ROSAMARIA MANCINI

DATELINE: LAKE SUCCESS 

 BODY:
THE drive to create a life sciences hub at i.park Lake Success is moving forward. Patrick Duggan, Nassau's deputy county executive for economic development, said last Monday $1.7 million was in sight to finance the construction of a 10,000-square-foot training center here. 
 The center will include classrooms, a computer lab and a 140-seat auditorium and will be equipped with laboratory equipment like a centrifuge, microscopes and high-tech audiovisual equipment. It will serve as place where present and potential employees can be trained to work in the specialized life sciences industry: in medical laboratories, for example, and at hospitals and companies that make medical equipment. 
 Mr. Duggan said that Nassau County had submitted a $1.5 million loan application to the Department of Housing and Urban Development in December for the training center and that the remaining $200,000 would come from fund-raising and grant money. ''This is a big step for the county and puts us in a position to break ground in the summer or early fall,'' he said.
 The center's architect is the Phillips Group, a Manhattan firm that has an office in Melville. 
 The brainchild of Thomas R. Suozzi, the county executive, the training center will be built in i.park's main building, one of three in the 1.4-million-square-foot complex on 94 acres, formerly owned by Sperry Gyroscope and Lockheed Martin. Part of the complex was also the first home of the United Nations, which moved out in 1951. 
 The training center's second phase, which is still in the planning process, includes the construction of an incubator that will have at least six units for use by start-up businesses. The estimated cost of the incubator is about $1 million, Mr. Duggan said. 
 I.park, which is owned by a partnership of Apollo Real Estate Investment Funds and National RE/Sources, already has as tenants the North Shore-Long Island Jewish Health System; E-Z-EM, a manufacturer of products used for diagnosing gastrointestinal illnesses; and Antech Diagnostics, a veterinary diagnostic laboratory. 
 North Shore-L.I.J. has leased a total of 447,000 square feet at i.park. It currently uses 47,000 square feet for human resources and storage for medical supplies, and is developing about 60,000 square feet as an ambulatory surgery center and ambulatory cancer center. The remaining space will be developed in the future. 
 Charlene Thompson, a program coordinator for the Nassau County's Office of Housing and Intergovernmental Affairs and a team leader for the training center, said St. John's University, Molloy College, the State University College at Old Westbury, Nassau Community College, North Shore-L.I.J. and Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory had all expressed interest in offering courses at i.park. 
 She added that the training center could also be used by Nassau's Boces program and its high schools. ''It's about creating a conduit for people coming out of high school, an educational continuum,'' she said.
 The full-fledged effort to attract life sciences to i.park began in 2003, when the county, the Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, North Shore-L.I.J. and i.park started a private-public partnership called BioPartners. 
 The goal is to attract start-up and multinational companies by providing research and development space at competitive rents. To further this goal, the owners of i.park have set aside 300,000 square feet for life sciences companies and offer rates of $24 a square foot to lease space and less than $200 a square foot to design and build laboratories. 
 ''The offices for these types of companies are very expensive to build, but if a company at i.park grows beyond its space, they don't have to relocate because there is flexibility at the site and room to grow,'' said Lynne Ward, a vice president of i.park.
 About half of i.park -- 680,000 square feet -- is occupied. Ms. Ward said that by 2006 she expects life sciences companies to make up about 40 percent of the tenants. I.park has conventional business tenants, too, including Allstate Insurance; AXA Advisors, a financial services company; and City and Suburban Delivery Systems Inc., a subsidiary of The New York Times Company. 
 Desmond Ryan, the executive director of the Association for a Better Long Island, a real estate group, said i.park's advantage is its proximity -- about 16 miles -- to Manhattan and to Kennedy and La Guardia Airports. 
 Joe Scaduto, the executive director of the Long Island Life Sciences Initiative, an association that has been selling the region as a good place for companies developing everything from pharmaceuticals to medical devices, said i.park was well positioned to attract the life sciences. 
 Asked if i.park could hurt the Suffolk life sciences hubs, including the Broad Hollow Bioscience Park at Farmingdale State University and the Long Island High Technology Incubator at Stony Brook University, Mr. Scaduto said, ''Not at all.'' 
 ''The success of i.park is a real important component for Long Island and the metropolitan area as we try to market the entire region as the place where life sciences companies should locate,'' Mr. Scaduto said.

HEADLINE: Beating the Odds to Buy a New Home

BYLINE: By VALERIE COTSALAS

 BODY:
IT was a letter in the mail that changed the future of Allison LaMaina and her son Jarrett, 5, last summer.
 The letter, from the Long Island Housing Partnership, informed Ms. LaMaina she was eligible to buy one of 17 new Riverhead homes that she and dozens of other Long Islanders had filed applications to own.
 ''When I got the letter, I was just crying,'' Ms. LaMaina said from the small round table in her new eat-in kitchen on Jan. 25, during a week when one of the last two homeowners in the development closed on a mortgage. ''I knew I could get a mortgage, so I knew I would be in.'' 
 Ms. LaMaina got the mortgage at HSBC and closed on the Sigal Avenue house in Millbrook Gables in mid-December. Not one to wait, she rented a truck the next day and enlisted a friend to help her move her things from her Riverhead apartment to her new home.
 ''This was my dream,'' Ms. LaMaina said. ''I have wanted my own house for me and my kids for as long as I can remember.'' Her other son, Jalen, 11, lives with his father in Greenport, but spends weekends with his mother in the new home.
 The Long Island Housing Partnership is a 17-year-old nonprofit group based in Hauppauge that works with local, state and federal agencies to build affordable housing and help home buyers secure financing. 
 To increase homeownership in blighted areas, rules in homeowners' contracts require buyers to live in the homes. Purchase prices at Millbrook Gables ranged from $92,123 to $131,450 after about $50,000 in state and federal housing subsidies.
 As Ms. LaMaina spoke, it was late afternoon. She would soon have to leave for her nursing job at Central Suffolk Hospital, where she works from 7 p.m. to 7 a.m. She earns $50,000 a year, just below 80 percent of the median income for a family of two on Long Island, according to the United States Department of Housing and Urban Development.
 Her salary qualified her for the lottery that the housing partnership held on Oct. 1, 2003, to choose 17 families from about 70 approved applicants for the homes. The remaining names were placed on a waiting list.
 To be considered for one of the organization's lotteries, applicants must be first-time home buyers with a steady job and good credit history. Riverhead residents were given higher priority for the Millbrook Gables homes. 
 On lottery day, people cram into a room and wait to see whose names will be pulled out of the hopper. ''You wait and you pray,'' Ms. LaMaina said. But her prayers were not immediately answered. She was put on the waiting list.
 ''I was very disappointed,'' she said. ''I went home and tried to put it out of my mind.''
 Still, she decided to apply for a mortgage under a federal rural housing development program and found she could finance up to $240,000. ''It took months of paperwork, but it kept me busy,'' she said. The work would prove timely when, two days later, she received the letter that changed everything.
 ''On occasion, people fall out because they can't get a mortgage or they move away, so we offer it to the next person on the list,'' said Peter Elkowitz, president of the Long Island Housing Partnership, explaining the waiting list.
 Ms. LaMaina matter-of-factly calls her new neighborhood a housing project. But that term brings to mind a block of buildings where poor tenants rent apartments courtesy of public subsidies. Instead, the 13 homes on her street in Millbrook Gables look as if they were ordered up from the set of ''It's a Wonderful Life,'' the film where George Bailey learns how essential his family's savings and loan is to homeownership in the fictional town of Bedford Falls.
 The picture changes, though, when Ms. LaMaina looks out the glass sliding doors from the kitchen to the backyard. Just beyond her property, she sees big chunks of snow-covered debris strewn throughout the woods. 
 The neighboring homes are part of a troubled area, long considered one of the worst in Riverhead, where hooded figures walk the streets at night and drivers lock their doors as they pass through.
 ''People call it 'the Greens,''' Ms. LaMaina said of the surrounding area. ''There's a lot of drugs and drug dealing. This has always been the hot spot in Riverhead around here.''
 Nevertheless, she dismisses the nearby dangers. ''Everywhere you go, there are problems,'' she said.
 The housing partnership bought the land in 1999, planning to build 43 attached condominiums. But Board of Health concerns about the capacity of the sewage system forced the organization to scale back to 17 individual homes with septic tanks. 
 Four of the homes, built on lots given to the town of Riverhead by Suffolk County, are scattered on nearby streets. The other 13, including Ms. LaMaina's, were built on the housing partnership's 3.2-acre parcel. The total cost for the project was more than $2.6 million in public and private funds, as well as bank financing.
 Town of Riverhead officials hope the small new development will help to revitalize the rest of Millbrook Gables. ''There's been tremendous progress and this new subdivision is adding to that both in appearance and in the increase by 17 of owner-occupied units,'' said Andrea Lohneiss, Riverhead's director of community development. 
 Diana Weir, the vice president of the Long Island Housing Partnership, said: ''People tend to stay in these homes. Most of them are thrilled to own their own home.''
 Though developments like those created by the Long Island Housing Partnership with the cooperation of towns, banks and county, state and federal agencies have given more than 3,000 families the chance to own homes, there are still many more people who will leave Long Island for that chance.
 With the median price of a house reported in July by the Long Island Regional Planning Board to be $394,900, twice the national average, ''people making 120 percent of the median income can't come close to buying a home on Long Island,'' said Jim Morgo, Suffolk County's commissioner of economic development. 
 As a result, according to the 2005 Long Island Index, a report on Long Island sponsored by the Rauch Foundation (www.longislandindex.org), 20 percent of Long Islanders aged 18 to 34 left the Island from 1990 to 2000, five times the national average.
 ''I had thought of moving away,'' Ms. LaMaina, 31, said, remembering visits to her brother's home in South Carolina while she was living in a Riverhead apartment. ''I was looking in Charleston because it's so much cheaper there.'' 
 But today, Jarrett is waiting for his mother to paint his room blue. Ms. LaMaina is imagining her living room after her brother brings over his leather sofa and coffee table, gifts from his Southern home.
 She's planning to invite 50 friends and family for a housewarming in Riverhead when the weather gets warmer. ''I'm here,'' she said, as Jarrett scrambled into her lap. ''I'm not leaving anytime soon.''

HEADLINE: The Patriots Made a Man of Me, in a Manner of Speaking

BYLINE: By BRENDAN TAPLEY. 
Brendan Tapley is a writer living in New Hampshire.

 BODY:
AS a gay man, I've spent my whole life trying to figure out how to talk ''guy.'' That may sound strange -- you may not think debating the merits of the latest plasma TV or sparring over the quickest highway directions are exactly conversational standards to aspire to. But I've always longed for the camaraderie that succeeding at guy talk confers. Whenever I've tried to bridge this language divide, I've only crashed and burned. (Lobbying to read my college roommates' tarot cards rather than attend a frat party did not go over well.) In attempting a male Esperanto, a hybrid between how straight men talk and how I talk -- a Manglish if you will -- I've only freaked guys out. And I had pretty much resigned myself to this communication impasse. I had, that is, until three years ago, when I made the fateful decision to begin watching the New England Patriots play football. 
 I hate to admit that it was because I liked the quarterback. More for his spirit than his face (even though his face could be on a Greek statue), but also for the team's anachronistic humility. The Patriots just seemed like good guys, the kind we sought to become as young athletes. I had never really followed football, always finding it to be something I was happy to resist as another bad metaphor for the male condition. But I was starting to become involved with things I had never experienced, including a relationship with a woman, and my heart and mind were open.
 I know what you're thinking -- a gay man with a straight woman? Isn't that a television show? And while I admit that certain episodes of ''Will & Grace'' have made us laugh in eerie recognition, my relationship with Lynn wasn't founded on comic lightness or spit-takes but forged on an anvil of deep emotional connection I hadn't been able to find with anyone else. 
 In short we rescued each other. She was in a lonely marriage, and I was broke, unemployed and just trying my best to get through each smog-filled Los Angeles day. A magazine editor, Lynn first lifted me out of my despair by giving me a series of writing assignments and then yanked me out of Los Angeles altogether by offering me a staff job in Boston. And that's when we started hanging out together -- kickboxing class, long lunches out -- and where she opened up about her marriage and I got reacquainted with the solace of human contact. 
 One day as I listened to her, a distant thought rumbled locomotively to the fore of my brain. ''Are you waiting for someone's permission to leave your husband?''
 Six months later, she and her husband decided to end their marriage, and she moved in with me.
 I know, I know. You're still saying: but a gay man and a straight woman? C'mon. 
 But emotionally we were already entwined, and it proved not difficult at all to stretch into the physical. When it finally happened I was shaking, but this was more because I had never experienced that kind of love -- with a man or a woman. 
 Ultimately Lynn and I didn't last as lovers, though she remains my closest friend. But in our years together I got to play the straight guy, and as such I started exploring aspects of masculinity I had long shunned. I embarked on a weight-lifting routine and returned to the kind of swimming I once had done competitively. My body went from the poverty-induced proportions that had inspired a couple to solicit me as a hooker on Hollywood Boulevard (I thought they wanted directions) to a build that was more rugged, more imposing. Maybe I also incorporated some bad-guy-like behavior -- open scratching, audible burping, a more earthy sensibility -- but that was just icing. Such transformations were more natural than they sound, which is why I didn't wonder at all when I began tuning in Sunday afternoons. Watching football was an aberrant manifestation of my already aberrant condition.
 That's when a strange and unexpected thing happened. As a result of my more masculine disposition, men started liking me -- straight men, I mean -- and at last I was ushered into that foreign land of guydom whose borders had been long closed to me. In my second N.F.L. season, I showed up at family gatherings and found myself contributing quiet gems of football statistics, rumors and insider knowledge. I had signed up for the Patriots' Listserv by then and read all the hyperlinked articles, so I knew Tom Brady's quarterback rating (and also that if a ''big guy'' like him could highlight his hair, so could my cousin), and I knew the answer when somebody more alpha would frustratingly snap his fingers looking for the right player to prove his point. With these small displays, I suddenly found arms around my shoulders and myself in corners of rooms inside a familial huddle that included other men. I was becoming more fluent in their language, even though they had yet to speak mine.
 Fast forward to the beginning of my third N.F.L. season, this one. I was over at Lynn's sister's house, where I still hung out now and then. Her brother-in-law and I were scraping paint outside -- shirtless, I'll have you know. We were wearing lead-filtering biohazard masks and listening to heavy metal. But although I'd made strides in my acquisition of malespeak, he and I were not talking. I was enduring yet again that awkward man-with-man silence I so longed to break out of, when suddenly, from behind his mask, came a question. And not just any question. A football question: ''You think the Patriots are ever going to solve their running game?''
 I teetered on my ladder for a second. Did this guy -- a construction worker and a rabid Pittsburgh Steelers fan, he of the numerous football magazine subscriptions and full N.F.L. cable package -- really just ask me that? 
 ''I think we did solve the running game,'' I said, swaggering down the ladder for a drink of water. ''We got Corey Dillon, and he's going to be a 1,000-yard rusher, trust me. And I hear Brady worked on his arm all summer. They're not going to be the dink-and-dunk team they had to be last year. Plus, they're the defending champs.''
 ''Yeah, yeah,'' came the Vaderesque voice from beneath the mask. He descended his own ladder, smirking at my obvious dig at his nonchamp Steelers. We were shiny from sweat and paint flecked, the evidence of some collaboration plainly visible. But what was not visible struck me even more. There was no typical male playing field here. The day's purpose -- so essential to guy bonding -- had come and gone, but still we remained, two men standing and talking.
 The Metallica song faded out, and during the lull made by the idle guitar licks and silenced vocal rage, he said: ''How's your novel anyway? I always mean to ask; it's just, with all this stuff I've been dealing with, well, you know.''
 ''It's good. I mean, it's coming.'' 
 I had long finished the water in my mug, but I faked sips to stall for time and strategy as to what to say next. I had a feeling he was doing the same. We pointed our gazes in multiple directions: the ladybug on the boom box, one of their dogs in the shade, the tire swing that still held the rain from two days before.
 ''How about the baby?'' I asked him. ''How's that going?''
 He shook his head and inhaled deeply. They'd been trying for a while, and the struggle hung over the house like some Greek curse. ''I don't know. Do I really want to bring another life into this world?'' 
 His question was less the luxuriant musing of an expectant parent than the sad weariness of a long-denied one. 
 I put down my mug and fixed on him. ''Tell me why you want to be a father.''
 AND, much to my surprise, he did. He talked about the influence one individual can have on a child and how a parent's role must be to ensure that influence is humane. He mentioned the tough years he had experienced in school and explained what kind of education he envisioned for his son or daughter -- a mind that was less trained than open and a spirit that overruled the cultural values he deplored today: ambition, selfishness and indifference. 
 ''You know,'' he said, suddenly realizing he had been holding the floor for a while. ''It's really nice to talk like this.'' Then he laughed. ''It's not standard fare at the construction site.'' 
 I laughed back. He and I had traveled across our respective boundaries; we'd been both natives and tourists, and we'd found common ground at last.
 These days, I have a passable Manglish -- I seek out every opportunity to use it -- but you can tell I still have an accent. This Christmas, when I received DVD's of the Patriots' previous Super Bowl seasons from Lynn's brother-in-law, I said I hoped there would be lots of interviews with the telegenic Mr. Brady. He just smiled.
 Ah, well. With this Super Bowl, I like to think that between the nachos and flan, I'll be able to offer a couple more guys a place to be both a native and a tourist. A place to speak both languages. Somewhere that's the best of both worlds.

HEADLINE: A Retreat From the Money Market

BYLINE: By JONATHAN FUERBRINGER

 BODY:
AMERICANS are still leaving a haven they found in the down years of the stock market. Since December 2002, investors have taken $460 billion out of the mutual fund equivalent of their mattresses: money market funds.
 That is more than half the $738 billion that poured into money market funds from January 2000, just before the stock market started to decline, to December 2002, when assets in money market funds hit their high, according to AMG Data Services. 
 Most of the withdrawals, $316.6 billion, were in the last weeks of 2002 and in 2003, the year the stock market rebounded strongly. So far this year, assets in money market funds have declined $26 billion, after net withdrawals of $117.3 billion in 2004.
 Robert Adler, the president of AMG, said outflows from money market funds were slowing recently as money market interest rates have risen. After the quarter-point increase approved by the Federal Reserve's policy makers last week, the benchmark short-term interest rate is now 2.5 percent and average money-market yields are 1.75 percent. The average money market rate was 0.5 percent in the middle of last year. Not much of the recent outflow appears to be going into stocks or bonds, Mr. Adler said. He suspects that more is going into bank certificates of deposit, which are beginning to offer more attractive interest rates.

TRADE DATA -- The trade deficit report, due on Thursday, may be a little confusing because it will include a correction in the November data for a Canadian government error in tabulating American exports to Canada.
 The November deficit was initially reported on Jan. 12 as a record $60.3 billion, a surprise that sent the dollar down 1.1 percent against the euro that day, and 0.9 percent against the Japanese yen. Other adjustments are possible, but the one for the Canadian error could reduce the $60.3 billion to $59.2 billion, according to Robert J. Barbera, chief economist at ITG/Hoenig. The November revision will be reported at the same time as the December trade data.
 Because the forecasts for December are based in part on the reported November number, Mr. Barbera said the actual December number could come in below the current consensus estimate, which is $57.1 billion, according to Bloomberg News.
 A smaller-than-expected trade deficit could give the dollar a temporary boost. But it may not be good for the dollar in the long run, Mr. Barbera said, because the trade deficit is still not showing signs of shrinking. The revision would mean only that the deficit is not growing as fast as it was.

HEADLINE: Hockey Moms

BYLINE: By DAVE CALDWELL

DATELINE: WEST ORANGE 

 BODY:
AT last, the canal was frozen solid and the schedule was clear. Ken and Jan Pilanski and their two sons were in Ottawa in December for a youth hockey tournament, and the long, sparkling Rideau Canal lured them in for a bit of skating and a stop for hot chocolate.
 It was a wonderful day because it was a rarity, even for a family that spends most of its time on ice or around a rink. Jan Pilanski rummaged through her memory and realized that it was the first time the four of them had skated together in more than a year.
 If the Pilanskis, from Bayonne, qualify as the quintessential hockey family, then Mrs. Pilanski would qualify as the quintessential hockey mom in a state that has a rich youth hockey tradition, a lot of young players and a lot of hockey parents. (USA Hockey, the national sanctioning body for amateur hockey, says nearly 11,000 players under the age of 18 are participating this year in its programs from New Jersey alone.) 
 Mrs. Pilanski's tan 2000 Ford Windstar van has more than 90,000 miles on it. She wears a red scarf to the rink, and she knows to shoves her hands back inside the sleeves of her black down jacket when she catches a chill.
 Her sons, Kenny, 12, and Matt, 10, play for separate teams in the New Jersey Devils Youth Hockey Club, which is based at South Mountain Arena here, 18 miles from Bayonne.
 Mrs. Pilanski also knows the ways to avoid traffic. A rink is not usually around the corner, like a Little League baseball field. Thousands of parents have driven thousands of miles to sit for untold hours on hard benches in chilly rinks to watch their children play a sport that is difficult to master.
 Mrs. Pilanski, 36, has taken an extra step. She is the manager for Kenny's team, the Pee Wee Major AAA squad, which means organizing schedules, coordinating team activities and acting as an intermediary between the parents and the coach, Steve Riley.
 Although she got a Palm Pilot as a Christmas present, Mrs. Pilanski, one of 18 parents who serve as managers in the Devils program, lugs a white loose-leaf notebook to practices filled with every piece of information pertaining to Kenny's team.
 As she sat at a picnic table next to a rink where Matt was practicing on a recent Tuesday night, Mrs. Pilanski estimated that she and her husband would spend at least $20,000 this season alone on equipment, ice time and travel expenses as they traverse the state and beyond.
 Sometimes, they look at each other late at night and wonder how they can continue to pay for their boys' hockey, and whether it is really worth it. After all, Mrs. Pilanski lost her job last year when her company declared bankruptcy. Her husband, Ken, is a state trooper who patrols the northernmost stretch of the turnpike. 
 Then moments like the one on the Rideau Canal will come along. And the answer, again, is yes.
 ''The relationship that I have with my kids is really amazing,'' Mrs. Pilanski said.
 Then she added: ''I have no delusions that my kids are going to become the next Wayne Gretzkys. But you know what, I'm not sure I want that, anyway.''
 What they have now is a serious pastime. Their sons played in back-to-back tournaments over the Christmas holidays -- the first in Toronto, the second in Ottawa. Kenny, a center, is to play in a select tournament in Quebec this month that the family will attend.
 ''Her kid's a leader, and he's a real good player,'' Mr. Riley said.
 It is understood in the family: if hockey becomes a distraction, it goes. But both boys -- honor roll students in Bayonne -- use the travel time to and from practice to complete their homework. And Mrs. Pilanski said they miss only about 15 days of school a year.
 ''I told them two things when they were really young,'' Mrs. Pilanski said of her children. ''The first thing is, I'll call you two times for school. If you don't get up, I'm going back to bed. I'm not going to fight waking you up. The second thing is, if school slides, you're not going to be playing in a hockey game.''
 Along the way, the Pilanskis have become closer because of hockey, and are grateful to go to new places together. Mrs. Pilanski said that Kenny always thanks her for driving him to and from a practice, a game or a tournament.
 ''They spend time and money on me and my brother,'' Kenny said. ''It's nice they provide for us.''
 Oddly enough, the Pilanskis became involved with hockey largely by accident. Had Mrs. Pilanski not become sick one day while pregnant with Matt, the family might have picked another sport -- like, say, golf.
 Mrs. Pilanski's mother was taking care of Kenny one day when she went to a dollar store to find something for him to do. She bought what she thought were golf clubs, and Kenny played with them until they realized they were hockey sticks.
 ''She said, 'Kenny, we're playing hockey right now, not golf,''' Mrs. Pilanski remembers her mother saying that fateful day.
 A rink in Bayonne beckoned. When Kenny was 4 or 5, the Pilanskis took their two sons. Matt was put on skates with double blades, and Kenny liked skating enough to keep at it. Soon, he tried out for the Bayonne Rangers, a youth hockey team, and made it.
 ''It's just snowballed,'' Mr. Pilanski said.
 Later, Matt was allowed to play on Kenny's team, and at age 4 he became the youngest player in the state to score a goal in a youth hockey game, his mother said. The Pilanskis moved from the Bayonne youth program to one in Staten Island, then another.
 Three seasons ago, looking for stability, they enrolled their sons in the Devils youth hockey program -- even though West Orange is a 45-minute drive from Bayonne. The program, which traces its roots to 1974, has 250 to 300 players.
 The Devils youth club is one of 17 members of the Atlantic Youth Hockey League. Six other teams are based in New Jersey: New Jersey Colonials (Morristown), New Jersey Rockets (Bridgewater), Ice House Avalanche (Hackensack), Junior Titans (Farmingdale), Mercer Chiefs (Hamilton) and Junior Phantoms (Pennsauken). 
 The Devils provide only the use of their name and logo, said Kelly DiNorcia, the administrator for the program. But because the Devils have won the Stanley Cup three times since 1995, the organization has established some credentials.
 The program also was able to attract leaders like Mr. Riley, who has also coached at the United States Military Academy and is associated with the national youth development program run by USA Hockey.
 As talented as Mr. Riley is, he still needs help organizing his team, and that is where hockey moms like Mrs. Pilanski come in. Practice times vary from one week to the next, as do times and sites for games.
 ''The teams absolutely cannot function without a parent overseeing what's going on,'' Mrs. DiNorcia said recently.
 For one thing, a manager has to make sure the team schedule matches the master schedule for the program. Mrs. Pilanski sends schedules to the families and notifies them of changes with a phone call or an e-mail message. And she books hotels for out-of-town tournaments.
 Her white notebook is packed. Included in the hundreds of pages are medical forms. Although youth hockey is a sport based more on finesse than concussive body checks, collisions happen.
 ''From soup to nuts, the managers are involved in everything,'' said John DiNorcia, Kelly's husband, who is the coaching and program director for the Devils youth program. ''And they can take a negative situation and diffuse it.''
 Hockey is expensive: a stick costs $170, and skates are $400; parents of players who can squeeze more than one season out of a pair of skates consider themselves lucky.
 Mrs. Pilanski said sometimes Kenny will receive a $20 bill from a relative for Christmas or for his birthday, and he will immediately offer it to her to defray costs. She said she has often told him to save the money to buy something nice for himself.
 ''Sometimes,'' she said with a sad smile, ''I have to take it.''
 The investments -- economically and emotionally -- can run so deep that a rift can sometimes arise between a parent and a coach who is not giving as much playing time to a son or daughter as the parent thinks he or she deserves.
 For those kinds of reasons, the Devils youth program, like most others, has instituted a policy in which a parent cannot complain directly to the coach but must go through the manager. 
 ''You're kind of dealing with personalities, and the more information, in my opinion, that the coaches can have, the smoother the season goes,'' Mr. DiNorcia said. ''Having that policy probably eliminates 95 percent of any kind of issues that come up.''
 The team has struggled, but Mrs. Pilanski said her first season as a team manager has gone well otherwise. The parents are easy to work with, she said, and Mr. Riley said he has been delighted with Mrs. Pilanski's organizational skills.
 ''Hockey is a mask,'' Mr. Riley said. ''You are really teaching them about life. I've found as long as you treat the players fairly, there are no issues.''
 Mr. Pilanski also has made sacrifices and accommodations. He takes about 80 percent of his vacation time during hockey season, when he can also shuttle their sons to and from practices and games. ''It's like a chess match,'' he said.
 The stakes grow bigger with each season. Although Matt is already bigger, Kenny has become an accomplished player who is facing the biggest challenge of his hockey career. Tryouts were held in November for a select team to represent the Atlantic District in an international tournament this month in Quebec, and he was one of five players from the Devils youth program to make the team.
 ''Kenny is so focused on this,'' Mrs. Pilanski said.
 In the past, Kenny has stayed with his parents during tournaments, but this time he will be billeted at a house in Quebec. His parents plan to watch the games, but Kenny will be on his own. 
 It could be a peek into a future that is coming too quickly.
 If Kenny is successful and wants to keep playing, Mrs. Pilanski said, he could be selected to play on a USA Hockey developmental squad in Michigan. And because of the high-profile Devils program, prep schools in New Jersey have shown an interest in him.
 Further ahead, of course, is a potential professional career. But, Mrs. Pilanski said, ''We really don't talk about that much.''
 After all, Kenny, who along with his brother is a top science student, might tire of hockey. And the National Hockey League, whose season has been aborted by a lockout, might not even exist then in its current form.
 ''Hockey is such a forgotten sport in this country,'' Mrs. Pilanski said. ''And it's such a hard road to get there anyway.'' The Pilanskis know about road. The day after Christmas, the family left Bayonne for the Toronto suburbs in two cars. Accompanying the Pilanskis were Mrs. Pilanski's mother, who as she said with a laugh, ''started this whole problem.''
 Kenny played six games there in five days. On the last day of the tournament, Mrs. Pilanski shuttled Matt to Ottawa, a five-hour drive, for another tournament. Kenny and Ken joined the family in Ottawa after his team lost in the semifinals.
 Matt's last game in Ottawa ended on New Year's Day at 9:30 p.m., after they had skated together. Skirting an ice storm, the family drove all night, returning to Bayonne at 5:30 a.m. That afternoon, Kenny had a road game against the Mercer Chiefs.
 They are racing the clock in more ways than one. But Ken and Jan Pilanski say their sons give 1,000 percent to hockey and love the game more than ever.
 Funny. So do the parents.
 ''It's gone so fast,'' Mrs. Pilanski said. ''Before I blink my eyes, they're going to be gone.''

HEADLINE: Is Online Retailing a Victim of Its Own Success?

BYLINE: By CONRAD DE AENLLE

 BODY:
ONLINE retailers have benefited from some very conspicuous consumption, on their Web sites and especially on Wall Street. Shares of companies in the sector rose nearly 80 percent last year, among the best performances in the entire stock market.
 But investors seem to have developed a strong case of buyer's remorse. Many companies in the sector are trading lower since the start of this year, including two of the leaders, Amazon.com, down 19.3 percent, and eBay, off 40 percent. The stock of Shopping.com, a site that lets shoppers compare prices from different merchants, is down 33 percent.
 Amazon had been holding up better than the other two until Thursday, when the stock fell 15 percent after the company announced fourth-quarter earnings. It closed on Friday at $35.72. 
 Professional investors are divided over whether the declines are just a glitch in an upward trend or the start of a more serious fall. The optimists are encouraged by strong growth in profits and revenue; the pessimists are deterred by the high valuations at which the stocks now trade -- about 60 times the last 12 months' earnings for eBay, and 38 for Amazon. 
 The investment considerations aside, the sector is widely admired. ''I like the concept of Internet retailing,'' said Gil Knight, senior fund manager at Gartmore Global Investments in suburban Philadelphia. ''I think it really is established; people have got comfortable using it. If anything, I see it continually increasing, which is going to be good for some of these companies.''
 A report by Smith Barney predicts annual online sales growth of 15 to 20 percent for the next few years and 10 to 15 percent over the next 5 to 10 years. The report points out that while e-commerce growth has slowed in recent quarters, ''the slope of the deceleration has begun to flatten.''
 ''Growth is likely to be driven by lower prices, more shopping options (more online stores and greater selection), continued improvements in the user experience and further adoption of broadband access technologies,'' the report's authors wrote.
 The problem for investors, and for executives of online retailers, is that swift growth attracts many new players, said Safa Rashtchy, an Internet media and marketing analyst at Piper Jaffray in Menlo Park, Calif.
 ''We're generally cautious because e-commerce is becoming much more competitive,'' Mr. Rashtchy said.
 Specialty online retailers are also being joined by department store chains and omnibus retailers like Wal-Mart.
 Then there are the search engine operators that help consumers in online comparison shopping. These include Shopping.com and BizRate.com, while more diverse online businesses like Google and Yahoo have been strengthening their shopping search functions, Mr. Rashtchy said.
 He finds the best online retailing investments among search companies. ''Search still has tremendous growth in it,'' he said. ''It's the most efficient way to acquire customers. Google is in a good spot, and Yahoo, Ask Jeeves and Shopping.com are going to be prime beneficiaries'' of a trend toward use of comparison-shopping sites.
 Henry Ellenbogen, an Internet analyst at T.Rowe Price, is not so sure. The comparison-shopping sites generate revenue when companies pay to advertise on them; in turn, they pay for ads on bigger search engines like Google. Mr. Ellenbogen said the shopping sites could be squeezed as the search engine operators raised advertising rates.
 He prefers two other business models. One comprises platform providers like eBay that can benefit as the numbers of buyers and sellers increase, making the sites still more attractive to other users. Moreover, he said, there is no inventory to accumulate, and barriers to entering this business are high. EBay's name recognition and large following give the site a big advantage over anyone just entering the field.
 While Mr. Ellenbogen does not recommend Amazon stock, he likes companies that can benefit from ''negative working capital,'' as it does. A conventional retailer buys stock, then sells it. Amazon and smaller companies like Blue Nile reverse the order: they sell products, then pay suppliers weeks later, a process that can work financial wonders.
 But after the run-up in share prices last year, Mr. Ellenbogen warned investors to expect ''a choppy year'' in 2005. He added that if they remained patient, investors in eBay and Blue Nile should ultimately be rewarded.
 ''EBay's model is incredibly unique,'' he said. ''It has achieved critical mass and should experience strong growth in the next couple of years.''
 He credited Blue Nile with having ''a superior financial model.'' The company sells jewelry online and pays merchants 90 days later.
 Mr. Rashtchy says that he prefers comparison-shopping sites because online retailing is evolving into a commodity business. 
 Piper Jaffray has ''market perform'' ratings on eBay. Mr. Rashtchy called it ''a great company,'' but he added that ''some of the risks are not reflected yet'' in its share price. He also said the increased competition in online retailing had not been fully reflected in Amazon's price, even after last week's price decline. He maintained his ''underperform'' rating and lowered his price target to $33 from $35. But Lanny Baker, an analyst at Smith Barney, evidently thinks that enough selling is enough. After having lowered his rating on the stock last month to ''sell,'' he raised it back to ''hold'' on Thursday. He said, though, that the stock might not do well in the short term and lowered his price target to $36 from $40. 
 ''Marketing and technology spending will continue to crimp margins in 2005,'' he told investors on Thursday. He had said in an earlier note that ''healthy e-commerce activity benefits Amazon.com,'' but that ''other retailers have noticed the same trends, and we believe the heat of competition is rising.''
 Mr. Knight, at Gartmore, is more optimistic about the sector, but he is not recommending the stocks enthusiastically. He said he owned Amazon, but no other online retailers, in some of his funds. He called Amazon ''a creative company'' that is expanding into video rental and music downloads, but he asked, ''Is Amazon overpriced?'' He hesitated, then answered his own question.
 ''There's been a little bit of concern about margins,'' he said. Considering its price-to-earnings ratio, ''the stock is not being given away,'' he said, but because earnings are expected to grow strongly, although more slowly than in the recent past, he is willing to hang on to it.
 ''I'll pay that P/E for something that's going to grow 20 percent over the next few years,'' he said. ''I'm not sure I want to add to it right now, but I'm not going to sell it.''
 Perusing the alternatives, he added, ''Google's really overpriced.''
 MR. KNIGHT said he had considered other companies involved in Internet retailing, including Overstock.com and IAC/InterActiveCorp, then decided not to buy, citing rich valuations.
 He said he was concerned that stocks with high P/E ratios would be especially vulnerable to an economic and market downturn, with the most expensive companies affected most. He added, though, that he was not expecting such a downturn and that in any case online retailers' businesses might be able to withstand a slump, because shoppers would become even more price-conscious and thus more likely to seek out online bargains. 
 ''It might hurt traditional retailers,'' Mr. Knight said, ''but it might help the Internet guys.''

HEADLINE: The Only Game in Town

BYLINE: By Janis Owens. 
Janis Owens is the author, most recently, of ''The Schooling of Claybird Catts.''

DATELINE: Newberry, Fla. 

 BODY:
I AM a native of rural North Florida and live in one of the little feeder towns that supply our local urban giant, Jacksonville, with blue-collar workers and mall-shoppers and more than a few heart patients. Though I've lived here all my life, and have given myself freely to just about every Southern obsession on earth (family, Faulkner and fried chicken, to name a few) I deviate from the norm in one significant way: I don't really get football; I never have. 
 So I wasn't particularly excited when I learned that our big-city neighbor to the north had snagged that most sacred of winter rites, Super Bowl XXXIX. But maybe I was a little surprised. Although heralded by the N.F.L. as a city of ''Southern hospitality'' and ''Florida magic,'' Jacksonville is actually a sprawling concrete roller-rink of a town, one best known locally for good hospitals, old bridges and a conglomeration of Interstates so confusing that any visit by car is almost guaranteed to lead to at least one screaming match over a missed exit or a wrong lane. It's the place you go to visit the gravely ill or catch a plane. 
 Lately, of course, it is also a place to watch the Jaguars at Alltel Stadium, the crowning jewel of the city's urban renewal, and home of the annual Florida-Georgia college football brawl. It's the one game of the university's season where alcohol is openly consumed, often in enormous football-shaped beer steins, making for a predictably raucous crowd and a parking garage that reeks of the scent of too many fans and not enough toilets. 
 Given my feelings about football, the likelihood of my shelling out eBay's going price of two thou a ticket to attend the Super Bowl is mighty slim, though I like the neighborhood. Roller-rink or not, Jacksonville is indeed a hospitable town, with an annual jazz festival, good bookstores, and many pleasant, brick-walled dives. The locals call it the largest town in South Georgia, and with good reason -- it is closer to Savannah than Orlando, to Charleston than Miami, with live oaks every bit as impressive and a natural abundance of that old Southern scene stealer, Spanish moss. 
 Since it's both coastal and Southern, the food has a slightly New Orleans flair -- as do the natives, who are reputed to have a fairly loose weave in their moral fiber. Any breast-baring wardrobe malfunctions during the halftime show will more likely be rewarded with bead necklaces than censored, at least if they happen on the street. 
 You couldn't pay me to fight the crowd near Alltel Stadium today. But I could deal with a balcony at the Omni a few blocks east, where I would spend the evening sipping iced tea and watching the play of lights on the St. Johns River, listening to the roar of the crowd downstream, and wondering just what the heck it is all about, this religion that is football.

HEADLINE: New Career, New Urbanism

BYLINE: By Robert Johnson

 BODY:
After agreeing to merge his creation, MindSpring, with EarthLink in 1999, Charles M. Brewer stayed awhile as chairman of the combined company. He quit in the summer of 2000 after disagreeing with other EarthLink officials on strategy and what he called the combined company's ''core culture and beliefs.''
 After cashing in stock options worth more than $50 million, he didn't have to do much of anything. But now, at 46, he is building a 400-home development in Atlanta; he has invested $8 million in it. 
 At first glance, real estate development may seem an odd career choice for the man who invested $80,000 in MindSpring, an Internet service provider, in 1994. But Mr. Brewer, who has an economics degree from Amherst College and an M.B.A. from Stanford, said he was never really a high-tech guy. ''I'm more of an entrepreneur looking for interesting business ideas,'' he said.
 He previously didn't view real estate as a calling of high principle. ''I'm interested in the environment,'' he said. ''So I had always thought of developers as destroyers.'' He said he considered suburban sprawl distasteful: ''I just don't like a lot of what's being built -- garage doors facing the streets, walled-off subdivisions and commercial pods with big parking lots.'' 
 He researched ideas and came across ''new urbanism'': the blending of housing, offices, stores and parks into compact neighborhoods that foster a sense of community and reduce the need for driving. 
 He didn't find his lack of real estate experience daunting. ''To be a developer you just sort of say you are one,'' he said. ''It's not like you have to go back to school and take nuclear physics.''
 He founded Green Street Properties in 2001, bought 28 acres of former industrial land two miles east of downtown Atlanta and asked experienced developers and consultants to help design the development, Glenwood Park, where detached homes and row houses nestle beside shops, restaurants and small office buildings. He says the residences, at $150,000 to $700,000, are selling well, and he is already looking for other land to develop.
 That may be in a different part of town, or in another city. But he wants to keep living in Atlanta, where he bicycles to work. And he insists on being home at dinnertime with his wife, Jenny, and their three children. ''That's nonnegotiable,'' he said. Robert Johnson

HEADLINE: The Year Of Living Indecently

BYLINE: By FRANK RICH

 BODY:
LET us be grateful that Janet Jackson did not bare both breasts. 
 On the first anniversary of the Super Bowl wardrobe malfunction that shook the world, it's clear that just one was big enough to wreak havoc. The ensuing Washington indecency crusade has unleashed a wave of self-censorship on American television unrivaled since the McCarthy era, with everyone from the dying D-Day heroes in ''Saving Private Ryan'' to cuddly animated animals on daytime television getting the ax. Even NBC's presentation of the Olympics last summer, in which actors donned body suits to simulate ''nude'' ancient Greek statues, is currently under federal investigation. 
 Public television is now so fearful of crossing its government patrons that it is flirting with self-immolation. Having disowned lesbians in the children's show ''Postcards From Buster'' and stripped suspect language from ''Prime Suspect'' on ''Masterpiece Theater,'' PBS is editing its Feb. 23 broadcast of ''Dirty War,'' the HBO-BBC film about a terrorist attack, to remove a glimpse of female nudity in a scene depicting nuclear detoxification. Next thing you know they'll be snipping lascivious flesh out of a documentary about Auschwitz. 
 This repressive cultural environment was officially ratified on Nov. 2, when Ms. Jackson's breast pulled off its greatest coup of all: the re-election of President Bush. Or so it was decreed by the media horde that retroactively declared ''moral values'' the campaign's decisive issue and the Super Bowl the blue states' Waterloo. The political bosses of ''family'' organizations, well aware that TV's collective wisdom becomes reality whether true or not, have been emboldened ever since. They are spending their political capital like drunken sailors, redoubling their demands that the Bush administration marginalize gay people, stamp out sex education and turn pop culture into a continuous loop of ''Rebecca of Sunnybrook Farm.'' 
 With today's Super Bowl, their crusade has scored a touchdown. MTV has been replaced as halftime producer by Don Mischer, the go-to guy for a guaranteed snoozefest; his credits include the Tony Awards, the Kennedy Center Honors and the 2004 Democratic National Convention at which the balloons failed to drop. (His subsequent cursing was heard on CNN, but escaped government sanction because no Republicans were watching.) Fox Sports Net has changed the title of its signature program ''Best Damn Sports Show Period'' to ''Best Darn Super Bowl Road Show Period.'' The commercials, too, will ''be careful'' and in ''good taste,'' according to the head of marketing for Anheuser-Busch. Fox, which recently pixilated the bottom of a cartoon toddler in a rerun of the series ''Family Guy,'' now has someone on full-time rear-end alert: it rejected a comic spot for Airborne, a cold remedy, showing the backside of the 84-year-old Mickey Rooney as he leaves a sauna. 
 This might all be laughable were the government not expanding its role as cultural cop. But it is. The departures of Michael Powell, the Savonarola of the Federal Communications Commission, and John Ashcroft, whose parallel right-breast fixation was stimulated by a statue in the Justice Department, are red herrings. ''Thank God he's gone, but God help us with what's next,'' said Howard Stern upon learning of Mr. Powell's imminent exit. He's right. After all, L. Brent Bozell of the Parents Television Council condemned Mr. Powell for ''four years of failed leadership'' in fighting indecency. (Mr. Powell's commission had the temerity to actually reject some Parents Television Council jeremiads, which are distinguished by their inordinate obsession with the penis.) Mr. Bozell, whose organization has been second to none in increasing the number of annual indecency complaints from 111 in 2000 to a million-plus last year, is angling for a tougher successor and may well get one. 
 His wish has in effect been granted even before Mr. Powell's chair is filled. The second Bush term began with the installation of a powerful new government censor in another big job, Secretary of Education. Margaret Spellings hadn't even been officially sworn into the cabinet when she took on ''Postcards From Buster,'' threatening PBS with decreased financing because one episode had the show's eponymous animated rabbit hobnobbing with actual lesbian moms while visiting Vermont to learn how maple syrup is made. Though Buster had in previous installments visited Muslims, Mormons, Orthodox Jews and Pentecostal Christians, gay couples (even when not identified as such on camera) are verboten to our new Secretary of Education. ''Many parents would not want their young children exposed to the lifestyles portrayed in this episode,'' Ms. Spellings wrote in her threatening letter to Pat Mitchell, the C.E.O. of PBS.
 The letter, as it happened, was unnecessary: Public broadcasting says that it had decreed on its own only a few hours earlier that it would not distribute the offending show -- the most alarming example yet of just how cowardly it has become and how chilling the Janet Jackson effect has been. (Since then, some two dozen member stations out of a total of 349 have rebeled and decided to broadcast the episode anyway.) But the story won't end with this one incident. Ms. Spellings' threats against PBS are only the latest chapter in a continuing saga at an education department that increasingly resembles an authoritarian government's ministry of information. 
 A month before the election, The Los Angeles Times reported on its front page that the department had quietly destroyed more than 300,000 copies of ''a booklet designed for parents to help their children learn history'' after Lynne Cheney, who has no official government role, complained about its contents. The booklet burning occurred under the watch of Rod Paige, the education secretary who, we would later learn, was simultaneously complicit in another sub rosa exercise in heavy-handed government information management: the payment of $240,000 in taxpayers' funds to Armstrong Williams, a talking head and columnist, to plug Bush administration policies on radio and TV. 
 Mr. Paige fled his post last month without adequately explaining what he knew about these scandals. Enter Ms. Spellings, previously a White House aide who by some accounts had been a shadow administrator of the education department during Mr. Paige's out-to-lunch tenure. With all the other troubles in public education, why would she focus on a single episode of a single children's program on her second day in the job? We don't yet know. But her act was nothing if not ideologically synergistic with still another freshly uncovered Bush propaganda effort. Just as Ms. Spellings busted Buster, two more syndicated columnists copped to receiving taxpayers' dollars, this time siphoned through the Department of Health and Human Services, to help craft propaganda for a Bush ''healthy marriage initiative'' that disdains same-sex couples as fervently as Ms. Spellings did in her letter to PBS.
 What makes this story more insidious still is the glaring reality that the most prominent Republican lesbians in America are Mary Cheney, a former gay and lesbian marketing liaison for Coors beer, and her partner, Heather Poe, who appeared as a couple in public and on TV during the presidential campaign. That Ms. Spellings would gratuitously go after this specific ''lifestyle'' right after taking office is so provocative it smells like payback specifically pitched at those ''pro-family'' watchdogs who snarled at the mention of Ms. Cheney's sexual orientation during the campaign whether it was by John Kerry or anyone else. Surely Ms. Spellings doesn't believe in discrimination against nontraditional families: by her own account, she was a single mother who had to park her 13-year-old and 8-year-old children in Austin when she first went to work at the White House. Then again, President Bush went on record last month as saying that ''studies have shown that the ideal is where a child is being raised by a man and a woman'' ( even though, as The New York Times reported, ''there is no scientific evidence that children raised by gay couples do any worse'').
 That our government is now both intimidating PBS and awarding public money to pundits to enforce ''moral values'' agendas demonizing certain families is the ugliest fallout of the campaign against indecency. That campaign cannot really banish salaciousness from pop culture, a rank impossibility in a market economy where red and blue customers are united in their infatuation with ''Desperate Housewives.'' But it can create public policy that discriminates against anyone on the hit list of moral values zealots. Inane as it may seem that Ms. Spellings is conducting a witch hunt against Buster or that James Dobson has taken aim at SpongeBob SquarePants, there's a method to their seeming idiocy: the cartoon surrogates are deliberately chosen to camouflage the harshness of their assault on nonanimated, flesh-and-blood people.
 This, too, has its antecedent in the McCarthy era. In his novel ''The Amazing Adventures of Kavalier and Clay,'' Michael Chabon was extrapolating from actual history when one of his heroes, a gay comic book artist, is hauled before Congress to testify about pairing up ''strapping young fellows in tight trousers'' as superheroes. A Senate committee of the time did investigate the comics. Its guiding force was the psychiatrist Fredric Wertham's fear-mongering 1954 tome ''Seduction of the Innocent,'' which posited that Batman and Robin could corrupt children by inducing a ''wish dream of two homosexuals living together.'' The decency cops of that day, exemplified by closeted gay right-wingers like J. Edgar Hoover and Roy Cohn, escalated a culture war into one with human costs by conflating homosexuality with the criminality of treason. 
 One big difference between that America and ours is that the culture industry, public broadcasting not included, has gained much more power since then. Should today's Super Bowl falter in the ratings, its creators will lure that missing audience back next year with wardrobe malfunctions that haven't even been invented yet. 
 But gay parents whose ''lifestyle'' is vilified by a cabinet officer don't have that power. They're vulnerable even in a state like Vermont that respects their civil rights. ''I feel sick about it,'' Karen Pike of Hinesburg, Vt., told The Burlington Free Press, after learning that PBS had orphaned the ''Buster'' episode showing her, her partner and their three children. ''I understand they get public funding, but they should be the one station we feel confident in, in knowing that what we see there represents our country.'' 
 No one had told her that some stories are no longer welcome. You have to wonder if anyone has told Mary Cheney: Focus on the Family could not have been pleased to read last week's New York Post report that she has hired Bill Clinton's high-powered literary dealmaker to peddle her own story as a book.

HEADLINE: Working Out the Numbers

BYLINE: By EDUARDO PORTER

 BODY:
In presenting its plan to let working Americans divert part of their payroll taxes into private retirement accounts, the Bush administration now says the proposal will do nothing to solve Social Security's financial problems. But at the very least, the president indicated during his State of the Union address on Wednesday, it may offer workers a better deal.
 The accounts are intended to provide potentially higher rewards to help offset the lower guaranteed benefit workers would receive after they had carved a private account out of their Social Security contributions. But weaker investment returns or higher management fees could erode those expected benefits. 
 Take somebody who will be 19 this year and will enter the workforce in 2011 -- the first year in which younger workers will be allowed to open personal accounts -- earning $38,566 in today's dollars, what the Social Security Administration calls the ''medium wage.'' That is the figure, annually adjusted to reflect the rising cost of living, that the Social Security Administration uses to calculate the effect of Mr. Bush's plan on the typical American worker.
 This employee -- who currently faces a 6.2 percent wage tax, matched by his employer -- would be allowed to place as much as 4 percent of his wages in a personal account. A ceiling for contributions would be set at $1,000, rising each year by at least $100. By the time he retired at age 65 he could accumulate a substantial nest egg to add to the standard Social Security benefit.
 To reflect the substantially lower contributions to the standard Social Security system, though, the standard benefit would be considerably lower than under current law. The basic benefit, said a White House official, who briefed reporters on the plan last Wednesday and requested anonymity because he did not want to upstage the president's speech, would be cut by the amount contributed to the personal account, plus a sum that reflected the gains from investing it at a rate of return of 3 percent above inflation. 
 The worker could still come out ahead under these terms. If the account were to earn an average 4.9 percent a year after inflation, minus 0.3 percent in fees -- the figure often cited by White House officials based on estimates by the Social Security actuaries of the expected returns of a mixed portfolio of stocks and bonds -- the worker's piggy bank would grow to more than $188,000 in today's dollars if he invested the maximum allowed, according to calculations by Dean Baker of the Center for Economic and Policy Research. 
 Taken as an annuity payment that would last the rest of his life, that money would generate $11,270 a year, or $940 a month, Mr. Baker found. Even after the offset carved out of the standard Social Security check, this worker's retirement benefit would add up to $24,530 in today's dollars, or $2,044 a month. That would be substantially more than the $21,220 a year -- or $1,771 a month -- that Social Security currently promises a medium wage worker after a similar career ending in 2050. 
 But there are other possibilities. As investors discovered in 2000, stocks can fall in value and stay down for some time. If a poor equity market or ill-timed investments left the average return on this worker's personal account at just 1 percent better than inflation, instead of 4.6 percent, the benefit would add up to only $18,650 a year, or $1,550 a month. 
 Some economists worry that personal accounts would put the well-being of low income retirees at risk.
 ''The personal accounts increase the variance in your outcome,'' said Richard Burkhauser, the chairman of the department of political analysis and management at Cornell University. ''But if you are poor, are you in a position to have so much risk in your portfolio?''
 Kent Smetters, a professor of insurance at the Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania who supports private accounts, sees it differently. Professor Smetters says private accounts are a good idea because they will provide lower-wage workers with their first exposure to the stock market. ''I buy the idea of an ownership society,'' he said. 
 Under the plan, workers are meant to come out even if their personal accounts yield 3 percent in real terms, the expected rate of return on ultra-safe Treasury bonds, where Social Security puts its money today. 
 The White House is counting on keeping fees low. If the personal accounts paid a 1 percent annual fee, similar to what many workers in Britain have faced for the management of their private retirement accounts, a 3 percent real return would produce a nest egg that would yield an annual benefit of about $19,800, lower than today's promise. 
 Professor Smetters predicted that fees would be low. The administrative costs of the thrift savings plan for federal employees, on which Mr. Bush is modeling his plan, are even lower than White House estimates for the personal accounts, he said.
 Mr. Baker, who opposes the plan, predicts that monthly payouts would be lower than the White House projects because workers who do not expect to live long into retirement will take most of their benefit as a lump sum, leaving less for those who select an annuity. 
 And, this deal still does not solve Social Security's financial problems. ''In a long term sense,'' the White House official said at Wednesday's briefing, ''the personal accounts would have a net neutral effect on the fiscal situation of the Social Security and on the federal government.''
 Mr. Bush has not yet specified how he would restore the system to balance. Regardless of the method, the best that can be expected from private accounts is that they might cushion the blow of future cutbacks.

HEADLINE: From the Outside, They Still Look Like Banks

BYLINE: By C.J. HUGHES

 BODY:
AFTER a two-and-a-half year absence downtown, Balducci's -- the market that has hooked up generations of Greenwich Village foodies with everything from Asiago cheese to zucchini -- is reopening in early summer.
 The new location, in a lofty 25,000-square-foot former bank on the northwest corner of West 14th Street and Eighth Avenue, will surely please those who thought the previous 6,000-square-foot store on the Avenue of the Americas, now a Citarella, was too cramped.
 The move may also thrill fans of Beaux-Arts architecture. The three-story bank, built in 1897 for the New York Savings Bank but for the past decade a carpet showroom, retains cream-colored pilasters under a blue-patterned ceiling. Rather than mute these historic details, Balducci's plans to call attention to them, so shoppers at the first-floor deli counter or in the second-floor restaurant can appreciate the craftsmanship. 
 ''Frankly, what we are about is selling classic foods, and here we are in a setting that is itself a classic,'' said Balducci's chief executive, Mark Ordan. ''There's a lot of symmetry here.'' 
 Balanced pairings of this sort seem to have caught on elsewhere. From Wall Street to Midtown, turn-of-the-20th-century bank buildings -- somber, towering tributes to the power of capitalism, some designed by titans of American architecture -- now house banquet halls, theaters, fashion boutiques, shoe stores and spas. 
 Yet replacing teller booths with aromatherapy stations requires extensive remodeling, especially since the exteriors of many former banks cannot be altered. Some banks, like the one Balducci's is using, also have landmark status inside.
 Because of those restrictions, Balducci's will spend $2 million on improvements, including a cooling system for the refrigerator generators, Mr. Ordan said. Opening the safe in the basement cost $7,500, he said. Mr. Ordan would not disclose details of Balducci's lease, but a commercial broker said ground-floor retail rents in the area average $100 to $125 per square foot annually.
 Such renovations can introduce larger audiences to some remarkable buildings, which in turn can insure they stay protected, according to preservationists. ''It's been a really positive trend of the last five years,'' said Charles Belfoure, architect and author of the book ''Monuments to Money: the Architecture of American Banks,'' scheduled for release by McFarland in March. ''Even if the reuse isn't very creative, it's better to get something in there rather than knocking any of it down.'' 
 For banks whose appearance can be changed, owners sometimes choose to keep them looking institutional anyway, at least on the outside. ''The grandeur makes it that much more special,'' said William Kim, development director for A.I. & Boymelgreen Developers, which is converting the former East River Savings Bank, a 15-story limestone edifice at 60 Spring Street designed by Cass Gilbert in 1927, into residences. 
 After paying $37 million for the building in 2002, Boymelgreen spent $28 million replacing photography and artist studios with 42 luxury condos; all but one have been sold, Mr. Kim said.
 Now, the company is turning its attention to the 3,783-square-foot ground-floor space that it hopes to rent for $200 per square foot annually to either a fashion boutique or home-furnishings retailer, he said.
 But retailing is not always the best answer. Displaying refrigerators and air-conditioners was ultimately seen as a waste of unique space by the Haier Group, the Chinese appliance manufacturer that owns the former Greenwich Savings Bank, built in 1924 at 1356 Broadway at West 36th Street.
 After using the main hall of the building as a sales showroom for a few months, in August 2002 Haier renamed the cavernous 70-foot-high space Gotham Hall and began renting it out for exclusive private events like college fund-raisers and fashion shows. 
 Why build such evocative Greek temples to begin with? To inspire confidence. When the United States economy collapsed in the Panic of 1893, many people blamed banks for the depression that followed and withdrew their money.
 So, banks built in that era (until the end of the Great Depression, when banks began to demystify themselves with glass-fronted branches) were meant to suggest strength, as if they had been there forever. 
 The former Bowery Savings Bank at Grand Street, designed by Stanford White in 1895 with a glowing amber glass ceiling and a buffed terrazzo floor, is now the site of bar mitzvahs and weddings as Capitale, a banquet hall that opened in October 2002. ''I think any reasonable person who looks at a building as historical as this would want to preserve it,'' said the owner, Seth Greenberg, who has spent $4 million to rehabilitate the 36,000-square-foot space. 
 Farther uptown, at the old Union Square Savings Bank, created by Henry Bacon, who designed the Lincoln Memorial, is the Daryl Roth Theater. Its tall ceilings were ideal for the acrobatic troupe De La Guarda, which performed there from 1998 till last September.
 Now, after months of painting, polishing and rewiring, the theater is ready for a new play, probably by this summer. ''It's funny these old buildings can work for you and against you,'' said the general manager, Adam Hess, citing how difficult it was to move equipment through the narrow doors. 
 Although on a high-visibility corner and slightly elevated off the sidewalk, the Union Square bank draws attention to its function without much flash.
 Today, a bank branch can also be midblock, with a neon-bright marquee, mannequin window displays and shimmering glass and chrome fixtures. ''It's all about colors and comfort levels,'' said Lee Carpenter, chief executive of Design Forum, which designed Washington Mutual's 30 Manhattan branches. 
 ''It was all about matching the physical experience with a corporate brand,'' one that emphasizes a casual, interactive experience, he said.
 Though older banks may be more formal, sharp-eyed commercial developers began to see their potential about a decade ago. 
 In 1996, the Memorial Sloan-Kettering International Center moved into a well-scrubbed Art Deco berth, with a clock still ticking over its front door, at 1429 First Avenue, at East 74th Street. In the same year, Blue Water Grill opened in the former Bank of the Metropolis facing Union Square.
 With the trend catching on, the restaurateur Giuseppe Cipriani opened a 15,000-square-foot banquet hall in the old Bowery Savings Bank branch on East 42nd Street, opposite Grand Central Terminal, in 1999.
 The same year, developers added 11 condos upstairs at the old New York County National Bank, on the southwest corner of Eighth Avenue and West 14th Street, opposite Balducci's; its downstairs is home to Nickel spa for men. 
 Uptown on Eighth Avenue, at West 43rd Street, the boxy 1927 Manufacturers Hanover Bank houses the Second Stage Theater, its ticket window tucked snugly into the basement safe.
 Still, time has not treated every old bank branch kindly. An unremarkable conversion of the First Federal Savings and Loan Association at 237 First Avenue, at East 14th , has left it with a series of pharmacies. 
 And the former First National City Bank of New York, a prominent 1928 building at Canal and Broadway, is almost unrecognizable under a grab bag of shops selling cheap jewelry, berets and scarves. Maybe its best chance at salvation is to welcome back tellers.

HEADLINE: If Profits Grow, How Can the Market Sink?

BYLINE: By MARK HULBERT. 
Mark Hulbert is editor of The Hulbert Financial Digest, a service of MarketWatch. E-mail: strategy@nytimes.com.

 BODY:
THE faster corporate earnings grow, the better the stock market performs. That is a tenet of Wall Street, but like so much other conventional wisdom, it turns out to be false.
 In fact, since 1927, according to data from Ned Davis Research of Atlanta, the market has performed best during quarters when earnings are as much as 25 percent below year-earlier levels. When earnings are growing strongly, as many expect them to do this year, the market has tended to have below-average performance. 
 Of course, these findings for the overall market run counter to the experience of specific companies. For many of them, the relationship of earnings growth and stock price is often positive -- especially when a company exceeds profit expectations. 
 But according to a recent study, it makes sound economic sense that what sometimes prevails for one company does not apply to the overall market. The study, ''Stock Returns, Aggregate Earnings Surprises, and Behavioral Finance,'' by S.P. Kothari, an accounting professor at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology; Jonathan W. Lewellen, an M.I.T. finance professor; and Jerold B. Warner, a finance professor at the University of Rochester, has been circulating as an academic paper since last year. A copy is at http://papers.ssrn.com/abstract=380127.
 The reason that the overall market usually fails to react more favorably to rapidly rising earnings is not that earnings growth is bearish itself. The problem, the professors say, is that such growth usually leads to higher interest rates. When rates rise, the net present value of future earnings, cash flow and dividends automatically falls, and this generally causes the market to decline.
 The professors say the Federal Reserve is unlikely to feel pressure to raise rates when just one company reports better-than-expected earnings. So the company's profit growth can be expected to translate into a higher stock price. But the Fed will certainly feel that pressure when aggregate market earnings rise quickly.
 To be sure, the professors' findings are based on a long-term average, and exceptions are inevitable. One occurred in the last couple of years, when earnings grew at a double-digit rate and the overall market performed well, too. But Professor Lewellen says that this recent experience is ''the exception that proves the rule,'' because the Fed kept interest rates artificially low over much of this period. That prevented the fast growth of marketwide earnings from having usual negative consequences. 
 The powerful role of interest rates in the stock market's valuation also explains why the market tends to perform best when aggregate corporate earnings are falling. Ned Davis Research says that since 1927, the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index has risen at a 28 percent annualized rate -- nearly triple its historical average -- during quarters in which earnings were 10 to 25 percent lower than where they were in the periods a year earlier.
 This bullish effect vanishes, however, when earnings are falling too much. Ned Davis Research found that during those few quarters since 1927 when earnings were more than 25 percent below their year-earlier levels, the S.&P. 500 declined at a rate of 28 percent, annualized. Professor Lewellen says that this is consistent with the results of his research. ''The positive effects of lower interest rates, though strong enough to overcome the negative consequences of more modest declines,'' he said, ''are unable to overcome them when earnings are falling by a huge amount.'' 
 An implication of the professors' study is that the market's performance is likely to be below average this year, because of the consensus expectation for double-digit profit growth accompanied by rising interest rates. S.&P. estimates that per-share operating earnings of the S.&P. 500 companies in the first quarter will be 14 percent higher than in the year-earlier period. Earnings for all of 2005 are projected to grow 12 percent. In quarters since 1927 when profit growth has been in the neighborhood of what S.&P. is projecting this year, according to Ned Davis Research, the S.&P. 500 has appreciated at an annualized pace of 5.8 percent. That is about half the market's long-term average rate.
 The pattern discerned by the professors could create buying opportunities down the road. That is because investors tend to drive market valuations way down when interest rates rise over a sustained period. A diversified stock portfolio bought at a time of depressed valuations can be expected to appreciate when interest rates fall. But if the pattern holds this time, it's way too early for the market to start going much higher.

HEADLINE: Engines in the Quiet Corner? Gentlemen, Start Your Debate

BYLINE: By PETER APPLEBOME. 
E-mail: peappl@nytimes.com

DATELINE: Plainfield, Conn. 

 BODY:
THE Quiet Corner, as the northeastern part of Connecticut is called, is home to rich colonial history, quaint farms, classic town greens and lots of towns that have seen better days. Before too long, some area residents ardently hope, it will also be home to the world's first indoor auto raceway, a $343 million, 140,000-seat domed racetrack and convention center for hot rods, dragsters, monster trucks, supercharged motorcycles and -- in their wildest dreams -- Nascar. More on that later.
 Hundreds of agitated people from across northeastern Connecticut braved the sleet and rain Thursday night for a hearing that ended up being canceled amid cries from both supporters and opponents of the raceway that something fishy was going on. As it turned out, the cancellation apparently came about because an announcement of the meeting had not been properly posted. 
 But as residents slug it out over whether it's a terrific idea (jobs and tax revenue) or a terrible one (noise and traffic congestion) to build a 425-foot high, 55-acre dome on the site of what's now a foundering dog track, a split-level quandary is playing out.
 The immediate issue is whether the gargantuan project makes sense. The second is, what does it say about the big bang theory of development that seems to be changing Connecticut from the Land of Steady Habits to the Land of Supersize This?
 If one judges by the rendering of the proposed New England Raceway, the project would produce something that would look like a gigantic tortilla hovering over the landscape off Interstate 395. It got its start when its developer, Gene Arganese, put geography, zeitgeist and sporting fashions together. He figured the Foxwoods and Mohegan Sun casinos had made eastern Connecticut a huge tourist destination, and the area has an enormous natural constituency of people from Boston, New England and New York. And everywhere he looked, he kept noticing Dale Earnhardt or Nascar decals and gear. Voila! Gentlemen, start your engines.
 First, he took his plan to nearby North Stonington. He got nowhere. 
 His next stop was Plainfield, where he promised that the track would bring in Nascar, racing's most popular offering, but Nascar officials said he had no prospects of getting a slot in its coveted Nextel circuit. ''Here is one $2 wager that pigs will fly at Exit 87 off I-395 before Tony Stewart flies off the handle during a Nextel Cup race here,'' a columnist for The Hartford Courant scoffed, referring to a leading Nascar racer. A popular racing Web site termed the idea of a domed racing facility ''ridiculous.'' In November, Plainfield's planning and zoning commission voted 3-2 against creating the zoning district needed for the project.
 But three months later, Mr. Arganese is still going full bore. He has revised the proposal to address the board's objections. He touts a study he commissioned by the Connecticut Center for Economic Analysis, which projects that the project could create 6,145 jobs. He now says, Who needs Nascar? ''There are so many racing events out there, our advisers tell us we could run 360 days a year and keep it full,'' Mr. Arganese enthuses. And in an area that has been declining for decades, the lure of potential jobs and tax revenues makes his improbable dream seem to some better than no dream.
 ''Like in 'Field of Dreams,' build it and they will come,'' said Walter Flowers, a member of a pro-racing group, Back the Track. ''We need jobs. Quiet Corner? Far as I'm concerned, it's going to be a ghost town if something doesn't happen here.''
 Which is where the big picture comes in. Let's see. Connecticut now has the world's biggest casino, Foxwoods, which just announced plans for a $700 million addition. Mohegan Sun, similarly ambitious, also includes what it bills as the world's largest planetarium dome. Another developer has proposed a $600 million movie theme park with a movie studio and college for the performing arts on the site of the former Norwich Hospital. When John G. Rowland was governor, he struck out on the big hit he wanted most, luring the New England Patriots. (The team's recent stellar seasons are another reason for him to feel miserable.) Instead, he hoped his legacy would be Adriaen's Landing, the $770 million revitalization project under way in Hartford.
 So maybe the Quiet Corner will become the raceway's noisy corner. But some people in Connecticut worry that the state now gravitates toward grandiose long shots at the expense of more traditional and reliable ways to create jobs.
 ''There can be good aspects to it,'' said Roy Occhiogrosso, a Democratic political consultant. ''The downside is that it's kind of like throwing up a Hail Mary pass. It works once in a blue moon, and you run off the field giving high fives. But more often, it gets batted down in the end zone. And what you end up doing is expending a lot of energy that takes the focus off growing jobs the old-fashioned way.''

HEADLINE: Social Security's Future? First, Consider the Present

BYLINE: By DANIEL ALTMAN

 BODY:
IS there a crisis in Social Security? The White House says yes. ''Social Security was a great moral success of the 20th century, and we must honor its great purposes in this new century,'' President Bush said last week in his State of the Union address. ''The system, however, on its current path, is headed toward bankruptcy.'' 
 Others, especially left-leaning research organizations, say no. Dire warnings ''seriously misrepresent Social Security's financing and the challenges the program faces,'' said a report released last month by the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities. 
 They are both missing an important point: however you choose to interpret the long-term predictions, Social Security's fiscal future is affecting the nation's economy today.
 The no-crisis camp has based much of its argument on figures in a report released last month by the Social Security Administration. The report estimates that under current law, the program will be able to pay all the benefits promised to retirees until 2042, leaving plenty of time to pursue alternatives. And even with no changes, the program would still be able to pay about 73 percent after 2042. So, this camp asks, where's the crisis? 
 The White House has its fiscal answer. But there is an economic problem that both sides are ignoring. 
 Start with some facts. The bulk of the people who will be receiving benefits in 2042 will be 70 to 85 years old. Today, those people are 33 to 48 -- in other words, they are the core of the nation's work force.
 Now say those people just found out that Social Security would pay 73 percent, not 100 percent, of their benefits in retirement. How would that news change their behavior? There would be two effects.
 The first would be on saving. Because a chunk of their retirement income would be vanishing, many of these workers would probably choose to save more on their own. To save more, they would have to spend less. And less spending means a lower standard of living, as well as a hole in the economy.
 Some of the workers might not decide to save more. They could become victims of the kind of financial nearsightedness that Social Security was supposed to combat. When they finally retired without enough savings, they would have to throw themselves upon the government's mercy.
 The other effect would be on the supply of labor. That is because the news about lower benefits could be the same as saying, ''Your tax rate on today's income just went up.''
 How can that be, without any change in the law? Here's the explanation: The Social Security payroll tax isn't always a tax. Many people receive just as much money back from Social Security in retirement -- or more -- as they would have if they had invested their contributions in the market. For them, Social Security is a saving device.
 In fact, the true effect of Social Security could vary from a wage tax of 12.4 percent -- the total of employer and employee contributions -- all the way down to a wage subsidy of almost 40 percent, according to methodology from a paper published in 1993 by Martin Feldstein of Harvard and Andrew Samwick of Dartmouth. (Disclosure: Professor Feldstein was one of my academic advisers.)
 The reason has to do with the program's rules. People who earn very low incomes receive a relatively generous Social Security benefit when they retire, meaning that they can make money from the program. More important, however, is the treatment of couples.
 For retired couples, the system pays the bigger of two amounts: the sum of the two streams of benefits that the two earners would receive by themselves, or 150 percent of the benefits of the person with the higher earnings. Consider a couple in that second category. The payroll contributions the lower earner made would count for nothing; the full 12.4 percent of wages that he or she paid would have been a pure tax. Yet for the higher earner, the 150 percent payoff may make the payroll contributions seem like a wage subsidy.
 Go back to the people who were going to get back exactly what they put in. The net tax rate imposed on them by Social Security used to be zero. But now, they can expect to receive only 73 percent of their benefits; the other 27 percent was a false promise. So for them, the extra tax on the first $90,000 of this year's income is 3.3 percent -- 27 percent of that 12.4 percent rate. 
 That tax increase is significant, equal to about a third of the federal income tax rate paid by people earning $50,000 to $100,000 in 2002. It may not look like much at the margin, but that depends on how you define the margin. Raising taxes this way might be enough to affect people's willingness to work. But if they worked less, they would have even less disposable income. And then they would have to cut spending by even more if they wanted to keep their retirement savings steady.
 THE biggest impact would be on those higher earners in couples, whose wage subsidies would fall, but also on the lowest earners who still qualified for Social Security -- the ones for whom the payroll contributions are fairly unlikely to be a pure tax. Those people are also the ones the no-crisis camp often says it cares about most. So why hasn't anyone said anything?
 Well, the economic effects have been more of a slow burn than a sudden reaction. Millions of Americans already doubt that Social Security will be around when they retire, and they may have already begun to change their behavior. But that doesn't mean these effects are nonexistent. Rather, it means that doing something about Social Security's seemingly far-off problems could unlock considerable economic gains today.

HEADLINE: What Meat Means

 BODY:
Most Americans do not want to know how the meat they eat is produced, if only so they can continue to eat it. Nearly every aspect of meat production in America is disturbing, from the way animals are raised, to inadequate inspection of the final product. When it comes to what happens in the slaughterhouse, most of us mentally avert our eyes. Yet in the past decade, the handling of livestock on their way to the killing floor has actually been one of the parts of the business that has improved most significantly. What is most alarming at the slaughterhouse is not what happens to the animals -- they have already met their fate. It is what happens to the humans who work there. 
 A large slaughterhouse is the truly industrial end of industrial farming. It is a factory for disassembly. Its high line speeds place enormous pressure on the workers hired to take apart the carcasses coming down the line. And because the basic job of the line is cutting flesh -- hard, manual labor -- the dangers are very high for meat workers, whose flesh is every bit as vulnerable as that of the pork or beef or chicken passing by. 
 The problem of worker safety is compounded by the fact that meatpackers, driven by the brutal economics of the industry, always try to hire the cheapest labor they can find. That increasingly means immigrants whose language difficulties compound the risks of the job. The result, according to a new report by Human Rights Watch, is ''extraordinarily high rates of injury'' in conditions that systematically violate human rights. 
 In fact, the report finds, some major players in the American meat industry prey upon a large population of immigrant workers who are either ignorant of their fundamental rights or are undocumented aliens who are afraid of calling attention to themselves. As a result, those workers often receive little or no compensation for injuries, and any attempt to organize is met with hostility.
 The industry has little incentive to improve conditions on its own, except a decent regard for human rights. The only reasonable prospect of improvement depends on the enforcement of federal and state law. Unfortunately, those laws at present are too weak and too riddled with loopholes to provide the regulations needed to increase worker safety and improve workers' rights. A systematic regulatory look at the meat industry, with an eye to toughening standards, is desperately needed.
 In recent years, Americans have had the habit of thinking of wide-scale workplace abuses as foreign affairs -- the kind of thing that turns up in Southeast Asia, for instance. And, in a sense, the abuses found in American slaughterhouses are international matters, because so many of the workers are actually citizens of other countries. But in this case, the abuses are taking place right at home, and as part of our food chain. In a carb-conscious era, the meat processing industry should be a place of opportunity for workers who put all that protein on your plate. Right now, that is hardly the case.

 Re ''Lessons for the American Empire'' (Economic View, Jan. 30), which compared the current might of the United States to the past dominance of the British Empire and the Soviet Union: 
 It would seem that the Bush administration is using history as a cookbook for ending American political, economic and cultural hegemony. No economic entity, corporate or political, can remain strong if it takes on excessive debt for anything other than productive capital assets. Our investments in the military and war are increasingly out of proportion to our investments in productivity. Our strength, in other words, will eventually bring us to our knees.

HEADLINE: Out of Sight, Out on Strike

BYLINE: By KIRK SEMPLE

DATELINE: YONKERS 

 BODY:
A MOROSE and quiet war of attrition is being waged on a bank of the Hudson River here. The battle line is the southernmost gate to the city's century-old sugar refining and packing plant.
 Seven weeks ago, all of the plant's 200 or so unionized workers went on strike in an effort to force better contract terms from the plant's owner, American Sugar Refining Inc. The workers have staged a round-the-clock picket since then, bundled in winter coats and knit caps against the frosty river wind. 
 On the other side of the gate, the plant's managers, supplemented by temporary workers and employees on loan from the owner's plants in Chalmette, La., and Baltimore have struggled to maintain production and satisfy demand.
 The plant, which produces the Domino Sugar brand, has been a part of the local landscape since the turn of the 20th century and is one of the last vestiges of an era when Yonkers was a full-fledged industrial town. The Otis Elevator Company and Alexander Smith Carpet Mills operated huge plants in downtown Yonkers before they closed in the second half of the 20th century.
 The sugar mill, however, held on, even as the national industry contracted. According to Donald Brainard, vice president for human resources for American Sugar Refining, about a dozen sugar refineries have closed in the past 10 to 15 years, the most recent being American Sugar Refining's plant in Brooklyn last year.
 The strike, which began Dec. 20, has a lonely, desultory air about it. The pickets spend the day shifting from foot to foot to keep warm, chatting among themselves. But they -- and the plant -- are out of view from the rest of the city, at the bottom of a hill, by way of a circuitous route through a mixed-use residential and industrial neighborhood. 
 The strikers say few people, including neighbors and friends, seem to be aware there is a strike under way, even though about a quarter of the workers are from Yonkers and second-generation employees are common. They get few visitors or well-wishers.
 ''You'd think the mayor would stop by,'' shrugged Pete Forcelli, 58, a rigger and welder who lives in Yonkers and has worked at the plant for 25 years. ''They want to bring new industry to Yonkers, which is good, but how about helping the old businesses?''
 During one recent midday stretch, several trucks crossed the picket line to retrieve loads of refined and packaged sugar. The strikers quietly watched the trucks roll in, and only once did a picket display any aggression: a snowball, trailed by an expletive, tossed at an idling truck.
 It has been harder to get a read on the atmosphere inside the plant. The company declined a request for a tour of the complex. But in a telephone interview, Mr. Brainard adopted a somewhat regretful tone that negotiations had come to this -- even if he placed the blame squarely on the union.
 ''I'm a homegrown local boy,'' said Mr. Brainard, who started at the plant 41 years ago running samples from the production plant to a laboratory for testing. ''I take these things very, very seriously. I find it very, very difficult the state we're at right now.''
 The workers have been without a contract since Oct. 4, when the last one expired. Negotiations ended Dec. 19, when the union rejected the company's final offer. A federal mediator brought the sides together for a special session Jan. 20, but the day ended with the parties further apart.
 Wages, pension and welfare benefits are the issues. The union is seeking a three-year contract with 3 percent annual raises each year. It also wants increases in pension and welfare benefits.
 In its final offer on Dec. 17, the company offered a lump-sum payment of $750 in the first year of a three-year contract, with 2 percent increases in the second and third year, and it did not meet the union's pension and welfare demands, according to Fred Gaffney, the vice president for the bargaining unit, International Longshoreman's Union Local 1814, and a 24-year veteran of the plant.
 Mr. Brainard said he would not discuss the terms of the final contract or details of the negotiations. ''The company wasn't reducing anything that the current union members have,'' he said.
 He explained that the company was facing increasing costs of energy, raw materials and employee benefits, forcing it to cut costs wherever possible.
 ''It's very difficult for our industry to pass those increases along to our customers,'' he said.
 American Sugar Refinery, like the rest of the sugar industry, has also had to grapple with a decline in the consumption of sugar, particularly cane sugar, which has had to compete with beet sugar, high-fructose corn syrup and other sweeteners. In addition, pressure is rising to roll back import quotas and price supports.
 But the union believes there is something more nefarious at work: a hardball effort to cripple labor.
 The majority owner of the plant is Florida Crystals, the agricultural conglomerate based in West Palm Beach, Fla., and led by the prominent Fanjul family of Palm Beach, Fla.
 Florida Crystals, in partnership with Sugar Cane Growers Cooperative, bought the plant in 1998, becoming the latest in a long series of owners during the 20th century. Nearly all the 500,000 tons of raw sugar shipped to the plant each year for processing comes from the Fanjuls' sugar cane fields in Florida, Mr. Brainard said.
 ''These guys are basically like the king of the hill with all the subsidies -- and we can't get a nickel,'' Mr. Forcelli said.
 In late December, a strike by workers at a Florida Crystals sugar plant in Okeelanta, Fla., collapsed after four days when scores of union members crossed the picket line alongside temporary workers. Fearing they would permanently lose their jobs in a region with high unemployment, the union accepted a contract with fewer benefits than the old one.
 ''They're tough, they are tough,'' Louis Pernice, president of Local 1814, said of the Fanjuls.
 The Yonkers strikers speak about management with the kind of rancor one would expect on a picket line. But they insist that it has not always been this way. Other strikes at the refinery were largely free of the animosity that characterizes this one, the strikers say. They blame the change in tone on the owners and on new managers who were brought in from the company's closed Brooklyn plant.
 ''We used to be a family,'' Mr. Forcelli recalled. ''We always used to work it out. We used to sit down with the foremen, have coffee and stuff.''
 Valerio Piacente, 51, who started at the factory when he was 17 and worked with his father, brother and two uncles, said, ''The old-timers are turning around in their graves right now.''

HEADLINE: In Pennsauken, a Deal Gone Bad

BYLINE: By ROBERT STRAUSS

DATELINE: PENNSAUKEN 

 BODY:
CALL it an object lesson in grandiose schemes gone awry. Or consider it a warning not to bet against the house at Caesars. 
 But this much is certain: planners in Pennsauken -- a blue-collar town in Camden County that is striving to trade up to a starched white shirt -- have their hands full as they try to pick up the pieces on a 65-acre patch of property that was to be the site of a 6,400-seat minor league hockey arena and civic center.
 Last week, Louis Cappelli Jr., the Camden County freeholder director, had to acknowledge, ''Without a guarantee that a hockey team would be economically viable, the project in its previous form does not make sense.''
 While Mr. Cappelli's admission was hardly surprising, many found it infuriating, particularly merchants who for 50 years worked at the site, known as the Pennsauken Mart, executives at Caesar's Entertainment Inc., who have already had to kick in millions of dollars despite their objections all along, and politicians opposed to project. 
 The situation last week was a marked shift from August 2003, when Mr. Cappelli and his colleagues on the freeholder board proclaimed a ''great day for our entire region'' produced by ''a jewel in the South Jersey crown.''
 After all, the arena and conference center -- with such promised adornments as a hotel and retail stores -- was expected to generate as much as $100 million in private investment and as many as 700 jobs. 
 And with George E. Norcross III, South Jersey's premier Democratic political power broker, in support of the project and holding the hockey franchise, the Casino Reinvestment Development Authority (known as CRDA and pronounced CREE-da) was inclined to sign off on a $24 million grant -- the largest ever earmarked for a project outside Atlantic County -- that was to provide the financial underpinnings for the project. Soon, however, a hitch developed because of Mr. Norcross's direct involvement, and it soon seemed that the money would be forthcoming only if Mr. Norcross would be going.
 Ultimately, Mr. Norcross removed himself from the project, a move that some now say foretold its unraveling.
 From the start, executives at Caesars Entertainment considered the plan ill-conceived. To them, spending even a dime on a minor league hockey arena in Pennsauken was a sucker's bet. Now, 17 months and at least $2.4 million later, the proposed civic center is dead.
 As the freeholders explained in a news release far less glowing than the one in August 2003, its ''project team'' would ''examine other forms and types of family-and sports-oriented community facilities.'' 
 Caesars is still not buying.
 ''In our view this project is dead and over,'' said Robert Stewart, a spokesman for Caesars. ''We don't think any more money should be spent on that project, and we are looking for CRDA to get the money back. But we know that it is going to take CRDA a long time and a great effort to get out of this bad project.''
 Indeed, Curtis Bashaw, executive director of the development agency, said the grant would go forward because the project is not in violation of the agreement, which merely says that there has to be movement forward. Since the county is in the process of demolishing a multiplex movie theater near the mart and is trying to relocate merchants, that is sufficient.
 But it was not only the sudden change in plans but the manner in which it happened that disturbed some officials.
 State Senator Diane Allen, a Republican from Burlington County, said she was slightly stunned by events. ''I was surprised at how the information came out -- a press release on a Friday,'' Ms. Allen said. ''The idea of getting rid of the mart, while it's a moot point now, may have been hasty. If we are talking about economic redevelopment, the first thing you watch out for is crushing development that is working.''
 The Crossroads Project -- so named because the swath of land sits at the confluence of three major highways, Routes 130, 73 and 90 -- was expected to help transform this frayed inner-ring suburb, starting with the Pennsauken Mart, an oddment from a past era.
 The mart is not a mall with a Nordstrom as its anchor. Nor is it even a Best Buy. It is a 50-year-old proto-mall with no air conditioning or skylights, just shops and stores for the low-salaried worker, offering soft pretzels and chintz, ninja masks and second-hand CDs, collectables and disposables.
 Even though many of the merchants have yet to pack up and leave the mart, the Camden County Improvement Authority -- which spent $13.2 million to buy the Mart -- insists that it still intends to tear it down despite the lack of an alternative plan.
 ''The market conditions have changed,'' said Jeffrey Swartz, executive director and chief executive of the Camden County Improvement Authority, which is overseeing the project. ''The cost of building materials has gone up. Interest rates have gone up. You have to reanalyze our model.''
 For now, in the aftermath of this abandoned project, there are raw feelings, a flurry of lawsuits and a number of unanswered questions. For starters, a quarter of the mart's 100 tenants have left because shoppers -- assuming the businesses are closed down -- have stopped coming.
 The $24 million grant from the casino agency, to be spread out over 10 years, is continuing to flow in. Last year, the first payment went toward paying debt service on the $13.2 million the Camden County authority paid for the property. And according to Mr. Swartz, a second payment, due this month, will pay off another chunk of that.
 But Caesars is adamant that the money should stop flowing. Although the company lost a lawsuit last year aimed at stopping the original financing, it won the right to be consulted on further projects -- financed by the casino agency with the tax on casino earnings. 
 ''CRDA always consulted with us in the past, so we never objected to any other disbursement,'' Mr. Stewart said. ''But this -- this you could see wasn't a good project to begin with.''
 Certainly not for merchants at the mart. Before the project's inception, the mart was fully occupied, open each Wednesday through Sunday, its hallways filled with bargain hunters. Once the redevelopment seemed to be launched, the county tried to relocate the merchants. For the last several months, it has been working with developers to move what is left of the mart's merchants to an abandoned shopping center in Willingboro.
 ''At this point, Willingboro is our only hope,'' said Kerry Yobb, owner of Gold Emporium, a jewelry store. ''It only works if we go as one. They could split us up, but it is the kind of place where we depend on each other. We are small merchants and we depend on customers to browse and stop two or three places.''
 Mr. Cappelli, the freeholder director, had a less romanticized view of the mart, which he characterized as ''an eyesore that has been an underutilized property for several years.''
 ''The tenants were a victim of a landlord who paid little or no attention to their surroundings,'' he added.
 But to the merchants, that is not the point.
 ''The merchants had never been given enough notice to protest the proceedings,'' said Mark Frost, a lawyer who represented the merchants in an unsuccessful lawsuit against the county and the casino agency.
 The history of the project actually dates to the middle 1990's, when officials decided the county needed an arena or civic center sort for large events. After all, they reasoned, Camden High School had nationally ranked basketball teams but often had to go on the road for big games. High school graduations had to be held outdoors, susceptible to changes in the weather.
 The county first tried to place the civic center in Lawnside, but local opposition to the project killed it. Similar protests took place in Gloucester and Winslow Townships in the southern, less-populated end of the county. 
 Then, three years ago, the mart site suddenly entered the picture. Mr. Norcross, who grew up in Pennsauken, acquired a minor league hockey franchise and envisioned a small civic center -- what would have been the 6,400-seat arena. It seemed like a good deal, particularly since Mr. Norcross's brother, Donald, is president of the Southern New Jersey Central Labor Council, a consortium of unions totaling nearly 90,000 workers.
 ''When we held a community meeting to protest the eminent domain proceedings, every time we made a point against the arena, we were shouted down by big men yelling: 'We want jobs. We want jobs,''' Mr. Yobb said. ''I was apparently naive.''
 Ultimately, Mr. Norcross turned his rights to the hockey team to a fellow Commerce Bank employee, Bernie Parent, who was a popular goalie for the Philadelphia Flyers. But the franchise no longer exists and, in fact, Mr. Cappelli said the perception that hockey's popularity is waning was a factor in scrapping the arena notion.
 ''Hockey teams weren't big money makers, but they were strong tenants for this kind of arena,'' he said. ''But now that the National Hockey League lockout has been going so long, we didn't believe hockey will ever get its fan base back. If we didn't have a professional minor league team, a big arena wouldn't work financially.''
 For his part, Mr. Yobb, the jewelry merchant at the mart, believes that once Mr. Norcross dropped out of the hockey franchise, it was clear the arena would not be built. But Louis Bezich, whose Haddonfield-based company, Public Solutions Inc., is an economic development consultant to Pennsauken Township on the project, bristled at that idea.
 ''The hockey situation was just one aspect to rethink the project,'' Mr. Bezich said. ''It's to the county's credit that it is flexible and understanding as circumstances change The CRDA allows us to do our due diligence. The grant says we are to get $40 million in new rateables. That is our goal, and we want to review things so that will happen.''
 Yet redeveloping the site of the Pennsauken Mart is only one of the moving parts these days in Pennsauken. 
 Cherokee Investment Partners, a company based in North Carolina, intends to redevelop an abandoned, sprawling industrial site on the Delaware River waterfront in Pennsauken and nearby Camden. 
 Mr. Bezich insisted that what happened to the mart had little to do with the Cherokee project.
 ''Pennsauken is committed to having a civic center and redeveloping the Crossroads site,'' he said. 
 Moreover, as Mr. Bezich put it: ''Everyone is talking about Smart Growth principles, using this type of area instead of chewing up farmland. Now that we're doing it, it seems foolish to complain.''
 But Richard Harris, a professor of political science at Rutgers-Camden who is the director of the Senator Walter Rand Institute for Public Affairs, said that it was not reasonable to disassociate the Crossroads and Cherokee projects, in addition to the huge redevelopment planned for the nearby Garden State Race Track in Cherry Hill. 
 ''How do you connect the development dots?'' Dr. Harris said. ''Increasingly, successful redevelopment planning is regional in scope. The Cherokee plans have got to have changed the landscape here.''

HEADLINE: ONE-WAY BONUSES?

BYLINE: By Mark A. Stein

 BODY:
The Ceridian Corporation has paid its chief executive, Ronald L. Turner; its chief financial officer, John R. Eickhoff; and other top managers $3.3 million in bonuses since 2001. The reason? They hit earnings and revenue growth targets. 
 Just last week, though, the company, which is based in Minneapolis and manages things like employee-benefit programs for other companies, restated its revenue and earnings figures for all of those years. Generally, revenue and earnings were lower than originally stated.
 Might that mean Mr. Turner, Mr. Eickhoff and their colleagues did not actually earn their bonuses? Or that the company may ask them to, um, return some or all of the extra pay?
 Craig G. Manson, Ceridian's vice president for investor relations, said that decision was up to the board's audit committee. He said he didn't know if the committee would consider the idea, but he did say that neither Mr. Turner nor Mr. Eickhoff got a raise or bonus this year. Mark A. Stein

HEADLINE: Bush Is Said to Seek Sharp Cuts In Subsidy Payments to Farmers

BYLINE: By ROBERT PEAR

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Feb. 5 

 BODY:
President Bush will seek deep cuts in farm and commodity programs in his new budget and in a major policy shift will propose overall limits on subsidy payments to farmers, administration officials said Saturday. 
 Such limits would help reduce the federal budget deficit and would inject market forces into the farm economy, the officials said. 
 The proposal puts Mr. Bush at odds with some of his most ardent supporters in the rural South, including cotton and rice growers in Alabama, Arkansas, Georgia, Louisiana and Mississippi.
 The new chairman of the Senate Appropriations Committee, Thad Cochran of Mississippi, and more than 100 farm groups are gearing up to fight the White House proposal. The administration's willingness to push the proposal, despite such protests, suggests how tight the new budget will be. 
 Most of the subsidies are paid to large farm operators growing cotton and rice and, to a lesser degree, corn, soybeans and wheat. 
 Mr. Bush would set a firm overall limit of $250,000 on subsidies that can now exceed $1 million in some cases. 
 The proposal comes as the administration is seeking significant changes in other programs long considered sacrosanct, including a proposed revamping of Social Security to allow personal investment accounts and a move to shake up the Civil Service system.
 Mr. Bush's farm proposal found support from some people who frequently criticize his policies.
 Kenneth Cook, president of the Environmental Working Group, a research and advocacy group, said the proposal would reduce payments to big agribusiness operations. The savings, he said, would ease pressure on Congress to cut conservation programs financed in the same legislation.
 ''This proposal is a very big deal,'' Mr. Cook said. ''I am stunned and impressed. The Bush administration is opening the door to reform on the most contested issue in agriculture policy today. Taxpayers will no longer have to subsidize every bushel of grain or bale of cotton. They will no longer have to subsidize the demise of the family farm.''
 In the past, when Congress considered limits on payments, Mr. Cook said, the administration took no position. The Senate approved a $275,000 limit in 2002 but dropped it in negotiations with the House.
 Agriculture Department officials said Mr. Bush's proposals would cut federal payments to farmers by $587 million, or about 5 percent, next year and would save $5.7 billion in the coming decade. The officials spoke on condition of anonymity because they did not want to upstage the release of the president's budget, scheduled for Monday.
 The budget includes other proposals intended to produce large savings in farm programs, the officials said, but they refused to give details.
 In theory, the maximum payment to a farmer, through multiple entities, is now $360,000 a year. But Keith J. Collins, chief economist at the Agriculture Department, said that growers had found many legal ways to get around the limit and that some growers received several times that amount. One type of aid, which involves marketing assistance loans, is not subject to any limit, he said.
 In setting a firm overall limit of $250,000, the president's plan would tighten requirements for the recipients of such payments to be ''actively engaged'' in agriculture, and it would generally prevent farmers from claiming additional payments through multiple entities.
 Farm subsidies have been a major issue in global trade talks, as poor farmers in the developing world demand that the United States and other wealthy countries cut back subsidies for their domestic producers. 
 Efforts to cap farm payments have produced odd alliances. Fiscal conservatives like the Heritage Foundation have joined some environmental groups and family farmers in the Midwest in supporting stricter limits. Opponents include the American Farm Bureau Federation, the nation's largest farm organization, as well as many commodity groups and politicians of both parties from rice and cotton states.
 Mr. Cochran, the former chairman of the Senate Agriculture Committee, said he would ''work as hard as I can to oppose any changes'' in current payment limits, set by Congress three years ago. 
 Speaking this week to the National Cotton Council, a trade group, Mr. Cochran said he knew that some people wanted to reduce farm program payments.
 ''We always know there is a threat to lower levels of payments to producers from some in the Congress,'' he said. But, he added, the payments are economically important to rural communities, and ''the risk caused by changing payment limits far outweighs the benefits.''
 In a letter to Mike Johanns, the new secretary of agriculture, a coalition of more than 100 farm groups said they too would resist such cuts. 
 ''With prices for many major commodities falling sharply from last year, reductions to farm programs would come at precisely the time that these supports are most needed in rural America,'' the coalition said. 
 The White House proposal is a vindication of sorts for Senator Charles E. Grassley, Republican of Iowa, who has advocated ''reasonable payment limits'' for three decades.
 ''When 10 percent of the nation's farmers receive 60 percent of the payments, it erodes public confidence in federal farm programs,'' said Mr. Grassley, who describes himself as the only family farmer in the Senate. ''Unlimited farm payments have placed upward pressure on land prices and contributed to overproduction and lower commodity prices, driving many family farmers off the farm.''
 Mr. Collins, the Agriculture Department economist, said, ''When the government subsidizes every bushel and every acre, it encourages large farm operations to grow larger.''
 The issue did not figure prominently in last year's presidential campaign. Senator John Kerry, Democrat of Massachusetts, voted with supporters of stricter payment limits when the question was before the Senate in 2002. President Bush signed the 2002 farm bill, which significantly increased payments to farmers, reversing six years of Republican efforts to limit subsidies.
 Subsidy payments take several forms and are computed according to complex formulas . In some cases, the government makes direct payments to farmers. In others, it lends money to farmers and assures them, in effect, that they can receive more than the market price for their crops, if that price declines.
 In a report last year, the Government Accountability Office, an investigative arm of Congress, said farmers used many ''schemes or devices'' to circumvent existing payment limits. Under federal law, payments are supposed to go only to people who are ''actively engaged in farming,'' but, the report said, many people not involved in farm operations have received large subsidies.
 Moreover, it said, individuals who on their own could receive no more than $180,000 for a farming operation sometimes set up a partnership of three partners, each receiving $180,000 in subsidies, thus tripling the total amount of payments to the farming operation.
 An exhaustive study by the Agriculture Department found that ''government payments increase with farm size and sales,'' so ''payments tend to be concentrated among the larger farms.'' In 2001, it said, ''59 percent of government payments went to producers on farms with a net worth of $600,000 or more.''
 Senator Blanche Lincoln, Democrat of Arkansas, said payment limits would be particularly unfair to rice and cotton farmers because production costs were higher for those crops than for others. Mrs. Lincoln, the daughter of a rice farmer, said some farmers would have difficulty surviving under stringent payment limits.
 But Brian M. Riedl, an economist at the Heritage Foundation, said stricter payment limits were needed because farm subsidies had become ''America's largest corporate welfare program.''

HEADLINE: Group of 7 Agrees to Ease Debt Burden Of the Poor

BYLINE: By ALAN COWELL

DATELINE: LONDON, Feb. 5 

 BODY:
The world's richest countries agreed formally for the first time on Saturday to pursue a 100 percent write-off in the $70 billion debt owed by the poorest nations to big institutions like the World Bank.
 But, at a meeting of finance ministers from the so-called Group of 7 major industrialized countries, they failed to resolve differences largely between Britain and the United States over plans to raise an extra $50 billion a year in aid to lift African nations in particular out of poverty.
 This year Britain is the leader of the richest countries -- the United States, Britain, Canada, France, Germany, Italy and Japan -- whose presidents and prime ministers meet along with Russian leaders in Scotland next July. The British hosts want the meeting to endorse a plan to relieve African poverty with the same broad sweep and effectiveness as the Marshall Plan after World War II. 
 They are trying to push the issues of African debt and poverty to the top of the agenda. But unanimity is proving elusive, despite an appeal Friday for action by Nelson Mandela, the former South African president. ''Do not delay while poor people continue to suffer,'' said Mr. Mandela, who had compared the fight against poverty to the battles against slavery and apartheid.
 In a communique after their two-day meeting, the Group of 7 noted that individual member countries had ''significantly reduced'' the bilateral debt owed by 27 of the world's poorest and most indebted nations to individual creditor nations.
 ''However, we recognize that more still needs to be done,'' the statement said, promising ''our willingness to provide as much as 100 percent multilateral debt relief.''
 At a news conference, the British chancellor of the exchequer, Gordon Brown, said: ''This is the first time as much as 100 percent debt relief has ever been detailed in a G-7 communique. It is the rich countries hearing the voices of the poor.'' 
 John B. Taylor, the United States Treasury under secretary, said the Bush administration had been supporting the 100 percent debt write-off ''for quite a while.'' 
 But, at a separate news conference, Mr. Taylor repeated that the United States would not support either of two sets of proposals put forward by Britain and France to raise money for the relief of African poverty. He also indicated that American proposals for a single, total and immediate cancellation of poor countries' multilateral debt had not won unanimous approval here.
 Britain is promoting a so-called International Finance Facility, which would raise funds for poverty relief on international money markets. Chancellor Brown is also pressing the International Monetary Fund to revalue its gold reserves to create funds for the alleviation of poverty. France has proposed a series of international taxes.
 The Bush administration ''is not convinced that gold sales are a necessary way,'' Mr. Taylor said. 
 Rather, Mr. Taylor said, the United States is promoting its own plan to ease poverty through a separate system that has allocated -- but not yet disbursed -- some $2.5 billion for assistance to 17 countries. He also said American law would not permit the Bush administration to take part in Britain's proposed International Finance Facility.
 In their communique, the Group of 7 ministers said they would work toward resolving differences at meetings before the July meeting. But it seemed that, while the United States was prepared to accept different ways of financing poverty relief, it wanted agreement on the way debt should be forgiven. 
 The Group of 7 also invited leading Chinese officials to discuss the way China's currency is pegged to the weak dollar, bolstering China's exports.

HEADLINE: Rice Chides Russia on Quieting Dissent but Rejects Penalty

BYLINE: By STEVEN R. WEISMAN

DATELINE: ANKARA, Turkey, Feb. 5 

 BODY:
Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice told a top Russian envoy Saturday that Moscow's crackdown on dissent was making Russian-American relations ''more difficult,'' a State Department official said. But Ms. Rice also signaled in public that the United States would not try to isolate Russia because of its actions.
 The State Department official, speaking after a dinner between Ms. Rice and Foreign Minister Sergey V. Lavrov, said the secretary cited Russia's steps to take over independent television, seize the oil company Yukos and arrest its leaders, and remove powers from state governors. 
 He said Ms. Rice made the expression of American concerns more central to the discussion than previous American officials had with the Russians in the past.
 ''These things do make it more difficult to pursue a full and deep relationship,'' Ms. Rice told Mr. Lavrov, according to the official, who spoke at a briefing under State Department ground rules that required anonymity because of the confidential nature of the session being described.
 Earlier Saturday, Ms. Rice acknowledged to reporters on her plane here that Russia had recently fallen backward on democracy and democratic reforms but that the government of President Vladimir V. Putin would not be punished or isolated by an American cutoff of cooperation in a variety of other areas.
 Those comments were themselves the most recent indication that President Bush's inaugural vow to spread freedom in the world did not signify a major change in American approach with certain countries.
 Ms. Rice said Mr. Bush's Inaugural Address would lead to American officials' raising the issue, but only in the context of other cooperative ventures, many of which she said would involve integrating Russia with democratic trends in the West.
 ''To the degree that the emphasis continues to grow in American policy and rhetoric about democracy and the importance of it, of course it becomes a central part of every discussion we have around the world,'' Ms. Rice said on her plane from Warsaw.
 But she also emphasized that cooperation with Russia had led to progress in combating terrorism, stabilizing Afghanistan and Iraq, and to Russian willingness -- despite deep misgivings -- to accept new democratic but somewhat anti-Russian governments in Ukraine this year and in Georgia after a popular uprising in the fall of 2003.
 ''On the matter of domestic trends in Russia, yes, I think those have been less favorable in recent times,'' Ms. Rice said. ''We've made no secret of that, but we're not going to stop working at it. We haven't stopped talking about it, and I think it continues to be an important part of our dialogue.''
 She said Mr. Bush's Inaugural Address should not be seen as suggesting a ''clean break'' with the past but rather building on policies already under way.
 The dinner with Mr. Lavrov, who flew to the capital of Turkey just to meet with the new secretary of state on her first overseas trip, was intended to pave the way for a meeting between Mr. Bush and Mr. Putin in Bratislava this month.
 On her second full day of her weeklong trip to Europe and the Middle East, Ms. Rice churned through meetings in three countries -- first with civic and opinion leaders in Germany, then with Polish leaders in Warsaw, and finally Saturday night with a brief meeting with Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan of Turkey and the dinner with Mr. Lavrov.
 On Sunday she is to meet with more Turkish leaders to discuss their acute concerns about the security situation in neighboring Iraq, and then she plans to fly to Israel for meetings with Israeli and Palestinian leaders.
 Ms. Rice said she would listen to Turkish concerns and assure leaders here that the United States supported the territorial unity of Iraq, and opposed any effort by Kurds in the north to break away. Turks fear that if the Kurds separate or gain autonomy, it will encourage the uprising of Kurds in the east of the country.
 In Poland, a country where Mr. Bush remains highly popular despite mounting anxiety over the presence of 2,400 Polish troops in Iraq, Ms. Rice sought to smooth relations by working on a new package of American military aid and on help in expediting the granting of visas for Poles wishing to visit the United States.
 The Polish foreign minister, Adam Rotfeld, said Poland would proceed with plans to pull 800 of its troops out of Iraq, and Ms. Rice expressed gratitude to Poland for its help in Iraq despite this step. 
 Ms. Rice also conferred with Prime Minister Marek Belka, who served for several months in 2003 and last year as the chief financial adviser to the American-led occupation in Baghdad. 
 American officials say that Russia, seen by many in Poland as a historic antagonist, has been a primary focus of all Polish-American discussions in recent years, especially as Polish leaders watched with anxiety the Russian intervention in the Ukrainian election last year.
 But Ms. Rice noted that after the difficulty in Ukraine, Russia moved quickly to establish close relations with the government of Viktor A. Yushchenko as soon as it became clear that he would serve as Ukraine's president.
 Russia, she said, would be ''aided by the growth of democratic movements and by party building and the growth of civil society in Russia,'' trends that the United States can encourage by working with Russia and also working to help it join the World Trade Organization so it can integrate itself with the global economy.

HEADLINE: Edwards's Speech Is on Poverty, But Focus Is on Where He Spoke

BYLINE: AP

DATELINE: MANCHESTER, N.H., Feb. 5 

 BODY:
In what appeared to be an early start for the 2008 campaign cycle, John Edwards told New Hampshire Democrats on Saturday that poverty was ''one of the great moral issues of our time,'' and he pledged to help fight it.
 ''It may seem like an impossible goal to end poverty, but that's what the skeptics said about all of our other great challenges,'' said Mr. 
Edwards, the former vice-presidential candidate. ''If we can put a man on the moon, conquer polio and put libraries of information on a chip, then we can end poverty for those who want to work for a better life.''
 The setting of the speech was as notable as its content. A visit to New Hampshire, the site of the first presidential primary, is often the first public sign that someone is considering a White House bid.
 Mr. Edwards, who left the Senate last month, said in an interview that he had not decided whether to seek the presidency. His focus is helping his wife, Elizabeth, recover from breast cancer, he said.
 The University of North Carolina announced on Friday that Mr. Edwards would direct a new center on poverty, which will be affiliated with its law school. ''We don't pretend to have all the answers, but I can promise you this: We will ask the hard questions,'' Mr. Edwards said Saturday night in an address that drew repeated applause from Democratic activists.
 Mr. Edwards took issue with critics of his party. ''Don't tell me Democrats don't stand for anything,'' he said. ''We do. We stand for work and opportunity. We know when something's right. And we know when something's wrong.''
 ''It's wrong when our neighbors work full time and they still live in poverty,'' he said.

 BODY:
The more we learn, the worse it gets.
 Last Wednesday, as President Bush prepped for his State of the Union address, a White House official gave reporters a background briefing on some of the details of Mr. Bush's Social Security privatization plan. Almost point for point, whatever the president said that sounded good sounded bad when the details were filled in. 
 For instance, Mr. Bush said, ''Personal accounts are a better deal,'' because ''your money will grow, over time, at a greater rate than anything the current system can deliver.'' But the privatized system actually contains hidden costs that could leave retirees with less. Your Social Security benefit would be reduced, dollar for dollar, by the amount of money you deposit into your private account and an additional charge amounting to 3 percent plus the rate of inflation. All the money that is drained off would presumably go to pay for the enormous upfront government borrowing -- $4.5 trillion over the next 20 years -- that privatization would require.
 That means people whose private accounts steadily earned three percentage points over inflation throughout their working lives would wind up with exactly what they would have gotten if Social Security remained untouched. Anyone who earned less than that would end up with less than is offered by the current system. When asked what would happen to the people who would not have enough income to avoid poverty, the administration official said, ''I'm not sure if I'm understanding your question.'' 
 The benefit cut is only the beginning. There is still the problem of strengthening Social Security's finances. On its own, establishing private accounts does nothing to solve the long-term shortfall in the system. The president alluded to this fact when he said, ''We must pass reforms that solve the financial problems of Social Security.'' He dutifully listed various benefit cuts that would do the trick, without taking the politically risky step of endorsing any of them.
 Neither the president nor his aides have been willing to acknowledge the extent of benefit cuts that would be needed. And no wonder: All in all, they would leave the average worker with a government benefit worth only about 10 percent of his or her preretirement earnings. (Currently, Social Security replaces about 35 percent, on average.)
 Various proposals to strengthen the current system's solvency via modest tax increases and benefit cuts -- without resorting to costly private accounts -- could guarantee a government benefit that replaces about 30 percent of preretirement income on average. But for all his talk about ''an open, candid review of the options,'' the president refuses to consider any plan that excludes private accounts or includes tax increases, no matter how small. His stance makes severe benefit cuts unavoidable. 
 Even the feel-good tidbits in the president's speech really fail to stand up to close examination. Mr. Bush assured listeners that the government would prevent people from making bad decisions by restricting their investments to a conservative mix of stocks and bonds. But the more restrictions there are, the harder it would be for people to achieve the outsized returns that the administration has generally promoted to sell the public on private accounts. 
 And the much-touted promise that the private accounts could be passed on to one's heirs, as it turns out, is also less than it seems. That works entirely only if you die before you retire. Under a scheme that is going to take a while for the public to digest, the White House wants to require new retirees to use their private accounts to buy annuities large enough to keep them above the poverty line for the rest of their lives. The most they could leave to heirs, then, would be what is left over after the annuities are purchased. 
 Mr. Bush is expending tremendous energy to sell his plan -- daily impairing his own credibility and shredding whatever confidence remains in the country's fiscal outlook. Members of Congress would do him -- and their constituents -- a favor by reining him in and moving on to more pressing matters.

GOD'S POLITICS
Why the Right Gets It Wrong
and the Left Doesn't Get It.
By Jim Wallis.
384 pp. HarperSanFrancisco. $24.95.
 FROM abolition to woman suffrage to civil rights, the leaders of America's most successful liberal crusades have turned to the Bible to justify their causes. But the history of the religious left seems to stop in 1968, the endpoint of Martin Luther King's movement as well as the starting point of a decades-long trend by which Democrats have become the secular party and Republicans the religious party. After three bruising national elections that can at least partly be explained by the party's failure to connect with religious voters, Democrats are suddenly rediscovering their past.
 Their prophet is Jim Wallis, an evangelical Christian who has become almost synonymous with the religious left, a sort of Pat Robertson for liberals. Through Sojourners, the political magazine he edits, six previous books and countless columns and speaking appearances, he has become the leading voice urging Democrats to embrace a politics rooted in the Bible.
 In ''God's Politics: Why the Right Gets It Wrong and the Left Doesn't Get It,'' Wallis has a simple message for Democrats: rather than challenging the right's piety, challenge the right's theology. ''Conventional wisdom suggests that the antidote to religious fundamentalism is more secularism,'' he says. ''But that is a very big mistake. The best response to bad religion is better religion, not secularism.''
 Many liberals admonish President Bush for his use of religious language. Wallis is one of the few on the left to question the accuracy of Bush's biblical allusions, which he maintains ''are too often either taken out of context or, worse yet, employed in ways quite different from their original meaning.'' And instead of attacking conservatives for bringing religion into the public square, Wallis attacks conservatives for reducing the Christian policy agenda to abortion and gay marriage. After all, the Bible has far more to say about poverty, economics and war than it does about the right's two favorite wedge issues.
 Wallis's politics are hardly ideal for all Democrats. The party has a religion problem and a national security problem. Wallis's instincts on terrorism -- despite his useful rejoinder to the moral relativism of those on the left who refuse to believe Al Qaeda is a greater threat to the world than American foreign policy -- are dovish, when the Democrats' trouble is that they aren't seen as hawkish enough. On social policy, he advises the party to de-emphasize abortion rights and gay marriage, show more tolerance toward those opposed to abortion and reach out to religious voters who are not on the right but are concerned about the general coarseness of American culture. On economics, he makes a biblically based argument for a more populist and anticorporate agenda. At a minimum, any Democrat running for election in a red state should read this book.
 And to liberals wary of any prescription that includes more religion in politics, and to those worried that his evangelical Christianity is not ecumenical, Wallis makes an important point rarely heard on the religious right. ''We bring faith into the public square when our moral convictions demand it,'' he writes. ''But to influence a democratic society, you must win the public debate about why the policies you advocate are better for the common good. That's the democratic discipline religion has to be under when it brings its faith to the public square.'' It is a reminder that Martin Luther King may have had a Bible in one hand, but he had the Constitution in the other.

WINNING THE FUTURE
A 21st Century Contract With America.
By Newt Gingrich.
243 pp. Regnery Publishing. $27.95.
 SOME folks mellow with age, others don't. Newt Gingrich falls in the latter category. And in case you weren't clear on that, he's written a new political manifesto to drive the point home. In ''Winning the Future: A 21st Century Contract With America,'' you'll find the Gingrich of a decade ago, with a scope as broad as his aggression runs deep, and rhetoric with the force of a sock in the face. He opens with a test, to find out where you stand ''on the great and growing gap between traditional American values and the secular liberalism of the Left'' (the capital L is his, throughout). If you pass, you may read on, and learn to ''protect and defend America's traditions and values.'' If you don't . . . well, he doesn't quite say what happens if you don't. Presumably you retreat to some redoubt deep in blue America and await your destruction. And so it goes, pretty much like that, for the next 200-odd pages. 
 Gingrich, who now splits his time between the American Enterprise Institute and his own private consulting company, stood at the pinnacle of political power for only four years. But what a four years! As speaker of the House of Representatives from 1994 to 1998, he was reckless and mercurial, wrapped in an arrogance that proved his undoing. But he was also possessed of political instincts and organizational ability that simply cannot be gainsaid, and may even have approached a sort of rascal's genius. The 1994 Republican takeover of Congress grew from a confluence of events ranging from the Republicanization of the South and redistricting to the whipsaw politics of Bill Clinton's first two years in office. But Gingrich shaped it and gave it a rhetoric, which he shipped off to Congressional aspirants on mass-produced cassette tapes like a motivational speaker. Democrats said he wanted to destroy the institution, not run it, evidently forgetting that creative destruction is a part of politics as well as economics. 
 Yet governing -- with its own distinct skill set -- Gingrich found far more difficult. His Contract With America -- the platform his House Republicans ran on in 1994 -- was less a program than a carefully poll-tested string of initiatives, raised like a sail to catch the gusts of conservative fury and political malaise of the early 90's. The eight reforms the signers pledged to pass immediately were procedural changes only. The 10 bills they promised to bring to a vote in their first 100 days carefully skirted the country's most contentious fiscal and social issues in favor of targeted stances like a balanced budget amendment and a ban on American troops serving under United Nations command.
 In his second act, Gingrich presents himself not as a politician and bomb thrower but as a thinker, an observer with unique insights gained from experience. ''I write these words as someone who spent 20 years in the United States House of Representatives and who has made a lifelong study -- including a Ph.D. -- of history,'' he declares. ''Since I left government in January 1999, I have made an in-depth study of national security, health, science and technology, and the American economy. I have had the unusual experience of being an academic, a leader at the center of government power, and now a student of Washington using both these tools: the academic and the practical.''
 Yet, again, as in the transition from tactician to legislator, he seems unable or unwilling to make the leap (just as he cannot resist ''not ruling . . . out'' a 2008 presidential run). As he ranges from Social Security to the war on terror to the nation's infestation with lawyers, misstatements and straw men burst from his keyboard like water from a fire hose -- just as they did, only with more effect, when he was bringing the Democrats' half-century Congressional ascendancy to its knees. In Gingrich's world there is none of the stark partisanship that continues to divide America roughly in half, but rather an overwhelming majority of common-sense Americans battling against and losing to a tiny minority of extreme liberal secularists who lord it over everyone else, notwithstanding their exclusion from power in Washington. ''Since the 1960's,'' he complains in a characteristic passage, ''the conservative majority has been intimidated, manipulated and bullied by the liberal minority.''
 The man simply cannot wean himself from bully-boy campaign speeches and 30-second television spots. And in that he does himself and his ideas a disservice. Gingrich's discussion of immigration and citizenship, for instance, is framed around the observation that ''the Left'' -- by which he seems to mean roughly everyone to the left of Arlen Specter -- ''regards national identity as irrelevant.'' He clarifies the debate over the Bush doctrine of pre-emption by noting that ''if Hitler was not evil enough to justify war'' in the minds of the international left, ''we should not be surprised that coexistence with Saddam Hussein and Kim Jong Il strikes them as reasonable.'' The Rehnquist court, which some find at least moderately conservative, he calls nothing ''but a proto-dictatorship of the elite pretending to still function as a Supreme Court.'' And then there is the ''new and growing pattern among the Left-liberal establishment to view foreign opinion and international organizations as more reliable and legitimate than American institutions.'' Each statement contains a grain of truth. But the claims and arguments are too oversize and parodic to drill down to any challenging point. The effect is of watching a grown man try to build semiconductors with a Tinker Toy set: fun for a while, but hopelessly futile, and fairly obviously so from the start.
 Gingrich breaks from the mold in his discussions of science, the environment and, to a lesser degree, education -- issues that seem always to have held a genuine fascination for him. Here the invocations of ''the secular Left,''+ ''the Left-liberal elite media'' and ''the Left-liberal establishment'' fade away and the tone changes. One might simply call it open-minded reasoning rather than political attack. And Gingrich ends up saying very un-Gingrich-like things -- like denouncing the folly of 9/11-inspired visa rules that prevent the brightest young students from coming to the United States to study and arguing for more generous research budgets and against the ''profoundly self-destructive'' policies that have recently led to a sharp reduction in the number of American scientists traveling abroad to attend international conferences and symposiums.
 Regrettably, such moments are few and far between. ''Winning the Future'' is difficult to distinguish from so many other political books, on the right and the left, that do nothing more than rant to the choir.

HEADLINE: Democracy Has to Start Somewhere

BYLINE: By MICHAEL WINES

 BODY:
IT'S now a week since Iraqis flooded the streets for their first free election in decades, and America, midwife to the birth of Arab democracy, is still in relieved thrall. Sunni clerics urged boycotts; the French dripped ridicule; terrorists promised to wash the streets with the blood of anyone foolish enough to cast a ballot. And 6 in 10 eligible Iraqis -- roughly equal to the turnout in President Bush's own victory last November -- voted anyway. 
 Honestly, has there ever been an election so inspiring? 
 Unfortunately, yes. Ponder the first sentences of one dispatch from this newspaper's archives: ''United States officials were surprised and heartened today at the size of turnout in South Vietnam's presidential election,'' it reads, ''despite a Vietcong terrorist campaign to disrupt the voting. According to reports from Saigon, 83 per cent of the 5.85 million registered voters cast their ballots yesterday. Many of them risked reprisals threatened by the Vietcong.'' 
 That appeared in September 1967. Last week, Mr. Bush proclaimed that Iraq tests ''our generational commitment to the advance of freedom.'' In 1967, Lyndon B. Johnson's State of the Union proclaimed a test of American will to ''keep alive the hope of independence and stability for people other than ourselves.'' 
 But wait: there are other parallels. If Baghdad voters can look disturbingly like voters in Saigon, the building of an Iraqi democracy has its own, sometimes more promising soulmates. Take South Africa, where an oppressed majority reconciled with its minority oppressors, or El Salvador, where representative government weathered a major-party boycott not totally unlike last week's Sunni boycott of the Iraqi vote. 
 In these and other cases, the democratic road began with a bracing show of popular support -- massive turnouts for elections, or throngs of peaceful protesters in a Belgrade square. But as Vietnam and, more lately, the former Soviet Union prove, oppressed people will always show up en masse to choose their own fate, even if that fate turns out to be more oppression. Last week's good news from Baghdad was not so much that voters turned out -- history forecast that -- as that they did not defy history by sitting on their hands. 
 Having cleared that hurdle, the good news for pro-democracy Iraqis is that history is no longer stacked against them, even if Syria, Iran and Abu Musab al-Zarqawi are. 
 ''The last three decades have seen an astonishing expansion of democracy into areas that many people thought democracy was simply impossible,'' Robert Pastor, a Carter Administration policy adviser who now directs the Center for Democracy and Election Management at American University in Washington. Ignoring the 1970's axiom that democracy was a system for middle-class Protestant nations, democratic rule has spread in the last 25 years in Catholic Latin America, Buddhist east Asia and, lately, Islamic Indonesia and Malaysia. 
 Iraq, he said, has a shot at joining the club, but it won't be easy. ''Every transitional country has its fissures, whether ideological, class-based or ethinic,'' he said. ''the hope of democracy is that it provides a peaceful way for these differences to be reconciled. But getting to that point is the biggest challenge.'' 
 The threats to a functioning Iraqi democracy are legion: insurgency; a once-dominant Sunni minority that resisted the election; a now-powerful Shiite majority that remembers oppression; neighbors like Syria and Iran with reasons to sabotage democracy, and more. The most that can be said about Iraq, say people who study democracy for a living, is that other nations' experiences offer proven tricks that can minimize these threats to democracy's survival. 
 ''There's a pretty strong desire to make a new country,'' Francis Fukuyama, a scholar at Johns Hopkins University's School of Advanced International Studies in Washington. D.C., said in a telephone interview. ''But you cannot have democracy if you have 5, 10, 15 percent of the population so alienated that they're willing to risk everything in a violent insurgency. A democracy has to have something close to a 100 percent consensus that these are the rules of the game.'' 
 How to create that consensus? In Mozambique, Angola and Nicaragua, exhausted left-wing governments and right-wing rebels agreed that neither could win a military victory, enabling a peaceful competition at the ballot box that has endured, with warts, to this day. In Chile and El Salvador, rivals eventually agreed to split their differences, giving the weaker party legal protections and a guaranteed spot in national political in exchange for an end to fighting.
 In South Africa, which in some ways offers the best analogy to Iraq's agony, besieged white oppressors and the black majority they ruled cut a deal: whites would cede control, but retain their rights as citizens. Blacks would assume control, but give whites a voice in government and society. 
 Something was central to all these deals: a mutual realization that failure to make peace would bring strife far more damaging than the losses either side risked in a peace accord. Even then, some compacts might have collapsed without a leader who could unite factions around a higher goal. 
 Nelson Mandela played that role in South Africa, spurning the chance to take retribution against whites who had imprisoned him for 27 years. Lech Walesa did it in Poland. Ukraine's new leader, Viktor Yushchenko, is making the same appeal across his nation's pro-Russia and pro-West divide. 
 Some wonder whether Iraq's Shiite leader, Ayatollah Ali al-Sistani, might yet play the same role. A cleric with ties to Iran, he has nevertheless played an astute political game in Iraq, tacitly supporting America's presence there and publicly endorsing the idea of a secular and multi-ethnic regime. 
 ''The signs are hopeful,'' Fareed Zakaria, the Newsweek columnist and foreign-affairs expert, said in a telephone interview. ''Within the Shia there seems to be a real realization that this is their moment, and they don't want to blow it.''
 ''You have an amazingly sophisticated and secure leader,'' he said, ''who now has spoken out on the need to incorporate the Sunni'' in Iraq's political life.
 But even if it gains a transforming leader and a consensus on a system of government, scholars say, Iraq still would want for a third element in democratic transitions: the stability and time to move to popular rule. 
 Even painful transitions are better than none, because in times of chaos, citizens cling to whatever brings order to their lives, even if that order limits their own freedoms. One case in point is Russia, which collapsed abruptly, suffered a counterrevolution and two economic crises, and now drifts toward authoritarianism under a leader who promised an end to uncertainty. Another is Chile, where Augusto Pinochet's fall from power was negotiated to ensure that both sides would benefit from a peaceful transition to freedom; there democracy has thrived. 
 It is in the transition now starting, some say, that Iraq's real hope for democracy lies -- and the greatest threat to it. Sunni refusal to bring stability to the national compact could dash democratic hopes. So could a prolonged terrorist insurgency. 
 The American invasion brought revolutionary change to Iraq, destroying the state that preceded it, says Michael McFaul, a Stanford University scholar, ''and in all the big revolutions, there is the Thermidor -- the real social demand for order and stability in the state. In Iraq, that's absolutely going to be there, and whoever can promise prolonged stability is going to get support.'' 
 The key, says Natan Sharansky, the former Soviet dissident who is now an Israeli legislator, is to make sure that democratic forces bring order first. Mr. Sharansky is an optimist even about Russia, which he says threw off a thousand years of serfdom and now has given back only some 15 years under the strong hand of President Vladimir Putin. For once freedom gets a foothold, he says, people will accept nothing less. 
 ''There is no such thing as to be a little bit free,'' he said in a telephone interview from Israel. ''The more people live without fear, the more they will be pushing for freedom. True stability can only be brought about by freedom, and democracy.''

HEADLINE: As Air Clears, Even Smokers Are Converted

BYLINE: By JIM RUTENBERG and LILY KOPPEL

 BODY:
Back in 2002, when the City Council was weighing Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg's proposal to eliminate smoking from all indoor public places, few opponents were more fiercely outspoken than James McBratney, president of the Staten Island Restaurant and Tavern Association.
 He frequently ripped Mr. Bloomberg as a billionaire dictator with a prohibitionist streak that would undo small businesses like his bar and his restaurant. Visions of customers streaming to the legally smoke-filled pubs of New Jersey kept him awake at night.
 Asked last week what he thought of the now two-year-old ban, Mr. McBratney sounded changed. ''I have to admit,'' he said sheepishly, ''I've seen no falloff in business in either establishment.'' He went on to describe what he once considered unimaginable: Customers actually seem to like it, and so does he. 
 By many predictions, the smoking ban, which went into effect on March 30, 2003, was to be the beginning of the end of the city's reputation as the capital of grit. Its famed nightlife would wither, critics warned, bar and restaurant businesses would sink, tourists would go elsewhere, and the mayor who wrought it all would pay a hefty price in the polls. And then there were those who said that city smokers, a rebellious class if ever there was one, simply would not abide.
 But a review of city statistics, as well as interviews last week with dozens of bar patrons, workers and owners, found that the ban has not had the crushing effect on New York's economic, cultural and political landscapes predicted by many of its opponents.
 Employment in restaurants and bars, one indicator of the city's service economy, has risen slightly since the ban went into effect, as has the number of restaurant permits requested and held, according to city records, although those increases could be attributed in part to several factors, including a general improvement in the city's economy. 
 City health inspectors report that 98 percent of bars and restaurants are in compliance with the rules, though some critics question those statistics. Wrath at Mr. Bloomberg, at least pertaining to the smoking ban, seems to be abating.
 There are still those cursing the ban as an affront to their civil liberties, and some bar and restaurant owners say that it has undoubtedly caused a decline in business. City officials say they doubt that contention, pointing to data from the first year of the ban showing that restaurant and bar tax receipts were up 8.7 percent over the previous year's. They said they were still waiting for more detailed and current data from the state. 
 But a vast majority of bar and restaurant patrons interviewed last week, including self-described hard-core smokers, said they were surprised to find themselves pleased with cleaner air, cheaper dry-cleaning bills and a new social order created by the ban.
 All of this comes as great relief to Dr. Thomas R. Frieden, commissioner of the city's Department of Health and Mental Hygiene, who took his job on a promise from the mayor that the smoking ban would be given priority. ''It was not a pleasant time,'' he said of the initial uproar over the ban. ''There was a myth that this was very unpopular.''
 Dr. Frieden credits the apparent success of the new smoking rules here with encouraging other seemingly unlikely places to follow suit, or at least to consider doing so. Among them are Boston, Virginia, Australia, Ireland and Italy. Last week, the City Council in Philadelphia began reviewing a newly proposed bill to make bars and restaurants smoke-free.
 The councilman who introduced the bill in Philadelphia, Michael A. Nutter, cited New York as an inspiration. ''This is kind of the epitome of the song: 'If you can make it there,''' he said in an interview. ''What people are saying is, 'If New York can deal with clean-air legislation, why can't we?'''
 Mr. Nutter said he was not worried about the political ramifications.
 Mr. Bloomberg's Republican critics have indicated they will raise the smoking rules during the Republican primary campaign as an example of what they call his Democratic tendency toward regulation. But many of the mayor's staunchest opponents said they thought the ban would have no effect on his re-election bid. One of his Democratic challengers, Gifford Miller, the City Council speaker, helped secure the ban's passage. And a leading contender for the Democratic mayoral nomination, Fernando Ferrer, has said he would not seek to overturn it.
 ''I thought he would lose 50,000 votes simply based on the smoking ban,'' said Robert Bookman, a lawyer for the New York Nightlife Association, a trade group that aggressively fought the ban. ''I'm not so sure anymore.''
 That is no small thing for Mr. Bloomberg, who once faced hecklers in the streets because of the smoking ban, and whose drop in popularity after it was put in effect was illustrated by The New York Post in a front-page bar graph with cigarette butts.
 Mr. Bookman did not dispute most of the good-news numbers the city presented in relation to the smoking ban, though he disagrees with the conclusion that the ban has not had an adverse impact on restaurants and bars. 
 ''Clearly employment is up in New York City going into 2005 or the end of 2004 compared with the year before the smoking ban went into effect,'' he said. ''The year before was 2002; 2002 was almost a depression in New York City. It was the recession plus the 9/11 economic impact. Everybody's doing better in New York compared with 2002.''
 Mr. Bookman said that the nightlife industries would be doing better still without the ban. But he conceded during an interview that his group had all but given up any lingering hope of overturning the city's provision. It is instead focusing in part on what he said were unfair enforcement issues, like ticketing bar owners for the misbehavior of smoking patrons or for an increase in noise complaints drawn by customers smoking outside. City officials say noise complaints have risen because the city's 311 complaint line has made it easier to file them, not because of outdoor smoking.
 The turncoats of Mr. Bookman's once vocal movement can be found on the sidewalk on any given night. Huddled in a tent at the Bohemian Hall and Beer Garden in the Astoria section of Queens on Wednesday and chain-smoking by two heat lamps, Kate Bly, who teaches English to foreign exchange students, said she was surprised by her own positive reaction to the measure, which she had expected would be terrible. 
 ''I was really against the smoking ban,'' she said. ''I thought, bars are for sinful things, smoking, drinking. Now my reaction has changed. I used to feel clammy, stinky, disgusting. Now there's a nice breakup to the evening and a new crowd.''
 Jason Sitek, 31, said he had similarly begun to enjoy the ban, even if smoke-free bars subtract from what he used to think a New York City bar should be. ''The whole nature of New York City and the bar is you can go into a smoky atmosphere,'' he said. ''It's like Disney World now.'' 
 Still, he said, smoke-free bars have their advantages. ''You realize you stop stinking, you don't smell like an ashtray,'' he said on Tuesday night as he smoked outside Spike Hill, a bar in the Williamsburg section of Brooklyn.
 The temperature was hovering near 30 degrees, but down the street, in front of Rosemary's Greenpoint Tavern, Brian Rennie, 23, said he did not mind that he was forced outdoors to smoke. ''I like going outside,'' he said. ''I like to get fresh air.''
 Several smokers cited other advantages.
 ''I'm all for it. My dry-cleaning bill's gone way down,'' said John Payne, 36, who was smoking on Tuesday night outside Toad Hall, in SoHo. ''And I'm smoking less.''
 A friend, Bill Cauclanis, 29, said, ''There's a secondary scene now outside of bars -- a smoker's scene.''
 He added: ''You can meet a girl out here. Strike up a conversation.''
 What is good for singles like Mr. Cauclanis is bad for bartenders, who cannot so easily go outside and who find themselves increasingly cut out of the social scene in which they centrally stood. Now, they are often placed in the role of hall monitors, chiding those who disobediently light up, said Barry Crooks, who was tending bar at Toad Hall. Mr. Crooks, an owner of Toad Hall, said he was far more worried about a falloff in business of at least 10 percent, which he said was a result of the new smoking ordinance. ''It hurt the volume of business,'' Mr. Crooks said.
 While such complaints were once more common, and perhaps more heated, there are still plenty of them. ''It hurts,'' said John Mulvey, owner of Bridget's Public House on Staten Island.
 Public acceptance of the ban has ''come around a little bit,'' Mr. Mulvey said. Business was off 25 percent right after the ban took effect, he said, but now that decline has stabilized at about 5 percent. And while Mr. Mulvey is no longer furious over the anti-smoking ordinance, he says it bothers him that he is not free to run his business as he sees fit -- without government intervention.
 Mr. Mulvey still has a champion in Audrey Silk, founder of NYC Clash, or Citizens Lobby Against Smoker Harassment. In an interview, Ms. Silk vowed to continue fighting the ban. ''We're not giving up,'' she said.

HEADLINE: Chalk Stripes And Chain Mail

BYLINE: By Guy Trebay

 BODY:
''I wanted to do something with the circus,'' John Tedeschi, a voice coach and party impresario, said at the Keanan Duffty show on Saturday afternoon, by way of explaining his decision to come out on a sunny winter afternoon wearing plaid pants, a Robin Hood hat, a yo-yo and a full-size carnival kewpie doll, which he had hung from the studded biker belt cinching his waist.
 If ever there is a time to indulge one's inner clown, Fashion Week is it. And this is a welcome thing, since occasions for displaying robust frivolity, sartorial outrageousness or even garden-variety self-expression have waned to the point of nonexistence on the island that some people now routinely refer to as Mallhattan. 
 One could write an entire column on good taste as tyranny, particularly at a moment when the American rag trade seems to have recovered its direction and is once again coolly playing up construction, silhouette and overall sobriety. Challenged perhaps by the strengths of European design and Japanese street style, designers here seem to be revisiting the roots of American fashion, which lie in refinements of sportswear, as everyone from F. Scott Fitzgerald to Kimora Lee Simmons has pointed out. 
 But where does that leave all the nut jobs and eccentrics, the people who find inspiration in unlikely eras and pairings, Beowulf and the Kray twins, let's say. It's a relief to find that the industry still has room for them, too. 
 ''I'm not really endorsing them,'' Mr. Duffty said, referring to the Krays, 1960's British gangsters made infamous in the tabloids for their gratuitous bone cracking and natty bespoke clothes. For a show he called ''Hard Day's Knight,'' Mr. Duffty, who once designed for the downtown label Slinky Vagabond, was once a D.J. and was not that long ago given a Rising Star award by the Fashion Group International, screened images of Reggie and Ronnie Kray onto jackets and trousers, had his models wear stiff Warhol wigs and chain-mail accessories and gave his O.K. to makeup applied with an airbrush to blank out their looks. 
 ''When you think of medieval times, you think of a lot of cold weather and not a lot of color, no tinting with pigments or berries or anything like that,'' said Roque Cozzette, whose title, director of makeup at Kett Cosmetics, has a decidedly Zoolander ring. Mr. Cozzette was busily spraying away the individuality of models like Eric Van Tassel and Renaldo Dorrell, as if to amend the genetic karma that had organized their molecules with such perfection.
 ''It feels like wind,'' said Mr. Dorrell as Mr. Cozzette went at it with the pressurized nozzle. 
 ''It's a great technique that was developed for high-definition television, since you can't afford to layer on heavy makeup anymore, '' Mr. Cozzette explained. In the clarity of HDTV, the pancake makeup that used to be an actor's best friend now gives close-ups a scary resemblance to landscape views shot from the Mars rover Spirit. ''You can cover a tattoo or imperfection or hyperpigmentation,'' Mr. Cozzette said. ''You could even make Michael Jackson black again.''
 It has been remarked before in this space, but it is worth repeating: fashion shows may be the most underrated theatrical form of our time. The cost to mount a show at the Bryant Park tents could easily finance some Off Broadway productions for a month. (It's no economic accident that ours is the heyday of the theatrical monologue.) 
 The baseline purpose is to hawk designers' new wares. But it would be simplistic to imagine that the jigsaw complexity of casting, rehearsing, lighting, scoring, costuming, ornamenting and producing a spectacle that lasts perhaps 15 minutes is just about clothes. Evidence of how fashion shows influence culture turns up everywhere from the fine arts (Elizabeth Peyton, Vanessa Beecroft, Francesco Vezzoli) to trash culture (''America's Top Model,'' ''Project Runway,'' MTV) to mutations in the public presentation of sexuality. (Would metrosexuals have happened without male models preening on runways?) 
 In the half decade since companies like IMG, which produces the Bryant Park shows, began licensing the Fashion Week concept, and cable television cottoned to the glossy, cheap content to be found on the runways, a quaint custom that originated in Christian Dior's Paris salon for an elite core of moneyed consumers has been transformed into an inescapable populist phenomenon. It is not just a matter of blanket coverage on E! Entertainment or ''Full Frontal Fashion.'' It is the never-ending loop beamed via satellites to India, China, Vietnam, New Zealand, Mexico and even, as this reporter recently discovered, the remote Himalayan kingdom of Bhutan. 
 Designers now play to the global bleachers. If they are Alexander Herchcovitch, a Brazilian who shows in New York, they mount shows like the one on Saturday, when each model came accompanied by live musicians: a samba band, a banjo picker, an accordion player, an opera singer, a duo that played gypsy fiddle and horns. If they are Kenneth Cole, they produce what amount to public service announcements, amusing and as politically correct as the clothes are inoffensive and derivative. 
 If they are Kimora Lee Simmons of Baby Phat, they invariably stage shows that capitalize on cliches of the sexed-up street girl (accessorized this season with grotesque rectangular purses shaped like pistol cases) and feel like quotations from a hip-hop remake of ''The Day of the Locust,'' complete with security goons wearing boxy suits and earpieces, obligatory celebrity oddities (Jada Pinkett Smith, Mary-Kate Olsen, Denise Rich, Paula Abdul) and the all-important mobs of scene makers clamoring hungrily from the wrong side of a velvet rope. 
 ''She was brilliant, literally,'' Billy Name said last week, referring to Edie Sedgwick, the beauty of privilege and Brahmin background who fled Santa Barbara, Calif., in the 1960's to become a Warhol superstar. Like many of the damaged people drawn into Mr. Warhol's orbit, Ms. Sedgwick's affectless cinematic brilliance originated partly in mental illness and was fueled by huge quantities of drugs. 
 Her incandescence, though, was real and exceptional and helps explain the enduring fascination (see: the collected works of Bob Dylan, her Warhol films and Jean Stein's shrewd 1982 best-seller, ''Edie: American Girl'') with a woman who accomplished almost nothing and yet left behind an image that remains as compelling as ever. 
 An exhibition of Edie photographs taken by Mr. Name, a photographer and former Warhol star, and others opened Wednesday at Gallagher's Gallery & Archive downtown. Amid the hubbub of nearly 90 official Fashion Week presentations, and dozens more scattered across showrooms and galleries around town, the exhibition would be easy to miss. The odds are, though, that designers avid for inspiration will not and that we will be seeing a lot more of Ms. Sedgwick's look by the time the next fashion season rolls around.

HEADLINE: New Jersey Faces Pressure to Increase Gas Tax

BYLINE: By DAVID KOCIENIEWSKI

DATELINE: TRENTON, Feb. 4 

 BODY:
As New Jersey residents and elected officials brace themselves for an ugly budget season of deficits, spending cuts and tax increases, another problem is looming in the background: growing pressure to raise its gasoline tax this year.
 The Transportation Trust Fund, which uses the state's 14.5 cent-per-gallon gas tax to build and maintain New Jersey's overloaded system of roads, bridges and rail lines, is expected to run out of money in June 2006. During the past five years, a succession of governors and legislative leaders from both parties have considered -- and scuttled -- plans to replenish the fund either by increasing the gas tax or by devoting revenues from other parts of the budget.
 But with the fund teetering toward insolvency, state officials must find a solution or risk losing $1 billion in federal transportation aid that is allocated to match state contributions. All those years of deferring the problem mean that by next year, New Jersey drivers could face sticker shock at the gas pump: as much as a 15-cent-per-gallon increase proposed by some transportation experts and commuters groups. 
 Acting Gov. Richard J. Codey has said that he is willing to consider the matter later this year, after he wrangles with the estimated $4 billion budget shortfall this spring and the General Assembly elections in November. Meanwhile, an assortment of business leaders, lawmakers, labor groups and commuters organizations are working on a plan to win public support for the tax, which has been opposed by as many as 70 percent of voters in recent polls.
 Even those pushing for a plan to replenish the Transportation Trust Fund concede that it may be tricky to sell to New Jersey drivers. Many New Jersey residents are notoriously emotional about their cars and do not want to pay any more to drive. The state's current gas tax, one of the lowest in the nation, is also partly responsible for making New Jersey's gasoline prices lower than other states in the region.
 ''I think the only way you can convince people is by assuring them that any tax increase will be used for the purposes it is intended and will make their daily lives better by improving their commutes and their roads,'' said Philip K. Beachem, head of the New Jersey Alliance for Action, which is sponsoring a conference to rally support for the transportation fund on Monday in Trenton.
 The fund was established in 1984 and devised to prevent lawmakers from diverting the gas tax to nontransportation purposes. The idea was to create a pay-as-you-go system and dedicate gas taxes for road, bridge and mass transit projects, using a limited amount of borrowing for major capital expenses. Since 1990, however, the fund has relied so heavily on borrowing that this year it devoted nearly two-thirds of its budget to debt service. By 2006, its entire $805 million budget would be needed to pay off loans.
 Martin Robbins, a Rutgers professor who analyzes transportation systems, said the borrowing paid for a Christmas list of major transportation improvements. A few projects, like the Camden-Trenton light rail line, have been criticized as a questionable use of public money. But Mr. Robbins said that many of the projects have provided upgrades to New Jersey's transportation infrastructure, including the Hudson-Bergen light rail line, subsidies for New Jersey Transit riders, rail stations in Montclair and at Newark Liberty International Airport, the rail transfer station in Secaucus and a variety of road improvements
 But the state now must pay back the bonds used to fund those projects, and the bill will be steep. A blue ribbon commission created by former Gov. James E. McGreevey in 2003 said that the state's infrastructure was deteriorating so rapidly that the state needed to increase the tax by 12.5 cents per gallon to raise the hundreds of millions of dollars needed to finance the necessary maintenance work. Mr. McGreevey then surprised lawmakers by scrapping the idea of an increase completely, saying it would undermine the state's fragile economic recovery.
 Since then, however, the situation has grown more pressing. The Bush administration appears unlikely to provide $125 million a year in additional transportation aid the state had been expecting, and more cuts in federal aid appear to be likely this year. Assemblyman John S. Wisniewski, chairman of the Transportation Committee, said that the state risks hurting its business climate if it allows its overstressed transportation system to further deteriorate.
 ''Every day we see gridlock, roads that aren't repaved, mass transit that doesn't serve drivers as well as it should,'' said Mr. Wisniewski, a Democrat from Middlesex County. ''New Jersey's whole economy is so dependent on having a functional infrastructure that if we don't invest in that economic engine, we're going to hurt our selves and be worse off in the long run.''
 Mr. Wisniewski and Assemblyman Peter J. Biondi, a Republican from Hillsborough, have sponsored a bill that prevent the state from spending more than 50 percent of its transportation fund on debt service. Despite those provisions, the state's ranking Republican, Leonard Lance, the Senate minority leader, expressed skepticism about the plan. But even some groups that advocate on behalf of drivers seem resigned to some tax increase being imposed.
 ''We have to be certain that drivers are treated fairly,'' said Pam Maiolo, president of public affairs of the Mid-Atlantic American Automobile Association. ''But the state clearly needs some sort of long-term solution. It just can't put it off any longer.''

HEADLINE: Fewer Beads and Boas, Perhaps, but Still Mardi Gras

BYLINE: By KATIE ZEZIMA

DATELINE: WOONSOCKET, R.I., Feb. 5 

 BODY:
Blame the three-foot-high snowbanks or the lack of balconies filled with rowdy revelers, but this sleepy city in northern Rhode Island does not exactly conjure up images of Mardi Gras.
 But to Bert Cayer Jr. and other residents of Woonsocket, the festival is as much a part of the history here as the city's shuttered textile mills and 19th-century churches.
 ''I really think Mardi Gras is part of Woonsocket,'' Mr. Cayer, 61, said. 
 Woonsocket is hardly alone in creating its own version of Mardi Gras, a pre-Lent holiday that was started by religious French Catholics and has come to be synonymous with partying and parades.
 But in Woonsocket, a blue-collar city put on the map by French-Canadian immigrants who went to work in the city's booming textile industry during the Industrial Revolution, the annual Mardi Gras is a way to hold on to the French heritage that once defined the community.
 ''I feel it's part of our French tradition and culture, and I don't want to see it die out,'' said Monique Jean, 61, who still speaks French to customers in her beauty salon, Chez Monique. ''It used to be just like Quebec; you walked down the street and everyone spoke French.''
 The city resurrected its Mardi Gras tradition in 1995 as a way to bring arts and culture back to Woonsocket, a hardscrabble city in the Blackstone River Valley. On Saturday, nearly 800 people, most clad in elaborate costumes, shuttled among four indoor sites to eat, drink and dance the night away to the music of Zydeco and French bands.
 But the celebration is about more than tossing on some beads, according to Susan Tessier MacKenzie, the event's organizer. It is a way, she said, for residents to come together and celebrate a culture that has been on the decline for more than 30 years and that many are now starting to resurrect.
 ''It's all about the culture,'' Ms. MacKenzie said. ''It seems like a huge party, but our method was really about bringing back the French-Canadian aspect.''
 French-Canadian immigrants started arriving in Woonsocket in the mid-19th century to work in the new mills. The heaviest migration occurred from about 1880 to 1930, said Sylvia Montzille Bartholomy of the American French Genealogical Society, a group based in Woonsocket that tracks French and French-Canadian genealogy. Most came from the Richelieu Valley in Quebec, Ms. Bartholomy said. The community was cemented with the opening of the city's first French-Canadian parish, Precious Blood Church, in 1872.
 By the early part of the 20th century, more than three-quarters of the population was French-Canadian, Ms. Bartholomy said. The city became known as the most French in the United States, she said.
 The city held its first Mardi Gras celebrations in 1954, and more than 150,000 people flocked here for a week of festivities. Parades sauntered through town despite the frigid weather, and businesses decked out their storefronts and shut for the holiday, Mr. Cayer said. He said his grandfather used to work at a local department store and would enter a float every year.
 ''For me it's something that's in the family, the whole Mardi Gras thing,'' Mr. Cayer said.
 Mardi Gras lasted until 1959, and its end in many ways signaled a diminishing French influence. The mills started to close and to move south, taking many workers with them, and more French families started moving elsewhere as work slowed and the city's economy sputtered. French classes were eliminated from city elementary schools, and the chatter on Main Street was slowly being heard not only in English, but also Spanish and Vietnamese as other immigrant groups started moving in.
 Mardi Gras, Ms. MacKenzie said, has become a way to showcase the past not only for the descendants of the Canadian millworkers but also for the community at large, offering them Creole food as well as French-Canadian specialties like meat pies and pea soup.
 The culture is being celebrated in other ways as well. Ms. Bartholomy helped found a French-language group that meets once a month at the library, and two local radio stations play French-language programming on the weekends. The city's population of 43,000 is now 23.2 percent French-Canadian, according to the 2000 census.
 Roland Lallier, 66, of Pawtucket, R.I., and his wife, Patricia, were having a drink at the Coachmen's Lodge, one of the Mardi Gras sites. He said the celebration was like a ''little piece'' of New Orleans, which is 1,500 miles to the southwest. It is also a way to celebrate his roots.
 ''The Germans have Oktoberfest and the Irish have St. Patrick's Day,'' Mr. Lallier said. ''I'm glad the French are doing something to celebrate French culture here.''

HEADLINE: Fetch your geography books, telecommunications executives. A merger wave may lead to new turf.

BYLINE: By Matt Richtel

 BODY:
NEW YORK, say ''yo'' to SBC. California, raise a glass of pinot noir to Qwest. Texas, tip your Stetson to Verizon. Maine, strap on the lobster bib for BellSouth. 
 The nation's four regional telecommunications companies may be heading to a town near you. Frenzied merger activity in the industry in the last week could propel these giants into a level of direct competition that they not only have not faced, but that they have worked deftly to avoid. 
 SBC, based in San Antonio, announced a $16 billion acquisition of AT&T, a nationwide long-distance company specializing in serving corporate customers. Qwest, based in Denver, was in intense merger talks to buy MCI, which also provides business services nationally. Verizon and possibly BellSouth were said to be mulling bids of their own for MCI.
 Whatever the deal-making outcome, on its face the activity speaks to the perceived importance of the corporate business, a $250 billion annual segment of the telecommunications market. But the long-term implications are broader, some industry analysts say, because they threaten to take the regional telephone companies out of their geographic comfort zones.
 The analysts said that SBC and Qwest could use the AT&T and MCI networks as entrees into new parts of the country and, in turn, force Verizon and BellSouth to fight back. Could the war between the Bells be poised to get a whole lot less civil?
 The SBC/AT&T deal ''shatters the independent operations of the respective Bells,'' said Todd Rosenbluth, an analyst at Standard & Poor's. 
 Reinforcing the point, an executive close to the Qwest-MCI negotiations said that Qwest appeared interested not just in MCI's business customers but also in its residential long-distance customers. 
 Qwest might, for instance, try selling long-distance services in the South. Similarly, SBC could tap AT&T's database to hawk Cingular Wireless service to customers in the Northeast, or eventually to stream Internet-based television programming to those customers. 
 To be sure, some of these companies already compete nationally, particularly in wireless services and, to a much lesser degree, in the business market. But their core, traditional business of serving local telephone customers and selling them Internet access has remained neatly divided and contained. 
 There has been virtually no overlap in the provision of local telephone service from SBC in the West and Southwest, Verizon in the East, Qwest in the Midwest and BellSouth in the South. In their territories they tend to control 90 percent of the local telephone market. 
 Such isolation has been to the great chagrin of consumer groups, who argue that the Bells have created virtual monopolies whose regional dominance is being reinforced through their selling of wireless and Internet access. These groups reason that the regional Bells will take great care before invading each others' territories and inviting retaliation. 
 The fact that these companies compete in the enterprise market ''does not mean the competition will ever spread to the residential market,'' said Mark Cooper, director of research for the Consumer Federation of America. The Bells' ''primary interest is in protecting their franchise product.'' 
 They have gone to great lengths to do just that. They successfully lobbied the Federal Communications Commission to make it more expensive for competitors to lease their lines and use them to offer telephone and Internet service in their regions. 
 More than that, several of the Bells have circumvented efforts by the F.C.C. that would have forced them to compete outside their territories. For instance, when SBC in 1999 acquired another Baby Bell, Ameritech, the F.C.C. mandated that SBC offer local service in 30 markets outside its core territories, as a way to ensure that competition would give choices to consumers. When BellAtlantic and GTE merged to form Verizon Communications, the F.C.C. mandated that the new company spend $500 million to develop service outside its territories.
 In both cases, the companies did the minimum required and then basically abandoned their out-of-territory efforts, essentially thwarting the spirit of the F.C.C.'s effort, said Mark Wigfield, a spokesman for the F.C.C. ''They met the conditions,'' Mr. Wigfield said. ''But the intention wasn't realized.'' 
 Analysts and industry executives say one dynamic that could change the landscape, so to speak, is technology. The advent of Internet telephony, which lets calls be transmitted using Internet technology, makes it theoretically less expensive for these companies to extend their geographic reach without having to build local switching offices. 
 By acquiring MCI, for example, Qwest might be able to build relationships with MCI long-distance customers outside its 14-state territory, then expand further into the territory. Internet telephony ''is really changing the dynamic,'' said an industry executive close to the Qwest/MCI discussions. The executive said that Qwest was very likely to consider using MCI to accelerate its Internet telephony plans for residential customers outside its territory. 
 Another factor changing the landscape is that the regional Bells are facing serious erosion of their traditional landline business as customers switch to wireless phones. The Bells also face new competition from cable companies, which have been getting into the Internet-based phone business, presenting new competition in the local telephone market.
 Roger Entner, an analyst at the Yankee Group, a market research firm, said that the purchase by SBC of AT&T makes the competition much more direct and unavoidable. SBC ''has brought the war to New York City,'' Mr. Entner said. ''It's a much tougher thing to swallow than if it was AT&T, because Verizon thinks of SBC as a peer.''
 Somehow, it seems that Verizon may greet SBC with something slightly less polite than ''yo.''

HEADLINE: Airline Pilot Union Agrees To Study Retirement Age

BYLINE: By MATTHEW L. WALD

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Feb. 6 

 BODY:
The airline industry's financial crisis and the collapse of some pension plans are leading the nation's biggest pilot union and some aviation experts to question a federal rule requiring that airline pilots retire at the age of 60.
 Letting pilots work a few years longer would give those who are suddenly facing much more frugal retirements more time to save money, and could reduce the funds' expenses by cutting the number of pensioners, advocates say. For some airlines, it could also trim operating costs by reducing the need to train new pilots, although not all airlines would see benefits and some might see additional costs, experts say. 
 Some pilots see the idea of another few years of work as intensely appealing, and are arguing that it would be good for the industry, too. Graham W. Jones 3rd, a 59-year-old captain who flies Boeing 747's for United Airlines, said the influx of retiring pilots would strain the finances of the government's Pension Guarantee Benefit Corporation, which is poised to take over United's pension plan. The corporation has already taken over US Airways' pension plan. 
 When his company's plan was healthy, Mr. Jones was expecting a pension of nearly $9,000 a month and a lump-sum payment of $250,000; now he is expecting no lump sum and a monthly benefit of about $2,500, he said. ''Now that the pensions have fallen apart, I'll have to do something else, maybe be a greeter at Wal-Mart,'' he said.
 In fact, the effect of extending pilots' retirement age on the pension funds would depend on how the extra years were treated. If their pension benefits continued to increase by 2 or 3 percent per year worked, the funds would not be helped, according to experts. But at a time when pilots are accepting pay cuts, advocates say that the airlines and the pilots might strike a deal to freeze the benefits and let the pilots earn money for a few more years. 
 And the politics of the retirement rule are changing. The relatively early retirement had long been supported by the Air Line Pilots Association, the largest union, as a compromise among its members that gives younger pilots a shot at the best jobs. In exchange, the retirees got very generous benefits -- at least until the financial crisis hit.
 Now, the benefits are starkly reduced, and many of the younger pilots who always supported early retirement have been laid off and have moved on to other kinds of jobs, changing the balance of opinion within the union.
 Late last year, the pilots' union decided to review its policy and conduct an ''education campaign'' for members; it plans to poll the members this spring. ''It's going at a deliberate pace, because we don't want to give the issue a cursory treatment,'' said a spokesman, John Mazor. 
 Last month, Representative Jim Gibbons, a Nevada Republican who is a former commercial pilot, introduced a bill that would make pilots retire when full Social Security benefits begin, which is age 65 for people who are now 60. 
 Mr. Gibbons had introduced similar bills in the past, but since the airline pension crisis began he has pointed to it as an additional reason to pass the legislation.
 At the United Airlines chapter of the union, Steven C. Derebey, the communications chairman, said: ''It had always been an issue of safety. Now that it's become an issue of money, it gets center stage again.''
 One concern for the airlines was that any change in the rules not be retroactive, said Basil Barimo, vice president for operations and safety at the Air Transport Association, the trade association of the major airlines. If a pilot who retired at 60 a couple of years ago was suddenly allowed to fly again, the disruption and retraining at the airlines would be substantial, he said. Raising the limit by two years and assessing the effect may be a better approach, he added.
 ''Realistically, there's longer life expectancy, and medical care that carries people out there farther,'' Mr. Barimo said. ''There's technology that helps pilots to manage the workload. Ultimately we would expect that the age limit would creep up.''
 His organization has not taken a position on the issue, though, and industry executives say many airlines have not figured out what the effect would be. If, for example, a senior pilot like Mr. Jones retires, someone flying a smaller plane would be trained to replace him, and someone flying an even smaller plane would be trained to replace that pilot. At some airlines, a single retirement could result in eight people being trained to fly new planes, which is a significant expense.
 Airlines that can replace senior pilots with younger ones can save money on salary. But no one seems sure how other costs, like health care, would change. 
 While the position of the union, which is a powerful influence, has been based on a truce among its members, the Federal Aviation Administration says the purpose of the rule is safety. Mr. Mazor, the union spokesman, said the union ''is not going to reverse its policy if it means that safety will be affected,'' adding, ''and that's not an easy question to answer.'' But many pilots say that scientific justification for a strict age limit is weak.
 At the F.A.A., Laura J. Brown, a spokeswoman, said, ''To date, there's been no scientific consensus that would provide a basis for changing the age 60 limit.'' The agency did a study of the safety implications in March 1993, but it was inconclusive, Ms. Brown said. 
 In 1995, the agency brought commuter airlines under the same rules as major airlines, but among those 8,000 pilots there were 200 who were already 60, she said. They were allowed to keep flying until 65, which had been the retirement age for commuter pilots.
 The F.A.A. recently published a proposal to let its air traffic controllers work beyond 56, their mandatory retirement age. They would be subject to extra health screenings. 
 J. Randolph Babbitt, a former president of the pilots' union, said that airline captains, who currently undergo physicals every six months, would probably get additional testing if they were to work beyond 60, and that this might mean new kinds of exams, like cognitive tests. 
 ''The elephant in the room for the pilots is, when are you going to start doing it?'' Mr. Babbitt said. Such testing might find ''guys who should retire at 55,'' he said.
 But, he added, ''Everybody believes age is a very poor, very inaccurate, incomplete measurement.'' 

CORRECTION-DATE: February 15, 2005

 CORRECTION:
An article on Feb. 7 about the mandatory retirement age for airline pilots misstated the age at which people who are now 60 can collect full Social Security benefits. It is 66, not 65. (For workers born after 1937, the retirement age is on a sliding scale, from 65 years 2 months to 67 years.)

HEADLINE: U.S. Takes Steps to Mend Ties With Indonesian Military

BYLINE: By JANE PERLEZ

DATELINE: JAKARTA, Indonesia, Feb. 5 

 BODY:
After a 13-year break, the Bush administration is acting to mend relations with the Indonesian military, the largest in Southeast Asia and a potentially crucial player in its campaign against terrorism.
 Washington is seizing on an opportunity that came with the tsunami, when Indonesia accepted the help of the United States military in distributing aid and had daily contacts with the Americans. Congress, concerned about Indonesia's human rights record, curbed military ties in 1992 and cut them back further five years ago after the army was involved in the killings of hundreds of civilians in East Timor, a province that has since gained independence. 
 Now, administration officials said, Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice has moved to strengthen American training of Indonesian officers considerably. Such training allows up-and-coming officers to learn modern warfare methods, the American system of civilian control over the military, accountability and rights issues. Armies in Asia that receive the training, known as the International Military Education and Training Program, include Thailand, Malaysia, India and Pakistan. 
 In late January, Washington dispatched $1 million worth of spare parts for Indonesia's aging fleet of military transport planes. For the moment, the administration was not planning to push for the removal of the ban on the sale of weapons to Indonesia, although that could come later, a Pentagon official said.
 The Bush administration tried once before to draw closer to Indonesia's military, but the effort failed in 2002 when two American schoolteachers were killed in Papua Province, and, American officials say, the Indonesian Army blocked American investigators. 
 Ms. Rice now plans to certify to Congress that Indonesia is cooperating sufficiently in investigating the Americans' deaths, a step that would remove a major stumbling block to ties, according to an aide to Senator Patrick J. Leahy, Democrat of Vermont. The aide, Tim Rieser, said Ms. Rice told the senator of her decision in a telephone conversation this week. Mr. Leahy is the Congressional architect of the break in relations dating to 1992.
 Mr. Leahy and others in Congress assert that the Indonesians first need to ''fully cooperate'' with an F.B.I. investigation into the American deaths, and in other cases of rights abuse, before full training of Indonesian soldiers in the United States can resume. Congressional approval is necessary for a resumption of the military training. 
 American military officials who have been hankering since the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks to gain access to the army, a dominant though still largely unreformed force, and the tsunami has presented the opportunity. The Bush administration views Indonesia, the most populous Muslim nation, as a moderate and increasingly democratic Muslim state.
 At the height of the cold war, when Indonesia was under the authoritarian rule of General Suharto, it was viewed by American administrations as a bulwark against Communism in Asia. Over nearly three decades, American training and equipment poured into Indonesia, though its military became increasingly abusive and corrupt.
 The Indonesian Army itself, where some factions are viewed by American officials to be sympathetic to Indonesia's Islamic extremist groups, has kept a determined distance from America. But in an interview, the civilian minister of defense, Juwono Sudarsono, who is close to the recently elected president, Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono, said he planned to go to Washington in March to make the case for what he called ''re-engagement.''
 President Yudhoyono, a former general and one of the last Indonesian officers to receive training at a United States staff college, is seen as the first Indonesian leader with a military background to be sympathetic to reform of the military, a proud and profoundly nationalist institution that is itself skittish about restoring ties.
 Mr. Juwono, who must take that attitude into account, said he intended to make a ''calibrated'' case to Washington that would emphasize the need for a stable Indonesia having a military with ''accountability and legitimacy.''
 He said Indonesia would not beg on its knees. Indeed, he said, the Chinese had invited Indonesia for strategic talks last November in Beijing, the first gesture of its kind between the nations. The Chinese, he said, offered to sell Indonesia fighter jets at concessionary rates. ''They emphasized there would be no conditionality,'' Mr. Juwono said. 
 Asked what Indonesia's response was, he said: ''We said it depends on the strategic partnership. If it's junior partnership for Indonesia, no way.'' 
 Mr. Juwono, who was educated at the London School of Economics, said that even after the widely heralded democratic presidential election here last year, the military ''retains the real levers of power.''
 ''From the political point of view, the military remains the fulcrum of Indonesia,'' he said. 
 To upgrade the military, Mr. Juwono said officers needed more training in management, budget and human rights issues at American military staff colleges. American officials also argue that training in the United States can create a more professional and disciplined force. 
 But Mr. Leahy said in a speech this week on the floor of the Senate that the United States needed to keep its leverage on the Indonesian military until it accounted for past actions. ''Although senior Indonesian military officers have repeatedly vowed to support reform, they have done next to nothing to hold their members accountable for these heinous crimes,'' he said. ''Instead, the Indonesian military has consistently obstructed justice.''
 After the two teachers' deaths in 2002, American officials said, the army blocked an F.B.I. investigation for 18 months. The Indonesian police concluded in a report soon after the killings that elements in the Indonesian military were responsible for the deaths. 
 A suspect, Antonius Wamang, who is suspected of having ties to the Indonesian Army, was finally indicted by the United States last June. He remains at large, although Mr. Juwono said he believed that the Indonesian military police knew his whereabouts.
 In Aceh, the Indonesian Army, which has been fighting a separatist rebellion for 30 years, has been on full display since the tsunami. Now it is common to see soldiers standing by, fully armed, as strong men among the refugees fight over boxes of food.
 Soldiers at the military hangar at the Banda Aceh airport, where large quantities of aid are temporarily stored, severely beat an anticorruption activist, leaving his face swollen, and an eye badly bruised. The military said afterward that the activist, Farid Faqih, whose beaten visage was all over television and the newspapers, had taken aid belonging to the wife of the top military commander, Gen. Sutarto Endriartono. An army captain was arrested in the case after President Yudhoyono said the violence was unacceptable.
 Of the incident, Mr. Juwono, the defense minister, said: ''It leaves me defending the indefensible. My argument is that as long as you have an undertrained, underfed military you will get these cases.'' 
 The army's uppermost concern appears to be to keep a stranglehold on the armed fighters of the Free Aceh Movement, most of whom have been pushed in the past two years out of the urban areas of Aceh and into the more remote hills. But the army is also running refugee camps.
 At Seunoddon, about 150 miles east of Banda Aceh, soldiers run three camps with varying degrees of intimidation.
 At one of the camps, a village leader, Hassan Sulaiman, showed a letter he had written to the local authorities saying the villagers did not want to be moved to barracks, where many are fearful that they will be controlled by the army, but rather wanted help in rebuilding their homes.
 The day after he made the letter public, Mr. Hassan said the camp's leader, Cpl. Zulikifri, kicked him in the groin. The confrontation came during the distribution of household goods donated by the International Committee of the Red Cross, Mr. Hassan said.
 ''The pain of the kicking was nothing compared to the pain to my dignity,'' he said later.
 To help ensure that the rebels do not gain ground on the decimated west coast of the province, the army chief, Gen. Ryamizard Ryacudu, who rarely speaks with foreign journalists, said in an interview that he planned to rebuild the 200-mile coastal road from Banda Aceh to Meulaboh that was swept away by the tsunami.
 The project, which Western engineers estimated could take two years, would be completed in two months with 5,000 soldiers working ''night and day,'' the general said. In addition to reaching out to the people devastated by the tsunami, the army is trying to keep the guerrillas from setting up a stronghold if the area remained cut off. 
 General Ryamizard, who has strong nationalist beliefs, has boasted of rising to the top of the military without training overseas, and is among those in whom American officials say they have sensed hostility to American overtures. 
 Asked about restoring ties, he said: ''America is the one that cut relations. Why are we blamed?''
 That impulse in the army to steer clear of the United States has mounted in the past decade, in part out of a sense of resentment that Washington took away what it gave during much of the cold war. For the past four years, for example, the Indonesian Air Force failed to take advantage of a slight easing on the weapons ban, said Robert Gelbhard, a former American ambassador to Indonesia.
 But two shipments of American parts are now being fitted onto C-130 planes that the Indonesians bought from the United States more than 20 years ago.
 Another American contribution to tsunami recovery arrived this week off the coast of Aceh -- the Mercy, a 1,000-bed United States Navy hospital ship. American officials said they were thinking of sending teams of the Navy's public health doctors and nurses into villages on Aceh's west coast, provided that the Indonesian military agrees.

HEADLINE: Trim Deficit? Only if Bush Uses Magic

BYLINE: By EDMUND L. ANDREWS

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Feb. 6 

 BODY:
The economy is growing. Tax revenues are climbing. But can these factors rescue President Bush from a federal deficit that seems stuck above $400 billion?
 The answer, unfortunately, is almost certainly no, analysts say.
 For all the programs that Mr. Bush is expected to slash in his budget proposal on Monday -- from health care and housing aid to Amtrak -- the cuts would total less than $15 billion next year and barely dent the deficit. 
 By far the biggest parts of the budget -- Medicare, Social Security and military spending -- would be immune from cuts and are expected to grow rapidly for years to come.
 On top of that, Mr. Bush's plan to replace part of Social Security with private savings accounts could require additional trillions of dollars in borrowing over the next several decades.
 The cornerstone of Mr. Bush's budget strategy is a belief that vigorous economic growth, spurred by supply-side tax cuts that were designed to provide incentives for upper-income Americans to produce more wealth, will generate big jumps in tax revenue that gradually reduce the deficit.
 At first glance, he would seem to have grounds for optimism. After all, surging tax revenue did come to Washington's rescue during the economic boom of the 1990's, pushing the budget from the red to the black. Republican and Democratic budget analysts, however, say that such an event is much less likely this time around. The contrasts are stark:
 Through most of the 1990's, government spending grew at a snail's pace. But government spending soared during President Bush's first term and is expected to keep growing rapidly as the nation's baby boomers start to claim old-age benefits.
 In the 1990's, the biggest jump in revenues came from high-income taxpayers who made enormous profits in the stock market bubble that ended in 2000. But Mr. Bush's tax cuts of 2001 and 2003 reduced rates on the wealthiest taxpayers and cut in half the taxes on dividends and capital gains, making it all but impossible for revenues to rise at a substantially faster pace than economic growth.
 Mr. Bush's own projections leave out the cost of rolling back the alternative minimum tax, a parallel tax that is expected to ensnare tens of millions of middle-income households as incomes rise with inflation. Republicans and Democrats both want to prevent such a trap, but a fix would cost roughly $500 billion over the next 10 years.
 ''I don't think we are likely to see a repeat of the 1990's,'' said Douglas Holtz-Eakin, the Republican-appointed director of the Congressional Budget Office. ''We can't grow our way out of this.''
 When Mr. Bush unveils his budget plan on Monday, White House officials hope to focus public attention on his proposals to cut scores of domestic programs: Medicaid, housing programs and Amtrak subsidies, among others. But while many of those cuts would be severe, their impact on the deficit would be small.
 Administration officials have proposed changes they say would reduce Medicaid spending by $60 billion over 10 years, or about $6 billion a year. Mr. Bush would cut spending on community development programs, consolidating 18 programs into 2 and reducing annual outlays from $5.6 billion to $3.7 billion.
 Eliminating operating subsidies for Amtrak, which would face intense opposition in Congress, would save about $1.2 billion a year.
 In all, Mr. Bush has vowed to cut or eliminate 150 government programs. But Republican Congressional analysts predicted on Friday that those cuts would be unlikely to save more than $15 billion. And even those savings may not materialize.
 Last year, Mr. Bush called for cutting or eliminating 65 programs, for a total projected saving of $4.8 billion. But Congress agreed to eliminate only four of those programs, for a savings of less than $200 million. 
 The other side of Mr. Bush's equation -- higher tax revenues that result from faster growth -- is unlikely to fill the gap. Despite strong economic growth and soaring corporate profits last year, federal tax revenues amounted to only 16.3 percent of the total economy, comparable with levels in the 1950's and far below the level of 21 percent reached during the stock market bubble in 2000.
 ''What's unrealistic is that they are trying to fund a government with today's demands on a 1950's stream of revenue,'' said Robert Bixby, executive director of the Concord Coalition, a research group that advocates fiscal discipline by the government.
 Tax revenues soared far beyond expectations during the economic boom and stock market bubble of the late 1990's, but budget analysts say there is little likelihood of repeating that feat in this decade.
 One reason is that Mr. Bush's tax cuts of 2001 and 2003 went largely to the nation's wealthiest taxpayers, the same people who accounted for the unexpected flood of tax revenue last time around. White House officials are already counting on tax revenues to surge by at least $200 billion this year, an increase of about 10 percent, and to climb more gradually after that.
 But even Mr. Bush's conservative allies have warned that those inflows will not be enough to cover the continued growth in overall government spending. Brian Riedl, budget analyst at the Heritage Foundation, a conservative research group here, estimated that deficits would remain around $400 billion through 2009 if current spending trends on Iraq and major benefit programs continued.
 For Mr. Bush to fulfill his promise of cutting the deficit in half by 2009, Mr. Riedl said, the president would have to cut $200 billion from domestic programs that now cost less than $500 billion a year.
 ''There is no way you can reach that goal by cutting only discretionary spending,'' Mr. Riedl said. ''You have to go after entitlements as well.''
 About two-thirds of the $2.3 trillion federal budget now goes to entitlement programs. The Congressional Budget Office estimates that costs for Medicare will rise $55 billion in 2005, to $380 billion. Social Security outlays are expected to rise to $540 billion, from $517 billion.
 But Mr. Bush has focused almost all of his budget cuts on discretionary domestic programs costing a total of $466 billion last year. Freezing spending at current levels on the vast array of programs Washington supports -- thus allowing them to grow simply at the rate of inflation -- would save about $10 billion next year, according to the Congressional Budget Office; a politically difficult reduction of 1 percent would save about $15 billion.
 Senator Judd Gregg, Republican of New Hampshire and chairman of the Senate Budget Committee, said neither Mr. Bush's spending cuts nor his hope of strong economic growth would be enough to close the gap. 
 ''You can't get there from here unless you look at entitlements,'' Mr. Gregg said last Thursday. ''It's for the same reason that Willy Sutton said he robbed banks: Because that's where the money is.''
 Chad Kolton, a spokesman for the White House Office of Management and Budget, said Mr. Bush was on track to cut the deficit by half over the next five years. ''We have a two-pillar approach for getting the budget deficit down by half,'' Mr. Kolton said, ''by restraining the growth in government spending and encouraging greater economic growth that leads to higher tax revenues.''
 But even if rising tax revenues do help reduce the deficit over the next five years, the subsequent five years are likely to be far more difficult.
 For starters, Mr. Bush wants to permanently extend his tax cuts rather than allow them to expire by 2011. That would cost about $1.8 trillion over the next decade, and most of the cost would occur after 2009.
 If Congress prevents an expansion of the alternative minimum tax, which Mr. Bush has said he wants, the cost would be $500 billion over the next decade and well over half of those costs would in the second five years.
 Those blows would be hitting the budget at the same time that the costs of the new Medicare prescription drug programs approach $100 billion a year and as the flood of baby boomers start to claim Social Security and Medicare entitlements.
 By that time, however, Mr. Bush will no longer be in office.

HEADLINE: Gay Marriage Ruling a Test of the Mayor's Political Mettle

BYLINE: By JIM RUTENBERG

 BODY:
With rising poll numbers, positive economic data and a preliminary election-year budget that avoided major cuts or tax hikes, Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg's opponents seemed to have a limited arsenal of weapons to use against him -- until late last week.
 A court ruling against the city on Friday making gay marriage legal in the five boroughs threw Mr. Bloomberg and his election team their first real test of the campaign season.
 To forgo an appeal would have been to pave the way for a wave of gay marriages in New York City, which would certainly hurt Mr. Bloomberg -- a longtime Democrat who only became a Republican four years ago -- in a likely primary against two conservative challengers. But to appeal would be to anger not only politically powerful gay voters, but also heterosexual voters who approve of same-sex marriage. 
 Mr. Bloomberg's solution, to pledge support for gay marriage while also announcing that the city would appeal the judge's decision to ensure that a higher court is in agreement with it, drew criticism yesterday from those on both sides of the debate. But even opponents said he seemed to have bought himself some time -- though how much remains unclear.
 ''I think he tried to punt,'' said City Councilwoman Christine Quinn, a gay Democrat who represents Chelsea, Greenwich Village and Hell's Kitchen. ''How far he'll get down the field is yet to be seen.''
 Officials at City Hall said Mr. Bloomberg's comments on Saturday came after a frenzied day and a half of deliberations in which the mayor was constantly e-mailing and telephoning his advisers and lawyers.
 Mr. Bloomberg and his aides found out Thursday night what the rest of the city would learn the next day: that Justice Doris Ling-Cohan of State Supreme Court had decided that the state's nearly 100-year-old law defining marriage as between a man and a woman violated its Constitution. She gave the city 30 days before it had to issue marriage licenses to gay couples requesting them. 
 Ed Skyler, a spokesman for the mayor, said city lawyers, who were defending the city in a lawsuit brought by five same-sex couples, wanted to appeal immediately. He said they thought that state law was clear and that the latest decision contradicted other rulings upholding the law forbidding gay marriages.
 What was needed, the lawyers argued, was clarification from the state's highest court, the Court of Appeals.
 But, Mr. Skyler said, the mayor initially resisted his lawyers.
 ''It was tough -- he was being asked to appeal a decision that he agrees with essentially,'' he said. 
 What convinced Mr. Bloomberg to authorize the appeal, Mr. Skyler said, were his lawyers' arguments that the city should avoid what happened last year in San Francisco after its mayor, Gavin Newsom, issued thousands of marriage licenses to same-sex couples. 
 A state court nullified them a few months later.
 ''No one has written the story about how devastated people were when the California court came back and said those marriage licenses didn't mean anything,'' said Jonathan Capehart, an informal adviser with whom Mr. Bloomberg consulted late last week.
 Mr. Capehart said that the thrust of his advice to the mayor was, ''Whatever you do, you must come out for gay marriage.'' He added, ''I knew he was for it, so it was like, if you're going to say something, now's the time to say it -- especially if you're going to appeal.''
 Throughout his mayoralty, Mr. Bloomberg has avoided saying exactly where he stands on gay marriage, though associates have frequently said publicly they believe he is for it. While there were obvious political reasons for Mr. Bloomberg to avoid a public pronouncement -- he can ill afford to alienate social conservatives who may vote in a Republican primary -- a top aide argued that the mayor's position has evolved over time and that only now was he ready to share it.
 But Mr. Bloomberg's aides do not deny that they thought a statement supporting gay marriage could go a long way in tempering public anger over the city's appeal.
 Before Mr. Bloomberg made his decision public, he telephoned gay leaders, including officials of Lambda Legal, the group representing the plaintiffs in the lawsuit that led to Justice Ling-Cohan's decision.
 Those calls seemed to help. Even as many gay groups expressed disappointment with his decision, they, including Lambda, also praised the mayor for supporting gay marriage.
 Still, Mr. Bloomberg's opponents, especially Democrats, argue that his position is cynically political. Two Democrats seeking his job, Fernando Ferrer, the former Bronx borough president, and Gifford Miller, the City Council speaker, joined several gay elected officials at City Hall yesterday to blast the mayor for what State Senator Thomas K. Duane called ''cowardice.''
 ''When you have social issues that New Yorkers care about like this, and he takes the Republican perspective, it endangers his re-election,'' said Assemblyman Scott Stringer, a Democrat representing the Upper West Side. ''You can't be for something when you're appealing it.''
 The mayor's aides and several gay activists agreed that the issue's effect on the election could depend on how soon the matter is decided. 
 Should the Court of Appeals strike down Justice Ling-Cohan's ruling, activists say they will watch closely to see if Mr. Bloomberg goes through with his promise to lobby the Legislature to legalize gay marriage. 
 But it's anyone's guess if or when the court might agree to hear the case. Lawyers on both sides of the matter say it could be as soon as this spring -- well before the Sept. 13 primary and the Nov. 8 general election -- or as late as next year, well after it.

HEADLINE: If Subarus Grow Up to Be Pretty, Will They Still Be Attractive?

BYLINE: By PHIL PATTON

 BODY:
WHEN a new car makes its public debut, the automaker listens anxiously for positive feedback. But at the Detroit auto show last month, Subaru was eager for comments of any kind about the design of the B9 Tribeca, the company's new seven-seat sport-utility vehicle.
 Trainers hired to coach the hostesses who worked at Subaru's display made this clear, saying that ''if anyone says anything about the styling, good or bad, that's a good thing.'' 
 Subaru has long been a wallflower at the prom of auto fashion. But styling is just about the only virtue for which Subarus have not been lauded. In surveys, consumers praise their durability and economy; enthusiast magazines applaud their ruggedness and sportiness. 
 The cars have not been ugly, just forgettable. The Tribeca, which goes on sale this summer, is Subaru's attempt to fix that.
 As the company's first production model to carry its new, more expressive design theme, the Tribeca wears a face whose grille suggests a jet-engine intake flanked by wings, shapes intended to evoke the aviation origins of Subaru and its parent, Fuji Heavy Industries. The pronounced bulges around the Tribeca's wheel openings emphasize the presence of all-wheel drive, which has become the company's hallmark feature in the United States; a high beltline (the line under the side windows) also departs from the design of current Subarus.
 The new design language was developed by Andreas Zapatinas, Subaru's head of advanced design, who was hired in 2002 to bring grace and uniformity to the model line as part of the company's effort to establish itself as a more upscale brand. His influence was embodied in two stunning, if not shocking, show cars: the B9SC roadster, unveiled at the 2003 Tokyo auto show, and the four-door B11S, which made its debut in Geneva the same year. A small city car also shown in Japan, the R1e, will make its debut in production form next month in Geneva. 
 The new look, Mr. Zapatinas said in an interview in Detroit, is intended to express the power of four-wheel drive and the qualities of precision engineering. The goal, he said, is to revise the image people have of Subaru. 
 ''We have high quality and lots of attention to detail,'' Mr. Zapatinas said. ''Before, maybe the exteriors did not say that.
 ''We have slowly managed to build a treasure here, to build a castle. It is time to consolidate and to give our family also a visual identity.''
 A playful and energetic man, Mr. Zapatinas slightly resembles the cartoonist R. Crumb. Engineering and design combine for Mr. Zapatinas in one of his favorite cars of all time, the Citroen DS, the pride of 1950's Gallic technology.
 Mr. Zapatinas, born in Athens in 1957, studied at the Art Center College of Design in Pasadena, Calif. He worked for Chris Bangle at Fiat, later following Mr. Bangle to BMW. His work on the Fiat Barchetta and Alfa Romeo 145 has been widely praised. 
 Subaru's design has often seemed an afterthought, a container in which technology is wrapped, secondary to engineering. Subaru executives have in the past referred to their designs simply as ''packaging.'' The ungraceful placement of beltlines, the cartoonish swells of the fenders and the muttlike faces seem not only to express a lack of interest in the romance of styling, but to advertise an outright disdain for it. 
 There is another side to Subaru, though. A raging rally-car personality is embodied in its signature blue sports models, notably the Impreza WRX STi that draws at least as much attention from teenagers as a Corvette or a Porsche. A six-cylinder sports coupe, the SVX, was built in the 1990's, but the upscale model baffled traditional Subaru buyers as much as the partitioned windows of its Giorgetto Giugiaro design baffled turnpike toll-takers.
 The Tribeca, which will be Subaru's most expensive model, has attracted a lot of attention in Japan, Mr. Zapatinas said. But the potential for confusion over the name seems great. Some prospective buyers may think that a Tribeca is a geometric figure with the same unusual shape as the grille. For others, the name may suggest a Subaru that can cope with rough roads -- urban as well as rural -- even if those buyers do not know that TriBeCa is a neighborhood in Manhattan, the triangle below Canal Street, where cobblestone streets are best traversed with a rugged vehicle.
 Some Japanese companies have made an effort recently to make their designs more, well, Japanese. Toyota designers talk about increasing the ''J-factor.'' Nissan has incorporated elements of Japanese tradition into its designs, while Mazda expresses its zoom-zoom message with a look of samurai armor. 
 Does Mr. Zapatinas want his cars to look more Japanese?
 ''That should come out, not in a presumptuous way, but as an expression of Japanese premium engineering,'' he said. 
 ''We want to show the same attention to detail you see in the display of vegetables at the market in Japan and even in the way the clerk gives you change at the checkout.'' 
 For the most part, Subaru drivers seem never to have missed fancy styling in their cars. The company succeeded in establishing itself as the leader in all-wheel drive before most other makers caught on to the interest in this feature. It jacked up an all-wheel-drive station wagon and called the result ''the world's first sport utility wagon,'' finding a large pool of customers who wanted all-weather capability without an S.U.V.'s boxy body. 
 For many Subaru buyers, homeliness is not only acceptable but serves as a visible token of their refusal to be seduced by the superficialities of styling. 
 ''I can't imagine anyone who cares less about the aesthetics of his car than I do,'' said David Laskin, the owner of a 2001 Subaru Outback. Mr. Laskin, who lives in Seattle, is a writer specializing in weather. He has driven his Outback many miles promoting his book, ''The Children's Blizzard,'' about a deadly snowstorm that struck the Great Plains in 1888. 
 ''It's an L.L. Bean edition, although we didn't buy it for that,'' Mr. Laskin said. He compares it to an L.L. Bean boot, waterproof and warm, even if it is not as fashionable as a Florsheim or Bruno Magli loafer.
 ''It's like a fleece vest instead of a cashmere sweater,'' Mr. Laskin said. ''Out here in Seattle there's a whole lot of the 'earth muffin' thing about Subarus.'' 
 This counterchic suggests a perverse pride in the homeliness of the vehicles. A Subaru's look may say as much about its driver as the rakish shape of a Porsche 911 does, but in a wholly different way. It fairly screams anti-consumption. ''We are not the sort of people to be deluded by such things,'' the sheet metal seems to say.
 With such customers, Mr. Zapatinas's design direction holds risks. The Tribeca shows a daring amount of grace. The taillights recall the lovely Alfas that Mr. Zapatinas worked on in the late 1990's. There is a hint of Porsche Cayenne in the face, and the shape of the grille is echoed in an interior more elegant and flowing than those of earlier Subarus.
 Could a new generation of Subarus become, well, too pretty? ''Only if it becomes too trendy, too fashionlike,'' he said, and he promises not to let that happen. 
 To judge from the reaction to the Tribeca, Subaru is safe from the dangers of prettiness for a while yet. ''Too pretty? No way!'' said Mr. Laskin, the Seattle Subaru owner. ''It's just as chunky and drab and unassuming as always.''

HEADLINE: Among Islamic Banks, A Shortage of Scholars

BYLINE: By MICHELLE WALLIN

DATELINE: MANAMA, Bahrain 

 BODY:
Nazim Yaquby, an Islamic scholar based in Bahrain, is as familiar with the angular calligraphy of early Koranic manuscripts as he is with customized software engines for equity hedge funds.
 Mr. Yaquby is among a group of scholars who sit on the supervisory boards that are a cornerstone of Islamic financial institutions, vetting all products and services to determine whether they comply with the Islamic legal code, or Shariah. The scholars wield tremendous power: an Islamic bank stripped of Shariah credentials has little future. 
 Now, however, the growth of Islamic banks in the Persian Gulf and beyond is straining the supply of such specialized scholars -- something particularly troublesome as the banks bring to market increasingly complex financial products.
 ''When an institution comes and claims it follows certain concepts,'' Mr. Yaquby, who is 46, said, ''then the public must have a means to know if this is true. We don't interfere with the day-to-day activities of these companies. Our only concern is Shariah.''
 The strictures are many, including prohibitions on financing practices like interest and speculation and bans on investments in pork or alcohol producers. Banking is to be based on trade and hard assets, and profit and loss must be shared. 
 ''Money is part of the religion for Muslims; it is not something separate,'' said Fareed Hadi, 43, a Bahraini scholar who serves on the Shariah board of the Gulf Finance House, an investment bank here, among other institutions. ''The main thing for Islamic economics or banking is to deal with people fairly. It means not taking what you should not take.''
 The shortage of specialized scholars is in stark contrast to the stubbornly high unemployment in many Persian Gulf countries, and underscores the continued gap between the region's educational systems and its professional needs. 
 And it provides a modest test of whether countries like Saudi Arabia, Bahrain, Kuwait and the United Arab Emirates, which in recent decades have relied on imported experts to run their economies, can train enough local talent to support a largely homegrown industry.
 ''The number of people who specialize in Islamic finance is very limited,'' said Omar Marwan Kamal, executive manager of Ernst & Young's Islamic Financial Services Group here. While bankers say that the lack of qualified people cuts across the industry, the Shariah boards and the scholars who populate them seem in particularly short supply. 
 There are no more than several dozen scholars with the right combination of knowledge of Islamic law, modern finance and technical English, the language of global banking, to serve on the Shariah committees of institutions based around the Persian Gulf and beyond, according to industry estimates. While the biographies of these specialized scholars vary widely, they tend to have studied Islamic law in the Middle East and received their economic training abroad. 
 Many serve on lots of boards. Mr. Yaquby, for instance, sits on the supervisory boards of HSBC's Islamic banking unit, HSBC Amanah; the Dow Jones Islamic Market Indexes; the UBS Group's Noriba Bank, a Shariah-compliant investment bank; and a handful of other foreign and Middle East banks. He advises Bahrain's central bank and industry agencies, is a frequent speaker at industry conferences and publishes actively.
 Such broad involvement is the rule rather than the exception among the industry's most respected and popular scholars, a group of people with national origins as diverse as the United States, the Persian Gulf countries, Syria, Pakistan and Malaysia. 
 Neither the scholars nor the institutions they serve make any secret of the numerous roles, or seem to have a problem with divided loyalties or with possible conflicts in serving competitors.
 In fact, bankers say, there is a benefit to having a small number of scholars: it provides a uniformity of criteria. Thousands of scholars issuing contradictory religious decrees would wreak havoc on the industry. In the last 30 years, scholars have issued around 6,000 such decrees dealing with financial matters.
 But bankers acknowledge that the shortage can create a logjam, especially as the industry has sought scholarly advice at very early stages of the development of financial products. 
 Yusuf Talal DeLorenzo, 56, a leading Shariah scholar based in the United States, said that only in recent years had the academics, bankers and lawyers begun to coordinate what can be a complicated dance of widely diverging interests -- allowing for innovations including a hedge fund that adheres to Shariah requirements, leveraged leases in real estate, and the securitization of a fleet of rental cars. ''The Shariah board is really behind so much of the important innovation that needs to take place,'' he said. 
 Bankers worry that they are not seeing the emergence of a new generation of scholars. ''There is a real need to educate more young Shariah scholars to Western transactional finance,'' said Eric Meyer, senior managing partner at Meyer Capital Partners of New Canaan, Conn. Mr. Meyer has worked closely with Islamic scholars, including Mr. DeLorenzo and Mr. Yaquby, as he has built up a Shariah-compliant hedge fund over the last three years. 
 Recognizing the shortage of people, Bahrain's central bank is planning to open a center for Islamic finance training, education and research, part of the country's efforts to convert itself into the hub of Islamic finance in the gulf region. 
 Total assets in Islamic banks in Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, Qatar, the United Arab Emirates and Bahrain -- five of the six members of the Gulf Cooperation Council -- increased by an average of 24 percent a year in the five years ended December 2003, to $49.5 billion, according to the General Council for Islamic Banks and Financial Institutions here. (The sixth council member, Oman, does not have Islamic banks.)
 With the region drenched in oil dollars and money remaining closer to home after September 2001, such growth is expected to continue, as long as the industry can attract the kind of creative financial minds needed to develop products and services that conform to Islamic codes. 
 The industry in the Persian Gulf region also needs to resolve shortcomings, like the limited financial instruments available to banks for managing their own liquidity, the lack of an interbank money market and a secondary debt market, and the absence of a lender of last resort for institutions in trouble.
 ''The continuous challenge is to create competitive, quality products,'' said Noriba Bank's chief executive, Mohamad Toufic Kanafani. ''This is a business. We are here to make money in a Shariah-compliant way.''

HEADLINE: Consumers Borrowed Less in Month Than Forecast

BYLINE: By Bloomberg News

 BODY:
Consumer borrowing increased less than expected in December, according to data released yesterday.
 Borrowing through charge cards, car loans and other nonmortgage methods rose $3.1 billion, to $2.104 trillion, from a revised gain of $2 billion in November that was first reported as a decline, the Federal Reserve said. 
 The Fed raised rates five times in 2004, to 2.25 percent in December from 1 percent in June, to control inflation. The Fed raised rates another quarter-point this month and said additional increases might come at a ''measured'' pace.
 Higher rates may further cool the economy, which grew 3.1 percent in the fourth quarter, compared with 4.4 percent in the year-earlier period.
 ''Households have become increasingly hesitant to tap even deeper into consumer debt,'' said Stephen Wood, principal economist at Insight Economics in Danville, Calif. ''As mortgage refinancing opportunities become scarcer, households will either have to resort to more consumer debt or bring their spending back into line with their more slowly growing income.''
 For the year, consumer borrowing rose 4.6 percent, the fastest annual increase since 2001, the report said.
 ''To the extent that the Fed raised rates in the second half and is likely to raise in much of this year, we should expect that consumer borrowing will slow,'' said Anthony Chan, senior economist at J.P. Morgan Fleming Asset Management in Columbus, Ohio.

HEADLINE: Firefighters Are on Both Sides of the Jets Stadium Ad Fight

BYLINE: By NICHOLAS CONFESSORE

 BODY:
For months, the war over the stadium proposed for the Far West Side had been consuming New York's political oxygen, burning up airwaves and column-inches with catty news releases, dueling economic impact studies and invective from seemingly every politician, community advocate and business leader in Manhattan. 
 And where there's smoke, there are also firefighters. Both sides in the debate have tried to harness the image of New York firefighters, and depending on who is talking, the stadium is painted as either a revenue-inducing boon to salary-starved municipal employees or an unconscionable drain on the city's budget.
 In May, the New York Association for Better Choices -- a coalition of politicians, community groups and local businesses -- unleashed a multimillion-dollar barrage of advertisements attacking the stadium plan, which calls for a total of $600 million in city and state funding. 
 Against mournful piano chords, a narrator complains about spending ''$600 million on a stadium while we ask our firefighters to do more with less'' as a montage of black-and-white photos of soot-blackened firefighters moves across the screen.
 The association also ran two other ads that put images of firefighters front and center. All these were paid for by MSG Inc., which owns Madison Square Garden and fears that a new West Side stadium would drain convention and concert business from its arena. 
 But there was one thing: the producers had used stock photos in the ads. That gave stadium supporters the opening they needed. In September, they struck back with ads featuring Edwin Anzalone, a New York City firefighter better known as Fireman Ed, the man at home games who leads fans in the J-E-T-S chant. ''We thought he was the best spokesman to get our message out that the stadium would actually produce revenue for the city,'' said Matthew Higgins, a Jets spokesman. ''So we approached Fireman Ed, and asked if he would be in the ad.''
 Mr. Anzalone agreed. ''We're real firefighters, not actors,'' he bellows in the ad, flanked by seven other firefighters in front of his company's firehouse in Harlem. The sports center, he explains as the background music swells, will bring the city millions of dollars in new revenue, and ''possibly even those hard-earned raises we deserve.'' 
 The Jets were delighted. ''That has proven to be without question our most effective ad,'' Mr. Higgins said. ''Every single meeting I go to, and everyone I talk to, one of the first things they say is, 'I love that fireman ad.'''
 Not everyone loved it -- specifically, Mr. Anzalone's union, the Uniformed Firefighters Association. The union has been in a running battle with Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg practically since his first day in office, on issues ranging from salaries to closing firehouses. The stadium is among the mayor's top priorities, and in August the union officials had taken the unusual step of forming a partnership with the New York Association for Better Choices to oppose it. 
 Union officials say they asked Mr. Anzalone not to appear in the pro-stadium spots. He went ahead anyway. The ads ran soon after, much to the dismay of other firefighters, who heckled him at an October union meeting. 
 Asked for comment, Mr. Anzalone was unwilling to discuss the heckling. 
 The union vice president, James Slevin, who attended the meeting, said Mr. Anzalone spoke after one firefighter complained about the commercials and asked whether the union had taken a position on them. 
 After a union official said that they had asked Mr. Anzalone not to appear in the spot, Mr. Slevin said, Mr. Anzalone took the microphone. He stood his ground, saying his decision had nothing to do with the mayor, that he wanted to bring his team back to New York, and that it was not up to the union to decide what he could and could not say. 
 ''He got a negative reception from the members,'' Mr. Slevin said. ''A very negative reception.'' They were outraged, he said, because ''they know full well that this mayor would never allocate any money that could ever be generated off the stadium to raise salaries for firefighters.''
 In an e-mail message, Edward Skyler, a spokesman for the mayor, responded: ''If we don't create jobs and economic opportunities for New Yorkers by investing in crucial projects now, we won't have the tax revenues to pay our teachers, cops and firefighters down the road.''
 However much Mr. Anzalone's appearance irked his fellow firefighters, it appears to have been by the book. The department requires any organization that wishes to use a firefighter in an advertisement to file an official request, which is reviewed by the deputy commissioner for public information. Most such requests are turned down.
 ''They're not to sponsor, shill, or advertise any products,'' said James Long, a department spokesman. Originally, he said, the Jets wanted to shoot Mr. Anzalone and his co-workers dressed in their uniforms and inside their firehouse, known as the Harlem Hilton, which houses Engine Company 69 and Ladder Company 28. The department said no.
 ''We told him he had the right to do this,'' Mr. Long said. ''But we wanted no uniforms, off duty, no quarters, and no pay.'' So Mr. Anzalone and the others appear not in their quarters but outside, wearing unofficial navy-blue firehouse T-shirts, and made the ad on their own time and received no compensation.
 Given the touchy circumstances, Mr. Long said, the Jets' request was also forwarded to the city's Conflicts of Interest Board. On the board's recommendation, the Jets ad included a disclaimer noting that ''the opinions expressed herein are not necessarily those of the New York City Fire Department and the City of New York.''

HEADLINE: 2 Koreas Forge Economic Ties To Ease Tensions on Their Own

BYLINE: By NORIMITSU ONISHI

DATELINE: SEOUL, South Korea 

 BODY:
The first products made jointly by South and North Korea since the peninsula was divided half a century ago -- stainless steel pots priced at $19 a pair -- went on sale at a department store here recently. They sold out in two days.
 The kitchenware was made in a special economic zone inside North Korea, just north of the demilitarized zone that divides the peninsula, by a South Korean company employing North Korean workers. A maker of semiconductor parts also began operating there late in 2004, and 13 more South Korean companies are scheduled to follow this year.
 For the two Koreas, the opening of North Korea's first economic zone is filled with real and symbolic significance, which was not lost on the many shoppers who snapped up pots to give to relatives, friends and South Koreans whose ancestral towns are in North Korea. The zone is inside the ancient capital of Kaesong, the burial place of some of Korea's kings, and is reached by a new road that links the two Koreas by passing a few miles west of the truce village of Panmunjom, the enduring symbol of Korean division. 
 ''The two Koreas have literally taken a different road toward eventual unification,'' said Jean-Jacques Grauhar, the secretary general of the European Union Chamber of Commerce here, who has lived in South Korea for 11 years and earlier lived in the North for 7. ''The Kaesong industrial complex represents cooperation between the two Koreas, without the interference of any outside power. This would have been unthinkable just five years ago.''
 To many government officials and businessmen here, the opening of the economic zone represents a major step in further engaging North Korea, which has carried out market reforms and established diplomatic, economic and cultural ties with many Western nations in recent years. That has put South Korea uncomfortably at odds with the Bush administration's policy of confrontation and isolation in its campaign to force North Korea to abandon its nuclear program. 
 But North Korea's changes have continued, if haltingly, despite the American efforts. Not long ago, the Communist North publicized a new inheritance law in what appears to be a step toward broadening property rights. And in 2004, new businesses opened in Pyongyang, the North Korean capital, including half a dozen Internet cafes, restaurants and karaoke and pool halls, according to the South Korean government. About 350 restaurants and 150 bars, including some that serve hamburgers and operate around the clock, are now said to be doing business there.
 Impatient North Korean officials, who have regularly visited China's special economic zones for inspiration, are pressing South Korea to quicken the pace of development at Kaesong, South Koreans say. Opinions vary on whether the Kaesong zone will eventually lead to Chinese-style economic changes, whether North Korea indeed has committed itself to taking the same road chosen by China two decades ago, or whether it is merely an effort to generate hard cash to prop up the economy, ease food shortages and ultimately avoid a government collapse.
 But Chinese businessmen have been investing heavily in the last year in Pyongyang, opening restaurants and small factories, according to visitors to Pyongyang. 
 ''They tell me North Korea will be a market in 10 years,'' said Nam Sung Wook, a North Korea expert at Korea University here, who has visited the North many times.
 Since the first meeting in 2000 between the countries, the idea of engaging North Korea has become entrenched in South Korea, and Seoul's distance from the United States, its greatest ally, has grown. American officials who are wary of South Korea passing secret technology to North Korea remain cool toward the economic zone, and their public statements supporting it have done little to dispel the popular perception in South Korea that the United States stands in the way of unification.
 In a speech implicitly critical of the Bush administration's hard-line policy toward North Korea, South Korea's president, Roh Moo Hyun, said in Los Angeles late in 2004 that North Korea was ready to change and open up.
 ''The North Koreans have accommodated market economics to the extent that they obviously cannot reverse the course any more,'' Mr. Roh said, comparing it to two other Communist Asian nations that have adopted economic changes, China and Vietnam.
 ''Even in the early 1970's amid the confrontation of the cold war, the United States began positive dialogue with China, eventually resulting in the opening of diplomatic relations,'' he said.
 In a sign of how the South's attitude has changed, Park Seung, the governor of the Bank of Korea, recently urged South Korean companies to invest in the North. ''We should go to North Korea instead of China or Vietnam,'' he said.
 Yoo Chang Geun, the president of S.J. Tech, a semiconductor parts maker, said he had been considering opening a factory in China and had never thought of North Korea other than as ''a dangerous and terrorist nation'' until a year ago. But the cost of labor in North Korea, which is even cheaper than in China, the common language and his personal belief that free enterprise could coax the North further out of its shell, persuaded him to put his factory there. His company represents a $5 million investment with a work force, now at 70, that is to grow to 300 this year.
 ''I concluded that North Korea is not anyone else's problem,'' he said. ''It's our problem as one people.''
 The Kaesong economic zone, which North Korean officials have allowed only South Korean officials and journalists to visit, was developed by the South Korean government and Hyundai Asan. By 2007, 300 South Korean factories employing about 500 North Koreans each are expected to be operating there. The North Korean workers' monthly salary of $58 is about one-twentieth what a worker in South Korea earns, a big advantage for the small and medium-size South Korean companies expected to go there.
 But the usual logistical problems, as well as unexpected ones, have already caused delays with the start-up of some companies. By the end of last year, 15 companies had been expected to be running, instead of 2.
 North Korean construction workers were rated only one-third as efficient as their South Korean counterparts, and many North Koreans, with little experience working with machines, required extensive training, said Song Yong Kwon, a project manager at Hyundai Asan. One South Korean supervisor is needed for every four North Korean workers.
 ''The desirable ratio is 1 to 10, but that will take time,'' Mr. Song said.
 The experience of working together at the economic zone has also offered a glimpse into unification's inevitable problems, big and small.
 Romanson, a watchmaker that will hire 570 North Koreans and start operations in June, will build a cafeteria for its South Korean workers in Kaesong, and provide lunch. Providing lunch for the North Koreans would cost $75 a month for each worker, more than their salary, so the company may face the awkward situation of requiring the North Koreans to bring their lunches.
 ''They might resist being ordered by South Koreans,'' said Lee Seong Han, a project manager at Romanson. ''They are a proud people.''
 Somewhat paradoxically, some South Koreans say they may have more trouble working with the North Koreans, rather than the other way around, because South Korea's fiercely anti-Communist education taught them for decades that North Koreans were dangerous and evil.
 In North Korea, by contrast, government education programs taught that while South Korea's government was an American puppet, its people were brothers and sisters.
 ''The first time I went to Kaesong last year, people were friendly and waved at our bus,'' recalled Chung In Kyo, 39, a project manager at Bucheon, a maker of electric wiring components that expects to open a factory with 300 workers in May.
 ''We saw children playing in the lake and having fun, but because of my education I thought this was staged,'' he added. ''After my second and third visits, my opinions of North Korea started changing. Our North Korean guides would always say that we are the same people and that we should work together.''

HEADLINE: Fortune Will Get a New Managing Editor

BYLINE: By KATHARINE Q. SEELYE

 BODY:
Rik Kirkland, managing editor of Fortune magazine, announced yesterday that he would step down on April 1, saying he was tired of the management part of his job and wanted to go back to writing. 
 Eric Pooley, managing editor for Time in Europe, was expected to be appointed to the post today. Mr. Pooley flew from London to New York yesterday to meet with executives at the Time Inc. unit of Time Warner, which owns the magazine. 
 Mr. Pooley, 45, who was once a researcher at New York magazine and then a contributing editor, joined Time in 1995, covered the White House and became Time's chief political correspondent in the 2000 election. He was editor of Time's Nation section before moving to London to head Time Europe.
 Mr. Kirkland, 53, served as deputy managing editor for six years before assuming the top job four years ago, just as Fortune -- and other business magazines -- faced a plunge in advertising from the burst of the technology bubble in the late 1990's and the terrorist attacks of Sept. 11, 2001.
 Since then, advertising in Fortune has started creeping back up, though the 3,405 ad pages in 2004 were lower than the 4,012 pages in 2001 and the 6,259 pages of its peak year, 2000. Paid circulation has inched up, reaching 919,000 for the period ended last June 30, the latest available. 
 Still, business magazines are hampered by a lack of technology advertising, said Mark Edmiston, managing director of AdMedia Partners, a financial adviser to magazines.
 Mr. Kirkland and his associates described his departure as driven less by business pressures on the magazine than by a desire to free himself from the pressures of management and get back to writing. When Mr. Kirkland served as deputy, the managing editor was John Huey; when Mr. Kirkland was named managing editor, Mr. Huey became his boss as editorial director of the Time empire. 
 In Mr. Huey and Norman Pearlstine, editor in chief of Time Inc. and former executive editor of The Wall Street Journal, Mr. Kirkland had two energetic executives who were intensely interested in Fortune and monitored Mr. Kirkland closely.
 Mr. Pearlstine said: ''Whoever is the managing editor of Fortune has to deal with two people, John and me, who have an extraordinary interest in that magazine, and that's a plus and a minus. John can tell you about the days when he was managing editor and I made him nuts. I comment on stuff, I raise questions on a level of things that I don't elsewhere.''
 Mr. Pearlstine said he had no particular desire to change the direction of the magazine. In seeking a new managing editor, he said he wanted to find ''someone who has the ability to maintain everything you like but who brings fresh eyes to it and you try to let them do it.''
 Mr. Kirkland said he approached Mr. Pearlstine and Mr. Huey in December and said he was tired of the ''day-to-day grind,'' including laying off people and ''all the pastoral functions of management, of being the local parish priest.''

LENGTH: 1130 words

HEADLINE: 'It's a Guy Thing. It's Like N.F.L. Football.' (Gas Mileage an Afterthought)

BYLINE: By DANNY HAKIM

DATELINE: DETROIT, Feb. 7 

 BODY:
The big sport utility vehicle is in a slump. But the big pickup truck? It's going full tilt.
 S.U.V. sales continued to grow last year as buyers sought smaller-size models. But sales of larger S.U.V.'s like the Ford Explorer, Hummer H2 and Chevy Suburban appear to have reached a plateau. 
 And for the first time in a decade, the sales growth of full-size pickup trucks outpaced the growth of S.U.V.'s over all, according to an analysis by the Ford Motor Company. Sales of full-size pickups rose 6.6 percent last year from 2003, compared with overall S.U.V. sales growth of 4.3 percent, Ward's AutoInfoBank data shows.
 What is more, American buyers seem to want their big pickups bigger and more S.U.V.-like. They are mostly buying trucks with seating for the family, instead of the two-seat work trucks that were standard a decade ago. And while several automakers say that concern over high gasoline prices is starting to influence prospective purchasers of sport utility vehicles, pickup truck buyers generally want the biggest truck they can afford. 
 ''How can I say it -- guys will be guys,'' said George Pipas, Ford's chief industry sales analyst. ''This is a guy thing. It's like N.F.L. football. That's why we advertise so much during N.F.L. games.''
 While environmentalists and safety advocates have long trained their ire on the S.U.V., the growth in popularity of the full-size pickup truck, which has risen to 15 percent of new vehicle sales in the last dozen years from 8.5 percent, has been another culprit in the nation's swelling dependence on foreign oil. 
 The average pickup truck has become 40 percent heavier in the last two decades and 11 percent less fuel-efficient, according to estimates by the Environmental Protection Agency. 
 Big pickup trucks are an even more formidable threat to people in cars than the largest S.U.V.'s, according to statistics from the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration. Fatality rates for the occupants of large pickup trucks are modestly higher than those for other family vehicles like large cars and minivans because of the trucks' increased rollover risk, a government crash study in 2003 indicated. 
 On Wednesday at the Chicago Auto Show, DaimlerChrysler is planning to introduce one of the largest passenger cabs yet as an option on its full-size pickup truck, the Dodge Ram. The new cabin, to be called the Mega Cab, is 20 inches longer than the largest Ram passenger cab now. 
 Weighing in at more than three tons unloaded, the Ram Mega Cab seats six and joins a group of new passenger trucks that are so heavy that they fall outside federal fuel economy regulations for most other passenger vehicles. The makers are not even required to post mileage figures on a window sticker. 
 Unlike some more exotic giant pickups, like the new 18-wheeler-size CXT from International Truck and Engine, the Dodge Ram Mega Cab will be positioned as a mass-market product. Chrysler executives estimate that they can sell 50,000 to 100,000 of them a year, according to a person close to the company's planning. 
 ''There's overwhelming desire for it; there has been for several years now,'' said Hayden Elder, a Dodge dealer in Athens, Tex., near Dallas. ''We could probably sell everything they can build just in Texas.''
 This is not welcome news to environmentalists. 
 ''We now have Cadillac pickup trucks and other things one would have thought never would have been needed,'' said Daniel Becker, the director of the Sierra Club's global-warming program. ''The majority of these are used by urban cowboys.''
 In areas like Texas and Oklahoma, pickup trucks have long been a mainstay and now account for about a quarter of all vehicles sold. Their appeal has increased as they are equipped with amenities matching those in sport utility vehicles, leaving some buyers to see advantages to a vehicle that feels like an S.U.V. inside and has a truck bed as a bonus. 
 ''I've never had a pickup,'' said Wayne Hays, a federal court jury administrator in Charleston, W.Va., ''but this sort of combines both the sport utility with the cargo bed of the pickup truck.''
 In December, Mr. Hays bought a 2004 SuperCrew Ford F-150, which has four doors and an expansive passenger cab.
 While the classic work truck with seating for two dominated the market a decade ago, increasingly large and smooth-riding cabs have become the norm. When it comes to models like the Cadillac Escalade EXT or the new Lincoln Mark LT, due this spring, pickup trucks are just as luxurious as cars. 
 Mr. Hays, 37, has the upscale Lariat model of the F-150, in ''Oxford white with Arizona beige accents,'' he said. The truck has heated leather seats and a DVD player. Mr. Hays's last vehicle was an Isuzu Axiom S.U.V., which he said was troublesome when he tried to tow his 20-foot boat. Though he is not all that happy with the gasoline mileage of his Lariat, he said a smaller truck, like a Ford Ranger, was not on his shopping list. 
 ''They've gotten now to where if you're not around 250 horsepower in anything, you're weak,'' said Mr. Hays, who was contacted through a message board on the car research site Edmunds.com. As for space, he said, ''if you've got more than you need, you don't have to worry about having to trade in or purchase another vehicle in a few years.'' 
 Full-size pickup trucks rose to 14.8 percent of the nearly 17 million cars and trucks sold in the United States last year, from 14.1 percent a year earlier and 8.4 percent at the beginning of the 1990's, according to Ward's AutoInfoBank. By contrast, the market share of compact pickups has been cut in half over the last decade.
 Last year, middle- and large-size S.U.V.'s fell to 15.9 percent of the auto market, down from 16.5 percent a year earlier, according to Ward's, while smaller models continued to grow sharply. 
 The industry is debating how much of the slowdown in sales of larger S.U.V.'s has to do with gasoline prices, changing tastes of baby boomers as they age, or the appeal of more S.U.V.-like pickup trucks. But the most potent alternative has been in an influx of crossover vehicles -- sport utility vehicles designed to be more like cars, particularly from Asian brands. 
 Asian automakers are also behind some of the recent growth in pickups and are selling far more pickups and S.U.V.'s than hybrid electric vehicles. This year, Honda will sell its first pickup truck, the Ridgeline. Nissan started selling its first full-size pickup truck, the Titan, late in 2003, and Toyota is building a new plant in San Antonio to more than double output of its big Tundra pickup. 
 So how much of the market can the big pickup swallow? Mr. Pipas of Ford said demand for the giants might be close to its peak, adding, ''I don't think everybody's going to be like Texas.''

HEADLINE: San Francisco Opera Names a New Director

BYLINE: By DANIEL J. WAKIN

 BODY:
David Gockley will become general director of the San Francisco Opera after three decades of running the Houston Grand Opera, where he became known as a leading innovator and producer of new works for the American stage.
 The announcement came yesterday at a news conference in San Francisco, and it contained a twist. The house's current general director, Pamela Rosenberg, had been due to leave the job after next season, but officials said she would leave in December, six months early. She will stay on for a year after that as a paid artistic adviser. 
 Mr. Gockley, 61, and Ms. Rosenberg said it would help the transition.
 ''I was prepared to wait around and take over when she left,'' Mr. Gockley said. ''I think it's preferable to get going, especially in opera companies, when you know change is happening.''
 Ms. Rosenberg said, ''It's a way to help David really get into the role,'' she said. Ms. Rosenberg's tenure was troubled by labor problems and a financial crunch, and consternation by some operagoers over her experimental approach. But several productions, including Messiaen's ''St. Francois d'Assise'' and Gyorgy Ligeti's ''Grand Macabre,'' were highly praised by critics and relatively well attended for newer operas.
 Despite his many years of experience, Mr. Gockley will face major challenges in San Francisco. He will have to raise money. The endowment stands at about $45 million, less than a third of what is considered optimal for a company with its annual budget, $54 million. 
 He will have to figure out a way to get more operagoers past the transportation hurdles of the Bay area: long travel times and terrible traffic for peninsula dwellers in Palo Alto and San Jose, for example, and for people from Berkeley and Oakland in the East Bay area. 
 And he will have to deal with tough unions, one of which of recently sued the house. ''Unions are much stronger in San Francisco,'' Ms. Rosenberg said. ''Texas isn't really a union state.'' In a clear opening gesture of conciliation, Mr. Gockley said reaching out to the unions would be a top priority. ''I have got to chart a path they are willing to go along with,'' he said. ''There needs to be work and healing and getting a real sense of family engendered.''
 When Ms. Rosenberg arrived, she was quickly confronted with a financial crisis caused by the dot-com bust. She reduced the number of productions to 9 from 12, cut staff by 20 percent, slashed spending by 14 percent and balanced the budget this season after a deficit that at one point reached $7.6 million.
 At the Houston Grand Opera, which is celebrating its 50th-anniversary season, Mr. Gockley was credited with bringing in 33 world premieres. He also was an innovator, introducing supertitles (San Francisco uses them) and OperaVision -- screens that bring close-ups of the stage and orchestra to people in the upper reaches of the theater -- and outdoor simulcasts.
 He hopes to provide Internet streaming of performances in San Francisco, he said. (Ms. Rosenberg said that she held discussions with Apple about providing live audio performances through iTunes but that the house's labor contracts made doing so impossible.)
 ''His demonstrated abilities as an innovator in the many facets of opera make him the right choice,'' Franklin P. Johnson Jr., the chairman of the San Francisco Opera's board, said in a statement.
 Mr. Gockley's innovations in Houston could very well be in the cards for the San Francisco Opera, he said. 
 ''It's a great company,'' Mr. Gockley said from San Francisco yesterday. ''It can be greater. It needs somebody with my American experience, my managerial capabilities, my ability to communicate. I hope I'm the man of the hour.''
 He also said he would seek to build or find a more intimate stage for smaller-stage works. Mr. Gockley added he was partly attracted to San Francisco because the audience there ''has been going to opera longer and has a broader taste and has a passion, a depth of passion that Houston doesn't have.''
 Working in San Francisco, where the opera was incorporated in 1923, would give him the chance to do works that Houston might not be ready for, like operas by Wagner and Strauss and early Verdi pieces.
 He said he was still committed to putting on contemporary American operas. ''Will it be as frequent?,'' he asked. ''Maybe not quite as frequent, but darn close. It's clearly a particular passion of mine that is not going to go away.''
 Under Mr. Gockley, the Houston Grand Opera became known as a major shaper of the current state of the art form. First heard there were works like ''Nixon in China'' by John Adams and ''A Quiet Place'' by Leonard Bernstein. It did ''Salsipuedes,'' by Daniel Catan, last fall and is doing ''Lysistrata,'' by Mark Adamo, next month.
 San Francisco has another attraction in its music director, the respected Donald Runnicles, and a better orchestra. The Houston Grand Opera parted ways with the Houston Symphony five years ago and established a new orchestra made up of musicians shared with the ballet.
 San Francisco has a bigger season, too, including 9 productions and 80 performances, and its $54 million budget is more than twice Houston's. Houston runs seven productions with 55 main-stage performances. 
 Mr. Gockley's contract will run through the 2010-11 season. Productions are already planned through the 2006-7 season and part of the next. His imprint will be felt in 2007-8. Mr. Gockley said he had an agreement with the board not to disclose his salary. The most recent Internal Revenue Service filing by the Houston Grand Opera, for 2003, listed a salary of $267,000, about half of what Mr. Runnicles -- who will report to him -- was listed as earning that year. Ms. Rosenberg, documents show, made $364,000.,
 Mr. Gockley, when asked how his new salary compares with what he earned this year at Houston, he said it ''makes a nod'' toward the increased cost of living.

PERSON: ROBBIE DONNO

HEADLINE: A Penchant for Picking Up, and Saving Lives

BYLINE: By ANTHONY DePALMA

 BODY:
THERE may be slurs about Italian-Americans, garbage haulers and the mob that Robbie Donno has not heard, but he doubts it. Growing up in a family that ran one of the largest sanitation companies on Long Island, he was surrounded by trash cans, diesel fuel and the wary glances of those who knew him only as ''one of those garbage people.'' 
 Sometimes it got downright ugly, like the day a junior high school friend played a prank on the art teacher. As usual, Mr. Donno was blamed. ''What are you doing here anyway?'' the furious teacher demanded to know. ''You're never going to be anything but a gangster like your father.'' 
 That stung. He knew his father was a straight shooter, a Rotary Club member who had taught his children that it was important to care for others. 
 The slight, which he never forgot, made him sensitive to images and the way that perception can be more powerful than reality. It also helped propel Mr. Donno, now 58 and a father of two, into a life of quiet commitment to healing hearts around the world.
 Thirty years ago, Mr. Donno helped found Gift of Life, a program that helps children with heart problems get life-saving surgery. It arranges transportation from third-world countries to the United States. The surgeons, anesthesiologists and other medical staff perform the operation -- which can cost $50,000 or more -- free.
 The program, which started with the Manhasset Rotary, has spread to about 40 other chapters that solicit donors, line up volunteers and transport sick children. So far, it has given almost 6,000 children around the world a second chance. After serving as president, director or chairman of Gift of Life from 1975 to 2002, Mr. Donno recently helped found Gift of Life International, which coordinates efforts worldwide.
 Mr. Donno's path from hauling trash to saving lives began soon after he graduated from Duquesne University in 1971 with a degree in business administration and went to work at the Donno Company. 
 His father died unexpectedly three months later, and the Rotary Club in Manhasset asked Mr. Donno to take his father's place in the volunteer organization for business leaders. 
 ''At first there was nothing altruistic about it,'' Mr. Donno said during a recent interview at the Gift of Life office in Great Neck. ''I just saw it as a business association I should join.'' 
 In 1975, Mr. Donno, then 29, was elected president of the Manhasset Rotary. He learned from the Kampala Rotary in Uganda that a 5-year-old girl, Grace Agwaru, desperately needed help. Mr. Donno keeps her picture on the wall of the Great Neck office. 
 The Manhasset chapter brought Grace to Long Island, where surgeons at the Heart Center at St. Francis Hospital in Roslyn repaired a hole in her heart. Today, at 34, she is an agricultural economist in Uganda.
 Mr. Donno had no idea that helping Grace would lead to a 30-year commitment. ''We helped one child and thought that's all this is going to be,'' he said. ''Then we helped a second, and a third. And since then it's been a process of, 'How do you reach the next child?'''
 Even as he was getting more involved with Gift of Life, Mr. Donno remained active in the solid waste business. Over the years, his company has been involved in local disputes over noise and odors. But he has spoken out on issues like recycling. And though he is reluctant to talk about it, in the early 1990's Mr. Donno indirectly helped weaken the mob's control of the trash hauling industry in New York City. 
 William D. Ruckelshaus, a former deputy United States attorney general, was then chairman of Browning-Ferris Industries, a private company trying to break into New York. He was cooperating in an investigation run by Robert M. Morgenthau, the Manhattan district attorney. 
 Mr. Donno's company subcontracted with Browning-Ferris and handled its pickups in the city for a few months. He paid dearly for his part in crossing the mob. ''I lost four of my trucks and had one of my buildings in Suffolk County burned,'' he said. He did not regret doing his part to help the investigation. 
 Eventually, the Donno Company was bought by a national waste handling firm, leaving Mr. Donno with substantial assets and plenty of spare time. He keeps a hand in the waste industry as a principal of Lemcore, a New Jersey company that operates a transfer station in Linden. But he spends most of his time working with Gift of Life. 
 ON a recent Wednesday afternoon, that meant spending several hours at Kennedy International Airport awaiting the arrival of an ill 12-year-old boy named Asadullah who was being flown in from Kabul, Afghanistan, for a heart operation. When the jet arrived he had only a few minutes with the boy and his father before they boarded another jet for the last leg of the flight to a hospital in California. 
 ''I could tell by looking into the father's eyes that he couldn't believe that people from the other side of the world had reached out to help save his son,'' Mr. Donno said. 
 He didn't need a translator. The images told him all he needed to know. 
 ''I knew that he felt the same about his kids,'' he said, ''as I feel about mine.''

HEADLINE: S.E.C. Rebuffs Investors on Board Votes

BYLINE: By STEPHEN LABATON

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Feb. 7 

 BODY:
Signaling a retreat, the Securities and Exchange Commission told three large companies on Monday that they could rebuff requests by institutional shareholders seeking the opportunity to nominate a small number of rivals for board seats.
 The decision by the staff of the commission, which officials said was not opposed by the S.E.C. chairman, William H. Donaldson, was seen as an unambiguous sign that an earlier proposal to open the proxies, or votes, to greater shareholder participation was dead.
 The proposal had come under criticism from chief executives at many big companies, who have lobbied the Bush administration and Congress to press the commission to abandon it.
 An S.E.C. spokesman said that Mr. Donaldson was committed to changing the proxy rules even though he no longer supported the proposal put forward by the commission in 2003. 
 Mr. Donaldson, who has come under heavy pressure from the Bush administration and company executives opposed to the 2003 proposal, has neither put forward any new proposals nor announced a timetable for when he might issue any new rules on shareholder involvement in the selection of directors. Monday's decision was sharply attacked by one commissioner, Harvey J. Goldschmid, a Democrat, who had been among the strongest proponents of opening the proxies. Mr. Goldschmid has said he intends to step down from the commission by summer to return to a teaching post at Columbia University School of Law, which has concerned supporters and heartened critics of the proposal.
 ''By this change in position, the staff has taken a half step backwards at a time when the commission should be taking two steps forward,'' Mr. Goldschmid said. ''The commission's failure to finalize a proxy access proposal has protected a small number of weak, inefficient and grossly overpaid C.E.O.'s. Leaving such C.E.O.'s invulnerable to shareholder challenge hurts the American economy. Unfortunately, the worst instincts of the C.E.O. community have continued to triumph.''
 The move is another step in the steady, but slow, shift in the balance of power between executives and shareholders in the two and a half years since the passage of a landmark corporate law, the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, which responded to a spate of corporate scandals. 
 The law imposed a tough series of new accounting rules and other requirements on corporations, but has recently been criticized by some executives. With Republicans in control of the White House and both Houses of Congress, some business groups and conservative policy research organizations hope to roll back provisions of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, although no political consensus has emerged. Many lawmakers remain leery of taking such a step and are concerned about reaction if more corporate scandals emerge.
 The decision was announced in response to queries about proposals sought by major shareholders of Verizon, Qwest and Halliburton. The shareholders sought to use a footnote in the original proposal to open proxy contests in October 2003. The footnote said that while the agency was deliberating on final rules, shareholders could submit proxy proposals to nominate a competing slate of directors. 
 The three companies then asked the commission's staff for a ruling on whether they would face any enforcement proceeding if they rebuffed requests that had been made for shareholder access proposals. Those proposals were made by the American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees and a Qwest retiree association, as well as pension funds in Connecticut and New York.
 In his ruling, Alan L. Beller, director of the S.E.C.'s Corporation Finance Division, concluded that the footnote and by implication, the proposal, had become stale, and that the companies need not worry about being sued by the commission for rebuffing the investors.
 ''Given the passage of time since the proposal'' Mr. Beller wrote in virtually identical letters to the three companies, ''we will not recommend enforcement action to the commission'' if the companies omitted the shareholder proposals from their proxy materials. 
 Matthew C. Well, the commission's top spokesman, said that Mr. Donaldson remained committed to making changes to the proxy rules to give shareholders greater access. But he added that Mr. Donaldson also understood that ''both sides in the debate have legitimate concerns'' and said that Mr. Donaldson had no timetable for moving any proposals.

HEADLINE: Unease at the Ease of Private-Jet Flight

BYLINE: By Joe Sharkey

 BODY:
Five years ago, I managed to wangle a ride on a corporate jet with several empty seats from Phoenix to New York. In the car on the way to the airport, I asked my host the following dumb question: ''What time does the plane leave?''
 He regarded me with puzzlement and replied, amiably, ''When we get there, of course.''
 The epiphany occurred. Here was the real virtue of a business jet. We drove practically up to the plane and boarded within 10 minutes, without any of the usual airport frustration. In flight, eight passengers had the space to work at laptops, or spread out and read. 
 Four hours later, we landed at Teterboro Airport in New Jersey, near New York. Our regular airport car service met us practically at the plane and whisked us home.
 Don't get me wrong. I am well aware that the increasing use -- and growing size -- of business jets is not at all a cause for celebration among those who live near the noncommercial airports where most business jets operate. 
 Last week, for example, a Challenger 600 jet operating as a charter flight with 11 people aboard skidded off a runway during takeoff at Teterboro, crashed through an airport fence and careered across a busy highway, clipping a car, before plowing into a warehouse. No one was killed, but more than 20 people, including two car passengers and several firefighters, were injured. 
 The incident further aroused the anger of nearby residents, who have been complaining for years about increased business-jet traffic at Teterboro. 
 Across the country, meanwhile, at the airport in Van Nuys, in the San Fernando Valley of California, the numbers show just how strongly demand is growing for charter flights, as opposed to flights operated by a business for its own employees. Last year, there were 16,016 takeoffs and landings of charters at Van Nuys Airport -- a 15 percent increase over 2003.
 After a three-year slump, business jet demand is up. ''Most of the major manufacturers saw an upswing in both orders and deliveries in the second half of 2004,'' said R. Randall Padfield, the editor in chief of the publications Aviation International News and Business Jet Traveler. 
 By the way, my trip from Arizona was the first and last time I've ridden a corporate jet for actual transportation to a place I wanted to go. But in the interim, I've attended a lot of aviation trade shows, including the annual convention of the National Business Aviation Association, where acres of corporate jets are on display, and short rides to show off the planes are readily available. 
 So I've been on demonstration rides on a good number of business jets, from the snappy little seven-seat Citation Bravo to the luxurious heavy-metal Gulfstream IV, and right up to the luxury liners of the corporate jet world, the 737-sized Boeing Business Jet and its competitor, the Airbus Corporate Jetliner. These are $50 million planes with amenities like paneled conference rooms, bathrooms with full-size showers and a bedroom in back with a queen-size bed.
 Let's just say that I get it. I understand the allure of the corporate jet, even as I plan my next business trip this week on a cheap coach seat to Houston. That gets me a spot on an actual 737, crammed with 94 coach seats, each offering 31 knee-buckling inches of legroom. And I'm lucky that it's a 737 and not one of those even more cramped regional jets.
 No wonder, then, with an economy percolating away on top, and with the commercial-air experience deteriorating by the week, we're witnessing a surge in business aviation in all of its forms, from direct ownership to fractional shares to ''jet cards'' for purchasing a specified number of flight hours, to the sharply increasing popularity of charters.
 In October, Honeywell Aerospace's annual Business Aviation Projection found that fractional-ownership programs were supporting steady growth in demand for long-range and other large jets, while deliveries of medium and medium-large jets, spurred by introductions of new models, are expected to ''grow rapidly'' in the next decade.
 Last week, Raytheon Aircraft, whose products include the Hawker line of business jets, said fourth-quarter sales were up 19 percent and aircraft deliveries rose to 117 from 100 in the 2003 quarter. And next week, the General Aircraft Manufacturers Association is expected to announce numbers showing the growing demand in orders.
 We'll explore more of the implications of that in future columns. It's abundantly clear that business aviation, including the nascent but definitely viable industry of cheap light jets that will one day be operated in fleets of short-haul, on-demand air taxis, is a growing component of our national air-transport system.
 But a word of caution is appropriate, and it comes from a recent e-mail message from Howard Gardner, a professor at the Harvard Graduate School of Education. ''The more people of means avoid commercial airlines,'' he wrote, the less likely it is that the mess in commercial air travel will be adequately addressed. 
 Drawing an analogy between frustration-filled commercial flying and the crumbling state of public education in many parts of the country, he added: ''Nowadays, public schools are increasingly used just by those who can't afford the alternative and, as a result, there is less motivation to fix the system.''

HEADLINE: New Yorkers Are Spending More as Cost of Necessities Rises

BYLINE: By JENNIFER STEINHAUER

 BODY:
A red-hot real estate market, high-priced orange juice and a ceaseless array of fare increases have combined to make it harder for New Yorkers to make ends meet than at any time in a decade, according to new federal statistics. 
 Facing prices on necessities that are growing faster than almost anywhere else, many New Yorkers have stopped buying books, hand creams and other discretionary treats, and have sharply decreased their charitable giving in the last few years. A New York family gave nearly 30 percent less to charity on average in 2003 than in 2000, the statistics show.
 Between 2000 and 2003, according to figures released on Monday by the Bureau of Labor Statistics, spending among New Yorkers rose 4.3 percent, while price inflation went up by 5.5 percent. That is the opposite pattern from most of the rest of the country, where spending went up faster than inflation. 
 Economists say that when inflation goes up faster than spending, it indicates that consumers find it difficult to keep up with rising prices.
 ''Expenditures went up less than inflation because New Yorkers allocated a large percentage of those expenditures on necessities,'' said Michael L. Dolfman, regional commissioner in the bureau. ''Basically, New York is getting too expensive.''
 It is the first time that imbalance has occurred in the region in about a decade, reflecting both the national recession that hit New York harder than the rest of the nation, and New York's endless ability to outprice other cities for basic necessities. 
 Among the cities the department looked at, Los Angeles had the biggest increase in inflation -- 5.8 percent -- but spending in that city rose 10 percent, reflecting the classic economic theory that spending usually drives inflation. ''What makes New York interesting is that it didn't happen that way there,'' Mr. Dolfman said.
 In nearly every category, people in the New York region spent more of their household dollar on essentials than other Americans between 2000 and 2003. Rental prices in the region rose 8.1 percent, while nationally, they went up 4.1 percent.
 Food prices rose 9.3 percent in the New York region; nationally they increased 2.7 percent. 
 What residents gave up were the extras. Spending on clothing fell by 12 percent, and there were also cutbacks in buying meat, poultry, eggs, and tobacco. In 2000, New Yorkers gave $1,353 per family to charity, but by 2003 that amount had fallen to $949. 
 Some economists were less than impressed with the new data, stressing that it was hard to draw broad conclusions about the rising costs of life in New York based on a few years of data during difficult times. Jason Bram, a regional economist with the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, noted that spending in the region may have declined in 2002 and 2003 because of the terror attacks and the ensuing economic slowdown.
 But the slowdown did not prevent prices from escalating. In 2004, the inflation rate rose 3.3 percent nationally over the prior year, while in the New York region, it went up 3.8 percent. 
 And since December 2003, the price for food in grocery stores in the New York metropolitan region rose 5.5 percent compared with 2.5 percent nationally. Total food costs, which includes restaurant meals, rose only 2.7 percent nationally but went up 4.4 percent in New York. 
 ''If prices continue to go up faster than what we are seeing now,'' Mr. Dolfman said, ''then what we are seeing is not unique happenstance but could be the beginning of a new trend.''
 New Yorkers who have shopped elsewhere already know they pay more than the rest of the country for many basic goods, even in national chains that clearly benefit from economies of scale when they buy their goods.
 At the Target store in Brooklyn, for instance, a 200-ounce container of Tide laundry detergent was $14.89, which was 27 percent higher than the same bottle at a Target Store in Houston, and 16 percent higher than in Target stores in Chicago. 
 ''Select items at an individual Target store can be impacted by prices on identical items at other nearby retailers,'' said Paula Thornton-Greear, a spokeswoman for Target, in an e-mail message. ''Therefore, it is commonplace that prices on selected items may vary from Target store to Target store within one metro area and that prices on selected items may vary in different states.''
 She said Target's pricing strategy is based solely on being competitive in a specific market area, rather than demographics.

HEADLINE: World Business Briefing Europe: The Netherlands: Bank Posts 33% Profit Rise

BYLINE: AP

 BODY:
ABN Amro, the Netherlands' largest retail bank, said that fourth-quarter net profit rose 33 percent because of asset sales, fewer bad loans and lower taxes. Net profit was 1.14 billion euros ($1.47 billion), up from 857 million euros a year ago. Sales were 5.53 billion euros ($7.11 billion), up from 4.86 billion euros, mostly because of the sale of its car-leasing subsidiary LeasePlan for an undisclosed sum. Operating profit fell 12 percent, to 1.34 billion euros ($1.72 billion). ABN cited ''low economic growth in Europe, in particular in the Netherlands, and a greater-than-expected downturn of the mortgage market in the United States.''

Bush Proposes Budget With Domestic Cuts
President Bush proposed a budget that would scale back or eliminate scores of agriculture, education, health, environmental and other domestic programs to help him meet his goal of slashing the budget deficit while providing more money for national security.
 Mr. Bush and his aides portrayed the plan as an effort to prune ineffective and duplicative programs while providing added support to priorities like keeping the nation safe from terrorism, keeping the economy healthy, improving high school education and building health clinics in poor areas.

HEADLINE: Mr. President, Let's Share the Wealth

BYLINE: By DAVID BROOKS. 
E-mail: dabrooks@nytimes.com

 BODY:
President Bush said he was open to other people's ideas on how to fix Social Security, so I hope he'll listen to mine.
 My idea starts with a blunt political observation. Personal accounts -- as they are currently envisioned -- are going to be hard to pass. Every important Democrat opposes them. Jim McCrery, the Republican who is chairman of the House Social Security subcommittee, says the president's plan will have to fundamentally change if it is to have a chance. 
 So my idea is this: If the president's current version of personal accounts stalls, he should consider another version -- one that is more likely to win broad support, and that achieves all the goals of an ''ownership society.''
 The personal accounts I'm thinking of would be inspired by a proposal called KidSave, which was floating around in the late 1990's. KidSave was championed by Bob Kerrey when he was a Democratic senator from Nebraska, but in its different iterations it attracted support from a range of Democrats (Lieberman, Moynihan and Breaux) and Republicans (Gregg, Grassley and Santorum).
 Under one version of KidSave, the government would open tax-deferred savings accounts for each American child, making a $1,000 deposit at birth, and $500 deposits in each of the next five years. That money could be invested in a limited number of mutual funds, but it couldn't be withdrawn until retirement.
 Over decades, it would grow and grow, thanks to the wonders of compound interest, so that by the time workers retired, they would each have a substantial nest egg, over $100,000, waiting for them. 
 The KidSave idea was an early venture in what has become a broad intellectual movement that goes by an infelicitous name: asset-based welfare.
 The idea behind asset-based welfare is that we are living in the midst of a social revolution. It used to be that only the rich owned financial assets like stocks. But over the last 20 years, the number of American households with money invested in the stock market has more than tripled.
 But people in the bottom half of the income scale don't get to join in to take advantage of compound interest. They don't get a share of the growing national economy. They don't get the psychological benefits of ownership. 
 All around the world, diverse writers are trying to spread the benefits of asset ownership. The Peruvian economist Hernando de Soto would like to help squatters get legal ownership of the homes they've built. In Britain, Tony Blair has created accounts like the ones proposed in KidSave. In this country, there are proposals for education and training accounts.
 The idea is that just as the Homestead Act turned people into pioneers, we would turn more people into capitalists if we distributed capital more broadly. We would encourage savings. We would increase social mobility, ameliorate the wealth gap between rich and poor, and give people more control over their own lives.
 The Social Security problem is a chance to enact this kind of thing on a decisive scale, with the KidSave proposal serving as a framework for a new vision of personal accounts.
 We could start by indexing Social Security benefits to prices, not wages, so the system wouldn't go broke. Then we could give everybody under a certain age KidSave accounts. This money could either supplement the reduced Social Security benefits, or individuals could divert some of their payroll taxes into their KidSave accounts, trading guaranteed benefits for more ownership. 
 We'd have to take care of today's 20-somethings, who are already too old to benefit from the new accounts, but this proposal would lead to less red ink than the president's current plan. And let me commit an act of heresy: it would be smart for Republicans to forgo making the Bush tax cuts permanent in exchange for these kinds of accounts. The Bush cuts are going to be repealed by the next Democratic president anyway, but these accounts, once created, would be forever.
 They would be the first step in a broader ownership agenda. They would pave the way for education accounts and expanded medical savings accounts. They might pave the way for other asset-based programs designed to give young people a better start in life, not just secure their retirement. They would cut across left-right polarities and prove an irresistible political force. 
 Even in this age of political deadlock, I can't believe that too many would be against a plan to give savings accounts to poor kids.

HEADLINE: Some Aid Is Cut to Pay for Increases Elsewhere

BYLINE: By ELIZABETH BECKER and DAVID E. SANGER

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Feb. 7 

 BODY:
President Bush is asking Congress to double the financing for his signature foreign aid program, which rewards nations that open their economies and spend heavily on education, but his request is still short of his original promise to the world's poorest nations.
 Moreover, the spending increase for the program, called the Millennium Challenge Account, is being partly offset by cuts in other foreign aid programs, including those dealing with childhood diseases, food aid and long-term development assistance.
 Foreign aid has been viewed in Washington and around the world as a measure of Mr. Bush's commitment to showing another side to American power in a time of war. Total foreign aid in the budget rises nearly 14 percent, to $18.4 billion in 2006 from $16.2 billion this year. 
 The Millennium Challenge Account in particular has been a favorite project of the new secretary of state, Condoleezza Rice. The president's request for $3 billion in 2006 fell short of the $5 billion originally pledged when the program was established. Congress cut back the administration's request for the program this year to $1.5 billion.
 The administration is seeking $350 million in aid to the Palestinian Authority this year and next, the first significant investment Mr. Bush has made in bolstering the new government of President Mahmoud Abbas. On Monday, he invited Mr. Abbas to Washington this spring. 
 In an era of tightening budgets, where most fiscal growth has been in military and security spending, some experts were surprised that Mr. Bush asked for a substantial increase in foreign aid.
 ''I think it is pretty remarkable,'' said Carol Lancaster, a professor at Georgetown University and deputy administrator of the Agency for International Development under President Bill Clinton.
 The cuts include $345 million from development assistance programs, reducing them to $1.1 billion from roughly $1.45 billion, and $288 million in food assistance to underwrite long-term development, cutting that program to $885 million from about $1.17 billion. Some of that money is to be transferred to disaster relief and programs for weak and fragile states, a spokeswoman at the Agency for International Development said.
 For charities like Catholic Relief Services, the cut in development food aid was a shock. According to Sean Callahan, the organization's vice president for overseas operations, the administration cut its contributions last year to these programs but said it was a temporary problem that the new budget would address.
 ''This cut in food aid puts the majority of our programs at risk,'' Mr. Callahan said.
 Ellen Levinson, the head of the Food Aid Coalition, questioned why food aid for disaster relief had to be taken from food aid for development. ''I agree that more should be made available for disasters,'' she said, ''but you don't do it by cutting money for people who are chronically hungry.''

HEADLINE: French Struggle Now With How to Coexist With Bush

BYLINE: By ELAINE SCIOLINO

DATELINE: PARIS, Feb. 7 

 BODY:
Ask the French foreign minister, Michel Barnier, about France and the United States, and he replies that the anger and distrust that tarnished the relationship for the last three years are history.
 No matter that 18 months ago, when she was national security adviser, Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice was widely quoted as having said the way to deal with the three main opponents of the American-led Iraq war was: ''Forgive Russia. Ignore Germany. Punish France.''
 The French have to coexist with President Bush for four more years, Ms. Rice is now America's top diplomat, and American-organized elections have taken place in Iraq. So for France, a new era of political realism is beginning, starting with Ms. Rice's visit to Paris on Tuesday and Defense Secretary Donald H. Rumsfeld's arrival in Nice the next day for a NATO defense ministers' meeting. 
 ''The situation has changed,'' Mr. Barnier said in a recent interview over lunch at the Foreign Ministry, adding that Ms. Rice's instruction to punish France has been forgiven.
 ''The phrase was uttered in other circumstances,'' he said. ''What's important now is neither to punish nor to give lessons. My line is to look ahead. I am someone who is very practical.''
 With practicality in mind, President Jacques Chirac, a lifelong politician and political survivor, sent Mr. Bush a handwritten ''Cher George'' letter congratulating him on his re-election. The French leader gave a speech expressing hope that 2005 will be a year of ''trust'' with Mr. Bush and congratulated him again after the elections in Iraq.
 Mr. Chirac is helped in his reality offensive by Mr. Barnier. A low-key expert on European integration, the foreign minister lacks the domineering personality and romantic vision of France's greatness of his predecessor, Dominique de Villepin, which so infuriated State Colin L. Powell when he was secretary of state.
 ''I want to get to know Condi Rice, to establish a personal relationship with her,'' said Mr. Barnier, who has already been to Washington to meet her since Mr. Bush's re-election and pledges to visit the United States every three months.
 He underscored that he is ''different'' from Mr. de Villepin, the man who emerged as the most vocal and relentless critic of the Bush administration's march to war against Iraq. Still, Mr. Barnier characterized his predecessor as ''a friend'' who is ''passionate,'' not ''arrogant.''
 But even as Mr. Chirac and his ministers adjust to the reality of a second Bush term, they hold fast to a belief that Mr. Bush and his team still have a lot to learn from France about running the world.
 In a meeting a week ago at Elysee Palace with five American senators, for instance, Mr. Chirac repeated his conviction that a ''multipolar world'' with multiple centers of power is not a desire or an aspiration but ''a fact,'' three participants said.
 That description of the world enrages Mr. Bush and Ms. Rice because it seems to envision a power that competes with American interests and influence, even though Mr. Chirac also says the best way to make the multipolar world as stable as possible is by strengthening the trans-Atlantic relationship.
 ''He still doesn't like the idea of the unipolar world with the United States as top dog,'' Senator Joseph R. Biden Jr., a Delaware Democrat, said in an interview after the meeting.
 The senators came away from the meeting with Mr. Chirac and a meeting with Mr. de Villepin, who is now interior minister but still weighs in on foreign policy, convinced that France has not yet accepted that some of its dire predictions on Iraq may turn out to be wrong.
 Both men have argued fiercely that the American-led invasion and occupation of Iraq has made the region much more dangerous. Now there is an effort to calibrate French policy while still asserting France's historic influence in the Middle East.
 Mr. Chirac made clear to the senators that France had supported the American-led debt relief proposal for Iraq and had formally proposed to Iraq that it would train 1,500 Iraqi policemen, but outside Iraq.
 On the other hand, he seemed taken aback by the high voter turnout in the election, criticized the Bush administration for disbanding the Iraqi Army and reaffirmed that French soldiers would not set foot in Iraq.
 ''My read of Chirac, as a plain old politician, is that he was saying, 'O. K., you did better than we thought you'd do,''' Mr. Biden said. ''I think he was saying: 'I'm not ready to step in and do the heavy lifting with boots on the ground. But you might make it, so I want to get in on the deal.' He's calculating he wants to keep one foot on the platform and one foot on the train because the train might leave.''
 Mr. Chirac also seems to be struggling to explain his policy on Iran. France, together with Britain and Germany and with European Union support, began a negotiating process to persuade Iran to abandon its uranium enrichment activities in exchange for economic and political rewards.
 Mr. Chirac told the American senators that if Iran did not comply with demands made by the International Atomic Energy Agency, France would support the Bush administration's demand to refer the case to the United Nations Security Council, where, if the United States has its way, Iran could face possible censure or even sanctions.
 But Mr. Chirac made it clear, they said, that sanctions never worked and that he was opposed to them. He also suggested that Iran's Islamic Republic could not be trusted.
 ''Chirac told us he believes you can deal with the Sunnis but not with the Shiites,'' one participant in the meeting paraphrased him as saying. Iran's population is overwhelmingly Shiite Muslim.
 Elysee Palace declined to comment on the conversation.
 The French are also convinced that the only way for what Mr. Barnier calls ''a new relationship'' with Washington to begin is if the Bush administration understands the urgency of making peace between Israel and the Palestinians.
 For France, with its large Arab, Muslim and Jewish populations, the Israeli-Palestinian crisis is not a far-away conflict but one that has struck the heart of Europe and is fought on a daily basis in its streets. Throughout France's diplomatic crisis with the United States over Iraq, Mr. Chirac and other French officials expressed the view that for France, the Palestinian crisis was much more important than the overthrow of Saddam Hussein.
 Terrorist groups are moving throughout Europe and elsewhere, and the Israeli-Palestinian conflict is one of the essential origins of terrorism in the world, one of the participants in the meeting with the senators paraphrased Mr. Chirac as saying. Mr. Chirac was said to have added that when militants are asked about their motivation, ''they always come back to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict as one of the main drivers.''
 One of the main obstacles to improving the relationship between the Bush administration and the French has been chemistry. Mr. Chirac truly believes that his decades of experience in global politics have made him an expert on just about any place in the world.
 At one point in the meeting with the senators, he said he would love to have some private time with Mr. Bush, without any aides present, when the two men dine together in Brussels as part of Mr. Bush's trip to Europe later this month.
 ''Several of us said that would be a great idea, to try to start over again,'' Senator Patrick J. Leahy, a Vermont Democrat, said in an interview after the meeting.
 But another participant said perhaps that was not such a good idea, noting that in some of their previous meetings, Mr. Chirac has pointed his finger at Mr. Bush and lectured him on what he does not know.

HEADLINE: Spearing The Beast

BYLINE: By PAUL KRUGMAN. 
E-mail: krugman@nytimes.com

 BODY:
President Bush isn't trying to reform Social Security. He isn't even trying to ''partially privatize'' it. His plan is, in essence, to dismantle the program, replacing it with a system that may be social but doesn't provide security. And the goal, as with his tax cuts, is to undermine the legacy of Franklin Roosevelt.
 Why do I say that the Bush plan would dismantle Social Security? Because for Americans who entered the work force after the plan went into effect and who chose to open private accounts, guaranteed benefits -- income you receive after retirement even if everything else goes wrong -- would be nearly eliminated. 
 Here's how it would work. First, workers with private accounts would be subject to a ''clawback'': in effect, they would have to mortgage their future benefits in order to put money into their accounts. 
 Second, since private accounts would do nothing to improve Social Security's finances -- something the administration has finally admitted -- there would be large benefit cuts in addition to the clawback. 
 Jason Furman of the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities estimates that the guaranteed benefits left to an average worker born in 1990, after the clawback and the additional cuts, would be only 8 percent of that worker's prior earnings, compared with 35 percent today. This means that under Mr. Bush's plan, workers with private accounts that fared poorly would find themselves destitute.
 Why expose workers to that much risk? Ideology. ''Social Security is the soft underbelly of the welfare state,'' declares Stephen Moore of the Club for Growth and the Cato Institute. ''If you can jab your spear through that, you can undermine the whole welfare state.'' 
 By the welfare state, Mr. Moore means Social Security, Medicare and Medicaid -- social insurance programs whose purpose, above all, is to protect Americans against the extreme economic insecurity that prevailed before the New Deal. The hard right has never forgiven F.D.R. (and later L.B.J.) for his efforts to reduce that insecurity, and now that the right is running Washington, it's trying to turn the clock back to 1932.
 Medicaid is also in the cross hairs. And if Mr. Bush can take down Social Security, Medicare will be next. 
 The attempt to ''jab a spear'' through Social Security complements the strategy of ''starve the beast,'' long advocated by right-wing intellectuals: cut taxes, then use the resulting deficits as an excuse for cuts in social spending. The spearing doesn't seem to be going too well at the moment, but the starving was on full display in the budget released yesterday.
 To put that budget into perspective, let's look at the causes of the federal budget deficit. In spite of the expense of the Iraq war, federal spending as a share of G.D.P. isn't high by historical standards -- in fact, it's slightly below its average over the past 20 years. But federal revenue as a share of G.D.P. has plunged to levels not seen since the 1950's.
 Almost all of this plunge came from a sharp decline in receipts from the personal income tax and the corporate profits tax. These are the taxes that fall primarily on people with high incomes -- and in 2003 and 2004, their combined take as a share of G.D.P. was at its lowest level since 1942. On the other hand, the payroll tax, which is the main federal tax paid by middle-class and working-class Americans, remains at near-record levels.
 You might think, given these facts, that a plan to reduce the deficit would include major efforts to increase revenue, starting with a rollback of recent huge tax cuts for the wealthy. In fact, the budget contains new upper-income tax breaks. 
 Any deficit reduction will come from spending cuts. Many of those cuts won't make it through Congress, but Mr. Bush may well succeed in imposing cuts in child care assistance and food stamps for low-income workers. He may also succeed in severely squeezing Medicaid -- the only one of the three great social insurance programs specifically intended for the poor and near-poor, and therefore the most politically vulnerable. 
 All of this explains why it's foolish to imagine some sort of widely acceptable compromise with Mr. Bush about Social Security. Moderates and liberals want to preserve the America F.D.R. built. Mr. Bush and the ideological movement he leads, although they may use F.D.R.'s image in ads, want to destroy it.

HEADLINE: Rail Connection to Kennedy Is Given $2 Billion in Budget

BYLINE: By RAYMOND HERNANDEZ and SEWELL CHAN

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Feb. 7 

 BODY:
In the budget plan he issued Monday, President Bush proposed using $2 billion in Sept. 11 aid to build a $6 billion rail link connecting the World Trade Center site to the Long Island Rail Road and Kennedy International Airport.
 The action by Mr. Bush is a reaffirmation of the support he threw behind the idea last summer, largely at the urging of Gov. George E. Pataki, a fellow Republican, who has made a direct rail link from Lower Manhattan to the airport a priority. 
 The issue now moves to Congress, where last fall Republican leaders in the House blocked the use of the Sept. 11 aid for the project, even as the Senate moved to approve the financing.
 It is unclear how much political capital Mr. Bush would be willing to spend to get the package approved in Congress, particularly since he already has several far-reaching and contentious proposals for which he wants Congressional approval, including an overhaul of Social Security and changes to the federal tax code.
 Nevertheless, city and state officials applauded the president's placing the rail-link project in his proposed budget, saying it was a strong indication of his desire to get it financed this year.
 ''The president's support means that we are one step closer to making a Lower Manhattan rail link a reality,'' said Lynn Rasic, a spokeswoman for Mr. Pataki. ''With the president's backing, we hope that Congress's support will soon follow because this project is so critical to the growth of Lower Manhattan and New York City.''
 The reaction from City Hall was similar. ''Obviously we have a ways to go here,'' said Daniel L. Doctoroff, the deputy mayor for economic development. ''But it is a very, very positive step.''
 Senator Charles E. Schumer, a Democrat from New York, said that the rail link was one of the few bright spots in a proposed budget that he says failed to provide enough money for an array of programs important to the New York region, including education, health care, housing and law enforcement.
 He noted that the money for the rail project would come from unused portions of a multibillion-dollar tax-incentive package that Washington allocated in 2001 to help spur redevelopment of Lower Manhattan after the Sept. 11 attack.
 ''The rail link is one of the few areas in this budget that looks good for New York,'' Mr. Schumer said in an interview Monday afternoon. ''That's because it's seen as old dollars being recycled, as opposed to new dollars.''
 In July, Mr. Pataki made an unusually direct appeal to President Bush asking him to provide cash for the rail project by tapping the unused money from the so-called Liberty Zone tax-incentive package for Lower Manhattan.
 Planners estimate that the rail link project could be completed by 2013. It would allow travelers heading to Manhattan from Kennedy Airport to travel aboard new trains on existing AirTrain tracks that loop around the central terminal area and then run along a viaduct in the middle of the Van Wyck Expressway to Jamaica, Queens.
 There, a new 1,500-foot elevated connector would carry the trains from the AirTrain tracks to the Long Island Rail Road tracks heading toward Brooklyn. Near the Atlantic Terminal in Brooklyn, the trains would enter a new three-mile tunnel and travel beneath the East River into Lower Manhattan. An underground station would serve both the tunnel and the Atlantic Terminal.
 The tunnel would allow access to Hanover Square, the intended terminus of the prospective Second Avenue subway, and the World Trade Center station, the existing terminus of the E train.
 The Metropolitan Transportation Authority has proposed spending $400 million to study the project's environmental impact as part of its new five-year capital program, which has not yet been approved by Albany. The Port Authority of New York and New Jersey, which operates the region's three airports, has committed $560 million to the project.

HEADLINE: PRESIDENT OFFERS BUDGET PROPOSAL WITH BROAD CUTS

BYLINE: By RICHARD W. STEVENSON

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Feb. 7 

 BODY:
President Bush proposed a budget on Monday that would scale back or eliminate scores of agriculture, education, health, environmental and other domestic programs to help him meet his goal of slashing the budget deficit while providing more money for national security.
 Mr. Bush and his aides portrayed the plan as an effort to prune ineffective and duplicative programs while providing more support to priorities like keeping the nation safe from terrorism, keeping the economy healthy, improving high school education and building health clinics in poor areas. 
 The budget responded to mounting calls from conservatives for Mr. Bush to take a harder line against the expansion of government, and it laid out a path for meeting his target of cutting the deficit in half by 2009 without giving an inch on his demand to make permanent the tax cuts he pushed through Congress in his first term. 
 ''It's a budget that reduces and eliminates redundancy,'' Mr. Bush said after meeting with his cabinet at the White House to discuss his plan for $2.57 trillion in government outlays for the fiscal year starting on Oct. 1. ''We've had a history of being successful in terms of passing good, strong budgets, and so I'm very optimistic that we can do so again this year.''
 Although it was welcomed by many Republicans on Capitol Hill as the first ambitious effort to check the growth of government since right after the Republican takeover of the House in 1994, other members of Mr. Bush's party were clearly leery of some specific proposals, especially the call for substantial reductions in aid to farmers. 
 Democrats denounced the budget as wrongheaded in its priorities and said it masked the fiscal effects of the administration's policies. Noting that the administration's budget made no allowance beyond this year for the costs of the military campaigns in Iraq and Afghanistan and left out entirely the costs of Mr. Bush's proposal for overhauling Social Security, they said his proposals were not credible. 
 ''This budget takes cops off the street, hurts veterans and punishes schoolchildren while saddling future generations with record budget deficits and mountains of debt,'' said Senator John Kerry of Massachusetts. ''There's nothing fiscally responsible here.''
 If enacted, Mr. Bush's plan would slow the growth of overall government spending to 3.6 percent next year, from 8.2 percent this year. It would result in broad, money-saving changes in programs as varied as the government insurance plan for pensions, low-income housing assistance and student loans. And it would lead to the first reduction since the Reagan administration in programs not related to the military that Congress revisits each year, like local law enforcement projects, the national park system and preschool literacy projects. 
 Spending on that category -- in budgetary language, nondefense, nondomestic-security discretionary spending -- would be trimmed by almost $3 billion, or about seven-tenths of 1 percent, for the year starting Oct. 1, to $389 billion from $392 billion. It would then be frozen at $389 billion for four years, effectively imposing a further cut each year after taking account of inflation.
 The proposal also calls for substantial reductions in programs like Medicaid and food stamps where spending levels are largely determined by eligibility criteria.
 Reflecting Mr. Bush's focus on fighting terrorism at home and abroad, the Pentagon's budget would increase 4.75 percent next year, to $419 billion from $400 billion, and spending on domestic security would rise 3.2 percent, to $32.2 billion from $31.2 billion. Both the military and domestic security programs would also get steady increases through the rest of the decade.
 The budget included $81 billion for the request Mr. Bush is expected to send Congress next week to pay for military operations in Iraq and Afghanistan in the 2005 fiscal year. But it included no money specifically to pay war costs in those nations next year or in following years. Administration officials said it was impossible to know how much might be needed.
 Even as his plan took a knife to many spending programs in the name of fiscal responsibility, it left room to make permanent the tax cuts of Mr. Bush's first term, at a cost of $53 billion in the next five years and $1.1 trillion through 2015. The costs are heavily concentrated after 2010 partly because some of the tax cuts, like the repeal of the estate tax, are being phased in gradually until then, holding down the revenue loss in the next five years.
 The new budget proposal also called for new tax cuts worth $23 billion in the next five years and $117 billion through 2015.
 After running up the national debt in the last few years, the United States is coming under pressure from other nations, as well as the financial markets, to start improving its fiscal condition, and Mr. Bush's budget sought to show progress by mapping a path to a substantially reduced budget deficit. It showed a deficit in 2009 of $233 billion, compared with $412 billion last year.
 But little if any progress would come in the first year or two. The budget shows the deficit climbing this year to $427 billion, including the $81 billion in new money for military operations and reconstruction in Iraq and Afghanistan, then declining next year to $390 billion. But the estimate for next year does not include any money for a continued American presence in Iraq and Afghanistan, assuring that the actual deficit -- assuming that the administration's economic assumptions are correct -- will be higher than that projection.
 The budget's figures for later years also understate the likely size of the deficit by not including the borrowing that, by the administration's own figures, would be needed to establish the private investment accounts that Mr. Bush has proposed for Social Security starting in 2009. Administration officials said the private accounts plan would add $23 billion to the deficit in 2009 and $56.5 billion to it in 2010, and would require higher levels of borrowing in subsequent years. The proposed spending cuts would range across the government, and include reductions that the administration has previously tried and failed to wring from Congress as well as new ones.
 The Justice Department would cut two programs to help localities hire more police officers, saving $635 million. The Energy Department would eliminate its oil and gas research and development programs, which this year received $83 million. 
 The Education Department would end 48 programs, including one that will provide $441 million in grants this year to states to promote drug-free schools and another that will spend $33 million this year on reducing alcohol abuse among students. The Environmental Protection Agency would cut by $500 million its program to help poor communities build wastewater treatment plants and other water projects. 
 The cuts would be offset to some extent by increased spending on programs Mr. Bush supports. NASA would get an added $400 million, or 2.4 percent, bringing its budget to $16.5 billion as it focuses on the administration's long-term goal of a manned mission to Mars. The budget also called for $3.2 billion to fight AIDS around the world, a rise of $382 million over this year but less than what the administration had originally signaled it would provide. The Department of Health and Human Services would get $304 million more for its program to build health clinics in poor neighborhoods, bringing the total for next year to $2 billion.
 After leading the nation through a military buildup and the creation of the Homeland Security Department after the Sept. 11 attacks, Mr. Bush has been labeled a ''big-government conservative'' -- admiringly by some Republicans, derisively by others who have grown frustrated by what they see as their inability to make good on their claim to be the party of limited government.
 This latest budget moves Mr. Bush in the direction of those conservatives most determined to scale back the federal government. And it creates a situation that many Democrats have feared: The combination of tax cuts and military spending increases has taken so much money off the table that they must choose between voting to cut programs they support or enduring Republican attacks on their fiscal responsibility.
 But pork-barrel spending and regional interests know few ideological boundaries, and Congress, even under Republican control, has been resistant to broad or deep budget cuts. Mr. Bush, who does not face re-election again, can more easily support them than can senators and representatives who do. 
 Still, there are factors working in the White House's favor. The Republican leadership on Capitol Hill has tightened its control over the appropriations process by installing committee and subcommittee chairmen who are more inclined to support leaner budgets than were their predecessors. November's elections also expanded Republican majorities in both the House and the Senate.
 ''Every individual member will be disappointed about something in this budget, I am sure,'' said Joshua B. Bolten, the director of the White House's Office of Management and Budget. ''Over all, I think they understand in the aggregate the need to restrain the federal government spending appetite, and I'm hopeful we're going to get some good support.''

 CORRECTION:
A front-page article on Tuesday about President Bush's proposed 2006 budget referred incorrectly to the $3.2 billion that was included to fight AIDS around the world next year. The amount - an increase of $382 million over this year -- was in line with the White House's initial pledge for AIDS; it was not less.

HEADLINE: An Effort to Show Conservatives and Foreign Investors a Tough Deficit Stance

BYLINE: By ELISABETH BUMILLER

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Feb. 7 

 BODY:
President Bush's $2.57 trillion budget is intended to demonstrate to three critical groups -- conservatives at home, Wall Street and financial markets overseas -- that he has become serious about reducing the nation's record deficit. The question is whether the groups will view it that way or see it as a collection of politically motivated cuts that Congress will almost certainly reverse.
 On Monday, a White House public relations offensive emphasized that Mr. Bush was cutting or eliminating 150 programs in his 2006 spending plan. But some economists and Wall Street financiers said they were underwhelmed by the pain and predicted that the president's budget would not impress conservatives or the international markets. 
 ''I don't think this approach will look very credible,'' said C. Fred Bergsten, the president of the nonpartisan Institute for International Economics and a Treasury official in the Carter administration who is a critic of the Bush administration's management of the dollar. 
 ''What the markets look for is the current level of the deficit, but even more than that, the trajectory,'' Mr. Bergsten said. ''The message here is that the underlying trend, contrary to the administration's assertions, is a steady increase in the deficit.''
 Similarly, some prominent conservatives said that the 2006 budget showed Mr. Bush to be a ''big-government conservative'' who was not interested in limiting the size of Washington's bureaucracy and that the political reality was that many of the cuts to popular programs would be restored by Congress in the budget battles that are likely to rage on Capitol Hill for the rest of the year.
 ''They're billing it as a new and tougher budget stance, and I don't think that's right,'' said Chris Edwards, the director of tax policy at the libertarian Cato Institute. ''Last year, they came out with 130 programs they said they were going to terminate and cut. And basically nothing happened.''
 Some conservative critics pointed out that Mr. Bush's budget did not cut military or domestic security spending, and that the net cuts in his domestic budget were only $2 billion to $3 billion out of a total of $389 billion in programs. 
 Administration officials themselves acknowledged that the budget would not significantly cut the $427 billion deficit in the near term, and that their calculations did not include any money beyond the $81 billion to be requested this month to cover expenses this year for the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan or the initial cost of Mr. Bush's plan to overhaul Social Security.
 Mr. Edwards added that Mr. Bush appeared to be sending a mixed message. ''He says he's going to be tough, that Congress has to restrain itself, but in two pages right at the front of the budget, he's got a laundry list of new initiatives,'' Mr. Edwards said, singling out $1.5 billion for an expansion of the No Child Left Behind education law mandating testing in third through eighth grades.
 Some conservatives also said it was unclear if Mr. Bush would veto any bills should Congress restore his cuts. They noted that Mr. Bush is the first president since James Garfield never to have vetoed a bill, spending or otherwise, and that Garfield, who was assassinated in office in 1881, was president for only six months.
 ''I've thought that long before now, they could have found some bill, any bill, that they could strategically veto just to make a point,'' said Bruce Bartlett, an economist at the National Center for Policy Analysis and a Treasury official in the Reagan administration who is often critical of Mr. Bush. 
 Although conservative critics have long annoyed the White House with complaints about what they call the president's free spending, economists said the administration was far more concerned about the effects of the deficit on foreign investment in the United States. 
 The fear is that foreigners will grow less confident in investing in American capital markets, in part because of their concerns over the deficit. Those concerns could force the United States to increase interest rates to attract foreign investors, which could slow down American economic growth. 
 The United States is increasingly dependent on foreign investors to keep its economy afloat, and borrows $3 billion daily from the rest of the world to help offset its annual deficit. Foreigners now hold more than 43 percent of Treasury bonds, compared with a little more than 18 percent a decade ago.
 ''If you're looking at this from abroad, you're saying to yourself that over the last three years, there has been an absence of any budget discipline in Washington,'' said Robert D. Hormats, the vice chairman of Goldman Sachs International in New York who was an economic or trade official in several administrations. ''Now this is a chance to rebuild foreign confidence that there is some sense of fiscal restraint. And that's really the great challenge: can you do that?''
 Government officials say they are optimistic that the president's budget will impress foreign investors with its discipline, and have already sounded that message in Europe. Alan Greenspan, the chairman of the Federal Reserve, said last Friday in London that the Bush administration was indeed serious about reducing the deficit. 
 ''The voice of fiscal restraint, barely audible a year ago, has at least partially regained volume,'' Mr. Greenspan told a gathering of finance ministers and central bank governors from the leading industrialized nations. His remarks inspired a strengthening of the dollar.
 Mr. Bush recently acknowledged that the deficit had made foreign investors and other nations nervous about investing in the United States and said that he intended to do something about it. In December, the president told reporters after a meeting with Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi of Italy in the Oval Office that he took seriously Mr. Berlusconi's concerns about the declining dollar.
 ''The best thing that we can do from the executive branch of government in America is to work with Congress to deal with our deficits,'' Mr. Bush said.

HEADLINE: Subject to Bush's Knife: Aid for Food and Heating

BYLINE: By ROBERT PEAR

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Feb. 7 

 BODY:
Under President Bush's budget, many food stamp recipients, farmers, veterans, small-business owners, nursing students, air travelers and Amtrak passengers would have to pay more or would receive less from the government.
 Spending for domestic programs, aside from security and entitlements like Medicare and Social Security, would decline slightly in 2006, to $389 billion, and would remain flat for the next four years -- a freeze with no obvious precedent in the last two decades. The budget promises to reduce the deficit to $207 billion in 2010, from a record $412 billion last year. Mr. Bush proposes stricter eligibility rules for food stamps, expected to save $57 million in 2006 and $1.1 billion over 10 years. Under the proposal, welfare recipients who receive only child care, education, training and other services would no longer be automatically eligible for food stamps. Poor people receiving cash assistance would remain automatically eligible. 
 The proposal has huge implications because cash assistance now accounts for less than half of all spending under the nation's main welfare program, Temporary Assistance for Needy Families. Ellen M. Vollinger, legal director of the Food Research and Action Center, a liberal advocacy group, said: ''We do not support this proposal. Families who have moved from welfare to work and are struggling with the high costs of child care could lose nutrition assistance.''
 One indication of new priorities is Mr. Bush's proposal to end the Community Services Block Grant, a $637 million program that helps pay for community action agencies begun more than 35 years ago as part of the fight against poverty. 
 The agencies provide housing, nutrition, education and employment services to low-income people. But the Bush administration said the program had been ''unable to demonstrate results.''
 The Low-Income Home Energy Assistance Program, which helps people pay their heating bills, would be cut 8.4 percent, to $2 billion. 
 Senator Charles E. Schumer, Democrat of New York, said this proposal could not have come at a worse time, since the cartel of oil-producing countries ''continues to jack up oil prices and tip American consumers upside down.'' 
 Senator Olympia J. Snowe, Republican of Maine, rejected the plan, saying she would push legislation to provide $3.4 billion in energy assistance.
 Michael O. Leavitt, the new secretary of health and human services, defended Mr. Bush's proposal to cut the budget of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, including grants to help state and local agencies prepare for bioterror attacks. He said Mr. Bush had significantly increased such aid since 2001.
 But the Association of State and Territorial Health Officials, representing health officers of the 50 states, said the cuts would ''leave the nation vulnerable to public health emergencies,'' including bioterrorist attacks and infectious disease. 
 In Medicaid, the federal-state health program for more than 50 million people, Mr. Bush is seeking changes that he says will save $60 billion over the next 10 years. 
 Dr. Mark B. McClellan, administrator of the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, said the proposals would reduce payments to pharmacies and state governments without hurting Medicaid recipients.
 But Lawrence A. McAndrews, president of the National Association of Children's Hospitals, said the cuts would force many hospitals to reduce or eliminate services. Medicaid accounts for more than 40 percent of the revenue at such hospitals, he said, and ''the care of all children, not just those on Medicaid, would be affected by the reduction of services.''
 The president would also cut $100 million from a $301 million program that trains doctors at children's hospitals. He would cut the budget for training other health professionals by 64 percent, to $160.5 million.
 Brian M. Riedl, an economist at the conservative Heritage Foundation, said the cries of anguish were predictable. ''Over all, it's a good budget,'' Mr. Riedl said. ''It sets priorities and takes a big step to eliminate wasteful spending. The president was courageous to propose cuts in farm subsidies and the elimination of Amtrak's operating subsidies. Those proposals show that no programs are immune.''
 ''Farm subsidies are America's largest corporate welfare program,'' Mr. Riedl said, ''and in a tight budget, there's no room for corporate welfare.''
 Many of Mr. Bush's proposals face stiff opposition in Congress. Administration officials said they had tried to spread the pain of cuts among a large number of constituencies.
 Aviation security fees, which pay for the screening of air travelers, would rise to $5.50, from $2.50, for a typical nonstop trip.
 Airlines plan to fight the proposal. James C. May, president of the Air Transport Association, said: ''A tax on travelers is a tax on airlines. Any new tax or fee raises ticket prices and the cost of airlines' doing business.'' 
 The tax increase, Mr. May said, ''will jeopardize airline jobs and local air service to small- and medium-size communities.''
 Joshua B. Bolten, director of the White House Office of Management and Budget, said the fees reflected the cost of screening passengers and baggage. Such costs, he said, should be paid by air travelers, not by taxpayers in general.
 The budget would eliminate operating subsidies for Amtrak, the nation's rail passenger service, unless Congress overhauls it. 
 Senator Jon Corzine, Democrat of New Jersey, said the proposal would have ''disastrous effects'' for New Jersey commuters and for the economy in the Northeast Corridor.
 But Mr. Bolten said Amtrak was meant to be ''a for-profit, self-sustaining corporate entity,'' not permanently dependent on federal subsidies. ''The market needs to apply in railroads, as everywhere else.''
 Mr. Bush would slash the budget of the Small Business Administration. Its spending authority would be sliced to $636 million in 2006, from $3.3 billion this year. The agency administrator, Hector V. Barreto, said the plan was ''fiscally responsible, good for small businesses and good for the American taxpayer.''
 But Ms. Snowe, the chairwoman of the Senate Committee on Small Business, said the proposed cut would impair the agency's ability to stimulate the economy and create jobs.

HEADLINE: The Big Picture May Seem Rosy, But the Deficit Is in the Details

BYLINE: By EDMUND L. ANDREWS and DAVID E. ROSENBAUM

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Feb. 7 

 BODY:
The large tables in President Bush's new budget show he intends to keep his promise of slicing the federal deficit in half by the end of his term, but the fine print indicates that the goal may be elusive.
 The budget is notable for including limits on spending that are unlikely to be enacted and for excluding expenses that are sure to be incurred. Here are the most important points: 
 It assumes that all discretionary spending outside of military and domestic security -- everything from paperclips to space shuttles -- will be frozen for the next five years.
 It includes no spending for the war in Iraq and Afghanistan in 2006. Those costs are now running about $5 billion a month and are likely to continue at some level in the 2006 fiscal year and beyond. 
 It omits the initial cost of Mr. Bush's Social Security plan, which would let people divert some of their payroll taxes to private saving accounts. Administration officials estimate the plan would cost $23 billion in 2009 and $754 billion over the next decade.
 It leaves out the cost of reining in the Alternative Minimum Tax, a tax that was created to affect the nation's wealthiest taxpayers but is now ensnaring millions of moderate-income families as incomes rise with inflation.
 ''It's a very unrealistic budget for a document that is supposed to reflect the president's policies,'' said Robert L. Bixby, executive director of the Concord Coalition, a bipartisan organization that lobbies for deficit reduction.
 In his message to Congress, Mr. Bush promised to hold ''federal programs to a firm test of accountability'' and take ''the steps necessary to achieve our deficit reduction goals.''
 The budget envisions the annual deficit shrinking to $233 billion from $427 billion by 2009. As a share of the national economy, a measure economists consider more meaningful, the deficit would decline from 3.6 percent to 1.5 percent, meeting the president's goal of cutting the deficit in half.
 But even with all the expensive omissions and problematic spending cuts, many of which Congress rejected last year, Mr. Bush's goal of deficit reduction has already slipped further into the future.
 One year ago, when he first pledged to cut the deficit in half by the 2009 fiscal year, the White House predicted that the budget deficit would decline to $364 billion in 2005 and $268 billion in 2006.
 Now, the White House is predicting that the budget deficit will rise to $427 billion in 2005, the current fiscal year, and decline to only $390 billion in 2006.
 Many people who follow budgets closely doubt much deficit reduction is in the offing. Speaking especially about the proposed freeze in most domestic programs, Stanley E. Collender, who writes an impartial annual guide to the federal budget, said, ''It is unrealistic to expect Congress to march in lockstep and accept the president's proposals.'' Mr. Collender said he expected the deficit to be ''in the $400 billion range for the rest of the decade.''
 By any measure, the new budget is austere. It calls for deep cuts next year in almost every category of domestic spending outside the mandatory entitlement programs like Social Security and Medicare, which are based on laws adopted in previous years.
 Analyses show that preventing these programs from rising with the rate of inflation and population growth over the next five years would amount to a 16 percent cut, or $65 billion out of $391 billion now being spent.
 After adjusting for inflation and including federal salary increases already approved for next year, the vast majority of domestic programs would experience real cuts for the second year in a row, a development that has not happened under modern budget procedures.
 Over the past four decades, spending for domestic discretionary programs has declined in only four years -- in the first budget year under President Richard M. Nixon, at the beginning of President Ronald Reagan's first and second terms and one year under President Bill Clinton. Each time, spending climbed again the next year. 
 Mr. Bush's Republican allies in Congress are already chafing about proposed cuts to farm subsidies, education programs, veterans' benefits and community development block grants.
 Moreover, while projecting aggregate spending reductions, the budget does not spell out which specific programs would be cut after 2006.
 Many of the savings that Mr. Bush is proposing are recycled ideas included in budgets year after year to show a lower projected deficit, even though their enactment is doubtful. Mr. Bush proposed substantially cutting or eliminating 65 programs last year, for a total proposed saving of $4.9 billion, but Congress eliminated fewer than a half dozen of them, for a total saving of less than $200 million.
 Among the proposals that Congress rejected last year and that cropped up again on this year's list are reductions in community development block grants, which included $302 million in projects that were earmarked by individual members of Congress, higher deductibles and copayments for veterans receiving prescription drugs and medical services, and elimination of ''Even Start,'' a $247 million education program aimed at helping children of illiterate parents.
 Budget analysts noted on Monday that Mr. Bush's plan also assumed a sharp slowdown in the growth of military spending, which has soared 35 percent in the past four years.
 Not counting money for the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, the new budget envisions that expenses for salaries, weapons systems and other military costs will climb 4.6 percent this year to $419 billion.
 By 2009, the budget is projecting only a 2 percent rise, but that would require the Pentagon to forgo some of its long-term modernization projects. As a practical matter, Pentagon officials are almost certain to push for the money and are likely to have the ear of Congress.
 As for the cost of fighting in Iraq and Afghanistan, the administration plans to ask Congress for $81 billion on top of the normal military budget for this year, but it has not said what may be necessary in the 2006 fiscal year. Army commanders, however, are planning on the assumption that at least 120,000 troops will remain in Iraq through 2006.
 The new budget also omits any cost estimate for dealing with the Alternative Minimum Tax. The alternative tax was intended to prevent high-income people from taking too much advantage of special tax breaks. But because it is not indexed for inflation, it is leading to tax increases for millions of additional families each year.
 Administration officials have already said they want to prevent that, but the proposed budget still assumes that the Alternative Minimum Tax will produce a rising torrent of new tax revenue. Preventing that tax increase would cost $72 billion in 2009 and $500 billion over the next decade, according to the Congressional Budget Office.
 Joshua B. Bolten, the White House budget director, said the administration had not included the cost of a tax fix because the Treasury Department planned to address the alternative minimum tax as part of a broader tax overhaul later this year.
 Perhaps the biggest initiative not in the budget is Mr. Bush's plan to overhaul Social Security and let people divert some of their payroll taxes into private accounts.
 Administration officials acknowledged that their plan would force the government to borrow about $774 billion of the next decade, and several trillion more in the decades that follow, because the government would still have to pay full benefits to people who are already 55 years or older. All this borrowing will show up in annual budget deficits.
 On Monday, Mr. Bolten affirmed the White House view that such ''transition costs'' are not an increase in government debt, because the government would get more than its money back many decades from now as future retirees depend more on their private accounts than on government-guaranteed benefits.
 ''Transition financing does not represent new debt,'' Mr. Bolten told reporters.

HEADLINE: Avoiding the Real Challenge

 BODY:
President Bush's latest deficit-steeped budget, for all its tough talk of reining in spending, stands out as a monument to misplaced political capital. It would take some hard work, indeed, to get Congress to face up to the binge of deficit spending that is haunting the nation and future generations of taxpayers. Yet Mr. Bush is not going to face the music. Instead, he's investing his precious re-election clout in pushing a wildly expensive plan to divert some Social Security payments to private accounts, a step that would not even address the long-term financial problems with the current system. His proposed budget, meanwhile, is a picture of reduced revenue and swollen pockets of hidden spending. The lip service about draconian clampdowns will hardly solve the problem, particularly in the eyes of the international markets that are studying the administration for signs of commitment to closing the budget deficit.
 Mr. Bush is right to call for a healthy analysis of government programs to determine which ones cost more than they are worth. But the reductions he proposes for the biggest targets are timid ones. 
 To his credit, for instance, Mr. Bush is asking for a reduction in farm and commodity programs. But his proposed cut of 5 percent -- should it somehow survive in a Congress that has never shown signs of being willing to stand up to agribusiness -- would hardly end that bloated giveaway. It offers little help for family farmers struggling to deal with the out-of-whack economics of an agricultural system that is distorted by monster subsidies to corporate farmers, or for poor farmers in the developing world who are hobbled by artificially cheap American exports. 
 While the Pentagon budget continues to boom, Mr. Bush has at least called for paring back some of the more unnecessary weapons programs from the cold war. But even if he manages to get the cuts past the arms industry's Congressional protectors, slowing weapons-building programs or cutting back on the number of weapons ordered by the Pentagon is never enough. History shows that these programs will be back to eat up tax dollars another day if Mr. Bush fails to kill off completely the contracts that feed them.
 Proposed cuts in Medicaid funds, while fiercely unpopular with the states, deserve a close look to see whether the administration can prove its case that the states game the system for more than their fair share. But the administration has shied away from even starting to seriously address the financial problems in Medicare, which is far and away the most deeply troubled federal entitlement program.
 Over all, the budget is a sham that takes big cuts out of politically vulnerable programs that have very little to do with the explosion of the deficit in Mr. Bush's tenure. 
 Programs benefiting low-income citizens, like community development and health care, are destined to bear close to half of the cuts even though they accounted for less than 10 percent of the spending increases during the first Bush term. Some of the cruelest cuts would affect hundreds of thousands of working poor people who rely on child-care assistance and food stamps.
 The deficit problem is a reflection of lowered revenue more than high spending -- a fact that the president and the Republicans in Congress are determined to ignore. To the contrary, their proposal is to lock the once-''temporary'' Bush tax cuts into stone. Meanwhile, expensive outlays will continue for the Pentagon, homeland security and mandated costs like Medicare. With such a lopsided perspective, vital environmental, education and housing programs cannot help but be disproportionately trimmed. 
 As a political tract, the budget neatly omits any accounting for next year's costs of the Iraq war, lately running at more than $5 billion a month. Nor do the budget figures for later years mention the hundreds of billions in borrowing that would be required to start up President Bush's plan to allow Social Security taxes to be directed into private investments. 
 Washington hands expect many, if not most, of the president's proposed cuts to be reinstated by Congress. And given Mr. Bush's preoccupation with Social Security, it's hard to imagine him wasting much effort on a leaner Pentagon budget or saner agricultural subsidies. In the end, only the programs with the least political clout -- generally aimed at helping the weakest groups in the country -- will be pared down or eliminated. That might give some politicians a sense of political cover, but it would be a bad choice and would hardly solve the problem.

HEADLINE: Amid Outcry, Pataki Yields On Grants For Tuition

BYLINE: By AL BAKER and PATRICK D. HEALY

DATELINE: ALBANY, Feb. 8 

 BODY:
Gov. George E. Pataki has decided to give state lawmakers the legal ability to undo his plan for withholding half of all Tuition Assistance Program grants until after college students graduate, aides to the governor said Tuesday.
 But in offering lawmakers that chance, Mr. Pataki would also require them to come up with $168 million that he hoped to save next year by withholding the TAP grants, beginning with entering students, the governor's aides said. 
 Mr. Pataki's retreat on reducing the tuition aid program came on a day when thousands of college students flooded the State Capitol to lobby for restoring the cuts. The students won support from one education leader who is close to Mr. Pataki: Robert L. King, chancellor of the State University of New York. In a legislative hearing on the topic, Mr. King said he favored restoring the grant cuts more than another Pataki proposal: to give money to colleges where students graduate on time.
 But even as Mr. Pataki sought to soften the student outcry, state legislators were puzzled about just how much flexibility they had to change the tuition program since the governor could always veto their moves. Republicans and Democrats also said they needed more time to study the proposal, included in 30-day amendments Mr. Pataki submitted for his $105.5 billion budget plan.
 By the end of the day on Tuesday, the governor's proposal on the grants had fallen into a much larger debate about budgeting powers in New York State, who wields them and what to do in a stalemate over large policy issues, like overall education or health care spending. Mr. Pataki and the state's four top legislative leaders -- the ruling Republicans and Democrats from the Senate and Assembly -- held their second public meeting in two weeks to discuss the budget, but emerged with no clear agreements on the budget-writing process, never mind dollars and cents.
 ''There are still some issues that need to be resolved regarding language, but where there is a will, there is a way,'' John E. McArdle, a spokesman for Joseph L. Bruno, the Senate's Republican majority leader, said after the meeting, echoing a point Mr. Bruno stressed in public.
 On the topic of money, John Cape, the governor's acting budget director, said state revenues had been ''extraordinary'' in recent months, a result of vibrant economic and job activity and higher-than-anticipated tax collections. He said the state would end the 2004-5 fiscal year, on March 31, with a $522 million surplus, about $352 million higher than projected. Next year, he said, there will be $200 million more available revenue. He also outlined the governor's aim to roll $1.4 billion in revenues into two reserve funds in case another downturn occurred.
 Mr. Bruno said the Senate had a list of available revenues ''that come into the billions.'' He said he could count $7 billion to $8 billion in money available to fund state programs, including some money in the governor's budget. ''There is money out there, without raising taxes,'' Mr. Bruno said. ''And we just have to agree that it truly is available and then move the process forward.''

HEADLINE: Can Amistad's Model Succeed in New York?

BYLINE: By AVI SALZMAN

DATELINE: NEW HAVEN 

 BODY:
It was the test scores that first got people outside of Connecticut interested in Amistad Academy, a charter school here.
 In a city where 31 percent of eighth graders achieved mastery on the state reading test in 2003, 81 percent of Amistad's did. In math, 75 percent of Amistad's eighth graders achieved mastery, compared with 19 percent citywide.
 New York City officials, who have been trying a variety of ways to shake up the school system, were so impressed with Amistad's success that they invited its organizer to start charter schools in the city. Three kindergarten-through-12th-grade schools are to open in Brooklyn this fall and two more are to open in 2006. 
 Joel I. Klein, New York City's schools chancellor, said he showed his own principals Amistad's scores and asked, ''Can you do this?'' He frequently describes the coming of Amistad as one of the most exciting educational developments in the city. 
 Amistad officials know that transplanting their program to New York will prove challenging, but they say they are getting strong support from city officials.
 ''The chancellor has really made New York the place to be,'' Dacia Toll, the director of Amistad, said of Mr. Klein. ''He has created the conditions for success in New York, and charter operators are responding.'' 
 Amistad, which runs from fifth grade to eighth grade, has a student body that is typical of many inner-city schools. The average student enters two grade levels behind where he or she should be. Eighty-four percent of students qualify for free or reduced-price lunches and about 97 percent are black or Hispanic. 
 So, what's the secret? For one thing, the students work long hours, from 7:30 a.m. to 3:45 p.m., sitting in classes that often last for more than an hour. All stay for after-school activities. In a regular New York City public school, the teachers' contract limits the length of classes, but most charter schools are not subject to the contract.
 The curriculum emphasizes basic skills and uses tests every six weeks to determine which students need extra drills. When students are lagging, teachers give them extra help or get their parents involved. If they talk back to a teacher or start a fight, they have to sit at the back of the classroom and are not allowed to speak with other students until their punishment has been served.
 The nonunion teaching staff puts in long hours, but teachers said the job is rewarding.
 ''I'd rather teach 10 hours here than six hours at a regular urban public school,'' said Matt Taylor, a literature and science teacher who used to teach in the New Haven public schools.
 Students said the attention and the emphasis on academics can be overwhelming, but they also say the school makes them feel as if they are part of a supportive community.
 ''The teachers are kind of too much in your business,'' said Yashira Agosto, an eighth grader, ''but they do it because they want to help you.''
 Ms. Toll, the director, knows the names of every student at Amistad, their personal struggles and, in some cases, their test scores. A Rhodes scholar, she picked up her teaching certificate even as she was earning a law degree at Yale Law School.
 The principal of a Brooklyn charter school said the Amistad administrators will face an uphill climb in New York.
 ''Just finding transportation and everything else is all different,'' said Alan Handel, principal at Brooklyn Excelsior Charter School in the Bedford-Stuyvesant neighborhood. Brooklyn Excelsior is part of the National Heritage Academies, which began in Michigan in 1995 and now runs 51 schools in five states.
 ''It's really a very big undertaking to open a school, let alone many schools,'' Mr. Handel said. ''Our company is a large company and has a lot of resources, but we are growing very slowly.''
 Achievement First, the nonprofit that runs Amistad and two other New Haven charter schools, has invested more than $1 million in starting the Brooklyn schools. It has hired a director of New York operations, a director of community and government operations, and three principals, and is hiring 32 teachers. 
 Ms. Toll has 123 items on a to-do list, including finding temporary space for the schools and recruiting students to enter the lottery that will decide who attends. 
 Melanie Mullan, the director of New York operations for Achievement First, expects the schools to be in Brooklyn, in neighborhoods like Brownsville and Bushwick, and she has already conducted visits to New York. Ms. Mullan said there is already a buzz.
 ''The word is out on the street already,'' she said. ''I get one or two calls a day from parents inquiring.''
 Some tasks are not as easy to check off, such as cultivating relationships with banks. Unlike New Haven, where Amistad has strong ties with local banks, New York is untested territory.
 There are also many less glamorous tasks, like finding auditors and filing applications so the school can buy supplies tax free. The interim assessment tests must also be reconfigured to meet New York's standards.
 But in New York, Ms. Toll said, the city has made the process easier than it was in Connecticut. For one thing, the city is willing to provide space for the school, or to match any new facility costs by two to one, Ms. Toll said. In New Haven, Amistad Academy is still paying off a $4 million building loan, much of it financed through private donations. Connecticut helped out with $500,000, but only after the school's charter was renewed.
 ''The goal is to level the playing fields, so they are competing on equal footing with the public schools,'' said Kristen Kane, the chief executive for the Office of New Schools with the New York City Department of Education.
 And while charter school enrollment in Connecticut is capped at 300, New York does not have a cap. So, the New York schools, with expected student bodies of at least 900, will be able to benefit from economies of scale. Finally, and perhaps most significantly, Achievement First expects to get about $8,600 per pupil in the New York City schools, an increase from the $7,250 allocated by Connecticut. Achievement First privately raises more than $2,000 per student to cover costs in Connecticut.
 Chancellor Klein said part of his plan to improve New York City schools is to seek out charter programs that have been successful in difficult environments ''and bring them to school districts that don't have a lot of high-performing schools.''
 He has announced plans to bring 50 new charter schools to New York City over the next five years.
 ''When you're in a charter school you're not being microregulated,'' he said. ''The focus has got to be shifted to student performance.''

HEADLINE: Loss Doubles At Mitsubishi For 9 Months; Sales Off 12%

BYLINE: By TODD ZAUN

DATELINE: TOKYO, Feb. 8 

 BODY:
Net losses at Mitsubishi Motors more than doubled to 228.2 billion yen, or $2.16 billion, in the nine-month period ended on Dec. 31, the company said Tuesday, as a continuing tumble in sales derailed its turnaround effort.
 Sales in two crucial markets, the United States and Japan, have fallen sharply in the last year amid worries about the quality of Mitsubishi vehicles and as a result of a botched marketing strategy in the United States. 
 The huge loss compared with a smaller one of 102.56 billion yen for the nine-month period a year earlier. Revenue fell 12 percent, to 1.62 trillion yen, for the nine months. 
 The loss underlined the extent of the trouble at Mitsubishi Motors, which recently received a 540 billion yen bailout ($5.1 billion) from other members of the Mitsubishi group, the second financial rescue in the last year. 
 Weak results had been widely anticipated after the company warned last month that its loss for the fiscal year ending March 31 would greatly exceed its previous estimates because of continuing severe sales declines.
 ''It's as bad as we originally expected,'' said Koji Endo, an auto analyst at Credit Suisse First Boston Securities Japan. 
 In its domestic market, Mitsubishi is dealing with perceptions that its cars are shoddily built, even unsafe, after it acknowledged covering up defects to avoid recalls. Sales of vehicles in Japan dropped 41 percent, to 146,000, in the nine months ended Dec. 31, the company said. 
 Mitsubishi reported an 8 percent rise in Europe, to 171,000 vehicles, in the nine-month period, a result of growth in East European economies. But there were few other positive developments in the earnings report. 
 Vehicle sales in the United States dropped 44 percent, to 105,000, as the company cut back on unprofitable fleet sales, like those to car-rental companies. Mitsubishi's American sales have been sliding for most of the last two years after it stopped making loans to customers with weak credit, many such loans having gone bad. 
 The company reiterated last month's forecast of a 472 billion yen net loss ($4.47 billion) for the full year ending in March, compared with a 215.4 billion yen loss a year earlier. 
 Also Tuesday, Mitsubishi Motors said it had reached an agreement with DaimlerChrysler on losses that Daimler suffered on its investment in Mitsubishi Fuso Truck and Bus. Daimler bought 65 percent of the truck maker from Mitsubishi, but the value of the stake dropped after a series of recalls to repair previously undisclosed defects. As compensation, Mitsubishi Motors will turn over its remaining 20 percent stake in Mitsubishi Fuso to Daimler and make an unspecified cash payment.

HEADLINE: Barbarians (Well, Mostly Art Lovers) at 'The Gates': Fans of Christo Descend

BYLINE: By JENNIFER STEINHAUER

 BODY:
In 1991 David Yust clocked 22 hours staring at a forest of yellow umbrellas in a valley north of Los Angeles. He spent 13 days in Berlin in 1995 marveling at the aluminum-surfaced fabric that draped the Reichstag, once rising at 2 a.m. for a reverential photo session of the sun rising over the enfolded neo-Renaissance landmark. And next week he plans to photograph a saffron-cloaked Central Park at dawn.
 Mr. Yust, 65, is part of a far-flung group of followers of the artists Christo and Jeanne-Claude, whose latest public art project, ''The Gates,'' is scheduled to open along 23 miles of the park's pedestrian walkways on Saturday. These loyal fans plot distant vacations, organize group trips and sometimes abandon jobs to bear witness to the artists' installations. 
 They are like the fans that long traipsed after the Grateful Dead, but with far fewer tour dates. They share the passion of people who collect milk glass, Manolo Blahniks or rare teapots, although their holdings are limited to books, pieces of fabric or, in the case of Caryl Unger, a shovel that was used to install ''Surrounded Islands'' in Biscayne Bay, off Miami.
 Groupies? Gate-heads? They resist monikers. But their ardor for the Christo and Jeanne-Claude happenings is passionate.
 Mr. Yust, an art professor at Colorado State University in Fort Collins, said he was first bitten by the Christo bug in 1983, when he signed on to work on ''Surrounded Islands,'' in which 11 Florida islands were encircled by pink floating fabric, after hearing the artists speak at the university. Since then he has tried to see as many of the installations as he can.
 ''I thought about that project every day for the next two years,'' said Mr. Yust, who, like many of those who travel the country or world to see the team's work, is an artist himself. ''I thought he was a big nut at that time. And I still think he is a big nut. But I am totally supportive of what he and Jeanne-Claude do. I feel they are among the last of the true idealists on the planet.''
 From art collectors to museum groups, tourists to paid Christo volunteers, the city expects 200,000 to flock to the city for the installation, which will remain through Feb. 27. Such figures, of course, are mere guesses for now. But there does seem to be universal agreement that in a traditionally slow tourism period, New York will draw record numbers of visitors, thanks to ''The Gates.''
 Hotels that are usually half full or worse this time of year are reporting strong bookings, especially at establishments that line the park's perimeter. For the coming weekend, the Carlyle Hotel is 75 percent booked, a 30 percent increase over last year, said James McBride, the hotel's managing director. The hotel is offering a ''Gates'' package, which includes a park-view suite with catering for two hours for 25 people, at $6,000. ''We booked one of them already,'' Mr. McBride said. 
 The Mark is sold out this weekend; last February, only half of the 176 rooms were booked, managers there said.
 The artists estimate that thousands of people around the globe make a point of traveling to see their work, often signing on to help install the pieces. Smaller Christo communities hammer beams, tread water, twist fabric, answer phones or perform myriad other tasks to help bring a work together. There is even a blog on which visitors can record their reactions: nycgates.blogspot.com.
 Those fans, as well as thousands of other visitors who are landing in New York over the next several days to behold the ornamented park, are expected to lift the city's tourism economy, usually lackluster this time of year. 
 ''You don't go running up to New York in the middle of February from Miami,'' said Mrs. Unger, who is flying in on Thursday from Miami to see the installation. ''But when I heard it was going to be in New York, I said to my husband, 'Please, let's go.'''
 New York merchants, of course, hope the experience will be as remunerative as it is enriching. The Mandarin Oriental will offer a package including binoculars in each of its Central Park View rooms, as well as breakfast at Asiate and a Metropolitan Museum of Art book on the project, starting at $1,050 a night. La Prima Donna Restaurant will serve sauteed Prince Edward Island mussels, in a saffron cream sauce. You get the idea.
 For the record, the artists do not earn income from the detritus left behind once a project is over. ''The Gates'' will be industrially recycled, and proceeds from the sale of ''Gates'' sweatshirts and other souvenirs will be donated to Nurture New York's Nature and the Central Park Conservancy. The project, which will cost more than $20 million to install, will be paid for by the artists.
 Organized groups are coming from Japan, Germany and many American cities to see the work, a great many of them made up of artists or art collectors.
 Ruth Halperin, chairwoman of Contemporary Collectors Circle of the Cantor Arts Center at Stanford University, will fly in with 25 museum members on her fourth Christo trip. 
 ''We went to Fresno to see the umbrellas,'' said Ms. Halperin, who is 77. ''We went to Paris, and we saw ''Running Fence,'' she said, referring to the draping of the Pont-Neuf in Champagne-colored cloth in 1985 and a 24-mile nylon curtain that stretched through Sonoma and Marin Counties in California in 1976. '''Running Fence' -- to me that was the most beautiful one,'' she said. ''The hills were beautiful and soft, and the light as the wind blew was magic. I will never forget that for the rest of my life.''
 About 100 hard-core fans live out their commitment by helping to assemble the projects. Iris Sandkuhler, an artist from San Francisco, has worked on seven Christo installations to date. ''I did my first one as a teenager, and now I am in my 40's,'' Ms. Sandkuhler said. ''In 1978, an art instructor in North Carolina piled us into a van and said you have to do this,'' she said, describing her initiation, a modest Christo project involving the wrapping of some streets in Kansas City. 
 The commitment is not without its physical challenges. ''Working in water in the Biscayne Bay,'' she said, ''we had to lace the panels together, and there was nothing to stand on, so we were in the water floundering around.''
 ''But the hardest one for me,'' Ms. Sandkuhler mused, ''was when I worked for them in Paris, and I was sleeping on a couch in the office right next to the bathroom.''

HEADLINE: The Coming Clash Over Kirkuk

BYLINE: By Sandra Mackey. 
Sandra Mackey is the author of ''The Reckoning: Iraq and the Legacy of Saddam Hussein.''

DATELINE: Atlanta 

 BODY:
AS the Iraqis turn their focus from holding elections to writing a constitution, the make-or-break issue for their nation may be the city of Kirkuk. Situated next to Iraq's northern oil fields, Kirkuk is a setting for all the ethnic-sectarian conflicts that are the historic reality of Iraq -- Muslim against Christian, Sunni against Shiite, Kurd against Arab. It is also home to the Turkmens, who are the ethnic cousins of the Turks and look to a willing Turkey as their protector. In their fierce competition for the right to claim Kirkuk, the Turkmens and the Kurds threaten to turn Iraqi internal politics into a regional conflict. 
 On a visit to Kirkuk last fall, I talked to both Turkmens and Kurds, and it was immediately obvious that both groups have a passion and feeling of possession toward the city, with its impressive citadel built on an ancient tell. . Kirkuk is the center of the Turkmen population in Iraq, while for Kurds, the city is a touchstone of their identity. 
 Each group employs demographics to back up its claim to the city. The last official Iraqi census, in 1957, listed 40 percent of Kirkuk's population as Turkmen and 35 percent as Kurdish; the rest were Arabs, Assyrians, Armenians and others. Today, the population is roughly 850,000; based on unofficial estimates, the number of Arabs has significantly increased, and the percentages of the Turkmens and Kurds are probably reversed. 
 When the American invasion of Iraq began in March 2003, Kurdish militias advanced southward from the Kurdish autonomous zone established in the northern third of Iraq in 1991 and entered Kirkuk. Since then the Kurds have used their position as American allies to bring in Kurdish families and thus bolster their demand that Kirkuk be incorporated in the Kurds' autonomous zone. 
 Their reason is emotional but also economic: Kirkuk is the key to oil fields that represent 40 percent of Iraq's proven petroleum reserves. At the least, those fields constitute an enormous bargaining chip in the negotiations over the future Iraqi government; at most they provide the economic base for a future Kurdish state.
 The Kurds' numbers, and their determination to lay claim to Kirkuk, have stoked the already intense hostilities between the Kurds and Arabs that date to the late 1980's, when Saddam Hussein pushed many Kurds out of the city and replaced them with Arabs. But it is the contest for Kirkuk being waged between the Kurds and Turkmens that is the far more serious problem for the United States because the only card the Turkmens of Kirkuk have to play against the Kurds is Turkey. It is a card Ankara is willing to allow them to put on the table. 
 Turkey holds its own claim to Kirkuk. Unlike the Ottoman territories that were ceded to Iraq in the agreements that came at the end of World War I, Kirkuk was taken from Turkey as a result of the 1923 Lausanne Treaty. Turkish nationalists still regard it as historically part of Turkey. Ankara also asserts guardianship over the Turkmen ethnic minority in northern Iraq. But those are more emotional than political issues. What is mainly driving Turkey's interest in Kirkuk is the long-term problem of Turkey's own rebellious Kurdish minority, which is 20 percent of its population. 
 Since 1999, Turkish Kurds have attacked Turkey from bases in northern Iraq, in the Kurdish autonomous region. To Turkey's frustration, Iraqi Kurd officials turn a blind eye to their Turkish Kurd cousins' activities, while the Americans have been reluctant to move against the bases for fear of damaging their relationship with the Iraqi Kurds. The Turkish military has taken matters into its own hands by crossing the Iraqi border on occasion to battle the rebels. 
 But more ominous for American efforts to stabilize Iraq are Turkish fears that Baghdad will be forced to allow the Kurds to make Kirkuk part of their autonomous zone. For Ankara, this would constitute excessive Kurdish autonomy, its red line in Iraq. 
 The Turkish military has repeatedly warned Iraqi Kurds against changing Kirkuk's demographics. Although it acknowledges that the future of Kirkuk is an internal issue for Iraq, the military insists that the inclusion of the city into the Kurdish autonomous zone is a question in which it intends to play a part. To underline the point, the military makes no effort to hide its plans to send troops if needed to thwart the Kurds' claim to Kirkuk.
 Military intervention in northern Iraq is diplomatically risky for Turkey. Having just secured Europe's agreement to open talks on membership in the European Union, Ankara will move with caution. Yet Turkey may well see preventing the emergence of a potentially oil-rich Kurdish political entity on its borders as worth the risk. And Europe may regard keeping the Iraqi Kurds within the boundaries of Iraq, thus promoting stability in the Persian Gulf and in oil markets, as more important than keeping Turkey out of Iraq. 
 Although publicly circumspect, Washington sees Turkish military involvement as a looming possibility on the complex political landscape of Iraq. Washington has quietly said that the Kurds will not be allowed to take control of Kirkuk. American military bases in northern Iraq are discreetly being reinforced. And the First Infantry Division that has been in charge of Kirkuk for the last year has balanced the rights of the Turkmens and Arabs against those of the Kurds.
 So Washington recognizes that the Kurds, further emboldened by their anticipated numbers in the new Iraqi Parliament, could precipitate a crisis over Kirkuk. The question is whether the United States or the non-Kurdish members of the new Iraqi government can hold the Kurds in check -- a difficult task considering the fervor, especially among younger Kurds, for an eventual Kurdish state. 
 This is one of the complications of the Iraqi election that the Bush administration has hailed as such a success. If the Kurds try to change the status of Kirkuk, the United States may find itself forced to turn its military power on them. But if America does nothing to hold Kirkuk, it may well find itself in another crisis. Only this one would not be confined to Iraq.

HEADLINE: A Harrowing Look at a Murderous Institution

BYLINE: By NED MARTEL

 BODY:
Free time, by the American definition of the pursuit of happiness, should not be spent imagining slavery. But PBS's harrowing four hours on this murderous institution deftly explains who we are and why we can afford so many moments of rest. 
 This solemn and exemplary four-part documentary, which is being shown tonight and next Wednesday on most PBS stations, poses unresolved questions about the brutality of one man asserting absolute power over another. The economic benefits that arose from slavery's mass exploitation gave the nation advantages that it still enjoys. Although regarded as an international beacon for fairness, the justice system only rarely recognized glaring injustices and barely challenged codified hatred. And when the Union, led by a president with a slim mandate, strove to end the system of human property, the bloodiest American war erupted, with suffering that extends to continuing racial conflicts. 
 The last time the nation was beckoned to the television for such a consideration of slavery, there were some happy characterizations to mask the hurt. In 1977's ''Roots,'' the music of Ben Vereen and the beauty of Leslie Uggams occasionally brightened the grim multigenerational saga. And there was the uplifting knowledge that the wilted family tree of Kunta Kinte had eventually blossomed, with the meritocratic success of the author Alex Haley.
 In ''Slavery and the Making of America'' there are again dolorous tales of resilient slaves. They endure the cleaving of families, the indignities of sexual humiliation, the false hopes of escape. The program re-enacts such episodes in blurry vignettes, in which the actors' faces are out of focus and their voices unheard. The calm voices of scholars advance the narration as they are interviewed on camera and in voice-over. The soothing rasp of the narrator, Morgan Freeman, patches the pieces together. Thus the story line avoids crescendo, any spiking of a viewer's emotion that, faced with yet another downturn, might leave one too depleted to continue.
 That would be truer to the hopelessness of these episodes because so many slaves do not survive. So determined was the slave-owning society to keep its labor force conscripted and uncompensated that acts of insolence were hideously punished. After Nat Turner's rebellion, white terrorists -- there's no more apt description -- rounded up many slaves who were not even disobedient, much less complicit, and murdered them. Victims' heads were placed on stakes to scare other slaves into submission.
 It is worrisome and easy to have assumed that slavery in this form was a European import, a bad habit that colonists eventually learned to kick. In fact, the documentary proves that it was an American innovation, and the trend line was not toward any improvement in the rights of slaves, even as abolition freed many in the Northern states. The institution grew more ironclad, the legal shackles tightened, the cruelty intensified as more American soil was tilled by slave hands.
 The documentary cleverly charts this gradually reduced respect for the slaves as something that harmed both sides. The program dwells on the biography of Harriet Jacobs for its epic entanglements with the dark side of slave-owning psyches. Her master's lust for her inspires hostility from him, when she resists, and from his wife, who suffers from jealousy and inattention. Another wealthy white man seems a solution to her crisis, but creates new ones for everyone involved. Her choices save the lives of her children and result in her own inhumane self-exile. In many forms, surviving slavery required inventing some reduced existence between life and death.
 Too often popular history has failed to explain the breadth of responses to enslavement. The slaves were hardly split between supplicant and rebel, the white man's victim and his enemy. Sometimes there were bargains struck, betrayals waged, alliances forged. Early on, African slaves and European indentured servants commiserated in Manhattan taverns, but the laws eventually invented a distinction: dark skin dictated harsher penalties.
 Many slaves developed a keen, nuanced understanding of abuses and grasped the slim chance of exposing or even ending them. In one inspiring chapter, a Massachusetts house slave, Mum Bett, learned the language of freedom from those she served: at her master's table were some drafters of the Declaration of Independence, and she wondered why the rights they articulated did not extend to her. 
 Once she protected a younger slave from being struck with a hot shovel, and she wore the resulting scar on her forearm as a badge of dishonor for her owner. When any white person inquired about her injury, she simply said, ''Ask Madam.'' By the end of her story she has sued for and won her liberty, and yet, over the show's long march, such milestones seem like lessons that have taken far too long to learn.

HEADLINE: Ruling Dynasty Seems to Start, Leaving Many in Togo Resentful

BYLINE: By LYDIA POLGREEN

DATELINE: DAKAR, Senegal, Feb. 8 

 BODY:
Many residents of Togo's capital, Lome, stayed home on Tuesday to protest the installation of the son of their longtime ruler as president, contrary to the Constitution, as they waited to see if tough words of condemnation from world leaders would put Togo on the path toward democracy. 
 ''We are waiting to see if words become action,'' Daniel Lawson Drackey, a commentator on Nana FM, one of the leading private radio stations, said in a telephone interview. ''I know by experience in this country that if it is only pressure by statements, they will stay the course they had before and nothing will change. The only things they understand are money and force.'' 
 The drama in Lome over the past few days could have been taken straight from an African history book: a tough, long serving leader died, his son was declared president in his place with the military's backing and a rubber-stamp legislature swiftly altered the Constitution to make the transition legal. 
 A decade ago, such a transfer of power would have raised few eyebrows. But Togo's machinations have earned widespread condemnation across the continent.
 The Peace and Security Council of the African Union threatened sanctions on Tuesday if Togo did not abandon its installation of Faure Gnassingbe, the 39-year-old son of the longtime Togolese ruler, Gnassingbe Eyadema, as the country's new president, calling it a ''blatant and unacceptable violation of the Togolese Constitution.'' Mr. Eyadema died Saturday en route to emergency medical treatment in Paris. 
 In New York on Monday, Secretary General Kofi Annan of the United Nations issued a similar condemnation, adding to a chorus of voices that has included France, Nigeria, South Africa and others. A meeting of Ecowas, a group of West African states, is scheduled Wednesday in Niger. 
 Adam Thiam, spokesman for the African Union Commission, said the group had meager tools at its disposal to force the Togolese government to hold elections, as required by its Constitution before it was hastily amended Sunday. 
 ''We have said it right at the beginning, we think this is wrong,'' Mr. Thiam said. ''But at the same time we are a very young commission with limited means, so maybe a combination of us and others, like the United Nations and the European Union, will be more effective. When we take that kind of position, we are also saying to the world, 'O.K., please help us to deal with this crisis.'''
 Economic sanctions would require help from Western governments, he said, and pressure beyond Africa would be required to bring the government into line. 
 Few options other than sanctions exist. The European Union cut off aid more than a decade ago because Togo was deemed insufficiently democratic, and no one is contemplating using force in a tiny nation the size of West Virginia with a per capita annual income estimated at $270. 
 The crisis represents a serious challenge, Mr. Thiam said. ''This is a chance for Africa to show that its instruments can work, that we can solve our problems and reinforce our principles,'' he said. ''It is the credibility of Africa which is at stake.'' 
 In Lome, there were early signs that dissent would not be tolerated by the new government despite statements by Mr. Gnassingbe after his swearing-in that he wanted to move toward democracy.
 Several radio stations with call-in shows that allowed people to vent their feelings about the new government received threatening phone calls, Mr. Lawson Drackey said. 
 ''The people are eager for change but cannot express it,'' he said. ''With 40 years of a dictatorial regime, people are afraid. There was great hope that freedom would come when the old man was gone, but people now are unsure of the future.''

HEADLINE: Keeping Iowa's Young Folks at Home After They've Seen Minnesota

BYLINE: By VERLYN KLINKENBORG

 BODY:
Lately the Iowa Legislature has been trying to find a way to solve a basic problem: how to keep young people from leaving the state. Right now, Iowa's ''brain drain'' is second only to North Dakota's. The Legislature is toying with a simple idea, getting rid of state income tax for everyone under 30. This proposal was front-page news in California, where most of Iowa moved in the 1960's. 
 Let me translate the economics of this plan. The State Legislature proposes to offer every young tax-paying Iowan a large delivery pizza -- or its cash equivalent, about $12 -- every week of the year. But smart young Iowans know this is only an average figure. The more you earn, the more state income tax you save. 
 If ever there were an incentive to earn your first hundred million by the time you're 30, this would be it. Never mind that South Dakota, right next door, charges no income tax, no matter how old you are.
 Of course, there are serious questions about financing this tax break, which could cost as much as $200 million a year. The best bet would be to require young people to spend their dole on the Iowa Lottery. 
 Iowans are resolutely practical about such proposals. One state legislator, quoted in The Minneapolis Star Tribune, said: ''Let's face it. Des Moines will never be Minneapolis.'' He might have added that Council Bluffs would never be Kansas City. Another Iowan, when asked what the state needed to keep its young people, said, ''An ocean would help.'' This is the kind of big thinking Iowa has always been famous for. 
 But $600, the average yearly state income tax for Iowan 20-somethings, is not enough to undo decades of social erosion. The problems Iowa faces are the very solutions it chose two and three generations ago. The state's demographic problem wasn't caused by bad weather or high income taxes or the lack of a body of water larger than Rathbun Lake -- an Army Corps of Engineers reservoir sometimes known as Iowa's ocean. It was caused by the state's wholehearted, uncritical embrace of industrial agriculture, which has depopulated the countryside, destroyed the economic and social texture of small towns, and made certain that ordinary Iowans are defenseless against the pollution of factory farming.
 These days, all the entry-level jobs in agriculture -- the state's biggest industry -- happen to be down at the local slaughterhouse, and most of those jobs were filled by the governor's incentive, a few years ago, to bring 100,000 immigrant workers into the state.
 Business leaders all across Iowa have been racking their brains to think of ways to spur economic development. But nearly every idea leaves industrial agriculture intact. That leaves a few families living amid vast tracts of genetically modified soybeans and corn, with here and there a hog confinement site or a cattle feedlot to break the monotony. 
 People love to blame the death of America's small towns on the coming of Wal-Mart, but in Iowa, Wal-Mart is just a parasite preying on the remains of a way of life that ended years ago. Every farming crisis -- they seem to come at least once a decade -- has shaken a few more farmers out of the business, consolidating land holdings and decreasing the rural population that actually depends on small towns to do business in. The complex connection between town and country that characterized the state when I lived there has long since been broken. 
 There is not enough life in the small towns of Iowa to keep a young person, and there is no opportunity on the land. The state faces an excruciating paradox. It can foster economic development of a kind that devours farmland -- the sort of thing that is happening around Des Moines. Or it can try to reimagine the nature of farming, with certain opposition from farmers themselves and without any help from the federal government, which has fostered industrial agriculture for decades. 
 I used to joke that Iowa's two leading crops were rural poverty and crystal meth. But it's not a joke. The fact is that Iowa is a beautiful state. Minneapolis isn't that far away. Iowa would be a great place to live, if only the air and the water weren't polluted and you could be sure you wouldn't find yourself living next to 10,000 sows in a hog prison. There was a time, well within my dad's memory, when Iowa's agriculture was diversified and when the towns were rich in a culture of their own devising.
 I grew up in the latter days of such a town, and I find it hard to imagine a better place to have been a kid. 
 My family moved away from Iowa in 1966, for reasons that had to do with my mother's health and not with economics or even the decline in pheasant hunting. I'd like to say I stared out the rear window as we pulled out of town, watching the state of my boyhood recede, but I didn't. We were going to California, which trumps Minneapolis. I was lucky to leave before I knew I would need to.

COX, LAWANDA FENLASON

 BODY:
 COX--LaWanda Fenlason, who passed away February 2, 2005, in her home in New York City at the age of 95, was one of the most distinguished, respected, and influential historians of her generation. Her books and articles on Abraham Lincoln, emancipation, and Reconstruction had a profound impact on historical scholarship and became classics that are read by historians in the twenty-first century. She had also resided many years in Bethel, CT. Born in Hoquim, Washington, on September 24, 1909, LaWanda Fenlason earned her B.A. at the University of Oregon in 1931, a masters from Smith College in 1934, and her Ph.D. from the University of California, Berkeley, in 1941. At Smith, she studied with Merle Curti, the pioneering social historian whose commitment to social justice deeply influenced her. Curti became a lifelong friend. In 1940, Cox came to New York City, where her husband, John Cox, accepted a teaching position at City College and she a position at Hunter College. Except for a brief stint at Goucher College in Baltimore (1944-46), she was a member of the history faculty at Hunter and the City University of New York's Graduate Center until her retirement in 1971. She was a legendary teacher at Hunter, influencing two generations of students there. As a doctoral student at Berkeley, Cox studied with John Schuster Taylor, the economist who collaborated with the great documentary photographer Dorthea Lang to study of the plight of the impoverished agricultural workers who migrated to California to escape the ravages of the Dust Bowl and Great Depression. 
Taking up Taylor's challenge, Cox completed a pioneering study of agricultural labor in the United States as her dissertation. Cox's work on agricultural labor led her to study the plight of former slaves in the post-Civil War South and, ultimately, Reconstruction policy and politics. Her scholarly writing dramatically revised understanding of Reconstruction. Civil rights was the era's defining issue, she demonstrated, not merely a product of Republican vindictiveness toward the South or a smoke screen to obscure the party's efforts to advance the interests of big business. The most complete and eloquent statement of her position came in Politics, Principle, and Prejudice, 1865-1866: Dilemma of Reconstruction America, which was published in 1963 by the Free Press and won the American Historical Association's John H. Dunning Prize. Subsequent work, including Reconstruction, the Negro, and the New South, published by Harper & Row in 1971, extended the argument to emphasize the farreaching--if hotly contested--changes Reconstruction era civil rights policy effected. Cox was also a highly influential Lincoln scholar. In Lincoln and Black Freedom, which appeared in 1981, she boldly challenged the reigning scholarly consensus that held that Lincoln was, at best, a reluctant emancipator. Cox argued that Lincoln's circumspect and indirect style of leadership--while highly effective in advancing the cause of black freedom--had misled historians about his commitment to emancipation and critical role in achieving it. While acknowledging the role African Americans themselves played in ending slavery, her characteristically meticulous research and careful reading of the sources made a compelling case for Lincoln's pivotal role in emancipation and commitment to civil rights for the former slaves. Throughout the 1980s, Cox remained an active scholar, conducting research and publishing essays that examined the demise of Reconstruction and the nation's failure to achieve substantive freedom for former slaves. She also conceived and guided the Symposium on Emancipation and Its Aftermath, which met annually in New York City from 1979 to 1989. A lively forum, it offered an opportunity for scholars to present workin-progress and served as an incubator for a number of important studies that appeared in the 1980s and 1990s. Failing vision brought an end to Cox's historical research and writing in 1989. Nevertheless, in a career that spanned almost fifty years, she left an indelible imprint on the field of Reconstruction, Lincoln studies, and American history more generally. While some of her contemporaries published more, few produced scholarship that equaled hers in its originality, depth of research, analytical power, and enduring significance. Few historians of any generation can equal the crisp lucidity of her writing and analysis. And perhaps no historian was as generous in nurturing the work of young scholars. She was preceded in death by her husband, John Cox, and is survived by her niece, Joan Mason of Los Angeles. A graveside service will be held Friday afternoon, February 11, 2005, at 1:30, at Center Cemetery, Bethel. There are no calling hours. The Bethel Funeral Home of Hull Funeral Service, 215 Greenwood Ave., Bethel, is handling arrangements.

HEADLINE: 2 Brooklyn Industrial Complexes Tap Into Upstate Windmills

BYLINE: By DIANE CARDWELL

 BODY:
Two enormous industrial complexes in Brooklyn have begun receiving some of their energy from power generated by 20 windmills near Syracuse, city officials said, under the largest wind power purchase by the city so far.
 Under the agreement, set to be announced today, the city's Economic Development Corporation is purchasing 3.7 million kilowatt-hours of wind power from ConEdison Solutions, a subsidiary of the conventional-electric company. The energy, roughly what is needed to power about 900 city residences for a year, will be used to meet 12 percent of the annual power needs for Bush Terminal and the Brooklyn Army Terminal, manufacturing and office centers that total five million square feet, the officials said. 
 ''Every kilowatt-hour of green, renewable power used in the city proportionally reduces the need for generating energy by power plants using fossil fuels, thereby reducing air pollution,'' said Gil C. Quiniones, senior vice president of energy and telecommunications at the Economic Development Corporation. 
 The reduction in power plant emissions as a result of the Brooklyn energy purchase would be the equivalent of reducing automobile use by about 3.5 million miles a year, said Philip Herman, managing director of business development at ConEdison Solutions.
 Historically, the city has bought renewable energy in the form of hydroelectric power, Mr. Quiniones said. And as the city continues to look for ways to reduce its dependence on traditional power plants, it is also pursuing other energy alternatives, including the use of fuel cells in water pollution control plants. In addition, it plans to install solar panels this year at the Bronx High School of Science and the New York Hall of Science in Queens.
 But as the cost of wind energy in New York State has decreased over the last few years, Mr. Quiniones said, it has become among the most promising of the new technologies.
 ''We're hoping that we are able to lead by example'' to encourage more businesses and institutions to turn to renewable energy sources like wind, he said. Towns and cities around the region have been considering buying wind-generated power or bringing in wind turbines, and real estate developers have increasingly been looking to build so-called green complexes. 
 ''The more people that buy renewable energy, there's economies of scale,'' Mr. Quiniones said, ''and hopefully that will spur innovation.''

HEADLINE: Retirement Becomes a Rest Stop As Pensions and Benefits Shrink

BYLINE: By EDUARDO PORTER and MARY WILLIAMS WALSH; Eduardo Porter reported from Littleton, Colo., for this article, and Mary Williams Walsh from New York.

DATELINE: LITTLETON, Colo. 

 BODY:
For John A. Lemoine, retirement has been hard work. Forced to take an early pension package at AT&T three years ago, Mr. Lemoine, 54, a former building manager who once made more than $70,000 a year handling the operations of several AT&T sites, soon found that retirement was something he just could not afford.
 To supplement the greatly reduced pension he received upon his retirement, he first took an $11-an-hour job as a maintenance worker at the Sam's Club up the road from his home here. He retrained as an X-ray technician, and began earning $17.50 an hour as a part-time radiology technician for several clinics. Still unable to make ends meet, he also took a full-time job as a security guard for an hourly wage of $10.50.
 ''I put in for other jobs, too,'' Mr. Lemoine said. ''You'd be surprised who won't hire you because of your age.'' 
 Employers had better get used to seeing older people's resumes.
 As numerous companies across the country withdraw retiree medical and dental benefits while others switch to less generous retirement plans, many aging workers who had expected to ease comfortably out of the labor force in their 50's and early 60's are discovering that they do not have the financial resources to support themselves in retirement. As a result, a lot more of them are returning to work. 
 Since the mid-1990's, older people have become the fastest-growing portion of the work force. The Labor Department projects that workers over 55 will make up 19.1 percent of the labor force by 2012, up from 14.3 percent in 2002.
 Until recently, most economists said that older people were being lured back into the labor force largely because of opportunities growing out of the vibrant economy of the 1990's. But these days, they say, many such Americans are being drawn to work out of necessity rather than choice.
 As the nation gears up for a fundamental debate over the future of Social Security, these circumstances hint at potential changes in the federal program that supports more than 40 million elderly Americans.
 Just as companies are seeking ways to reduce their roles in financing former employees in retirement, many economists say that the Social Security program should also scale back in response to the aging of the population.
 Some have pointed out that continuing to raise the official retirement age in step with increases in Americans' average longevity could probably guarantee Social Security's solvency forever.
 ''Policies promoting longer working life could ameliorate some of the potential demographic stresses,'' Alan Greenspan, the Federal Reserve chairman, told a conference of economists and policy makers in Jackson Hole, Wyo., last year. ''Early initiatives to address the economic effects of baby-boom retirements could smooth the transition to a new balance between workers and retirees.''
 To some extent, that transition is already under way -- although not in the way Mr. Greenspan, 78 himself, proposed. As they stay longer in their jobs or peruse the help-wanted ads for post-retirement employment, Americans are reversing what had been a nearly century-long decline in the participation of older people in the work force. 
 ''Everyone that I talked to is looking at working part time,'' said Jim Drummond, 59, a 37-year veteran of US Airways in Pittsburgh who retired on Jan. 1 and whose pension plan recently failed and was taken over by the federal government. ''The pension is not enough unless you are single and living alone.''
 Gerald Fronek, 62, an electrician for Lucent Technologies in Lockport, Ill., now plans to retire in April, five years after his original plan was thwarted by the collapse of Lucent's stock in 2000, which took most of his lifetime savings with it.
 ''I was dealt a bad card,'' Mr. Fronek said. ''I just have to forget about that and move ahead.''

Necessity, Not Choice
 Made to carry more of the burden of their retirement, many retirees say they feel that a social compact between workers and employers -- a set of expectations established over the second half of the 20th century -- is being dismantled.
 Not only are many discovering that they cannot afford to retire, they are also finding themselves in a labor market in which companies facing tough competition seem intent on controlling costs, partly by ridding themselves of higher-earning older workers.
 ''I spent 25 years with this company,'' Mr. Lemoine said. ''When we were hired at Ma Bell there was this premise that the more dedication you gave the company, the more they would take care of you.''
 The steepest turnaround in labor participation has occurred among older men. The percentage of men 55 to 64 years old in the work force fell steadily from 87 percent in 1950 to under 65 percent in 1994. Then it began inching back up, reaching 69 percent last year, according to the Labor Department. Among men 65 and older, the participation rate rose from 15 percent in 1994 to 19 percent last year. 
 For older women, who entered the labor force at increasing rates through the 1950's and 1960's, the change has been less pronounced. Nevertheless, the rate of participation for women over 55, after declining from around 26 percent in the late 1960's to nearly 21 percent in the mid-1980's, has rebounded over the last two decades, to 31 percent.
 A big factor keeping people in the work force later is Social Security itself, which until recently provided relatively generous benefits for people retiring as early as 62 and discouraged work after 65.
 But in 1983, to deal with Social Security's first financial crisis, Washington approved a law to raise the normal retirement age from 65 to 67 and increase the benefit paid to people who kept working for additional years. That law only began to bite for those retiring after 2002. 
 Many economists say that older Americans under 65, and therefore not yet eligible for Medicare, are being forced to accept work they might have disdained earlier so they can afford health insurance and pay for other necessities. 
 ''In the recessions through the 1980's and even in the early 1990's, the biggest drop in participation rates was among people in their 50's and 60's,'' said Gary Burtless, an economist at the Brookings Institution who studies retirement issues.
 But ''that has not been true since 2000,'' he said. ''My gut feeling is that what changed is the persistence and willingness of older workers to accept a job that would not have been to their liking 15 or 20 years ago.''
 Joe Janson, for example, retired three years ago, when he was 55, from an $83,000-a-year engineering job at Lucent to a $35,000 pension. But now he is looking for work again to pay for his family's health insurance, which Lucent cut last year.
 And he is not setting his sights high. In January, he and his wife, Mary, made $140 in two days delivering phone books for Qwest. ''If I have to,'' he said, ''I will drive a school bus.''

Working Older and Longer
 Among the most vulnerable workers are those who made their careers at some of the titans of yore -- companies like United Airlines, AT&T and Bethlehem Steel.
 In the labor-abundant baby boom era, large companies could offer generous benefit packages and valuable incentives for early retirement. Big unions like the Teamsters and the United Automobile Workers promoted early retirement, too, to clear the way for new hiring.
 Today, after rounds of downsizings, many companies have sharply cut their work forces to survive intensified competition from home and abroad, only to be left with large pools of retirees collecting benefits far longer than predicted. 
 Lucent, for instance, has only 20,000 active workers in the United States to generate the business needed to help support nearly 120,000 retirees, whose health care last year cost about $775 million, an amount equal to 70 percent of Lucent's net profit. So the company has been aggressively paring the health insurance it offers its retirees, prompting older employees to rethink their retirement plans. 
 ''We simply cannot afford to absorb U.S. retiree health care costs at this level and remain a sustainable, competitive company,'' Lucent notified its management retirees last September in explaining a new round of health benefit cuts. 
 As companies have whittled away at benefit packages, they have pushed their retirees back to work.
 The first step was the dismantling of many traditional pensions: the defined-benefit plans that offer a predetermined monthly income after retirement, and usually offer incentives for early retirees.
 Companies have been steadily replacing such plans with defined-contribution plans in which workers save a portion of their pay for retirement tax-deferred, and companies contribute a partial match.
 As recently as 1979, the Center for Retirement Research at Boston College found more than 80 percent of the workers covered by a company retirement plan had a defined-benefit pension. By 2001, the percentage had dropped to a little over 40 percent.
 The dismantling of traditional defined-benefit pensions left many older workers -- who had accumulated pension credit under the old system -- feeling short-changed. ''They did us wrong,'' said Mr. Lemoine, who says that a realignment of AT&T's pension plan in 1996 slashed his benefits. He joined a retiree organization that is supporting a lawsuit against AT&T over the changes.
 According to Stephen Bruce, a lawyer for the plaintiffs, Mr. Lemoine's final pension -- valued by the company at $135,000, which he took as a $70,500 lump sum plus $402 a month -- was less than half of what he would have been due under the previous defined-benefit system. 
 Citing the lawsuit, an AT&T spokesman said the company could not comment on the matter.

Health Benefits Hold Sway
 Even more critical has been the collapse of company-paid health insurance for retirees, prodding growing numbers of workers to hang on to some job, almost any job, to keep their health coverage until Medicare kicks in at 65.
 In 1988, two-thirds of all large employers offered health benefits to retirees; last year only about one-third did. And employers who offer coverage are forcing workers to shoulder more of the cost. In 2004, 79 percent of them increased their retirees' premiums. A survey by Watson Wyatt, a corporate-benefits consulting firm, found that the absence of company-financed retiree health insurance increased the average retirement age by two years for women and 1.5 years for men.
 ''In this day and age,'' said Jonathan Gruber, a professor of economics at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, ''retiree health insurance is perhaps the biggest single determinant of retirement.''
 Mr. Janson, the former Lucent engineer, agrees with that. Even though he has two teenage daughters at home and his wife, Mary, does not work outside the home, he could afford to stay retired, he said, as long as Lucent kept paying for his family's health insurance. But last year Lucent stopped paying for his dependents' coverage. That left him with an extra monthly bill of about $500. 
 ''We were making it before they took medical away,'' Mr. Janson said. ''It's kind of like the company pulling the rug out from under me now.''
 Mr. Janson is also suffering because he put most of his retirement savings into Lucent stock. Shares he bought at $80 are now trading at less than $4 and his nest egg -- worth about $700,000 in 1999, he said -- is now less than $150,000.
 For Americans heading into retirement, the contrast to the previous generation is stark. The typical household headed by a 47- to 64-year-old is poorer today, in constant dollars, than a similar household was in 1983. The main reason is the disappearance of the traditional pension, according to Edward N. Wolff, a New York University economist who analyzed Federal Reserve wealth data.
 Mr. Lemoine is lucky that AT&T still offers health insurance that covers his family, even though the monthly premium of $421.52 is more than his pension check. A head injury in a car accident in August ended his stints as a security guard and part-time X-ray technician.
 That shifted the financial burden of a four-teenager household onto his wife, Susan, 41, who draws a modest salary as a paralegal. Mr. Lemoine's 80-year-old mother also pitches in, lending the family money.
 The ordeal has profoundly changed Susan Lemoine's outlook on the future.
 ''I will work,'' she said, ''until the day I die.''

HEADLINE: Shares Rise on Pfizer Gain And Stronger Chip Outlook

BYLINE: By Reuters

 BODY:
Stocks edged slightly higher yesterday, helped by a jump in shares of the drug maker Pfizer, while gains in semiconductor stocks helped support the technology-dominated Nasdaq index.
 Shares of Cisco Systems fell 1.6 percent, to $17.95, in after-hours trading. The company said quarterly earnings rose, benefiting from higher sales, but revenue was less than Wall Street expected. 
 Pfizer gained 64 cents, or 2.6 percent, to $25.55. A research note from Lehman Brothers said Pfizer was considering reducing its sales force by up to 30 percent, possibly adding 15 cents to 18 cents a share in profit for 2005. 
 Pfizer, the world's largest drug maker, said later in the day that it was considering job cuts. Separately, the company said its experimental drug for a deadly form of stomach cancer proved safe and effective in a late-stage trial.
 The Dow Jones industrial average rose 8.87 points, to 10,724.63. The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index gained 0.58 point, to 1,202.30, while the Nasdaq composite index rose 4.65 points, to 2,086.68.
 ''We've seen some real money put back to work,'' said Scott Lynch, managing director of United States trading at Credit Suisse First Boston. The gains were led by technology shares, specifically the semiconductor stocks, he said.
 Chip stocks advanced after SG Cowen & Company said in a note that inventory concerns in the sector were fading fast. Intel rose 50 cents, to $23.41.
 The Philadelphia Stock Exchange index of semiconductor shares jumped 2.2 percent.
 EBay climbed $2.94, or almost 4 percent, to $78.53 after J.P. Morgan made bullish comments about the company even as it removed eBay from its list of recommended stocks.
 The student loan company SLM fell nearly 6 percent, or $2.83, to $47.84, limiting advances in the S.&P. 500.
 Friedman Billings Ramsey downgraded its rating on SLM to market perform from outperform, citing possible damage to its business from loan changes outlined in the federal budget.
 Nike fell $2.25, or 2.6 percent, to $83.95 after Merrill Lynch cut its rating on the stock to neutral from buy.
 Taser International fell $1.94, to $15.22, after the company, which makes stun guns, reported quarterly earnings that fell shy of Wall Street estimates.

HEADLINE: Bush Says He Has Listened To Concerns on Spending

BYLINE: By ELISABETH BUMILLER; Anne E. Kornblut contributed reporting from Washington for this article.

DATELINE: DETROIT, Feb. 8 

 BODY:
President Bush campaigned on Tuesday for his $2.57 trillion budget before a friendly audience of auto executives and civic leaders, and pointedly told them that Congress and the nation's business community ''have expressed their concerns about federal spending, and I've listened.''
 In a speech to the Detroit Economic Club at the city's Cobo Center, Mr. Bush promoted his budget for 2006, released 24 hours earlier, as ''the most disciplined proposal since Ronald Reagan was in office.'' He added that ''now Congress needs to join with me to bring real spending discipline to the federal budget.'' 
 The audience at the club, a regular stop for presidents and presidential candidates when they deliver important economic speeches, responded with warm but not thunderous applause. 
 Mr. Bush, who seeks to convince conservatives, Wall Street and the international financial markets that he is serious about bringing the nation's record deficits under control, singled out a $257 million education program that he has proposed to eliminate, Even Start, as an example of his new restraint. The program is a small part of the nearly $3 billion in cuts that Mr. Bush has proposed for domestic programs.
 The president said the 16-year-old program, which serves low-income children of illiterate parents, was ineffective.
 ''I can't think of anybody in the Congress who is not for helping low-income families become literate,'' Mr. Bush told the crowd, which included the chief executives of Ford, General Motors and DaimlerChrysler. ''The problem is, is that after three separate evaluations it has become abundantly clear that the program is not succeeding.''
 Margaret Spellings, the new education secretary, echoed the president. ''It's not working, and there are better ways to do it, and it's diffuse,'' Ms. Spellings said in an interview later in the day in Washington.
 But Democrats and advocates of Even Start denounced the president's position, a sign of the difficulties Mr. Bush faces from both parties on Capitol Hill as he tries to make cuts to popular programs. Even Start serves 120,000 children and adults.
 Scott Himelstein, the chairman of the National Even Start Association, an advocacy group for the program, said in a telephone interview from San Diego that Mr. Bush was unfairly comparing ''apples and oranges'' because Even Start serves a more disadvantaged group than other government programs. Mr. Himelstein said the methods for collecting data for the evaluations were ''flawed and uneven,'' and noted that Mr. Bush had sought to substantially reduce or eliminate Even Start from his three previous budgets. 
 Each time, Congress restored Even Start's financing. 
 Mr. Bush also mounted a defense of his plan to partly privatize Social Security by adding personal investment accounts for younger workers, and affirmed that he was open to any number of options to pay for it, including limiting benefits for wealthy retirees and increasing the retirement age. He said once again that Social Security would be bankrupt by 2042.
 ''If you're a younger person, you ought to be asking members of Congress and the United States Senate and the president what you intend to do about it,'' Mr. Bush said. 
 The Social Security trustees themselves project that after 2042 the system could still afford to pay nearly three-quarters of the benefits promised by current law, and some economists, especially liberals, say there is a good chance after 2042 that the system could still pay full benefits.

HEADLINE: 4 Years Later, Ferrer Still Aims to Unify 'Two New Yorks'

BYLINE: By DIANE CARDWELL

 BODY:
In a preview of his coming mayoral campaign, Fernando Ferrer returned yesterday to the Bronx and to the central theme of his failed bid for City Hall four years ago: that New York is increasingly two separate cities, with the wealthy reaping ever more benefits and everyone else struggling to get by.
 ''I've spoken in the past about the other New York, two New Yorks,'' Mr. Ferrer said before an audience of hundreds at an annual Martin Luther King Jr. tribute at Lehman College. ''Now let me be clear: I am still committed to talking about it and solving that problem. I know that this is a reality we still face.'' 
 When Mr. Ferrer ran for mayor in 2001, his message about ''the other New York'' was viewed as an effort to appeal to black and Latino voters and was labeled divisive by his opponents. But speaking to reporters after his lecture, Mr. Ferrer said the message now was different because he had delivered it in the context of a speech about Dr. King's legacy and because ''people understand that it is inherently unifying when we talk about a city and a country that works better for everyone.''
 Without mentioning Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg by name, Mr. Ferrer spoke of a need to close the ''dignity deficit'' and yoked Dr. King's ideas of economic opportunity and social justice to what he views as an administration making the wrong choices. 
 ''If Dr. King were here today, I'm sure he'd celebrate the undeniable progress we have made,'' he said. ''But I am also certain he'd agree that there needs to be some changes made, and some of our priorities are wrong.''
 Chief among those bad choices, he said to the audience's bursts of applause and calls to preach, is spending hundreds of millions on a West Side stadium while cutting funds for after-school programs and for new classrooms, and while families struggle to find child care, jobs, health insurance and housing.
 But later, Mr. Ferrer foreshadowed the political tightrope he might have to walk as a candidate as he tries to appeal to minority voters without alienating whites and to poor voters without pushing away middle-class New Yorkers.
 Speaking to reporters, he rejected suggestions that he would aim his candidacy at any particular group and studiously avoided any mention of race or ethnicity. Asked if he planned to work to build a black and Latino coalition as he did in 2001, he said, ''My hope is that we can build a diverse and deep coalition of people throughout this city who believe as I do, that this can be a better city.''
 He added, ''It is my hope that that coalition will be found in the Bronx and in Staten Island, in Brooklyn and in Queens, Manhattan, uptown, downtown, East and West.''

HEADLINE: Bush Bites His Tongue

BYLINE: By NICHOLAS D. KRISTOF. 
E-mail: nicholas@nytimes.com

 BODY:
There are two words the Bush administration doesn't want you to think about: North Korea.
 That's because the most dangerous failure of U.S. policy these days is in North Korea. President Bush has been startlingly passive as North Korea has begun churning out nuclear weapons like hot cakes.
 The dangers were underscored with last week's reports that the uranium in Libya's former nuclear program may have come from North Korea. Indeed, Mr. Bush seems to recognize that his policy has failed -- that's why he isn't talking much about North Korea now, at least publicly, and why (as reported in The Times today) he sent an emissary to talk last week with the Chinese leader, Hu Jintao, about how to tame North Korea. 
 North Korea is particularly awkward for Mr. Bush to discuss publicly because, as best we know, it didn't make a single nuclear weapon during Bill Clinton's eight years in office (although it did begin a separate, and secret, track to produce uranium weapons; it hasn't produced any yet but may eventually). In contrast, the administration now acknowledges that North Korea extracted enough plutonium in the last two years for about half a dozen nuclear weapons. 
 In fairness, Mr. Bush is paralyzed only because the alternatives are dreadful. A military strike on North Korea's nuclear sites might have been an option in the early 1990's, but today we don't know where the plutonium and the uranium are kept, so a military strike might accomplish little -- but trigger a new Korean war. To fill the time, Mr. Bush has pursued six-party talks involving North Korea, but they have gotten nowhere. 
 So what would work?
 The other option is the path that Richard Nixon pursued with Maoist China: resolute engagement, leading toward a new ''grand bargain'' in which Kim Jong Il would give up his nuclear program in exchange for political and economic ties with the international community. This has the advantage that the best bet to bring down Mr. Kim, the Dear Leader, isn't isolation, but contacts with the outside world.
 A terrific new book on North Korea, ''Under the Loving Care of the Fatherly Leader'' by Bradley Martin, underscores how those few glimpses that North Koreans have had of the outside world -- by working in logging camps in Russia or sneaking trips to China -- have helped undermine Mr. Kim's rule. Yet Westerners have in effect cooperated with him by helping to keep his borders sealed.
 At least China and South Korea have a strategy to transform North Korea: encourage capitalism, markets and foreign investment. Chinese traders, cellphones and radios are already widespread in the border areas, and they are doing more to weaken the Dear Leader than anything Mr. Bush is doing. 
 North Korea is the eeriest and most totalitarian country I've ever visited, making even Saddam Hussein's Iraq seem normal by comparison. I realized how regimented the entire country was when I stopped two girls randomly on the street for an interview on a 1989 trip and the girls started praising their leaders -- reciting identical lines in perfect unison.
 In his new book, Mr. Martin tells the story of how one of the Dear Leader's assistants, while drunk, told his wife about his boss's womanizing. The wife, apparently a true believer in the North Korean system, was shocked and wrote a letter to the leadership to protest this immorality.
 The Dear Leader had the woman brought to him, then denounced her before a crowd and ordered her shot. At that point, her husband begged to be allowed to kill her. Graciously acceding, Mr. Kim handed him a gun to kill his own wife.
 So this is a regime that is not just menacing, but monstrous. Mr. Bush is right to regard it with loathing. But U.S. policy on North Korea for the last four years has only strengthened Mr. Kim and allowed him to expand his nuclear arsenal severalfold.
 The risk is that Mr. Bush will respond to the failure of his first term's policy by adopting an even harder line in the coming months, seeking Security Council sanctions (he won't get them) and ultimately imposing some kind of naval quarantine. That would only strengthen Mr. Kim's grip on power, as well as risk a war on the Korean peninsula. A Pentagon study in the 1990's predicted that such a war could kill one million people.
 In short, our mishandling of North Korea has been appalling -- and it may soon get worse.

HEADLINE: U.S. Asking China to Increase Pressure on North Korea to End Its Nuclear Program

BYLINE: By DAVID E. SANGER and WILLIAM J. BROAD; David E. Sanger reported from Washington for this article and William J. Broad from New York.

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Feb. 8 

 BODY:
Driven by new evidence that North Korea may have begun selling nuclear materials around the world, President Bush sent an emissary last week to see President Hu Jintao of China and urge him to intensify diplomatic pressure on the North to give up its weapons program, according to senior American and Asian officials.
 The emissary, Michael Green, delivered a letter from Mr. Bush to Mr. Hu that, in the words of one American official, ''was written to underscore the greatly heightened urgency'' of the problem. 
 According to Asian officials, the Chinese promised to send a delegation to Pyongyang later this month, but also advised Mr. Bush against making public pronouncements about the North Korean situation, the way he regularly talked about the threat posed by Iraq in the year leading up to the March 2003 invasion. Mr. Bush has never publicly mentioned the new information about suspect North Korean nuclear sales, which was reported by The New York Times last week.
 ''The Chinese advised that we not demonstrate to the North how anxious everyone is about this,'' said one senior Asian diplomat who is deeply involved in the six-country negotiations over North Korea's nuclear program. ''But the Chinese also seemed surprised by the quality of the scientific evidence,'' the diplomat added, that North Korea had produced several tons of a uranium compound that ended up in Libya. Until now, the Chinese, at least in public, had dismissed American charges that North Korea had a secret program to build weapons from uranium, based on technology it obtained from A.Q. Khan, the Pakistani nuclear scientist. 
 In response to inquiries last week, the White House confirmed that Mr. Green, who is the senior director for Asia at the National Security Council, had traveled to Asia with William Tobey, a National Security Council official who deals with the spread of nuclear weapons. White House officials said the two men were visiting Beijing, Tokyo and Seoul ''to advance the goals of peace and stability within Asia and the world.'' 
 But they did not disclose the highly unusual meeting with Mr. Hu. Chinese leaders do not ordinarily see midlevel officials, but the two men arrived with American intelligence information about North Korea's two parallel nuclear weapons programs -- one program that the North has boasted about, involving the manufacture of plutonium, and a second one that it has denied pursuing, involving uranium. 
 The meeting was intended to underscore the urgency of the new intelligence data, the first evidence that North Korea had gone beyond building new weapons for its own small nuclear arsenal, and may have provided aid to other nations by selling a partly processed form of uranium that can be enriched into bomb fuel. While there is some dispute about when the uranium was sent to Libya, there is some evidence that the transaction took place as recently as early 2003. 
 American and Asian intelligence officials say it is unclear whether North Korea knew that Libya was the ultimate destination for the chemical, called uranium hexafluoride. One senior official with access to the intelligence data said it was possible that the North Koreans only knew that it was transferring the fuel to members of Dr. Khan's network.
 ''We don't know how much they produced, or if it was shipped elsewhere,'' the official said. ''It's one of the questions we have to get answered.''
 North Korea has not said whether it will rejoin the stalled negotiations, which also involve Russia, Japan and South Korea in addition to the United States and China. After a lengthy struggle within the Bush administration, the United States made a proposal in June that envisioned gradual economic aid and investment in North Korea in return for highly intrusive inspections and an agreement for complete dismantling of all of its nuclear facilities. The North Koreans have never responded to that proposal.
 Mr. Bush has often repeated his determination to find a diplomatic solution, in part because his military options are unpalatable: Officials do not know the locations of some of North Korea's nuclear installations, apparently including the site of the plant that is producing the uranium hexafluoride. Nor do they know where North Korea is storing plutonium ''cores,'' perhaps enough for six to eight weapons, that have probably been manufactured within the past two years, according to the C.I.A. Still, the evidence of sales of raw fuel has energized some hard-line officials in the administration, and renewed internal debate about taking actions to cut off North Korea's money and trade, and to destabilize the government of Kim Jong Il. 
 Mr. Bush's aides have determined that if the negotiations fail, they must end with China on the American side of the issue, not on the side of North Korea. ''This is part of a strategy by the Bush administration to get China much more active on an issue that the administration has struggled with, and recognizes is now going on to the front burner,'' said Kurt Campbell, a former senior Pentagon official in the Clinton administration who worked on North Korean issues, and is now a senior vice president at the Center for Strategic and International Studies.
 The central piece of evidence that Mr. Green and Mr. Tobey took to Asia was a scientific analysis of the uranium found in Libya, which has now been identified with near certainty as having been produced in North Korea, intelligence officials say. Adding to the evidence, they told Asian officials, were traces of plutonium on the outside of casks found in Libya, which they said appeared to match plutonium from the North's main nuclear site, at Yongbyon.
 Two scientists who consult for federal intelligence agencies, but have not seen the evidence, said the mere presence of plutonium suggested a link to North Korea, because it leaves a distinctive ''fingerprint.'' The United States, one of the scientists added, obtained a sample of North Korea's spent reactor fuel in 1992 from the International Atomic Energy Agency. Experts probably would have been able to compare the signature of the plutonium traces found in Libya with the sample in the possession of the United States.
 Moreover, they noted, for more than a decade the North Koreans have reprocessed spent fuel from nuclear reactors to recover plutonium. Such reprocessing, they noted, also produces uranium as a waste product often contaminated with traces of plutonium. 
 Finally, the scientists said, the plutonium would contain mixtures of isotopes, or different forms of the element, that would reveal the type of reactor in which it was made.


CORRECTION-DATE: February 12, 2005

 CORRECTION:
An article on Wednesday about a United States request that China press North Korea to end its nuclear program omitted credit for the first report that President Bush had sent two envoys to Asia with evidence linking North Korea to traces of plutonium on the outside of a cask found in Libya. It was by The Washington Post.

HEADLINE: Rice Calls on Europe to Join in Building a Safer World

BYLINE: By STEVEN R. WEISMAN; Elaine Sciolino contributing reporting for this article.

DATELINE: PARIS, Feb. 8 

 BODY:
Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice called Tuesday for France and Europe to put aside differences with the United States and embark on a joint effort to expand freedom in the Arab world, build a new Iraq and bring about peace in the Middle East.
 Reactions to her talk afterward suggested that Ms. Rice had gone far to convince listeners, and perhaps those beyond the hall, of her sincerity, but a certain skepticism remained.
 The speech was given to students, political figures and intellectuals at the Institute of Political Studies. Ms. Rice sought to assure her audience that despite past talk about a Europe divided between friends and critics of the United States, the Bush administration wanted to work with a united Europe on common problems using the power of ideas, not force. 
 ''America has everything to gain from having a stronger Europe as a partner in building a safer and even a better world,'' Ms. Rice said. ''So let each of us bring to the table ideas, experience and resources, and let us discuss and decide, together, how best to employ them for democratic change.''
 Ms. Rice delivered her half-hour speech in the subdued tone of a university lecture rather than a political speech. She spoke in an academic lecture hall, before an audience of luminaries in scuffed wooden seats. 
 Former President Valery Giscard d'Estaing, who was there, called her talk ''the affirmation of a new line in American foreign policy,'' but added that it might have lacked some realism. ''The main aim of America is to see the spread of freedom,'' he said, ''but that is not enough to organize the world. Freedom is not enough to solve all the problems in the world.''
 More pleased was Ernest-Antoine Seilliere, president of Medef, the association of French corporate heads. ''This shows a warming of the Franco-American relationship,'' he said. ''Ms. Rice was convincing, the bearer of simple and strong ideas, the Americans' ideas. She really is Mr. Bush's spokesman.''
 Aides described the speech as the centerpiece of her weeklong tour of Europe and the Middle East, which began Thursday. Its mission was not only to repair the rupture over Iraq and other policies, but in effect to move to higher ground by presenting an array of causes around which the two sides of the Atlantic could rally. 
 The talk did not outline new policies so much as try to define in a favorable way the current state of affairs and win over the French political class, if not Europeans as a whole. American officials said they were pleased at the publicity it was getting, hoping that this would improve the atmosphere before President Bush goes to Europe this month.
 The ideas in the speech were unusually detailed, reflecting a strategy by her team to address deep European anxieties about the United States. Europe, American officials acknowledge, is skeptical about American-led crusades and believes that countries pursue their interests more than their ideals, whether they admit it or not.
 Ms. Rice tried to meet that argument head on, reminding the French that they had joined together two generations ago to defeat Communism and declaring that they now must confront Islamic terrorism.
 ''Today's radical Islamists are swimming against the tide of the human spirit,'' Ms. Rice said. ''They grab headlines with their ruthless brutality, and they can be brutal, but they are dwelling on the outer fringes of a great world religion and are radicals of a special sort. They are in revolt against the future.''
 After her speech, Ms. Rice met with President Jacques Chirac for what a spokesman said were ''cordial and focused'' discussions. A State Department official said it was ''a very good meeting.'' 
 The French spokesman, Jerome Bonnafont, said President Chirac had told Ms. Rice that France attached ''great importance to bilateral cooperation and the trans-Atlantic relationship'' and was eager to ''push forward the political process'' in Iraq but that he wanted American support for the European-led negotiations with Iran.
 The speech came at a moment that French and American officials acknowledged was a propitious one for Ms. Rice because of the agreement between Israel and the Palestinians announced in Sharm el Sheik, Egypt.
 After visiting the Middle East, she was able to report to her audience that she had urged Israel as well as the Palestinians to make tough concessions in pursuit of an accord.
 That comment seemed directed at allaying the suspicion in Europe that Mr. Bush has been indifferent to the Middle East, in part because of domestic political pressure on him to support Israel uncritically.
 ''This is the best chance for peace we are likely to see for years to come, and we are acting to help Israelis and Palestinians seize this chance,'' Ms. Rice declared. Appealing for European aid to this process, she said that if Europe and America shared such burdens, it would enable them to ''share in the blessings of peace'' in the region.
 The speech gave scant mention to the issues dividing Europe and the United States, particularly the differences in their approach to Iran, underscored by American doubts about the effectiveness of the European desire to persuade the Tehran government to drop its suspected nuclear weapons program by offering economic and political incentives.
 Nor was there mention of the International Criminal Court or the Kyoto Treaty on global warming, both of which Europeans support and the Bush administration opposes, or American opposition to Europe's plan to lift a ban on military exports to China. 
 The idea, aides said, was not to dwell on whether Europe and America loved each other or whether they were culturally from different planets, but to issue a kind of call to arms.
 ''Ladies and gentlemen, this is a time of unprecedented opportunity for our trans-Atlantic partnership,'' Ms. Rice said. ''If we make the pursuit of global freedom our overarching organizing principle for the century, we will achieve historic global advances for justice and prosperity, for liberty and for peace.''
 ''A global agenda requires a global partnership,'' she added. ''So let us multiply our common effort.''
 In another way, the speech offered as much insight into Ms. Rice's role within the Bush administration as her vision of the American relationship to Europe. An unspoken but unmistakable figure in the shadows of her presentation was Defense Secretary Donald H. Rumsfeld, who in 2003 spoke of an ''old Europe'' that was critical of American objectives in Iraq and a ''new Europe'' that was supportive.
 In Europe that comment was widely viewed as an attempt to divide the continent for American gain, undercutting what some French diplomats were saying would be an effort to make Europe a ''counterweight'' against the United States.
 In fact, administration officials note, there is a debate among conservatives in the United States and within the Bush administration over whether a united Europe -- the European Union now has 25 members and an economy that competes with the United States -- is good for American interests. American officials said Ms. Rice was coming down on the side that says European unity is beneficial to Americans.
 ''The United States, above all, welcomes the growing unity of Europe,'' Ms. Rice declared. ''America has everything to gain from having a stronger Europe as a partner in building a safer and better world.''

HEADLINE: New Jersey Transit Is Set to Urge a New River Tunnel for a Commuter Link to Midtown 

BYLINE: By PATRICK McGEEHAN

 BODY:
Two days after President Bush threw his financial support behind a rail link under the East River, New Jersey officials are to make a pitch today for a different rail tunnel, this one under the Hudson River.
 According to a study they plan to release today, New Jersey Transit officials believe a new tunnel into Manhattan from the west would increase economic activity in the region by $10 billion and add $480 million a year to its tax base by 2025. By then, a decade after its completion, the tunnel would have helped to create 44,000 jobs, two-thirds of them in New York, the report concludes.
 Those estimates were derived from projections of how many jobs would be generated in Midtown by the additional commuters the tunnel would carry. Transit officials said the current eastbound commuter rail system was nearing full capacity. 
 The economic study is the latest salvo in the competition for federal and state money to pay for huge improvements to the region's transportation infrastructure. New Jersey officials are lining up to push for the rail tunnel, which would connect to a new station under 34th Street between Sixth and Eighth Avenues.
 The project, which would include improvements to North Jersey commuter lines, and the $5 billion that would be needed are a long way from reality and have some formidable rivals.
 New York's governor, George E. Pataki, is pressing for construction of a rail link between Lower Manhattan and Long Island that would speed travel between Kennedy Airport and downtown. That project, expected to cost $6 billion, got a boost this week when the Bush administration included $2 billion for it in the federal budget.
 That money, which would come out of a federal tax incentive package that was intended for redeveloping Lower Manhattan, is being lined up even though the plan's feasibility and economic and environmental impact have not been studied. The Port Authority of New York and New Jersey is already committed to paying $500 million of the construction costs of the downtown rail link if it proves feasible.
 ''The numbers speak for themselves,'' said Charles A. Gargano, vice chairman of the Port Authority and a Pataki appointee. ''With the president's proposal, we have $3 billion. That's about 50 percent of what the estimated cost is.''
 Anthony R. Coscia, the chairman of the Port Authority, reiterated yesterday that he believed a new Hudson tunnel should have first priority among mass transit plans because ''it does actually provide more for the region than any of the other projects.'' Mr. Coscia was appointed by James E. McGreevey, the former governor of New Jersey.
 Robert D. Yaro, the president of the Regional Plan Association, said he considered a new Hudson tunnel to be critical to continued expansion of New York's employment base. He added that he also supported the plan to improve rail connections between Manhattan and Long Island and to build a Second Avenue subway.
 ''The problem here is we haven't built any new capacity in 60 years,'' Mr. Yaro said. ''This is going to come down to having the funding in place and having the political will in place to do these things.''
 The study, which was conducted for New Jersey Transit by Economics Research Associates, says the entire region would grow during and after the building of the tunnel and proposed improvements to commuter rail lines in North Jersey.
 Over the 10 years that the study estimates the project would take to complete, it would create an average of 3,920 construction jobs each year, according to the report. During that period, the regional economy would grow by $4.5 billion and the income of the region's residents would increase by $2.7 billion, the report estimates.
 Once the construction is completed, the ability to bring in more workers would help the economy to grow much faster and benefits would spread from Hunterdon County in western New Jersey to Fairfield County in Connecticut, the report says.
 Outside of New York City, the part of the region that would benefit the most would be an area covering four counties in North Jersey: Bergen, Essex, Hudson and Passaic. Over the first 10 years of its use, the tunnel would help to create an average of 1,475 jobs and add $157 million to the economy in that area each year, the study says. A four-county area to the west, comprising Morris, Sussex, Hunterdon and Warren, would receive only about 10 percent as much benefit, it says.
 Although the aim of the project would be to increase and improve rail access between Manhattan and the west side of the Hudson, the report says Westchester County and Fairfield County would get significant benefits, including an average annual increase in personal income in both counties of $26 million. That gain would come from Midtown jobs for residents of those counties, said Richard T. Roberts, chief planner for New Jersey Transit.
 ''They get a proportionate share of the new jobs in New York City,'' Mr. Roberts said. ''The real message is this is a bistate project that benefits New York in a number of ways.''
 Mr. Coscia said the best argument for the Hudson tunnel is what will not happen without it. ''If we don't build this tunnel, we're going to eliminate the potential for growth, add to congestion and ultimately the region will suffer, not just New Jersey,'' he said.

HEADLINE: Republicans Raise Possibility of Bush Veto to Pass Budget

BYLINE: By CARL HULSE

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Feb. 8 

 BODY:
The chairman of the House Budget Committee, anticipating stiff resistance to the administration's new spending plan, told the White House budget chief on Tuesday that President Bush might need to consider his first veto to hold Congress in line.
 ''There's a number of us that are willing to make some tough decisions, but I think we are going to need a little help from the administration,'' said the chairman, Representative Jim Nussle of Iowa, a day after the president's plan was greeted with a torrent of criticism for limiting spending on a broad range of domestic programs. ''Is it possible that, depending on exactly how these bills come forward, that the V-word might be used for the first time in this administration's tenure?''
 Mr. Bush has sought to work with Republican leaders in Congress and obtain their help on spending plans. Joshua B. Bolten, director of the Office of Management and Budget, told Mr. Nussle's committee, ''I don't anticipate that cooperation to break down, but if the president needs to enforce his spending limits through the use of the veto, I'm sure he won't hesitate to do that.'' 
 Mr. Nussle's remarks, coming in the first hours of budget deliberations, reflected a consensus on Capitol Hill that Mr. Bush's budget was going to be an extremely tough sell. Throughout the day, Democrats and Republicans traded partisan barbs over spending, setting the stage for what is likely to be months of clashes over what gets cut and by how much.
 Democrats deplored the $2.57 trillion spending plan, listing the popular programs it would reduce, including Medicaid, veterans' health care, environmental enforcement, law enforcement and scientific research. They also pointed to what it left out, particularly the costs of the war in Iraq and of a potential major shift in the way Social Security operates.
 ''This budget is not going to put us on a path to balancing the budget -- not in 5 years, not in 10 years, not in 20 years,'' said Representative John M. Spratt Jr. of South Carolina, the senior Democrat on the Budget Committee. ''It'll put us on a path to endless deficits and a Mount Everest of mountainous debt.'' 
 Senator Harry Reid of Nevada, the Democratic leader, said, ''This document is immoral for what it does to those who can't defend themselves.''
 Republican leaders acknowledged that many of their rank-and-file lawmakers continued to object to elements of the spending plan, but they were urging a long view of the economic situation. 
 ''There'll be a lot of people coming into each of our offices, saying, 'My program has got flat funding,' or, 'My program has been cut,''' said the Senate majority leader, Senator Bill Frist of Tennessee, who said he was advising fellow Republicans to take a ''big picture'' look. ''I do hope that people don't lock down in any way over the next several days,'' Dr. Frist said.
 Senator Rick Santorum of Pennsylvania, the No. 3 Republican in the Senate, said that Congress would inevitably rearrange the spending plan but that current economic conditions provided an opening to address spending.
 ''This is the time to get your house in order, at a time when the economy is growing, revenues are going up,'' Mr. Santorum said.
 Treasury Secretary John W. Snow also appeared on Capitol Hill to put in a plug for the budget while he was making the case for the Social Security overhaul, another White House priority meeting skepticism from members of Congress. Mr. Snow credited the Republican-backed tax cuts, which Democrats blame for adding to the deficit, with stimulating the economy. 
 ''We need to keep that going,'' he told members of the House Ways and Means Committee. ''The president's budget is designed to do that.'' 
 Both Mr. Snow and Mr. Bolten came under sharp questioning from Democrats while Republicans accused their opponents of trying to have it both ways by calling for deficit reduction but balking at any spending cuts.
 ''You know, it doesn't take a rocket scientist to understand that if you're concerned about the deficit, you either have to raise taxes or cut spending,'' said Representative Mario Diaz-Balart, Republican of Florida. ''What's very interesting for me to hear is the same people that complain about a high deficit then complain about not enough spending by this budget.''
 Other Republicans expressed misgivings to the administration officials. Representative Nancy L. Johnson of Connecticut said she was disappointed the plan did not renew a request for $25 billion for long-term care; Senator Saxby Chambliss of Georgia joined a number of Republicans worried about proposed limits on farm subsidies. 
 Mr. Nussle, who is considering a race for governor in Iowa, said that he was unhappy with some of the agriculture initiatives but that it was not enough to just carp.
 ''We are all going to have something we don't like,'' he said. ''But you're not allowed to just come out here and criticize it and say you don't like it, and no is the answer. No is not an answer. We're going to come up with alternatives and solutions if you want to be credible.''
 Even raising the prospect of a veto illustrated how uncertain Republicans were that they could force through the spending bills that would be required to meet the administration's overall goals, even if the details were rearranged. 
 Mr. Bush is the first president since John Quincy Adams to serve a full term and not exercise a veto, and Republicans controlling the Congress worked closely with the president to avoid such a public rupture in the party.
 Mr. Bush did make what appeared to be a serious threat against a highway measure last year, saying he would reject it if it exceeded his spending target. Speaker J. Dennis Hastert chose to keep the measure bottled up rather than engage in a veto fight with a fellow Republican in the White House before the elections.

Tolls Sought on St. Lawrence Seaway
 WASHINGTON, Feb. 8 (AP) -- The Bush administration hopes to raise about $8 million next year in new tolls on freight ships passing through the St. Lawrence Seaway, a move the Great Lakes shipping industry said Tuesday could cost it business and jobs.
 The budget proposed by the White House calls for the new tolls to be imposed on commercial carriers using the United States part of the shipping route. The United States has not imposed such tolls since 1986, though Canada, which operates the St. Lawrence system jointly with the United States, has continued to charge them. The United States manages 2 of the 13 locks along the route.
 The $8 million that is the Bush administration's goal would come from the 4,000 annual one-way commercial trips through the locks. The government's plan calls for the corporation's $16 million annual budget to be paid eventually by a combination of tolls, pleasure-craft user fees and revenue from leasing property.

 CORRECTION:
Because of an editing error, a grouping of thumbnail sketches on Wednesday with articles about the beginning of the legislative battle over President Bush's proposed 2006 budget omitted the political office held by Senator Kent Conrad of North Dakota, the ranking Democrat on the Senate Budget Committee, at the time he ran for the Senate in 1986. While he had indeed been appointed his state's assistant tax commissioner, he later held the statewide-elected position of tax commissioner, a job that set in motion his national aspirations.

He has often fought for Mississippi's agricultural businesses. In 2002, he helped support the revival of the marketing loan program, one of the farm subsidies Mr. Bush has proposed cutting.

He is a vocal champion of the committee's budgetary authority against any encroachment, often cultivating alliances across the aisle against presidential dictates. He is likely to find much to complain about in Mr. Bush's proposed budget as well, even though Mr. Bush carried West Virginia in both 2000 and 2004.

He was first elected in 1978, and eventually rose to become a member of the House Republican leadership. Conservatives forced him out in 1992 on the ground of collaborating too closely with Democrats, but Mr. Lewis gradually climbed back.

He was chairman of the Appropriations Committee from March 1994 to January 1995, when the Democrats last controlled the House. He has often opposed President Bush's budget proposals. In 2002, he held up Mr. Bush's request for additional financing for domestic security, pushing unsuccessfully for more money, especially for guarding nuclear facilities.BUDGET COMMITTEESJudd Gregg, 57REPUBLICAN OF NEW HAMPSHIREChairman of the Senate Budget CommitteeMr. Gregg, a taciturn New Englander, has roots in politics that run deep.

He was elected to the Senate in 1986 and is one of several Democrats in Republican-leaning states who are perceived by Republicans as vulnerable if they fight the White House. But so far, Mr. Conrad seems inclined to fight

HEADLINE: Bush Budget Would Cut Millions From City's Social Services

BYLINE: By IAN URBINA

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Feb. 8 

 BODY:
New York City faces deep cuts in law enforcement and domestic security funds under President Bush's proposed budget, but the largest reductions are likely to be in social services, city officials said on Tuesday.
 Under the proposed budget, released on Monday, the city faces the loss of its $207 million Community Development Block Grant, which is used to pay for day care centers, housing, services for the elderly and literacy training for the poor. The city also stands to lose about $31 million from another poverty reduction program that paid for after-school programs and English classes last year for thousands of immigrants.
 The community development grant program now provides $4.7 billion to cities and towns nationally, but the budget would eliminate the grants, consolidating the money from that program and 17 others into one $3.7 billion program. The Commerce Department, rather than the Housing and Urban Development Department, would oversee the new program. 
 The government now gives the money to the city without competition or a detailed plan for how it will be spent, allowing it to move money around to its most pressing needs, said Representative Jerrold L. Nadler, a New York Democrat. Under the new program, he said, cities would have to propose their spending plans in advance and compete with other localities for the funds, although New York would almost certainly receive some of the money it now gets.
 New York City, which is the largest of the program's more than 1,100 recipients nationwide, received about $207 million in the block grants this year, used for purposes like child care subsidies for the poor, emergency repairs in schools, and upkeep of homeless shelters. In New York City, much of the grant money goes toward addressing housing problems, rehabilitating dilapidated buildings, cleaning up vacant lots and conducting lead abatement programs. 
 Carol Abrams, a spokeswoman for the city's Department of Housing Preservation and Development, said the department used about $141 million from the grant each year to rehabilitate affordable housing and to enforce city housing codes. The cuts would mean that the department's lawyers would make about 3,300 fewer court visits on behalf of tenants living in buildings owned by negligent landlords, she said. The department would also have to reduce its housing code inspectors by 130, she said.
 Elected officials prepared for the annual rite of defending the city's allocation.
 ''This is going to be brutal for New York City, because these grants are the seed corn for urban development and job growth,'' said Senator Charles E. Schumer, Democrat of New York. ''Really, they are the single most important tool that cities like New York have to grow.''
 Mr. Nadler said the cuts would mean a loss of about $2.5 million to his district, which includes parts of Manhattan and Brooklyn, or the possible elimination of 34 community-based organizations serving the elderly, the poor and immigrants. 
 The city would also face the loss of the Community Services Block Grant, a federal program that provided officials with $30.6 million last year for a variety of human services, including tutoring more than 10,000 low-income children and helping about 12,000 immigrants sign up for English classes. 
 ''We're bracing for the worst,'' said William E. Rapfogel, who is the director of the Metropolitan Council on Jewish Poverty, a nonprofit group that provides home care to the elderly and runs a food pantry in the city serving about 13,000 households monthly. The group receives about $250,000 from the community development grants and about $200,000 from the community services grants, said Mr. Rapfogel, adding that requests for the group's services had doubled in the past four years. ''There couldn't be a worse time for these types of cuts,'' he said.
 In law enforcement, the budget would cut 70 percent from the Community Oriented Policing Services program. The reduction would lower the city's allocation by an estimated $70 million, the equivalent of hiring about 900 new police officers, the city's lobbyists said. Under the proposed budget, the city will also have to begin paying for the $81 million that the federal government now provides the Police Department for the jailing of noncitizens.
 The budget also alters the way money from the Homeland Security Department is doled out, shifting from a per capita formula to one based on risk assessment. This move will probably result in a larger share of security money going to New York City. However, because the government would shrink the total amount of domestic security spending for programs that are most relevant to the city to $2.2 billion from the current $2.7 billion, New York lawmakers predicted that the city will receive less money than it does now.

HEADLINE: Top Bush Strategist Adds Another Big Hat

BYLINE: By RICHARD W. STEVENSON

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Feb. 8 

 BODY:
Karl Rove, President Bush's influential political strategist, added a title to his portfolio on Tuesday, taking on the post of deputy White House chief of staff for policy, a move that formally gives him what he has had in practice all along, a substantial voice in nearly every issue before the administration.
 Mr. Rove will keep his current title of senior adviser and all of its responsibilities, which include political and intergovernmental affairs and strategy, said Scott McClellan, the White House press secretary. But Mr. Rove, he said, will now also coordinate the work of the National Economic Council, the Domestic Policy Council, the National Security Council and the Homeland Security Council. 
 ''He is one of the president's most trusted advisers, who has played an integral role in the strategy and policy development for a long time,'' Mr. McClellan told reporters as Mr. Bush flew to Detroit for a speech. ''So now he has a more expanded role.''
 While best known as the architect of Mr. Bush's four consecutive victories in his races for governor of Texas and president, Mr. Rove has always had a keen interest in policy. With no re-election race to plan for, he is immersing himself in getting Mr. Bush's ambitious agenda enacted, a critical component in Mr. Rove's plans to build a lasting Republican majority.
 In bureaucratic terms, the move struck some analysts as curious. As senior adviser, Mr. Rove has always operated with a relatively free hand and open access to Mr. Bush. In assuming the deputy chief of staff's job as well, he will take on what some White House officials said were mainly administrative duties. 
 The change also reinforced a perception shared by many Democrats and some Republicans that the line between policy making and politics in the Bush White House is blurry, if it exists at all.
 ''Empowering Rove in this way shows that Bush cares more about political positioning than honest policy discussions,'' said Terry McAuliffe, the chairman of the Democratic National Committee. ''Bush knows that Rove is neither an economic nor a national security expert; he's simply an ideological strategist who has a history of bending the truth and using dirty tricks to get his way.''
 But Republicans said the intent was to streamline efforts to win enactment of policies that have largely been set already.
 ''It gives him overt authority in a way that is recognized publicly and makes it more efficient for him to manage the intersection of politics and policy,'' said Wayne Berman, a leading Republican fund-raiser who is a friend of Mr. Rove's.
 The White House also announced that Michael Gerson, who was Mr. Bush's primary speechwriter in his first term, will become assistant to the president for policy and strategic planning.

HEADLINE: Heat Turns Page As Knicks Play Out The Same Old Story

BYLINE: By HOWARD BECK; Joe Brescia contributed reporting for this article.

 BODY:
It is one of the cruel realities of the Knicks' woeful season that even the rare moments of joy are followed by a bitter aftertaste.
 They skipped off the Delta Center floor late Monday night with a slump-busting 102-99 overtime victory over the Utah Jazz. Stephon Marbury whooped and shouted and slapped hands with teammates, and the Knicks basked in the glory of only their third victory since Dec. 29.
 Yet the fit of bliss would be short-lived, tempered by the knowledge of what comes next. 
 The Miami Heat -- a former Knicks rival, now playing in another stratosphere -- visits Madison Square Garden tonight. 
 ''Yeah,'' Coach Herb Williams said Monday night, ''I know exactly what's waiting for us.''
 Given how rough the ride has been, Williams said, he would enjoy the victory over Utah, ''then we're going to worry about the one on Wednesday -- probably halfway home on the plane.''
 Somewhere over Iowa, the Knicks started to fret over Shaquille O'Neal and Dwyane Wade.
 Contending with the Heat, the Eastern Conference's top team at 36-14, is difficult enough. But as the Knicks gaze across the court tonight, they will also be reminded of their shortcomings and their legacy of poor leadership.
 Five years after their last playoff meeting, the former rivals are now in different universes. 
 Miami stripped down and rebuilt, swung a trade for O'Neal last summer and could contend for the championship in June. The Knicks patched up their roster with overpaid veterans, let their payroll balloon and will be fortunate just to make the playoffs.
 It was not so long ago that the Heat and the Knicks were Atlantic Division rivals and Eastern Conference powers. They met in the playoffs four straight springs, from 1997 to 2000.
 They fought memorable battles, sometimes with their fists. They brawled in 1997, after Miami's P.J. Brown flipped the Knicks' Charlie Ward. The next year, Larry Johnson exchanged punches with the Heat's Alonzo Mourning, setting off a melee that ended, comically, with Jeff Van Gundy, then coach of the Knicks, clinging to Mourning's leg.
 The incidents were viewed darkly at the time. But from where the Knicks stand now -- at 19-29 and going nowhere -- the fisticuffs and suspensions seem like the good old days.
 ''It was fun; it was very competitive,'' Kurt Thomas said. ''We enjoyed going to Miami, too.''
 But it is a rivalry no more.
 Age and neglect began eroding both teams' rosters in 2001, and they plunged in the standings. Realignment took the Heat out of the Atlantic Division this season. Thomas and Allan Houston are the only players left from the late 1990's. The only Van Gundy on the court tonight will be Stan, brother of Jeff and coach of the Heat.
 But the greatest impediment to a rivalry revival is the disparity in talent. While the Knicks wander the depths of the Eastern Conference, Miami is enjoying a fantastic resurgence.
 ''They were fortunate enough to get the big fella,'' Thomas said, referring to O'Neal. ''If Shaq would have came to New York, you never know how you'd be writing the story now.''
 Thomas is correct, but he misses the larger truth: the Heat, stocked with young talent, had the means to trade for O'Neal. The Knicks did not.
 Their divergent paths provide a good lesson in N.B.A. economics and the art of rebuilding.
 The Knicks tried retooling on the fly, trading the aging star Patrick Ewing in a four-team blockbuster in 2000. The deal landed them Glen Rice, Luc Longley and Travis Knight, among others, and began a toxic cycle of flawed decisions. Rice, who arrived with declining skills, was later traded to Houston; the Knicks received Howard Eisley and Shandon Anderson and their burdensome contracts in the three-team deal.
 Even losing did not pay dividends for the Knicks. They were in the draft lottery twice, but in 2002 they traded the No. 7 pick, Nene, to the Denver Nuggets for the oft-injured Antonio McDyess; in 2003 they drafted Mike Sweetney with the No. 9 pick, hoping he could blossom into a star.
 While the Knicks were compounding their payroll problems with journeymen, the Heat began moving in a more constructive direction.
 Miami weathered Mourning's health problems and eventually let him walk away. The Heat also parted with the aging, highly paid veterans Tim Hardaway, Dan Majerle and Anthony Mason. Miami suffered in the results but spent its lottery picks well, taking Caron Butler at No. 10 in 2002 and Wade at No. 5 in 2003.
 By allowing free agents to leave, the Heat also cleared enough salary-cap space to sign Lamar Odom to a six-year, $65 million contract in 2003. Behind Odom, Butler and Wade, the Heat advanced to the second round of the playoffs last spring.
 Two months later, Odom and Butler were the key pieces in the trade that sent O'Neal to South Beach. It was the crowning achievement for Pat Riley, the Heat president and former Knicks coach.
 ''We rebuilt the team in two years,'' said Riley, who was recently in New York for an event sponsored by Associated Black Charities. ''I had to strip it all the way down to nothing and get under the cap.
 ''We signed 45 minimum contracts over those two and a half years, just to try to be competitive. We won 36 and 25 games. We were very fortunate to get Caron Butler, Dwyane Wade, Lamar Odom, and they all turned into Shaquille O'Neal. I feel blessed that I could move on from coaching into the front office and have a good team.''
 Riley was still coaching Miami when the Knicks eliminated the Heat in three straight postseasons. It could be some time before they meet again in the playoffs. But it would seem that Riley has had the last laugh.

HEADLINE: Yield on 10-Year Treasury Falls Below Symbolic 4% Mark

BYLINE: By JENNIFER A. KINGSON

 BODY:
The yield on the benchmark 10-year Treasury note fell below 4 percent yesterday for the first time since October. 
 While the decline was modest -- to 3.98 percent from 4.02 percent on Tuesday -- the move below the symbolic level of 4 percent highlighted the peculiar nature of the recent rally in Treasury securities: long-term interest rates have been held down even as the Federal Reserve has steadily pushed short-term rates up. A week ago, the Fed raised its target rate a quarter-point, to 2.5 percent. Since then, the yield on the 10-year note -- a major influence on mortgages and other consumer rates -- has fallen from 4.14 percent. It was last below 4 percent on Oct. 25. 
 The price of the 10-year Treasury rose 9/32 yesterday, to 1025/32. Prices and yields move in opposite directions. 
 Some fixed-income traders and analysts said the gains yesterday were bolstered by suggestions from the president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta, Jack Guynn, that the central bank might pause in its steady march of quarter-point rate increases. Alan Greenspan, chairman of the Federal Reserve, is scheduled to give his semiannual address to Congress next week.
 The remarks by Mr. Guynn, cited yesterday morning on the Web site of The Wall Street Journal, indicated that the central bank might no longer refer to ''measured'' rate increases. Some analysts said they thought this could foreshadow what Mr. Greenspan might say next week.
 ''That is, of course, the biggest event,'' said William Prophet, interest rate strategist at UBS, referring to the testimony. It will ''essentially sort of legitimize Guynn's comments today, or not.''
 A Treasury auction of five-year notes was greeted with very strong demand yesterday. And some traders said they saw signs of demand from foreign central banks, particularly in Asian countries that fix exchange rates or otherwise try to manage their currencies, and in oil-rich Middle Eastern countries with money to spare.
 ''There's intervention happening in the currency market by Asian central banks in an unprecedented way,'' said David Gilmore, a partner at Foreign Exchange Analytics in Essex, Conn. ''There were rumors today that they were big buyers.''
 The Treasury's quarterly refunding -- yesterday's auction of five-year notes and Tuesday's sale of three-year notes -- has gone ''surprisingly well,'' said Mr. Prophet of UBS, boding well for today's auction of 10-year notes. ''Typically when the market rallies, you get short covering, and I think part of the movement today was people covering their shorts.'' He was referring to the buying of securities to replace those borrowed for a short sale.
 Jason Evans, co-head of government bond trading at Deutsche Bank, said, ''I do regard what's going on in the market as more of a technical trade or a position trade as opposed to a fundamental one.'' 
 Following are the results of the auction of five-year notes and three-day cash management bills:

HEADLINE: Government Says Contractor Inflated Its Cost Estimates

BYLINE: By ERIK ECKHOLM

 BODY:
In a lawsuit that is being watched closely by companies and lawyers involved in the multibillion-dollar federal contracting business, the federal government has charged one of its largest contractors with padding cost estimates during negotiations, allowing the company to reap profits of 30 percent or more on jobs when it was legally entitled to profits of only 10 percent. 
 The fraud suit against the company, Science Applications International Corporation, based in San Diego, involves a series of environmental testing and cleanup jobs it performed at Kelly Air Force Base in Texas in the late 1990's. The contracts, awarded without competitive bidding, paid the company a negotiated price of $24 million. 
 The company says it strictly obeyed the law in negotiating its contracts. But on Friday, in a setback for the company, known as S.A.I.C., a federal judge in San Antonio rejected a motion to dismiss the case. 
 The suit is of wider interest, legal experts say, because it addresses a practice used to varying degrees by many government contractors: overestimating projected costs when agreeing on the price upfront, economizing as work is performed and pocketing the difference. 
 The suit focuses attention on an obscure but important corner of government contracting, where the fine print on agreements or the particulars of negotiations can have large effects on a contract's bottom line. These issues are most relevant to the large number of government contracts that are not competitively bid.
 ''A lot of companies feel they can outsmart the government,'' said Andrew Grosso, a lawyer who has handled contracting lawsuits and who used to be a federal prosecutor. 
 A government victory in the Texas litigation would not only expose S.A.I.C. to large penalties but ''would send a warning to the entire industry,'' Mr. Grosso said. 
 The company denies any wrongdoing, saying it uses a technique called ''quantitative risk management'' to project the possibility of cost overruns due to unforeseen circumstances. The government says the company increased its estimated costs during negotiation to offset those risks and did not disclose those calculations to the government. 
 ''S.A.I.C.'s policy is to fully comply with the law and to disclose all information and data, whenever required to be disclosed,'' said Ronald M. Zollars, a company spokesman, in an e-mailed statement. ''S.A.I.C. disagrees that it provided any misleading cost or profit information to the government.''
 Mr. Zollars added, ''We believe it is a common industry practice to undertake and prepare risk analyses in estimating fixed-price work and preparing fixed-price proposals.'' 
 The Justice Department, in a court document last September, said the company was obliged to tell military negotiators how it arrived at price assumptions but instead gave the Air Force cost and profit figures that the company knew were misleading. 
 The company reported revenues of $6.7 billion and net income of $351 million for 2004. A majority of its revenues come from government contracts, many of them with the Pentagon. It has recently been criticized for its foundering effort to develop new case-management software for the Federal Bureau of Investigation. 
 On Dec. 20, the Air Force, noting that it alone had hundreds of contracts with the company worth $513 million, warned its contracting officers to demand full disclosure of pricing assumptions in future negotiations and to disallow costs associated with hypothetical risk. 
 On Friday, Judge William Wayne Justice of Federal District Court in San Antonio denied the company's motion to dismiss the suit. The company has pressed the Air Force to retract its warning, which it says ''unfairly impugns S.A.I.C.'s ethics.'' 
 The charges against the company were first brought in 2002 by a former project manager for the company in San Antonio. The former manager, Michael D. Woodlee, who filed a whistle-blower suit under the False Claims Act, says the company knowingly inflated its cost estimates, resulting in profits of as much as 60 percent on some of the jobs it carried out under a multi-year ''master contract'' with the Air Force. 
 Mr. Woodlee also said that managers had been encouraged to list higher-paid employee categories on job descriptions, then use lower-paid employees to do the work.
 Based on information provided by Mr. Woodlee, and its own investigation of the company, the Justice Department joined in the lawsuit last September. Under the False Claims Act, the government can pursue triple damages for money falsely received, and the whistle-blower may receive a substantial reward, said Patrick Burns of Taxpayers Against Fraud, a group based in Washington. 
 The lawsuit, while focused on the Texas contracts, accuses the company of engaging more widely in the same pricing practices. 
 The Justice Department's brief, filed in September, said the company violated two major laws: the Truth in Negotiations Act, which requires companies to provide ''accurate, complete and current'' pricing data and calls for a reduction of fees if early cost data prove to be inaccurate; and the Federal Acquisition Regulation, which requires contractors to submit ''any information reasonably required to explain your estimating process.'' 
 The September court document also describes internal messages of the company in which San Antonio employees ask company leaders in San Diego whether they should disclose the cost buffers to the Air Force. The corporate headquarters approved the ''failure to disclose,'' the Justice Department said. 
 In a $2 million hazardous-waste project negotiated in 1999, the Justice Department says, the company described to the Air Force a pattern of expenses that would give it a profit of 10 percent, while internal documents at the time said the ''actual profitability'' would be 23 percent.
 Four months into the one-year contract award, according to internal company documents, the effective profit had risen to 29 percent. By the end of 2000, when the work was completed, the company found -- and did not disclose to the Air Force -- that its profit has risen to 54 percent, the Justice Department brief says.

Eavesdrop and Tell
 Morgan Friedman's ''Aha!'' moment came at a cafe in Williamsburg, Va., where he overheard a man talking on a cellphone with his girlfriend. Mr. Friedman recounted how the man seemed to become agitated: ''He said to her, 'So you ask me how I'm doing, then I tell you, and then you always bring it back to you.' I thought, that was so funny I need to post this somewhere.''
 So Mr. Friedman enlisted the help of his friend Michael Malice and started the site overheardinnewyork.com, where you, too, can post priceless gems you overhear on the street. ''Where better to do this than a place like New York, where everyone's always spying on everyone else,'' said Mr. Friedman, adding that the omnipresence of the cellphone made it easier than ever to overhear all manner of conversation. 
 The only place better for eavesdropping than the streets of New York is at work, they figured, so a few weeks ago they started overheardintheoffice.com. 
 ''The things people say in the office are much more narrowly streamlined,'' Mr. Malice said. ''Not to get too pretentious about it, but there's a sociological aspect to it. It's a chance to take desktop dictators to task.''
 Or just chatty co-workers who do not realize how their voices carry amid the cubicles -- or how ridiculous they sound. 
 Take this item, which was posted by someone who works on Park Avenue and was listed under the headline, ''Yet She Assumes He Understands Her Question'':
 The food delivery man waits outside the office to be let in. A woman comes to the door.
 Woman: ''Who is this food for?''
 He hands the slip to the woman.
 Woman: ''No! 'RING' is what you're supposed to do when you get here; that's not the name of the person. How long have you been standing there?''

Short Short Stories
 Preston Brady III owns a recording studio in Mobile, Ala., but appreciates the written word as well as the spoken and the sung. He saw the Web as a way to bring words to life, and in a more dimensional way than print media could. Besides that, it was a lot cheaper than starting a magazine. 
 ''I can read, accept and publish a story while a traditional print publisher is still going through the slush pile,'' said Mr. Brady, whose site, flashfiction.net is an online literary journal. 
 Mr. Brady, who lists Victor Hugo among his favorite writers and who is a fan of The Paris Review, is clear about what he is seeking: ''A good short story engrosses the reader immediately in a beginning sprinkled with poetry. It promises a glimpse into the mind and spirit of the writer, their point of view on something important, without preaching. It simply unfolds into being, tapping into the emotion of the reader, who will not stop until the very last word.''
 Reaching that last word at flashfiction.net, though, would not take very long. When Mr. Brady says short story, he means short: 150 to 1,000 words. 
 The economy of words aids and abets another of his plans, to publish each accepted story on a coffee mug. ''The mugs will end up in cafes and kitchens across the world, providing a new way of sharing literature,'' said Mr. Brady, who was quick to add that writers would receive a royalty for each mug sold. He is also recording stories that can be downloaded.

Tribal Wares
 Even when Dilwyn Jenkins's body is in Wales, his mind is in South America. The same could be said of his Web site, ecotribal.net, a portal to raise money and awareness for the needs of tribal people. 
 Mr. Jenkins's first trip to South America, at age 18, led to a two-month stay with a disappearing Amazon tribe. After studying anthropology at Cambridge University, he worked as a journalist and teacher in Peru, all so he could be close to Peruvian Amazon communities, particularly the Ashaninka tribe, to which he recently delivered a solar-powered radio communications system.
 After writing travel guides and making documentaries about jungle Indian communities, Mr. Jenkins decided to develop projects that allowed him to help those communities market their wares, like jewelry or coffee, on the Web. 
 ''The idea for Ecotribal has developed as the only practical way that I can personally work for the benefit of tribal peoples, arguably the most marginalized communities on earth,'' Mr. Jenkins said in an e-mail message. ''My idea isn't to storm into remote villages and demand to buy everything marketable. It's about developing long-term partnerships for the production of sustainable nontimber forest produce and what can be produced sustainably from organic forest gardens.''

PERSON: George A. Dudley

HEADLINE: George Dudley, 90, Architect; Helped Build SUNY Campuses

BYLINE: By JENNIFER BAYOT

 BODY:
George A. Dudley, an architect who coordinated large civic projects at home and abroad, including the construction of several campuses for the State University of New York, died on Sunday at his home in Rensselaerville, N.Y. He was 90. 
 The cause was pneumonia, his family said. 
 In the early 1960's, Mr. Dudley led the newly founded State University Construction Fund in financing, planning, designing and supervising the building of SUNY campuses in Stony Brook, New Paltz, Buffalo, Oneonta and Plattsburgh, among other university projects. 
 He also guided public construction overseas. As president of the IBEC Housing Corporation from 1948 to 1960, he built more than 10,000 low-cost housing units in Puerto Rico, Peru, Venezuela, Iran and India. In the 1970's and 80's, he planned or advised Middle East developments like the Kuwait Institute for Scientific Research and the Abu Nuwas effort to revitalize downtown Baghdad. 
 George Austin Dudley was born in Pittsburgh on Dec. 24, 1914. At Yale, where his father was dean of the engineering school, he received two bachelor's degrees and a master's degree in urban planning. 
 As a young architect working under Wallace K. Harrison, who was then chief of the planning board for the United Nations headquarters, Mr. Dudley was assigned to take notes throughout the design process for the complex. He later chronicled the project in his book ''A Workshop for Peace: Designing the United Nations Headquarters'' (The M.I.T. Press, 1994). From 1965 to 1967, he was the founding dean of the School of Architecture and Urban Planning at the University of California, Los Angeles. He was previously dean of architecture at Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute.
 His first marriage, to Mary Bergin Dudley, ended in divorce. He is survived by his wife, Barbara Cooley McNamee Dudley; a daughter, Sally J. Dudley; three sons, George B., John P. and Samuel W.; five stepchildren, Daniel V. McNamee III, George C. McNamee, Dardis McNamee, Roger B. McNamee and Giles W. McNamee; 20 grandchildren; and five great-grandchildren.

HEADLINE: Too Late for Katie, Town Tackles a Drug's Scourge

BYLINE: By JODI WILGOREN

DATELINE: CROTHERSVILLE, Ind., Feb. 9 

 BODY:
John Neace forces himself to pass by the run-down apartment buildings every day. Inside, the police say, Mr. Neace's 10-year-old daughter stumbled on someone with methamphetamine last month. Her drowned body was found five days later at a nearby creek, small hands tied tightly behind her back.
 As dime and dollar donations poured in from around the corner and around the country for the little girl's burial, Mr. Neace, whose $14.75-an-hour factory job barely covers the $400 monthly rent on his trailer, had a thought: What if he could buy the hated buildings, bulldoze them and build a playground in their place?
 ''Katie may be gone, but she's going to live forever in this town,'' Mr. Neace, 35, said of his daughter, Katlyn Collman. ''We're taking down one meth house -- you probably can't take them all down, but it's sending a message. We're taking our town back.'' 
 Katie's Jan. 25 disappearance, and the Feb. 2 arrest of an unemployed high school dropout, have shaken this small town out of silence about the scourge of methamphetamine. 
 Like many similar communities across the nation's midsection, Crothersville, 40 miles north of Louisville and with a population of 1,541, has seen methamphetamine steadily seep into its streets. 
 When the roof of a house behind the funeral home exploded in December, a makeshift meth lab was found in the fire. Another lab, spitball distance from the school, was raided earlier last year. The uncle of the young man now facing charges of killing Katie wrote a letter to the town council two years ago beseeching the members to do something about drugs before someone got killed.
 But many residents said they had been scared to report suspicions in a community where everyone seems somehow related. Others complained that the three-man police force too often looks the other way -- the man who lived at the house behind the funeral home has yet to face charges, and two complaints about methamphetamine use at the dilapidated Penn Villa apartments in the days before Katie's death yielded no arrests.
 Now, as people here comfort the families of the victim and of the suspect, stories are spilling out, in a town seemingly transformed.
 The pastor who preached at Katie's funeral is organizing Crothersville's first-ever neighborhood watch. Shady characters no longer stalk the streets of the one-stoplight town, where ribbons of blue, Katie's favorite color, hang from utility poles and porches. Gone, too, are the bike-riding and dog-walking youngsters, now let outside to play only with their parents, or in groups. 
 ''This town is not going to be known, and these people are not going to let it be known, for a murder,'' declared Terry Gray, the assistant chief of the volunteer fire department, who has pledges for $100,000 of the $400,000 he estimates will be needed to buy the Penn Villa apartments and build the park. ''They're going to be known as a town that took a bad situation and made it something good.''
 But amid the pride in the prospect for change that the proposed playground represents, there is shame that it came to this.
 ''It's changed too late,'' said Misty Banks, who works at the Butcher Block convenience store, where she gave Reese's peanut butter cups and Popsicles to Katie even when she could not pay. ''They've known it's been going on this whole time, and they have to wait until a 10-year-old's dead?''
 Katie, whose surname is that of her mother because she was born before her parents were married, was a fourth grader who loved animals and the Disney Channel. She came home that Tuesday afternoon bubbling about a pajama party planned at school the next day, her mother, Angela, said. 
 And at 3:10 p.m., Katie headed to the Dollar General store a few blocks away to pick up some toilet paper. She apparently swung by the People's Bank to grab a lollipop, and stopped at the Penn Villa apartments to tell a resident that a dog had been hit by a train on the adjacent track. 
 She never came back.
 By nightfall, scores of volunteers were combing the countryside, on A.T.V.'s and on horseback. A state trooper found her body on Jan. 30 in a creek that runs off Cypress Lake, 18 miles up Interstate 65. 
 For local residents, who presumed Katie had been abducted by a stranger, the tragedy deepened with the arrest on murder charges of Charles Hickman, 20, a fixture in front of his family's trailer on Crothersville's main street, just across from the Dollar General and Penn Villa. 
 Known as Chuckie, Mr. Hickman had a couple of curfew violations as a juvenile but no police record as an adult. The children who used to shoot baskets with him at the high school hardly recognized the wan face of his mug shot.
 According to an affidavit submitted by the F.B.I., Mr. Hickman told investigators that Katie saw people producing or using methamphetamine at the apartments, ''so they decided to scare her with the hope that she would be intimidated enough to keep her observations to herself.''
 Mr. Hickman, according to the affidavit, said he took Katie to the creek in a borrowed pickup truck.
 ''Hickman stated first that Collman tried to run away and fell into the creek, but also said that he might have 'bumped' her into the water,'' the affidavit read. ''In any event, Hickman watched, left the area with Collman's unmoving body still in the creek.''
 Two others, including the truck's owner, Timothy O'Sullivan, and a 17-year-old whose name is being withheld, have been arrested on charges of lying to the police, who continue to search for co-conspirators. Sgt. Jerry Gooding of the state police, spokesman for a multi-agency task force of 50 officers, said they had combed through only 20 percent of some 500 leads so far. 
 In an interview, Mr. Hickman's mother, Sandy, acknowledged that her son had been addicted to drugs, including meth, for perhaps two years, but said he had falsely confessed to involvement in the crime for fear of being killed himself.
 ''He shook his head and he goes, 'No, Mom' -- he looked me in the eye, and he never looks me in the eye,'' Ms. Hickman said of her jailhouse conversation with her son on Sunday. ''I'm scared for the whole town. If they don't stop this drug stuff, it's going to happen again.''
 Indeed, the authorities say that up to 90 percent of recent crime in these parts is tied to drugs, mostly methamphetamine, a powerful and addictive stimulant that can be made from cold medicine and farm chemicals.
 In Jackson County, which includes Crothersville, meth-related arrests skyrocketed to 116 in 2004 from 29 in 2002. There have been 187 methamphetamine labs seized in the county since the first two were found in 1998, as lab seizures statewide climbed steadily to 1,549 last year from 177 in 1999.
 ''If we had a brothel move into town, people would close it down instantly,'' said the Rev. Jon Pearce of the First Baptist Church here. ''If we had an X-rated movie house come, it'd be gone within a week. But this has been here. It is a monster. We didn't know what kind of monster it was.''
 Lifelong residents say Crothersville has been changed, like a child coming of age. Marty Hoevener said he checks what his 10-year-old son and 7-year-old daughter are wearing each morning, for fear of having to describe them to the police. 
 Marsha Fink, a bank teller, said, ''my doors are locked now.'' Mr. Pearce is ordering lights for the alley behind his church's gym, and no longer lets children wander out during activities.
 People who had been frustrated with the local police are thrilled that the task force, including county, state and federal agencies, continues to camp at the firehouse, with seemingly new resolve to stamp out drugs. ''Anyone who tells themselves it's not a problem in their area is fooling themselves,'' said Sergeant Goodin. ''Are we stupid enough to think we got them all? No way. It's something we're going to stay on.''
 Neighbors who had not spoken for decades now meet to discuss plans for the playground; Katie's father even met with Chuckie's sister and two uncles, telling them, ''I want you to wave at me as you always do.'' Some 1,600 people paraded through the funeral home over two days to pay their respects. 
 Everywhere, the beatific grin in her school picture beams from buttons, T-shirts, and framed funeral programs. In the Neaces' trailer, a large painted version is propped on the ice box, behind a ceramic angel and under a butterfly balloon.
 Near midnight Monday, after his wife and mother-in-law had gone to sleep, Mr. Neace sat in his worn beige recliner, staring at his daughter's smile.
 ''I thought, now's my time, finally I'm alone, I can do a little grieving,'' Mr. Neace recalled. ''I wanted to cry. I didn't have the tears. I looked over here, and I caught myself smiling at her.''

HEADLINE: Know When to Hold 'em, Know When to Fold 'em

BYLINE: By CAITLIN KELLY

 BODY:
Sometimes, an entrepreneur has to know when to throw in the towel.
 Nine days before Christmas, Jonathan Rosen of Scarsdale, N.Y., shut down Mobelex Designs, the home-office furniture retailer and wholesaler that he founded eight years earlier. In its early years, his company prospered, but then a combination of global forces knocked him to his knees: the Internet meltdown; the economic slump; a stronger euro, which hurt him as he bought primarily from Spanish and Italian makers; and cheap imports from China.
 Not long after, Mr. Rosen did the unthinkable for many in the entrepreneurial world: instead of trying his luck in another business venture, he took a job in corporate America for the security of a weekly paycheck. ''Sometimes it's a smart idea to start a business,'' he said, ''and sometimes it's a smart idea to end a business.'' 
 Small businesses fail all the time. Gene Marks, author of The Small Business Desk Reference, says their average lifespan is about eight and a half years. According to the Small Business Administration, about 550,000 small businesses close each year. 
 For Mr. Rosen -- 48 years old, married, and the father of two children -- it was simply time to trade brutally long hours and a dwindling paycheck for a steady income and a calmer life. ''It's a large burden to carry every day when you are strapped with large bank debt, inventory you can't profitably sell and sales that are diminishing,'' he said. ''You have the payables and receivables memorized. You talk to your creditors and you tell them the truth. But you get tired of making those calls. You go to work every day with a pit in your stomach.'' When he decided to close last June, he recalls thinking that he just had to get it over with.
 By the end, with 2004 gross sales down to $250,000 from a peak of $1.3 million in 2000, he calculated that he would need $750,000 to keep going. And he knew that whoever provided the money would demand a say over his business. ''If I had to give up control of the business, then I didn't want to go forward,'' Mr. Rosen said.
 On his last day in his showroom, his telephone rang constantly as he said goodbye to suppliers, shippers, customers and others around the world. He thought of all the things he would miss, like flying to trade shows in Milan or taking a Spanish colleague to a Chicago Cubs game.
 Taking a salaried job and reporting to a boss would be a new experience for him. He had practiced law on his own for two years, then ran a New York City business with his father for 11 years, selling high-end office furniture to Fortune 500 companies. But he wanted a company of his own, and was sure he had spotted a niche: smaller companies, and the many Americans now working at home, that did not want or need a $10,000 mahogany credenza but might love a $400 computer cart.
 ''I saw there was this huge gap in the market between low-end products like you could find at an office supply store and the high end,'' he said. He was hoping that he could fill the gap with high-quality European products.
 And he hustled. He carried his flat-packed packages through a snowstorm in Manhattan to meet a buyer at Gracious Home, a major housewares retailer. He exhibited at five trade shows a year, from Chicago to High Point, N.C. He sold through his own two Web sites and those of others, and through his showroom, retail stores and mail-order catalogs.
 ''I made a very detailed business plan with spreadsheets and contingencies,'' he said. ''My business did almost exactly what I'd hoped it would do.'' Until the end of 2000.
 By then, sales had grown by 40 percent a year, to $1.3 million from $350,000 in 1997, the company's first full year, and his staff was three full-time employees. Then, he said, ''things started to flatten out a little.''
 ''The dot-com industry was less hot,'' he added. ''In June of 2001, everything stopped.''
 Reliable Home Office, a catalog company that had been buying $200,000 worth of his products a year, went bankrupt. So did another major buyer. Other big clients were re-thinking their lines. 
 And, at least for the time being, he did not need the stress of being an entrepreneur anymore. ''I felt I had good credentials and could be an asset to any business,'' he said. ''I also wanted to simplify my work situation. I looked forward to the luxury of going to work, putting myself into a defined set of responsibilities, but not having the responsibility of every aspect of the business.''
 On Jan. 6, he was hired by the owner of Franzoso Contracting Inc. in Croton-on-Hudson, N.Y., whom he met at a business-networking meeting. Mr. Rosen will supervise residential construction jobs.
 ''So far I find it easier to please my boss than it was to please my larger customers,'' he said. He also has more free time.
 It is not surprising that he got a good job so quickly, in the view of Andres Fortino, dean of the school of management at Marist College in Poughkeepsie, N.Y. ''Businesses are starting to prize entrepreneurial thinking and the entrepreneurial spirit,'' he said.
 Just recognizing that he had come to the end of the line wins Mr. Rosen the praise of Timothy L. Faley, managing director of the Samuel Zell and Robert H. Lurie Institute for Entrepreneurial Studies at the Ross School of Business at the University of Michigan. ''I think that speaks highly of him as a skilled entrepreneur,'' he said.
 Not everybody applauds the decision, however. Rich Sloan -- a 36-year-old entrepreneur who, with his brother Jeff, is host of StartupNation, a syndicated radio talk show on small business -- wonders whether Mr. Rosen did not bail out too soon. ''I believe there's a market for that stuff out there,'' he said. ''People still want the real thing. He should have tried a really aggressive publicity campaign for these desks. They might have made a great feature for something like In Style magazine for holiday gifts.''
 But that was not an option Mr. Rosen wanted to pursue. ''I really was ready to move on,'' he said.
 ''For now, I need an entrepreneurial break.''

HEADLINE: S.E.C. Chief, Under Cross-Pressure, Sees Some Modest Changes

BYLINE: By STEPHEN LABATON and JENNY ANDERSON

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Feb. 9 

 BODY:
William H. Donaldson, chairman of the Securities and Exchange Commission, predicted on Wednesday that the commission would consider making modest, but not wholesale, changes to some major regulations adopted after a wave of corporate scandals.
 Under heavy pressure from Bush administration officials, business groups and Wall Street, Mr. Donaldson denied that the agency was in a period of significant retrenchment, but said that it was part of his plan to reflect on the regulatory experience of the last two years and make some rules more ''cost effective'' without diluting their impact.
 ''I'm not reacting to the 'pendulum swinging too far,''' Mr. Donaldson said in an interview in his sixth-floor office here. ''I'm acting out the plan that has always been here. We would be foolhardy if we didn't try to adjust it with experience,'' he said, alluding to a section of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, the landmark law enacted in the wake of corporate fraud that requires executives and their auditors to tighten controls. 
 Mr. Donaldson defended a recent announcement by the S.E.C. that it would allow foreign companies whose shares are traded in the United States more time to comply with a contentious and expensive provision of the Sarbanes-Oxley law.
 He reiterated a commitment to allowing shareholders to exercise more power, as well as to changing the way stocks are traded and improving disclosure and governance at the nation's exchanges. 
 Calls from some administration officials and business groups have cast a shadow on Mr. Donaldson's agenda. A contentious proposal to allow shareholders to nominate a limited number of rival directors has died, and the agency's decision to extend the deadline for compliance with a Sarbanes-Oxley provision to small companies as well as foreign companies listed in the United States has fueled sentiment that Mr. Donaldson is caving in to a notably pro-business administration. 
 ''Reforms are dying and the agency is clearly backsliding,'' said Lynn E. Turner, chief accountant at the commission from 1998 to 2001. ''Donaldson has largely backed off or watered down many important proposals.''
 Mr. Donaldson has not been afraid to side with the commission's two Democrats on a number of critical matters, including mandatory registration for most hedge funds, a requirement that mutual funds have independent chairmen and some enforcement issues. 
 Many of these issues, and Mr. Donaldson's decision to support them, have been unpopular in business circles. The United States Chamber of Commerce is suing to overturn the requirement that mutual funds have independent chairmen. Various financial world figures, including the Federal Reserve chairman, Alan Greenspan, have balked at the S.E.C.'s proposal that hedge funds must register.
 And foreign companies have vigorously complained that compliance with American accounting and regulatory standards is making listing on markets in this country unappealing. 
 A group of high-technology companies has been fighting to delay the application of new accounting rules that would impose stricter standards on the way companies account for stock options to executives.
 Many groups opposing the changes are heartened by the departure from the S.E.C. of Harvey J. Goldschmid, a Democratic appointee who has been one of the major architects of the changes. Mr. Goldschmid said Wednesday that he did not expect there would be wholesale retrenchment, but that much would depend on who is named to succeed him, particularly because the agency has ruled on a number of contentious issues by 3-to-2 votes. 
 ''I agree that evaluation and fine tuning may be appropriate,'' he said, ''but what's critical is that the important reforms be retained and the commission does not retrench or turn back.'' 
 Mr. Goldschmid and Mr. Donaldson have had a strong working relationship, even as they broke ranks on the question of whether shareholders should be able to nominate rival directors. 
 Mr. Donaldson reiterated his commitment to trying to reform shareholders' ability to nominate directors. ''I am as interested in this as I have ever been,'' he said. ''I am not interested in pushing this under the rug.''
 Still, he has neither put forward a plan nor announced a timetable for consideration of any proposal.
 Supporters of the proxy reforms have protested what they see as the commission's willingness to accommodate business. This week, it told three companies that they could reject proposals put forward by institutional investors in their proxies.
 Mr. Donaldson took a positive view of the agency's recent actions. ''It has been the most active period in the history of the S.E.C.,'' he said, calling its efforts to change the structure of the nation's markets ''revolutionary,'' and disclosure and governance proposals for exchanges as indicating that there is ''change is in the air.''
 But Mr. Donaldson did not endorse fundamental change in how the exchanges are regulated. 
 Currently, they operate as self-regulatory organizations -- sometimes referred to as the S.R.O. model -- and are responsible for rule making and enforcement of those rules. But a number of exchanges have been, or will be charged with failing to adequately supervise their trading activities. The commission's department of market regulation has submitted a concept on reforming the S.R.O. model.
 Mr. Donaldson was tempered in addressing how far he thought the commission should go. ''Before we say the S.R.O. model is forever broken,'' he said, ''we should see if we fixed it.'' 
 He also took issue with comments made recently by a Republican commissioner, Paul S. Atkins, suggesting that regulation had gone too far. 
 In a speech last week in New York before the Bond Market Association, Mr. Atkins said, ''Underlying all my other concerns is a basic philosophical one, namely we must not allow the American economy to be unduly encumbered by a web of regulations.''
 Asked about those comments on Wednesday, Mr. Donaldson responded, ''Put that in the context of what was happening two years ago, the malfeasance and corruption and the mutual fund scandal, then ask yourself if the remedies haven't had their effect.''
