HEADLINE: Don't Dump More of Mentally Ill on the Streets

 BODY:
To the Editor:
"For the Homeless, Practicality" (editorial, Feb. 24), your endorsement of New York State's newest crusade to slash spending by effectively jettisoning thousands of mentally ill patients onto the streets is sadly ill advised.
The proposal, as suggested by Richard C. Surles, the Mental Health Commissioner, is flawed because it cannot obtain, under budgetary constraints, the funds to transfer patient care properly to community settings. Using the news media to float these grandiose schemes is hardly a historic breakthrough, therefore, but rather an injustice. An injustice to the patients, their families and the communities that will bear the brunt of a well-packaged dumping of additional homeless people onto our streets. 
 The findings of the report issued by Andrew Cuomo's commission on the homeless must also be examined in this context, for they clearly document the results of an earlier implementation of deinstitutionalization gone awry.
The commission's comprehensive report placed the number of homeless single adults suffering from mental illness at more than 30 percent. In a year when political rhetoric takes precedence over policy, can we truly afford, from an economic and a humanitarian point of view, another dumping from a system already fraught with problems?
As a labor leader representing hundreds of dedicated employees working on the front line in the delivery of mental health care services in our state, in hospitals and outpatient settings, I take exception to your charge that "special interests" are holding patients hostage to an "archaic system." The bottom line, as always, is money, something you do not even allude to until the last paragraphs.
Until the Office of Mental Health can remove itself from election-year rhetoric and finance the necessary community-based programs, its officials should refrain from publicizing any plans and work instead to provide services for the thousands of mentally ill patients who depend on the agency for survival. Anything less is criminal.

HEADLINE: THE 1992 CAMPAIGN: Primaries and Caucuses;
CLINTON TAKES FLORIDA EASILY, SWEEPING PRIMARIES IN SOUTH; PROTEST VOTES STILL DOG BUSH

BYLINE: By ROBIN TONER, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: MIAMI, March 10

 BODY:
Gov. Bill Clinton of Arkansas dominated former Senator Paul E. Tsongas today in the biggest test so far of the primary season, winning a string of victories in his native South, including a decisive triumph in Florida.
The Super Tuesday primaries and caucuses, held in 11 states, gave Mr. Clinton a powerful lift in his drive for the Democratic Presidential nomination as the race moves on to the March 17 contests in Illinois and Michigan. For Mr. Tsongas, those contests now become critical as he seeks to repair the damage caused by his heavy losses across the South, most tellingly in Florida, the one Southern state where he had hoped to hold the line. 
 In Florida, with more than 95 percent of the votes counted, Mr. Clinton had 52 percent to 34 percent for Mr. Tsongas. In Texas, with more than 90 percent counted, Mr. Clinton had 66 percent to 19 percent for Mr. Tsongas.
 
Warning for a President
 On the Republican side, President Bush won commandingly across the region, with about two-thirds or more of the vote everywhere. But the President was once again given a warning for the November election, that even in Bush strongholds like Texas and Florida, a sizable minority of Republican voters would vote against him. Patrick J. Buchanan, the conservative commentator, won a third of the vote in Florida, a little less than a quarter in Texas and had similar backing in most other states.
Projected results tonight showed that Mr. Clinton was reaching the one-third mark in the race for the Democratic nomination, with more than 670 delegates, including the Democratic National Committee members, governors and former elected officials, or super delegates, who have declared their support for him. He needs 2,145 delegates to win the nomination.
 
Uncommitted Delegates
 Mr. Tsongas follows with at least 340 delegates, but there are more delegates, some 350 in all, who are not committed to any Democratic candidate, including those who were selected previously for Senators Tom Harkin of Iowa and Bob Kerrey of Nebraska, who have both dropped out of the race.
For the President, as expected, Super Tuesday produced an enormous crop of delegates, at least 360, bringing his total to at least 566. He needs 1,105 to be nominated. Mr. Buchanan added only about 25 delegates to his total, now about 45 delegates.
Mr. Clinton, as a son of the South who knew how to use his regional advantage, was widely ceded most of the seven Southern or border states voting today. But Mr. Tsongas had fought fiercely in Florida, hoping that this ever-changing state of Northeastern transplants would prove fertile ground for his message of bitter economic medicine.
The former Senator from Massachusetts found, however, that the Clinton campaign had defined his message for him. In advertising and in speeches, the Arkansas Governor cast Mr. Tsongas's economics as favoring the affluent over the middle class, with economic sacrifice for average Americans through measures like a higher gasoline tax but little pain for those "at the top of the totem pole."
Mr. Tsongas complained bitterly of distortions, but he heads north with a critical strategic imperative: to regain control of the debate.
 
What Tsongas Salvaged
 Mr. Clinton also won a major victory today in Texas, the biggest delegate prize of the day, as well as prevailing in Louisiana, Mississippi, Oklahoma, Tennessee and Missouri. Mr. Tsongas, as expected, won Massachusetts, Rhode Island and Delaware.
Former Governor Edmund G. Brown Jr. of California, the third remaining Democrat in the race, generally ran well behind the two front-runners, although he was stronger in Massachusetts, Rhode Island and Delaware than elsewhere.
Mr. Tsongas signaled the pitch of the coming battle tonight, when he told supporters in his hometown of Lowell, "I'm going to tell you something, Bill Clinton, you're not going to pander your way into the White House as long as I'm around." Alluding to the Southern emphasis of this primary day, Mr. Tsongas added: "Super Tuesday was meant to eliminate someone like me. Well, I'm still here."
Mr. Clinton, for his part, seemed to be reaching out for the change-oriented voters who were drawn in many states to Mr. Tsongas. In his victory speech in Chicago tonight, the Arkansas Governor cast the election as a chance to break decisively with the politics of the past decade: "a choice of more of the 80's versus something new in the 90's."
He also tried to portray Super Tuesday as a decisive verdict on the character issues that have dogged his campaign. "The people in the South heard the worst about me, but they saw the best," Mr. Clinton said.
This was a daunting day for the Democrats, with contests in 11 states that produced more than a fifth of the pledged delegates to the Democratic National Convention.
In the six Southern Democratic primaries, a total of 18 million people could have voted, but only about four million did. Mr. Clinton won more than 2.5 million of those votes.
 
Across Racial Lines
 Mr. Clinton put together a powerful biracial coalition, combining white voters of moderate means with overwhelming support from black voters. He won the backing of more than 8 in 10 black voters in Texas and three-quarters in Florida, according to the exit polls, affirming the fears expressed by Mr. Tsongas that his own campaign was "behind the curve" in courting black Democrats.
The former Massachusetts Senator tried to play down Mr. Clinton's showing, telling reporters as he landed tonight at Boston's Logan International Airport: "I didn't anticipate winning a Southern state. I said very clearly that we had a silver-medal strategy."
But the Tsongas campaign was keenly aware that Super Tuesday sent Mr. Clinton back North with a big edge in delegates and a winner's aura. "The hay's in the barn," Mr. Clinton said as he finished his Super Tuesday campaign. "I felt ever since the first of the month, I think, the momentum was good." The Governor, whose campaign was nearly derailed just five weeks ago amid accusations of marital infidelity and manipulating his draft status, added, "I'm gratified that we've pulled back in contention after all we've been through."
His aides were euphoric. "The race is going according to plan," said George Stephanopoulos, Mr. Clinton's deputy camapign manager. "Now we head into the heartland with a head of steam."
 
Still Angry With Bush
 Other Democratic analysts agreed. "This puts him in a very strong position, and if he can follow this up in Illinois and Michigan, it puts him in a commanding position," said Geoffrey Garin, a Democratic poll taker not allied with any candidate.
Ronald H. Brown, the chairman of the Democratic National Committee, said that the Illinois and Michigan contests, where "nobody can claim there's any regional advantage," will at least move the battle for the nomination "a lot closer to decision time."
On the Republican side, the results showed that Mr. Bush faces a continued protest vote of about a third of the Republican primary voters. Even in Texas, his adopted state, more than a third of those voting in the Republican primary said in the exit poll that they disapproved of Mr. Bush's handling of his job.
Still, the Bush campaign chairman, Robert M. Teeter, said in Washington that the President's re-election drive was precisely on schedule. "We're happy we got eight more wins," he said, referring to the President's victories in Florida, Louisiana, Massachusetts, Mississippi, Oklahoma, Rhode Island, Tennessee and Texas. Mr. Teeter conceded that a quarter to a third of the voters in Republican primaries now seemed destined to vote against Mr. Bush, but he rejected the idea that a good share of them were permanently lost.
 
The Next Battleground
 Mr. Buchanan, who has repeatedly declared his intention to stay in the race until the party's convention in Houston, was already on the next battleground today in Michigan. The television commentator and columnist stressed economic themes, asserting that the Administration's trade policies and regulatory positions contributed to the decline of the automobile industry and of big cities like Detroit.
Mr. Buchanan sought to put the best face on his showing tonight.
"My friends, I know what the returns are saying tonight," he said in Dearborn, Mich., "but consider what we have accomplished in just three weeks. We have torn away one-third of the Republican Party from the national establishment for good."
David Duke, the former Ku Klux Klansman and Louisiana state representative, barely registered in the results in many Southern states.
On the Democratic side, there was never any doubt that Mr. Clinton would run well on Super Tuesday. He began with a regional advantage and carefully cultivated it for months. Moreover, unlike his fellow Southerner, Senator Al Gore Jr. of Tennessee, who in 1988 hoped to use Super Tuesday as his springboard, Mr. Clinton did not have to compete with Mr. Jackson for the support of black voters.
Bill Carrick, a native Southerner who ran the campaign of Representative Richard A. Gephardt of Missouri in 1988, said of Mr. Clinton, "He put together the kind of coalition in these states that you'd put together if you were running for Governor: a biracial, moderate coalition."
Florida had seemed to be the place where Mr. Tsongas could make up for lost time. It was a state, after all, that Gary Hart won in 1984, when he too rolled into the South with a victory in New Hampshire but not much of an organization on the ground. Still, in recent days, it was more and more apparent that Mr. Tsongas had lost control of the campaign debate in Florida, as he found himself answering a volley of Clinton attacks, on issues from Social Security to the strength of his support for Israel.
Ed Jesser, communications director for Mr. Tsongas, scoffed at the results: "He won the South, we won New England, what a surprise." But the road from Super Tueday became a lot steeper for the Tsongas campaign today.

BYLINE: By DENNIS HEVESI

 BODY:
Hans Zeisel, a professor emeritus of law and sociology at the University of Chicago whose studies of the legal system, and juries in particular, are considered landmarks in the field, died Saturday at his home in Chicago. He was 86 years old.
Dr. Zeisel died of liver cancer, his daughter, Jean Richards of Manhattan, said. 
 An immigrant educated in Austria, Dr. Zeisel was a pioneer in the use of applying sociological methods to analyze the way juries make decisions. His analysis of the interrogation of witnesses by the House Un-American Activities Committee was instrumental in the dissolution of the committee.
A fervent opponent of capital punishment, he used his sociological methods to demonstrate that the death penalty discriminates against minority groups. And his work, in association with Prof. Harry Kalven Jr., was the basis for legal changes throughout the country.
"He was an outstanding empirical scholar of legal institutions but, at the same time, had a highly developed social conscience and never put it aside for a moment," said Gerhard Casper, the provost of the University of Chicago and a former dean of the university's law school.
Judge Jack Weinstein of the Federal District Court in Brooklyn, who worked with Dr. Zeisel in the mid-1950's, said, "He did the landmark study on the administration of justice in the New York courts, applying scientific proof and sociological analysis to the court system."
Judge Weinstein went on, "And that was only one of a series of studies he did with Harry Kalven and others that were the pre-eminent studies of the workings of the court system."
 
Effects of Unemployment
 Dr. Zeisel was born in Czechoslovakia in 1905, but moved with his family to Austria when he was a year old. He earned his law degree from the University of Vienna in 1927 and a doctorate in political science from the university a year later.
A leading Austrian Socialist in the period between the World Wars, Dr. Zeisel practiced law in Vienna until 1938, but immigrated to the United States three months after the Nazis assumed power. While in Austria, he and two colleagues, Paul Lazarsfeld and Marie Jahoda, used sociological methods to write "Marienthal," a systematic study of the psychological effects of unemployment in the Austrian town of that name.
The methods used in the "Marienthal" study were the basis of a book, "Say It With Figures" (Harper & Row, 1947), which Dr. Zeisel wrote and which brought him wide attention after he came to the United States. Dr. Zeisel became research director for the advertising agency, McCann-Erickson, and also served as a consultant to the War Department, the Justice Department, the Rand Corporation and the American Bar Association. He also taught sociology at Rutgers and Columbia Universities.
In 1952, he was invited to join the faculty of the University of Chicago and to work with Professor Kalven on a Ford Foundation project, which led 14 years later to the publishing of "The American Jury" (Little, Brown and Company, 1966).
"It proved that, on the whole, there is substantial agreement between professional judges and the lay jury," Dean Casper said. "It supports juries against the argument that they are arbitrary."
"At the time they did their work, jury deliberations were mostly a closed book," Dean Casper said. "The question they asked themselves was what might be the difference between having the jury decide a case and having the judge decide the case." The study found that in one of four cases, the judge would have reached a different verdict.
In 1965, in support of a suit against the House Un-American Activities Committee, Dr. Zeisel analyzed more than 100 transcripts of witnesses who had been called to testify. The analysis demonstrated that the questions had violated the constitutional rights of the witnesses.
Another study by Dr. Zeisel showed that there was virtually a zero possibility that a person charged with murdering a black person would receive the death penalty. A 1983 book, "The Limits of Law Enforcement," (University of Chicago Press), indicated that the judicial system does not deter crime and that emphasis must be placed on early moral education of children.
A small, slim man whom Judge Weinstein described as "constantly moving, eyes dancing, full of energy," Dr. Zeisel was an accomplished tennis player and swimmer.
Besides his daughter, Dr. Zeisel is survived by his wife, Eva, an internationally known designer of ceramics; a son, John of Carlisle, Mass., and three grandchildren.

HEADLINE: Worker Shortages Found

BYLINE: By Reuters

 BODY:
Despite the economic slowdown and widespread loss of jobs, 40 percent of North American companies do not have enough employees to meet their requirements, according to a survey released yesterday.
The Olsten Corporation, a provider of temprary personnel based in Westbury, L.I., asked human resource executives at 1,000 companies in the United States and Canada about their staffing levels at the end of 1991. 
 Of the 427 who responded, 35 percent said their companies were marginally understaffed and 5 percent said many areas of their companies lacked sufficient employees.
At the same time, 14 percent said they were overstaffed, while 46 percent said their companies were at optimal staffing levels.
At the time of the survey, the unemployment rate was around 7 percent; it climbed to 7.3 percent in February.
In Canada, also hit hard by an economic slowdown, 67 percent of the respondents said their work forces were at optimal levels or were overstaffed.
The industries reporting the biggest staff shortages were health care and public services, while banking and finance companies reported the highest staffing levels.
About half of the companies responding had between 100 and 1,000 employees, and one-third had 1,000 or more. Eighteen percent of the respondents were from Canada.
According to Olsten, about a third of the companies said they were increasing their use of independent contractors, temporary employees and sending work out to independents.

HEADLINE: THE 1992 CAMPAIGN: Voters;
Tsongas Unable to Break Clinton's Grip on Several Important Constituencies

BYLINE: By DAVID E. ROSENBAUM, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: MIAMI, March 10

 BODY:
Once again today, Paul E. Tsongas's voting strength was limited to upper-income, highly educated whites, and he was unable to crack into Bill Clinton's basis of support among other Democrats, surveys of voters leaving the polling places showed.
That breakdown was especially bad news for Mr. Tsongas, since the surveys showed the Democratic electorate in Florida to be much more heavily white and much more highly educated than it is likely to be in most primaries down the road. 
 Mr. Tsongas, a former Massachusetts senator, and Mr. Clinton, the Arkansas Governor, more or less split the white vote here, but Mr. Clinton won 75 percent of the black vote.
Mr. Tsongas led Mr. Clinton here among the one in four Democrats with incomes above $50,000, but Mr. Clinton was far ahead among the rest.
 
Split on Educational Lines
 Mr. Tsongas also did well among the nearly two-fifths of Florida Democratic voters with college degrees, but Mr. Clinton carried about three of five of the less-educated Democrats.
The situation was even more pronounced in Texas. There, fourth-fifths of blacks voted for Mr. Clinton, while Mr. Tsongas was able to win only one-fifth of the Texas Democrats who do not hold postgraduate degrees, even those with college degrees.
The third Democratic candidate, former Gov. Edmund G. Brown Jr. of California, won less than 15 percent of the vote in Florida and less than 10 percent in Texas and seemed from the exit polls to have drawn voters away from Mr. Clinton and Mr. Tsongas fairly equally.
In the Republican races in Florida and Texas, the polls also reinforced the conclusions drawn from earlier primaries. President Bush did much better among women than among men, and Patrick J. Buchanan ran strongest among Republicans who say the economy is in poor condition.
 
Primary Wounds Showing
 Illustrating the tensions from the combative primary campaigns in both parties, up to one-quarter of the Democratic voters in Florida said they would vote for Mr. Bush in November if the candidate they supported in the primary today did not win the nomination. By the same token, about 40 percent of Buchanan supporters in Florida said they intended to vote Democratic in November if Mr. Bush was the Republican nominee.
In the campaign here, Mr. Clinton tried to appeal to the elderly by portraying Mr. Tsongas as an advocate of cutting Social Security benefits, but that seems to have had little effect on the outcome. Mr. Clinton was 10 to 15 percentage points ahead in every age bracket.
And the Clinton assertion that Mr. Tsongas was less than a true friend of Israel also carried little weight. The two men split the Jewish vote in Florida. They also split the vote among white Catholics, but Mr. Clinton was far ahead among white Protestants.
The national economy seems to have been a more telling issue. The unemployment rate in Florida is 8.6 percent, well above the national average of 7.3 percent, and few other states have as much empty office space. Almost half the Democratic voters said the "economy and jobs" were a main reasons they decided to vote as they did.
More than half the Democratic respondents here said the national economy was poor, and about 60 percent of those voters chose Mr. Clinton. Mr. Tsongas did better among the voters who said the economy was in good shape.
In addition, Mr. Clinton did much better than Mr. Tsongas among Democrats who said their own financial situation was worse today than it was four years ago, while Mr. Tsongas won far more votes than Mr. Clinton among the 10 percent who said they were better off.
While about half the Democrats in Florida said they were worse off financially than they were four years ago, only about 30 percent of Republicans said that was the case with them. But of the Republicans who said their financial situation was worse, Mr. Buchanan won three of every five votes.
Over the years, Florida has been one of Mr. Bush's strongest states. His margin over Michael S. Dukakis in 1988 was greater than in any of the other 10 most populous states. Even so, two-fifths of the Republican voters here said they disapproved of the way Mr. Bush was handling the Presidency.
In Texas, a state Mr. Bush calls home, three Republicans in 10 said they disapproved of the way he was handling his job.
Mr. Clinton's having avoided being drafted in the late 1960's continues to worry a significant fraction of Democrats. In both Florida and Texas, about 20 percent said they thought less highly of the Arkansas Governor because of this.

 Note: The number of respondents in the Florida Democratic primary who said that they are Hispanic was less than 3%. The number of respondents in the Texas Democratic primary who said that they are Jewish was less than 2% Such samples are too small for reliable analysis.
 
How the Poll Was Conducted
The Election Day exit polls were conducted by Voter Research and Surveys, an organization created in 1990 by ABC News, CBS News, CNN and NBC News. The voters involved completed questionnaires as they left voting stations throughout Florida and Texas.
The Florida results are based on 1,190 voters in the Democratic primary and 1,055 voters in the Republican primary from 60 randomly selected precincts across the state.
The Texas results are based on 1,155 voters in the Democratic primary and 876 voters in the Republican primary. The Democrats were from 60 precincts and the Republicans 47 precincts throughout the state that were randomly selected.
In theory, in 19 cases out of 20, the results from such polls should differ by only four percentage points in either direction from what would have been obtained by interviewing all voters who turned out in Florida and Texas.
Results based on smaller subgroups have a larger potential sampling error. In addition to sampling error, the practical difficulties of conducting any survey of voter opinion on Election Day, including the reluctance of some voters to take the time to fill out questionnaires, may introduce other sources of error into the poll.

HEADLINE: THE 1992 CAMPAIGN: Illinois and Michigan;
Presidential Campaign Moves North for First Big Fight on Neutral Ground

BYLINE: By DON TERRY, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: CHICAGO, March 10

 BODY:
Before sunset can deepen into night over the South on Super Tuesday, the Presidential campaign will hurry north for what many consider the first major confrontation in regionally neutral territory: the Rust Belt states of Illinois and Michigan.
Some are calling this region "a mini-America," with the outcome likely to be especially important to the Democrats. 
 Not only do the candidates have no clear geographic links to the region, but both of the Midwestern states holding primaries next Tuesday are also rich in delegates and diverse in people and problems. They have high unemployment, deep budget cuts, closing automobile plants and fading family farms.
"They're both large states that are very reflective of the national population," said James P. Dresler, a spokesman for the Democratic National Committee. "That's a major reason they're so important."
Michigan and Illinois will also be the Presidential campaign's first confrontation in the heavily unionized and urban-flavored industrial North. A big primary winner here, especially if he has done well in the South a week before, will leave the Rust Belt with "National Candidate" stamped on his resume.
For months in Illinois, from the sky scapers of Chicago to the corn fields and coal mines down state, the word had been that Gov. Bill Clinton of Arkansas had the state sewn up, with plenty of thread to spare.
After all, he had a who's who of Illinois politics on his side. He had the most money, the longest list of endorsements and the prayers and support of black ministers throughout Chicago.
 
Tsongas Creeps Up
 But in recent days, former Senator Paul E. Tsongas of Massachusetts has been nipping at Mr. Clinton's heels. Polls published over the weekend showed that Mr. Clinton had a slight edge, but that Mr. Tsongas had gained considerable ground.
In Michigan, polls showed the Clinton-Tsongas race a tossup.
In both states, a third or more of the likely Democratic electorate remains undecided, meaning so much could change in the coming week.
The third Democratic candidate, former Gov. Edmund G. Brown Jr. of California, is struggling to break into double-digit support in the polls in both states.
"He's a non-factor," said Gary J. LaPaille, chairman of the Illinois Democratic Party, referring to Mr. Brown. "He's going to have the hardest time selling his message in this part of the country."
 
'A Whole Different Attitude'
 "This isn't Colorado where people are looking at mountains and streams every day," Mr. LaPaille said, alluding to Mr. Brown's victory in Colorado, where the environment was a major issue. "In Chicago, you're looking at gray skies and drafts. Your main concern is getting a paycheck every two weeks. It's a whole different attitude."
But Bruce Crosby, a Brown campaign coordinator in Illinois, dismissed the voter surveys, saying the poll takers "can't count."
Before Senator Tom Harkin of Iowa folded his Presidential campaign on Monday, he was given a chance, though slim, of making a respectable showing in Michigan because of his strong ties to organized labor.
Mr. Harkin's campaign manager in Michigan, Denise Sloan, said on Monday that it was unclear whom the Senator's backers would now support. Some would probably go ahead and vote for Mr. Harkin as a protest, she said, while others would support Mr. Clinton. Ms. Sloan said she thought there would be little support for Mr. Tsongas.
 
Clear Lead for Bush
 The Republican race in both states appears clearer and more lopsided. In the most recent polls, President Bush has a commanding lead over Patrick J. Buchanan. David Duke, the former Louisiana State Representative and ex-Klansman, is on the Republican ballot in Michigan but is given little chance of being a factor. Mr. Duke's campaign failed to collect enough signatures to get him on the ballot in Illinois.
Mr. Bush has ties to Illinois and its Republican leadership, which has controlled the Governor's office for the last 16 years. Three members of the President's Cabinet are from Illinois, as is his chief of staff, Samuel K. Skinner.
"On paper, if there is any state that should be pro-Bush, it is Illinois," said George Grey, chairman of Mr. Buchanan's Illinois campaign. "Organizationally, the establishment party here in Illinois has a stranglehold over every major official."
But these days, the candidate preferred by an area's elected officials is less and less important, and that is what Harry Veryser, chairman of Mr. Buchanan's Michigan campaign, is banking on.
"There's enormous dissatisfaction," Mr. Veryser said. "The question is to what extent will Buchanan be the vehicle for that dissatisfaction."
 
Support for Buchanan
 Mr. Buchanan, the conservative columnist and television commentator, is expected to focus much of his effort in the blue-collar strongholds of Michigan, which have been reeling from layoffs and plant closings in the automobile industry. People in Michigan are scared and angry as their plants close or move to Texas or Mexico. Many want job protection, or at least the promise of it.
"If Buchanan is going to do well anywhere outside of the Deep South, Michigan should be it," said David W. Rodhe, a professor of political science at Michigan State University. "This is the place where we're going to see a good amount of Japan-bashing. This is where his message against George Bush on economic-trade grounds should have its strongest appeal."
"But if Buchanan comes here and doesn't do well," Mr. Rodhe added, "it probably means his campaign is in decline."
Mr. Clinton is also expected to spend a lot of time courting the blue-collar vote, the people who have been called Reagan Democrats. In the poll published on Sunday in The Chicago Sun-Times, the Governor scored highest with people earning less than $49,999 a year, but Mr. Tsongas led him by 15 percentage points among the voters earning more than $50,000. The survey had a margin of sampling error of plus or minus five percentage points.
Despite the closeness of the Democratic race suggested in the poll, Mr. Clinton is still the strongest candidate in the state, said Prof. William J. Grimshaw, a political scientist at the Illinois Institute of Technology in Chicago, largely because of his campaign organization and its many allies. The once-mighty Chicago Democratic machine is trying to rekindle its spark and has been pushing its faithful hard to support Mr. Clinton.
The push has been so hard that black and white members of the City Council, who would scarcely sit at the same table a few years ago, are now singing Mr. Clinton's praises in two-part harmony.
Most of the Democratic candidates' remaining time in Illinois will be spent in Chicago and its suburbs, where 60 percent of the state's enrolled Democrats live. Mayor Richard M. Daley is officially neutral, but many of his top political associates and advisers are senior members in Mr. Clinton's campaign.
"Clinton definitely has the lion's share of elected officials on his side," said Kitty Kurth, the Tsongas campaign manager in Illinois. "They jumped on early. But across the country we've had voters' support, and that's the support that matters most."
 
Economy on Voter's Minds
 But winning the hearts and minds and votes here will not be easy for anyone. In both states, the shaky economy is the major issue, overshadowing everything else. Last month, Michigan and Illinois had some of the highest unemployment rates in the country among the states.
The Presidential campaign had seemed very distant to most both states until heavy television and radio advertising began this week. Until now, the only advertisements had seemed to be Mr. Clinton's commercials on black- and Hispanic-oriented radio stations in Chicago.
Mr. Clinton hurried here before the votes were counted on Super Tuesday for an evening of fund-raising events.
Mr. Tsongas is scheduled to arrive in Illinois on Wednesday for what could be the final shootout of the campaign.
"I think Illinois will be a pivotal state because it is the dessert of the Democratic primary season," said Paul Green, a professor of political science at Governors State University in University Park, Ill. "Super Tuesday is the entree, but we're the dessert. We top off the meal.
"After Illinois, it's over."

HEADLINE: Bush Names Aerospace Executive To Lead NASA in New Direction

BYLINE: By WILLIAM J. BROAD

 BODY:
Signaling a new direction for the space agency, President Bush yesterday nominated as its administrator Daniel S. Goldin, an industry pioneer in making civil spacecraft and spy satellites.
Federal officials and private analysts said Mr. Goldin's nomination, which goes to the Senate for confirmation, meant that the National Aeronautics and Space Administration might lose its monopoly over the nation's space program but be more open to ideas from outside the agency. 
 Mr. Goldin, an executive of TRW Inc., one of the nation's top aerospace contractors, has a mandate to achieve closer ties to industry and other Federal agencies, including the Energy and Defense Departments, they said. Most important, he is expected to lessen NASA's dependence on the space shuttle.
"He's a faster, cheaper, better kind of guy," said a White House official, who spoke on condition of anonymity. "He's obviously outside the NASA culture."
Private analysts lauded Mr. Goldin's technical experience, but several analysts and members of Congress expressed concern that Mr. Goldin might not have sufficient political skills.
In recent years, the White House has pushed for the exploration of ideas like inflatable space stations and planetary probes, smaller and "smarter" satellites and radically new launching vehicles meant to cut the cost of lofting payloads into space.
The agency's previous administrator, Richard H. Truly, who was forced to resign last month, had resisted many of these and other ideas as impractical, and his two-and-a-half-year tenure was marked by growing friction with the Bush Administration.
Mr. Goldin, 51 years old, general manager of TRW's Space and Technology Group, based in Redondo Beach, Calif., is expected to be more receptive to White House views.
Mr. Goldin, a 25-year TRW veteran, is uncelebrated in space-policy circles and has no known public record on such topics as whether the United States should join Russia in space exploration. Though a leader in space technology, he is little known to the public because much of his work for the military was secret. His nomination came as a surprise to many on Capitol Hill.
Under Mr. Goldin's stewardship, TRW has built a number of spy, early-warning and communication satellites, as well as scientific probes like NASA's Gamma Ray Observatory. Most recently, his TRW team has worked under a $380 million, six-year contract to perfect space arms known as Brilliant Pebbles, the centerpiece of the Bush Administration's "Star Wars" anti-missile plan. In theory, swarms of the weapons would circle the earth, ready to ram and shatter enemy missiles.
"This is the first NASA Administrator who is an accomplished leader in robotic space technology," said Dr. Bruce Murray, a planetary scientist at the California Institute of Technology.
In the dispute between advocates of manned and robotic missions, Mr. Goldin is expected to take the middle ground. Despite his long work on robotic craft, he is described as a fierce advocate of manned missions and sending astronauts to Mars.
"As the Europeans sent out little ships to explore the New World, we have got to start sending out ships to colonize space," he recently told Space News, an industry journal.
 
Criticized Shuttle Program
 But Mr. Goldin is expected to try to move the agency from its reliance on the manned space shuttles. In 1990, he was a co-author of a policy paper for the American Astronautical Society in which he implicitly criticized the nation's fleet of winged spaceships as troublesome and antiquated.
"The lack of a rapid, reliable, economical launch technology will continue to limit our efforts," he wrote. "We cannot afford to pay the current price for access to space, whether the cost is measured in dollars or delays."
Senator Al Gore, Democrat of Tennessee and chairman of the Senate subcommittee that will act on the nomination, said Mr. Goldin would receive "serious scrutiny" amid what he said were questions over whether the White House was exerting too much influence over space affairs through the National Space Council, headed by Vice President Dan Quayle.
"Mr. Goldin has an impressive record of accomplishment," Senator Gore said, "but his nomination cannot be isolated from a larger, more troubling picture."
 
Political Skill Questioned
 John E. Pike, head of space policy for the Federation of American Scientists, a private group based in Washington, said: "Having been at the same company for 25 years, and having been on none of the NASA advisory panels, he might not bring the requisite political skills to the job. He's clearly somebody who is going to represent the White House to NASA, rather than the other way around."
Mr. Bush made his announcement yesterday at the White House without the presence of Mr. Goldin, who was in California. Mr. Bush called the nominee "a leader in America's aerospace industry and a man of extraordinary energy and vitality."
In a statement, Mr. Truly wished his replacement "every success as he comes to this elite organization."
A senior NASA official in Washington, who spoke on the condition of anonymity out of concern for possibly offending his new boss, said the reaction in the agency had generally been positive with the possible exception of the people involved with manned flight, who felt Mr. Goldin might have difficulty comprehending their work.
 
New York Native
 Mr. Goldin was born in 1940 in New York City and graduated from the City College of New York in 1962 with an engineering degree. He lives in Manhattan Beach, Calif., with his wife, Judy, and two daughters, Ariel and Laura.
After graduation, Mr. Goldin went to work at NASA's Lewis Research Center in Cleveland to help perfect innovative rocket engines for human interplanetary travel.
In 1967, he joined TRW, also based in Cleveland. In its California divisions he continued his engine work, explored the use of lasers to measure great distances, and helped build a large NASA communications satellite. Between 1976 and 1983, Mr. Goldin managed "classified programs of high national priority," according to TRW.
Private analysts say that in this period TRW was the prime contractor on photographic spy satellites known as KH-11, then the nation's most powerful. The company also developed a satellite known as Magnum, which, instead of using a camera, unfurls a giant antenna in space to monitor missile tests, radio, telephone, radar and other military and diplomatic communications. The Magnum, lofted in 1985, is said to be the nation's most advanced "ear" for space listening.

HEADLINE: THE 1992 CAMPAIGN: Primaries and Caucuses;
CITING CHARACTER, TSONGAS STEPS UP ATTACK ON CLINTON

BYLINE: By R. W. APPLE Jr.

 BODY:
With his back against the wall after crushing losses to Gov. Bill Clinton in most of the Super Tuesday contests, Paul E. Tsongas flew to the Midwest yesterday and began pummeling him on questions of character that refuse to subside.
If Mr. Clinton wins next Tuesday's showdowns in Illinois and Michigan and goes on to take the Democratic Presidential nomination, Mr. Tsongas said, "we're going to put up our most vulnerable candidate, whom Republicans will have no hesitancy in investigating in great detail." 
 "Whatever vulnerabilities I have on the issues," he added, "they're not vulnerabilities of character and judgment."
 
Agreement on the Stakes
 In the upper echelons of his party, there was widespread agreement that losses next week would finish Mr. Tsongas as a viable contender. Several senators, speaking on condition of anonymity, said they thought that Mr. Clinton had "already won this thing," as one put it, though all expressed worry about the chance of more charges against the Arkansas Governor like the accusations of an extramarital affair and efforts to avoid the draft during the Vietnam War.
President Bush, the easy victor in all eight Republican primaries on Tuesday, said yesterday that voters "feel I have the experience and leadership." Having reached or exceeded 70 percent of the vote in four of the Tuesday primaries and held Patrick J. Buchanan, his main challenger, to a third or less everywhere, Mr. Bush said he intended to cut back his frenetic cross-country campaigning.
Mr. Buchanan acknowledged that the President held "a prohibitive lead" but said he would not drop out of the campaign. He said he would press on to the California primary on June 2, though he raised the prospect of abandoning negative tactics there and concentrating on explaining his conservative philosophy.
 
Big Lead by Bush
 "If the time comes to exit," Mr. Buchanan said, sounding calmer and less pugnacious than usual, "we will do it gracefully. I would not do anything consciously to damage the chances of the Republican nominee."
But later he changed tack and resumed his usual attack mode.
With Mr. Bush's slightly stronger showings in Tuesday's contests than in past weeks, especially in Tennessee and Mississippi, he gathered a cornucopia of 376 delegates, giving him a total of 582, more than half the number needed for nomination, according to a tabulation by The New York Times. Mr. Buchanan won 26 delegates on Tuesday, giving him a total of 46. One new uncommitted delegate was chosen, for a total of 6.
Mr. Clinton added 430 delegates, for a total of 728, including the Democratic National Committee members, governors and former elected officials, or super delegates, who have declared their support for him. Benefiting from the Democrats' proportional-representation rules, Mr. Tsongas picked up nearly half as many, 199, and now has 343. Former Gov. Edmund G. Brown Jr. of California gained 32, for a total of 89; there are 468 uncommitted delegates. Mr. Clinton is a third of the way to the number he needs for nomination.
Aides to Mr. Tsongas conceded that they had failed to put their message across in the South, where much of Tuesday's voting was concentrated, and had allowed themselves to be put on the defensive. To avoid a repetition, the former Massachusetts Senator began yesterday by questioning Mr. Clinton's business dealings with a man linked to the nation's savings and loan scandal.
When he heard of Mr. Tsongas's remarks, Mr. Clinton said: "I'm disappointed to see him doing something like that, without regard to the facts. He plays a little loose with the facts now and then."
 
'They Saw the Best'
 Other prominent Democrats, including several in Michigan, spoke anew of accusations, denied by Mr. Clinton, that he had a long affair with a nightclub singer and tried to manipulate his draft status during the Vietnam War.
On Tuesday night, after winning six primaries and two caucuses to two and one for Mr. Tsongas -- and winning most of them by a country mile -- Mr. Clinton tried to take himself out of the line of fire. "The people of the South heard the worst about me, but they saw the best," he said, and went on to talk in lofty terms of his future plans.
But yesterday he seemed determined to deliver a knockout punch next week, inaugurating a new, brass-knuckle television attack against Mr. Tsongas. The commercial calls the former Senator an advocate of reduced Social Security benefits, lower taxes for the rich, higher gasoline taxes and more nuclear power plants.
"Isn't it time we closed the book on the 1980's?" the announcer concludes. "Paul Tsongas. More of the same."
The Tsongas campaign plans to retaliate beginning today with its own new commercial. "This is Paul Tsongas," the announcer says. "He's not pretty. He's not very polished. He's not the guy with all the endorsements from politicians because he doesn't just make promises."
The advertisement continues: "He's no Bill Clinton, that's for sure. He's the exact opposite. Paul Tsongas. He's not afraid of the truth."
 
Looking to the Unions
 Both Mr. Tsongas and Mr. Brown appeared to be focusing mainly on Michigan, where the auto industry has dragged down the economy.
In the Republican race, Mr. Buchanan will also spend most of the next week there, hoping to attract the backing of voters jittery about their long-term job prospects. He might also find support in Macomb County, north of Detroit, to which many white workers moved when blacks began to settle in their neighborhoods.
Though unemployment is high in both states, 9 percent in Michigan and 7.3 percent in Illinois, the political situation in Michigan is far more fluid because many union leaders there had favored Senator Tom Harkin of Iowa, who has withdrawn, and are now seeking someone else to support.
Frank Garrison, head of the state A.F.L.-C.I.O., said most of the unions, including the big United Automobile Workers, would probably end up endorsing no candidate and telling their members to do as they liked. A surprising number, he said, may support Mr. Brown, who was endorsed last night by the U.A.W. local at Willow Run, the General Motors plant whose closing has been announced.
 
Urging an Alternative
 Mr. Garrison was one of those who expressed doubts about Mr. Clinton's electability in November.
"He's a battleship that's taken about a dozen torpedoes below the waterline," the union official said. "He's sailing on, but one more bimbo and I think he'll sink."
Representative John Conyers Jr. of Detroit criticized all the active Democratic candidates and said he has urged his largely black constituents to write in his name as a protest. And Representative John D. Dingell, also from the Detroit area, told The Detroit Free Press that he doubted that Mr. Clinton could survive any more accusations in the news media.
On Super Tuesday, segments of the Democratic electorate ranging from 15 percent (in Louisiana) to 34 percent (in Rhode Island and Massachusetts) said Mr. Clinton's draft record made their opinion of him less favorable.
Here are details of the results on a state-by-state basis:
DELAWARE: Democratic caucuses in this small mid-Atlantic state defied tradition. As usual, party leaders urged support for an uncommitted slate, but Tsongas supporters, concentrating on the Wilmington suburbs, narrowly beat the organization slate. Mr. Tsongas got five delegates, Mr. Clinton three, Mr. Brown three and uncommitted three. There was no Republican contest.
FLORIDA: This was the place Mr. Tsongas chose to stage his most determined fight in the South. With a week to go, he appeared to stand a chance, but Mr. Clinton put him on the defensive on Israel and Social Security. Mr. Tsongas ran weakly among blocs like blacks and the elderly and carried only two counties, one in the affluent suburbs of Orlando and the other dominated by the University of Florida. Mr. Clinton won 51 percent of the vote and 87 delegates. Mr. Tsongas won 58 delegates and Mr. Brown 3. On the Republican side, Mr. Bush took 68 percent and all 97 delegates, despite the state's serious economic problems, like 8.7 percent unemployment.
HAWAII: In this overwhelmingly Democratic state, party leaders' wishes are usually heeded. Gov. John Waihee 3d supported his fellow Governor, Mr. Clinton, who won 11 delegates in caucuses, with 8 uncommitted and 1 for Mr. Brown, in one of two states where Mr. Tsongas was shut out. Republicans did not vote here.
LOUISIANA: Mr. Clinton won 59 of 60 delegates in a state where Mr. Tsongas, who got the other delegate, did not campaign. Mr. Buchanan got no delegates, with Mr. Bush taking all 32, but he exulted in having "buried in a bayou" the candidacy of David Duke, a native son who pulled only 9 percent of the vote as against 27 percent for Mr. Buchanan. Mr. Duke, a former leader of the Ku Klux Klan, won a majority of the white vote in his campaign for governor last year, but much of that came from conservative Democrats. No crossover voting was allowed in Tuesday's primary.
MASSACHUSETTS: Mr. Tsongas put on a show of strength in his home state, winning two-thirds of the vote and shutting Mr. Clinton out of the delegate count, even though the Arkansan had strong support from state lawmakers. Mr. Clinton's local manager said, nonetheless, that the Governor had laid a strong foundation for November. Mr. Brown finished second, picking up 13 delegates, mostly in Boston, to Mr. Tsongas's 81. Massachusetts was one of Mr. Buchanan's best Super Tuesday states, giving him 28 percent of the vote and 11 delegates, with 26 delegates for the President and 1 uncommitted.
MISSISSIPPI: This was Mr. Clinton's best state of the day, at 74 percent, and one of Mr. Bush's two best, at 72 percent. Mr. Buchanan, Mr. Tsongas and Mr. Brown were all shut out of the delegates, with the President getting all 33 of the Republicans and Mr. Clinton all 39 Democrats. The Democratic primary electorate is heavily black, which aided Mr. Clinton.
MISSOURI: The only caucus state among the six Super Tuesday states that border Mr. Clinton's Arkansas, Missouri chose 36 Clinton supporters, 39 uncommitted delegates and 2 Tsongas supporters. Mr. Tsongas started late and suffered from poor organization. There was no Republican contest.
OKLAHOMA: Mr. Tsongas's name was not on the ballot because of mistakes by his staff, enabling Mr. Clinton to pile up 38 delegates to 7 for Mr. Brown. Paradoxically, Mr. Tsongas had the help here of one of his few big-name backers, Senator David L. Boren. Mr. Bush won all 34 Republican delegates with 70 percent of the vote.
RHODE ISLAND: Mr. Tsongas barely managed a majority in the second New England primary of the day. He won 12 delegates, Mr. Clinton 6 and Mr. Brown 4. Mr. Clinton supported continued financing for the canceled Seawolf submarine, which was built by the state's largest employer, the General Dynamics Corporation. Mr. Buchanan got a third of the vote and 5 delegates; Mr. Bush got 10 delegates.
TENNESSEE: Mr. Clinton carried every county, with Mr. Tsongas competitive only in the Nashville and Knoxville areas, which are traditionally more liberal than the rest of the state. Mr. Brown finished a weak third, although the Rev. Jesse Jackson campaigned with him here. Mr. Clinton won Memphis 11 to 1 and collected 56 delegates over all to Mr. Tsongas's 12. Former Senator Howard H. Baker Jr. helped Mr. Bush to his strongest showing of Super Tuesday. The President picked up 73 percent of the vote and 23 of the 33 delegates, the rest going to Mr. Buchanan.
TEXAS: Results were a major disappointment to Mr. Tsongas, who had hoped to carry the Austin area and make a respectable showing elsewhere. He lost Austin to Mr. Clinton, 2 to 1, with Mr. Brown close behind. In Beaumont, the most blue-collar industrial city in Texas, not unlike some Illinois and Michigan cities, Mr. Clinton won by 5 to 1. Mr. Tsongas did best in the largely white suburbs of Dallas, Houston and Austin. Mr. Clinton won 95 delegates, Mr. Tsongas 28, Mr. Brown 1, with delegate distribution for one Congressional districts still undecided. Among the Republicans, Mr. Bush got 70 percent of the popular vote and swept all 121 delegates.

Singing a Song of Nationhood (Lento, Pianissimo)

BYLINE: By JANE PERLEZ, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: ASMARA, Ethiopia

 BODY:
Since rebel forces swept through this Italianate city atop the East African highlands last May and secured the birth of a new nation, a surge of symbolic and material changes have convinced the world that this place is no longer really Ethiopia.
But until a referendum is held, around May 1993, Eritrea officially remains neither a nation nor a province of Ethiopia. Until the referendum, the Eritreans say, they are not asking for membership in the United Nations or formal recognition. 
 The nine peoples who live here nonetheless consider themselves Eritreans and now, free after 30 years of Ethiopian occupation, they are doing everything to show it.
The official Amharic language of Ethiopia has been discarded, for example, and new postage stamps are inscribed "Eritrea."
 
Who Won, Who Lost
 As the former Soviet republics establish themselves as new nations and receive almost instant recognition from world bodies, this remote area is going through what many consider a similar process without the international fanfare.
The sense of nationalism here is embedded in high sacrifice: 50,000 Eritreans out of 3.3 million were killed in the war of independence, according to the Eritrean People's Liberation Front. (Ethiopia has never said how many of its people died.)
But Eritreans are also different through historical experience: Eritrea was colonized by Italians for five decades, beginning in 1890; Ethiopia was ruled by Italy only briefly.
Instead of declaring independence with the Eritreans' victory last May, as many wanted him to, the front's leader, Isaias Afewerki, chose the more legalistic and, he hoped, internationally respected route of a referendum within two years.
 
Whom to Help, and How
 Whatever the future, the uncertain status today presents problems, mostly financial, for a drought-stricken and war-devastated region, 80 percent of whose people live on foreign food aid.
"Its legal position as an aid recipient is uncertain," said Trevor Page, the senior United Nations official here. Because Eritrea is not formally a nation, it is not eligible for loans from the World Bank or the International Monetary Fund, he said. But food and other aid faces no such restrictions and is arriving by ship in Massawa, on the Red Sea.
In the last few months, the pace of visits by Western donors to Asmara, the capital, has quickened, giving the Eritreans heart that infusions of economic assistance to rebuild industries are on the way from the United States, Britain and Italy, which has opened a consulate here. Italy signed a protocol in February to supply $90 million in aid.
Italian colonists designed the mostly sienna-hued Asmara, eventually using the territory as a base from which they established their brief rule in Ethiopia. They stayed until the British drove them out in World War II. Britain gave Eritrea to Ethiopia in 1952 as part of a federation.
The long Italian presence in Eritrea resulted in textile mills, a brewery and other commercial enterprises that gave Eritrea skills and a trading edge over Ethiopia.
"We are calling on anyone to come and invest in the country." said Yemane Gebre Ab, the head of the information department. "This is no time for us to be choosy," he added, brushing aside some anti-Italian sentiment among the population.
Officials from the United States Agency for International Development visited Eritrea in February and left promising about $26 million in aid, Congress permitting.
It is expected that the United States will open a consulate and A.I.D. mission in Asmara by the middle of the year, an American diplomat said, adding that Washington was heartened by an investment code announced last month that delineated a market-directed economy.
The slow pace of economic assistance does not seem to have deflated the spirit among a population that is still reveling in late-night cafes after many years of curfews at dusk.
"We're patient," said Sabu Mebrahtu, a pharmacist, whose store has more plentiful supplies of medicines than are available in the Ethiopian capital, Addis Ababa. "We're enjoying our peace."
 
Those Who Fought the War
 The Eritrean front was well-known among African guerrilla groups for its self-reliance in the field and its well-educated top cadre, many of whom were the sons and daughters of the Asmara middle-class. Many have returned to Asmara to establish for the civilian population what they accomplished in the northern mountains as guerrillas.
Senay Jesus Kifle, who during the war established a sophisticated pharmaceutical factory in the mountains, is now working at one of Asmara's hospitals on plans for a much larger plant. There were prospects, he said, for a partnership with a multinational company for the manufacture of a treatment for tuberculosis that the Eritreans had developed.
But perhaps one of the more visible signs of improvement for consumers since the Ethiopians were vanquished was the appearance in February of 25-year-old Coca-Cola trucks spruced up with shiny red and white paint. The first deliveries in seven years are planned for March.

HEADLINE: THE 1992 CAMPAIGN: Political Memo;
Super Tuesday's Warm Glow Fails Clinton in Cold Chicago

BYLINE: By GWEN IFILL, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: CHICAGO, March 11

 BODY:
Gov. Bill Clinton of Arkansas should have been euphoric this morning on what his advisers were convinced was the first day of the general election campaign.
But four of the first questions at his news conference with Chicago's Mayor, Richard M. Daley, went something like this:
Do you think your marital problems will stop you from winning the white Catholic vote in Illinois? 
 Aren't your new advertisements about Paul Tsongas misleading?
Why isn't Mayor Daley endorsing you?
Isn't your message too moderate for Northern voters?
 
No Endorsement
 Like a splash of cold water that roughly matched the blast of winter air that greeted the Clinton entourage when it arrived here yesterday from the politically agreeable South, Mr. Clinton was confronted with the rough-and-tumble world of big-city politics today.
For a man who should have been feeling like a political giant, nothing seemed to be going quite right. Mayor Daley, who consented to meet and have his photograph taken with Mr. Clinton, had only kind words about the Arkansas Governor.
"I think Governor Clinton brings hope and brings some light at the end of the tunnel for people here in Chicago and throughout the country in his race for the Presidency," Mr. Daley said. But when a reporter asked if those words translated into an endorsement, he replied curtly, "No."
In response to one question about the meaning of the joint appearance, Mr. Daley insisted that such image issues were the province of the press, not politicians.
 
Importance of Florida
 No matter what questions and challenges Mr. Clinton runs into in the days leading up to next week's primaries here in Illinois and in Michigan, his aides remain convinced that the most crucial test against Paul E. Tsongas, the former Massachusetts Senator, occurred Tuesday in Florida.
"This race has always been about Clinton," one adviser said. "It's never been about anybody else. Once we had a big victory, it was over."
 
Tough on Tsongas
Clinton aides realized that they were going to win big in Florida a week ago, campaign officials said, when their private polling showed a 13-point overnight increase after Mr. Clinton's victory in the Georgia primary on March 3.
But if his advisers have set aside the Tsongas challenge, Mr. Clinton has not. Asked about the tough advertising campaign in which he has begun attacking Mr. Tsongas's economic proposals, Mr. Clinton responded quickly and harshly.
"As far as I know, the only outright false ad that any candidate of either party has put on was put on by Paul Tsongas," he said.
And when he learned that Mr. Tsongas had made a reference today to his questionable business dealings with the head of a failing savings and loan in the 1970's and 80's, Mr. Clinton dismissed the matter as "the most ridiculous thing I've ever heard of," accused Mr. Tsongas of "playing fast and loose with the facts" and said it was "a real sign of desperation on his part to attack me personally."
And soon his staff was passing out to reporters copies of a 1983 letter from the National Council of Savings Institutions that listed a series of actions that then-Senator Tsongas had taken to help deregulate the savings and loan industry.
Mr. Clinton told reporters today: "I am trying to let people know the differences between Senator Tsongas and myself. Let me remind you how the negative campaign began."
He also showed that some of Mr. Tsongas's statements accusing him of pandering to voters have hit their mark. After a Chicago Sun-Times reporter suggested that Mayor Daley might be on Mr. Clinton's list of Vice Presidential prospects, Mr. Clinton denied it so emphatically that he left the reporters in the room slightly stunned.
"I was not pandering to the Mayor or anyone else," Mr. Clinton continued after offering a blow-by-blow reconstruction of his conversation with the Chicago reporter. "I didn't ask him for his endorsement today."
Mr. Daley glowered on one side of the podium; Mr. Clinton frowned on the other. The cameras flashed.
"I was not buttering up the Mayor," Mr. Clinton declared.

HEADLINE: British Election Is Called April 9; Battle Seen as Tough but Less Ideological

BYLINE: By CRAIG R. WHITNEY, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: LONDON, March 11

 BODY:
After months of waiting in vain for the British economy and his Conservative Party's public opinion poll ratings to pull out of the doldrums, Prime Minister John Major bowed to the inevitable today and called a national election for April 9.
Mr. Major, who became Prime Minister in November 1990 after a Tory rebellion against Margaret Thatcher's leadership, will battle for a mandate of his own in the middle of the longest British recession since the 1930's. Neil Kinnock, leader of the resurgent opposition Labor Party, seeks to displace the Conservatives for the first time since 1979. 
 For months, Britain's two main parties have been so close in the polls that an election stalemate has seemed a possibility, with neither party winning the 326 seats required for a governing majority in the 651-seat House of Commons. In this case, the third party, the Liberal Democrats, who stand to win about 15 percent of the popular vote if the polls are right, could play a pivotal role.
Mr. Major went to Buckingham Palace to see Queen Elizabeth II shortly after noon today to ask her to dissolve Parliament next Monday. After returning to 10 Downing Street, he came out on the steps and announced the election date. After months of pre-election maneuvering, a sort of "phony war" campaign, the announcement came as no surprise.
 
'Utterly Confident,' Major Says
 "Up and down the country there is no doubt that business wants such a decision," Mr. Major said. "I am utterly confident we will win the election and we will win the election with a working majority."
Mr. Kinnock expressed similar optimism. "We will work to insure that our country succeeds, and we will start in just a few weeks time," he said, "and, with the support of the British people, we will form the new government Britain so badly needs."
The British electoral system, unlike the American one, does not have fixed election dates, though each election produces a Parliament that can last as long as five years. The Prime Minister has the prerogative of going to Buckingham Palace when the chances of winning seem best and asking for a writ to dissolve Parliament and call an election. The election must be no sooner than 17 working days after Parliament is dissolved.
Mr. Major may have missed his best moment just after the war in the Persian Gulf last year, when his popularity was at its peak, because he thought an election then would look like a cheap shot, his aides say.
Now he will campaign with national unemployment at 9.2 percent and rising, business failures running at a rate of more than 200 a day, separatist sentiment boiling in Scotland, and some of the most loyal supporters of Mrs. Thatcher charging that he has betrayed her legacy.
Like all recent British election campaigns, this one promises to be fast-paced and no-holds-barred. But the issues are no longer the momentous ones they often seemed in the last decade, when highly individualistic, private-enterprise Thatcherism pitted itself against welfare-state socialism and won, in 1979, 1983 and 1987.
 
Toward the Middle Ground
 Mr. Major, 48 years old, an unassuming man as politicians go, is hardly Mrs. Thatcher, and the oratorically gifted Mr. Kinnock, 49, is not the firebrand of early campaigns. (Mr. Kinnock turns 50 on March 28; Mr. Major will be 49 on March 29.)
Mr. Kinnock, even though he was Labor's leader in the 1987 contest, acknowledges that his party really had little chance of winning the last three elections, dominated as it was by militant labor unions and with groups that favored state control of the means of production and unilateral nuclear disarmament.
And many Conservative legislators were persuaded two years ago that there was no way their party could win this election with Mrs. Thatcher in charge. She had alienated some by cutting social benefits and championing undiluted free-market economics during a time of recession, and others with her suspicious view of Europeaqn unity.
Mr. Major has taken the Conservatives back toward the middle ground of pre-Thatcher postwar politics.
Mr. Kinnock's Labor Party, in contrast to its positions of a decade and more ago, backs a British nuclear deterrent and enthusiastically supports Britain's membership in the European Community. It would not privatize British Rail, as the Conservatives plan to do, but it has no clear plans to return to national ownership any of the great enterprises that Mrs. Thatcher sold off except the 16 national water companies.
So this campaign is unlikely to have much of the ideological charge of the last three. It promises instead to be basically about personalities and taxes.
A recent national poll showed that Mr. Major's "satisfaction ratings" with voters had come down since the days of the gulf war, when 61 percent said they were satisfied and only 15 percent were dissatisfied with him; in late February, the figures were 48 to 44. Mr. Kinnock's ratings last month were 54 percent dissatisfied as opposed to 36 percent satisfied, down from 44 percent who were satisfied with him in January 1991.
 
Recession Is Issue
 "Major's not running against Major a year ago," said Robert M. Worcester, chairman of the firm that took the poll, Mori. "He's running against Kinnock today, and for over a year, Kinnock has really failed to make up the ground."
Mr. Kinnock has spent much of his time leading up to the formal start of the campaign trying to get Mr. Major's Government to accept the blame for the current recession, which worsened when the Government imposed high interest rates after letting inflation get out of control in 1988.
Mr. Major prefers to blame the worldwide recession for Britain's troubles. On Tuesday, his Chancellor of the Exchequer, Norman Lamont, announced what amounted to a tax cut of $172 this year for every taxpayer in the country, one that will most help those at the low end of the scale, who like everyone else will pay 20 percent instead of 25 percent on the first $3,440 of taxable income.
The Government's budget also assumes a very un-Thatcherite budget deficit of $48.2 billion in the fiscal year that begins in April. The pound weakened on European currency markets after the election announcement, making it unlikely that the Government can reduce interest rates from current double-digit levels and give mortgage payers a break before Britons vote.
The Conservatives had already reduced income taxes, from 83 percent for the wealthiest when Mrs. Thatcher took office in 1979 to 40 percent now, and from 40 percent to 25 percent for the vast majority of middle-income taxpayers. Labor has promised to rescind the latest cut if it is elected and raise taxes on those earning more than about $60,000 a year -- to 59 percent, including social security tax.
 
More for Public Services
 The country needs to spend more on public services, Labor says, after the Conservative Party let the rich run rampant; London's subway, the Underground, has become shabby and graffiti-ridden, the trains run filthy and late, and the free National Health Service has run short of money.
Mr. Major has rid himself of the most unpopular of Mrs. Thatcher's policies, including the disastrous per-capita "community charge," a local government tax that was the same for rich and poor in every locality. He has moved away from her insistence that the free market is the best solution to every problem and toward an idea of partnership among state, labor, and industry to advance the British economy that is not all that different from the modern Labor Party's.
In Scotland, where the small Scottish National Party has made inroads against Labor and all but banished the Conservatives on a platform of secession from Britain, Labor is committed to setting up a Scottish parliament with its own independent local powers of taxation and legislation. Labor also holds out the promise of more autonomy for Wales and the regions of England.
The Liberal Democrats' leader, Paddy Ashdown, warned both Labor and Conservatives against trying to form a minority government after the election, and predicted that the campaign would be "the most dirty we have seen for many a long year."
He has said he will insist on reform of the electoral system as the price of cooperation with either party, to achieve his goal of a proportional representation system that will give small parties more seats in Parliament.

HEADLINE: THE 1992 CAMPAIGN: Democrats;
Tsongas, Seeking Broader Base, Reaches Out to Blacks in Chicago

BYLINE: By RICHARD L. BERKE, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: CHICAGO, March 11

 BODY:
Eager to shed his image as the candidate for high-brow and high-income voters, Paul E. Tsongas today plunged into one of this city's toughest neighborhoods to open his campaign in the industrial Midwest.
Stung by his overwhelming defeats in the South and by his failure to draw significant support from minorities and working-class voters in his quest for the Democratic Presidential nomination, Mr. Tsongas picked the all-black William R. Harper Senior High School in the crime-torn neighborhood of West Englewood to talk about inclusion and economic hope. 
 "Part of what being a President is about is making everybody feel we're all in this together," he told students gathered in the school's library. "Don't give us a middle-class tax cut for our children if they're going to have to pay for it. Give us a job."
Surveys of voters leaving the polling places in earlier primaries show that Mr. Tsongas's strength is among well educated, financially comfortable white voters. To win the Illinois and Michigan contests, political analysts say, the former Senator from Massachusetts must broaden his base to draw from the coalition of minorities, ethnic groups and working-class Democrats that gave Gov. Bill Clinton of Arkansas a big edge on Tuesday.
 
The Remedy: Try Harder
 Mr. Tsongas and his advisers acknowledge the problem and say the remedy is not to retool his message, but to court those groups more forcefully.
"He's offering working people economic hope," said Dennis Kanin, Mr. Tsongas's campaign manager. "He's saying the most important issue in this campaign is jobs and people's economic future. In the black community, it's basically a question of more aggressively exposing voters to Paul's ideas. The more they see him as a person, the more they like him."
But with only one week before the primary in Illinois and Michigan, Mr. Tsongas is fighting against time and the far better organized campaign of Mr. Clinton, who has wide support in the black political establishment.
Don Rose, a Democratic consultant here, said that while it was too late for Mr. Tsongas to make major inroads among black voters, he could make gains among white ethnic voters. "Tsongas probably has a lot of hay to make in suburban and ethnic areas by making it a character race rather than an issues race," Mr. Rose said.
Perhaps recognizing the potential effect of the character issue, Mr. Tsongas intensified his criticism today of Mr. Clinton's suitability to be President, declaring that the Arkansan would be "the most vulnerable" Democrat in the general election.
 
The Electability Argument
 Asked about broadening his appeal and countering efforts by Mr. Clinton to depict him as a closet Republican, Mr. Tsongas said his more moderate economic views made him popular among independents and disaffected Republicans, and thus would make him more electable in the fall.
"I make no apology for the fact that even though I'm liberal on social issues I can appeal to Republicans," the candidate said in an interview. "The charges may hurt me now, but if we get past the nomination we're going to be in very good shape."
But political analysts say the electability argument may have little resonance with voters in the primaries who fear that Mr. Tsongas may be too much like a Republican.
David Axelrod, a Clinton strategist here, said Mr. Tsongas lacked a compelling message that would appeal to working-class and minority voters. "His message has been basically aimed at board rooms and not living rooms," Mr. Axelrod said, "and that's his fundamental problem."
Mr. Tsongas's backers are hard pressed to deliver an argument as to why working-class and minority voters should support him, short of repeating that his plan to rebuild the economy would benefit everyone.
"The blue-collar vote that we may not be getting at the moment will benefit from his overall leadership," said Barry B. White, the Tsongas campaign chairman. "We will be expanding the message to show that he will help the traditional Democrats as well as middle-of-the-road Republicans."

HEADLINE: THE 1992 CAMPAIGN: The Incumbent;
Bush Turns to November, Feeling Buchanan's Challenge Has Been Defeated

BYLINE: By MICHAEL WINES, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, March 11

 BODY:
Apparently convinced that he has quelled the renegade candidacy of Patrick J. Buchanan, President Bush today began to shift his political energy away from a revolt by his conservative supporters and toward the more formidable job of rebuilding his standing among voters of all stripes.
The President signaled what amounts to the beginning of his campaign for the November election at a White House news conference. He declared that he has "responsibilities that no other candidate has for leading this country and for being the President," and that he will pare his political travel to tend to the nation's problems. 
Mr. Bush also implicitly invited Mr. Buchanan to end his candidacy, asserting that most Buchanan supporters will vote for him in November and that Mr. Buchanan himself would be welcomed should he decide to rejoin the ranks of the President's backers.
The President's political advisers said Mr. Bush would now concentrate on convincing voters that he has a workable plan to restore the nation's economic and moral strength and, equally important, that his Democratic rivals do not. That effort will begin in earnest on March 20, the deadline Mr. Bush set in his State of the Union speech for Congress to enact legislation that he has proposed to stimulate the economy but which congressional Democrats already have rejected.
 
Defections Stemmed

 
 Mr. Bush's strategists plan to highlight the passing of the deadline with a carefully staged event, like an Oval Office speech, a prime-time televised news conference or an address to Congress. None has been chosen, although aides are leaning away from a nighttime speech, one White House official said today. Networks have not carried some such speeches before.
This campaign will continue throughout the spring, when Mr. Bush will deliver a series of speeches outlining his view of the issues in the November election, veto any Democratic economic package that does not conform to his plan, and take action to stimulate the economy that does not need Congress's approval.
The shift from conservative stump-speaker back to Rose Garden leader has actually been in the works for several weeks, Mr. Bush's strategists said. It is driven by a lull in the primary season between next Tuesday's contests in Illinois and Michigan and early May.
But it has been made possible only by the voting in this week's Super Tuesday primaries, in which Mr. Buchanan largely failed to widen the defection of disaffected voters from Mr. Bush's camp, and the President scored several compelling victories. Mr. Bush's advisers also concede that the quarter or so of Republican voters who have consistently backed Mr. Buchahanan are unlikely to return to the fold during the remaining prmaries unless the economy improves.
"If we'd had the luxury of not having to run a primary campaign, we'd already have begun to lay out the facts of George Bush's vision of America," James Lake, a senior issues adviser to Mr. Bush's campaign, said today. "As of today, that campaign, for all practical purposes, is over."
While the President will make other ostensibly nonpolitical trips in coming months to promote his economic-growth legislation, aides said, there will be little of the campaign barnstorming that has characterized his travels since last month's New Hampshire primary election.
 
Getting Beyond a Slogan

 
 In the 20 days that ended on Saturday, the President traveled to 22 cities in 11 states. The crusade amounted to a furious courtship of Republicans who were flocking to Mr. Buchanan, largely out of disaffection with Mr. Bush's attention to the conservative right and his handling of the economy.
In the two weeks that began on Sunday, Mr. Bush plans but two day trips to the Midwest, where primary elections are being held next Tuesday.
Mr. Bush's campaign manager, Robert M. Teeter, said in an interview last week that the White House hopes in the next month to start the process of fleshing out a re-election platform that so far is little more than the political slogan, "Jobs, family, peace." Mr.
"In the next six months, we're going to stress a lot about the job the President has done on a lot of very difficult issues, where he has led this country and the world through some remarkable changes," Mr. Teeter said.
Mr. Bush may even return foreign affairs to his White House agenda for the first time since his politically disastrous journey last January to Japan and three other Pacific nations. The White House is reconsidering the decision not to send Mr. Bush to a global environmental summit in Rio de Janiero in June. Officials also continue to study the options for action against Iraq and Libya, which are flouting United Nations mandates.

HEADLINE: New York Threatens Penalties Against Bond Underwriter

BYLINE: By CALVIN SIMS

 BODY:
New York City officials said yesterday that they plan to withhold $250,000 of $1 million to $2 million in fees from the city's main underwriter of bonds, the First Boston Corporation, as a penalty for the investment bank's failure to disclose its purchase of city bonds that could have yielded a profit at the city's expense.
First Boston, which is currently underwriting more than $1 billion in city debt, will also pay for the city's investigation into the matter, which is being conducted by the city's counsel on bond disclosure, Lord Day & Lord, Barrett Smith. 
 While city officials said that it was too early to determine the total cost of the investigation, lawyers familiar with such inquiries estimated that the city would incur more than $100,000 in legal fees.
City officials said the penalties are intended to send a strong message to First Boston that they are agitated about First Boston's handling of the bond transaction.
The city hired First Boston to underwrite $1 billion of low-interest bonds, the proceeds from which would be used to repurchase $84 million worth of bonds at a higher interest rate. In February, First Boston bought $13 million of the $84 million of bonds the city planned to repurchase.
First Boston did not notify the city of its purchase. The city discovered the transaction on March 3 and began an investigation.
The city's Corporation Counsel, F. Peter Sherwood, said yesterday that the $250,000 in fees would be withheld from First Boston to reimburse the city for the investigation.
Still, the city has retained First Boston as its main underwriter of the deal, and the investment bank stands to gain the bulk of the $1 million and $2 million that it was to receive for handling the bond offering.
Details of the city's plan to withhold $250,000 in fees from First Boston were first reported in the The Bond Buyer newsletter on Tuesday.
Archibald Cox Jr., president and chief executive of First Boston, said the bank had agreed to pay the $250,000 and legal fees to keep its client happy. "I would hate for people to think that we have admitted to any culpability just because we have agreed to pay this," he said.

HEADLINE: Republicans' Tax Plan Is Rejected by Senate

BYLINE: By KEITH BRADSHER, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, March 11

 BODY:
Voting almost entirely along party lines, the Senate tonight rejected, 60 to 37, a Republican tax measure. The defeat surprised no one, least of all the Senate's Republican leaders, who had introduced it not because they thought the measure would pass but because they wanted their own position to defend.
The Democrats, meanwhile, rushed to adjust their plan, to protect it against challenge because it would increase the budget deficit, eliminating $3.5 billion in tax credits for middle-class parents. 
 The Senate took up the Republican plan, a modified version of President Bush's seven-point tax proposal, as the second of a number of amendments to the Democratic bill, which is expected to be approved by the end of the week. The first, which would have linked pharmaceutical companies' tax credits to drug prices to hold down health-care costs, was defeated 61 to 36.
 
Urging Fairness
 Like President Bush, the Republicans leaders would have cut corporate taxes by accelerating depreciation, reduced the capital gains tax to 15.4 percent and provided tax breaks for home buyers and real estate investors. And like Mr. Bush, they stumbled over a tax cut for families. The Democrats have been touting their measure, which centers on tax cuts for the middle class and increases for the well off, as one that would make the tax code fairer.
Under the changes introduced tonight by the majority leader, Senator George J. Mitchell of Maine, the middle-class tax break would now apply only to families earning up to $40,000, and would phase out at $50,000. The original Democratic proposal was for a $300 tax credit to families earning up to $50,000, but phased out for families earning up to $70,000.
On the Republican side, some senators had wanted to include a $500 increase in the personal exemption for each child, paid for by cuts in military spending; others backed off, saying it would promote consumption rather than economic growth and would hurt the party's image of concern about the Federal budget deficit.
Mr. Bush proposed such a change in January but did not include it in the seven-point list he said he wanted passed by March 20, an omission that his Republican challenger, Patrick J. Buchanan, stressed to New Hampshire primary voters as a sign that the President was not concerned about their interests.
The principal difference between the White House and the Senate Republican plans came in how to pay for them. Instead of making accounting changes in long-term Federal programs and claiming them in the coming fiscal year, as the President proposed, the Senate Republican plan would rely on small spending cuts and the sale over five years of $3 billion in minerals in Defense Department stockpiles.
"It's important for a lot of people to be for something, and it's clear that's why the leadership package is being offered," said Senator Mitch McConnell, Republican of Kentucky, before the debate.
Senator John C. Danforth, Republican of Missouri, said that doing without any Republican measure "would be fine." A certain Presidential veto of the Democratic bill made the current round of tax legislation "a dry run," he added.
In a news conference, President Bush vowed again today to veto the Democratic bill because it included tax increases. "I'm going to veto this tax bill; we've got too many," he said. "This would be the worst time to raise taxes. No time is good, but this would be the worst."
The middle-class tax cut that Republican moderates rejected had been backed by Senator Phil Gramm of Texas and other conservative Republicans.
After a day of negotiations among Republican senators, Mr. Gramm agreed to support the leadership's proposal while reserving the right to introduce his own measure later that would also include the tax credit.
The Senate spent the morning and most of the afternoon debating the other amendment it later defeated. Sponsored by Senator David H. Pryor, Democrat of Arkansas, it would have curbed the tax credits of pharmaceutical companies that raise their prices faster than the inflation rate.
Mr. Pryor said that pharmaceutical companies had tripled the profit margins of the average large industrial corporation because of "outright price gouging" at the expense of the old and the sick.
But Senators Bill Bradley and Frank R. Lautenberg, both Democrats of New Jersey, a home to large drug companies, said that pharmaceutical companies needed the ability to raise prices as needed to pay for research. Prescription drug purchases account for only 7 percent of the nation's health care spending, Mr. Bradley said.

HEADLINE: Japan Trade Surplus Climbs

BYLINE: Reuters

DATELINE: TOKYO, March 11

 BODY:
Japan's trade surplus soared to an all-time high in February as exports, especially to Asia, jumped while a slowing domestic economy and lower oil prices trimmed imports, economists said today.
The Ministry of Finance said the surplus, without being adjusted for seasonal factors, more than doubled, to a record $10.23 billion, from $5.06 billion in February 1991. 
 Japan has been trying to fend off foreign criticism, particularly from Washington, over the size of its enormous trade surplus by decreasing the volume of exports and increasing imports.
But in February exports increased 12.4 percent, to $28.08 billion, and imports fell 10.3 percent from a year earlier, to $17.86 billion.
"Today's figures were a sign that the Japanese economy is starting to depend more on exports than domestic demand," said Hiroaki Hashiguchi, an economist at Tokai Bank.
Exports to Asian nations posted a larger increase compared with those to the United States and Europe, where economies are sluggish and the stance against trade imbalances with Japan is tougher, economists said.

HEADLINE: Casino Developer Tries One Hard Sell: Hartford

BYLINE: By KIRK JOHNSON, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: HARTFORD, March 11

 BODY:
In this old city of insurance companies and banks, the buttoned-down culture seems as ingrained as the methods of actuarial accounting. There are few showgirls, and neon is mostly considered an inert gas. Want some time alone? Go downtown at 9 P.M.
Mirage Resorts wants to build a $350 million resort casino and convention center in the middle of all that. 
 "If you build it, they will come," Stephen A. Wynn, Mirage's president and chairman, told a joint committee of the General Assembly today, quoting from the movie "Field of Dreams," which starred Kevin Costner, whom Mr. Wynn described as a close personal friend.
Mr. Wynn is no idle dreamer or crank. He represents a company that he said made more than $200 million in operating profit last year from one Las Vegas property alone, or as Mr. Wynn put it, twice the profits of the entire Sheraton Hotel chain. Besides the Mirage Casino Hotel, Mr. Wynn's company also owns two Golden Nugget casinos in Las Vegas.
 
Gray Flannel and Green Felt
 Tanned and polished, he swept into Connecticut's Capitol like a foreign potentate, ready, he said, to stake his personal fortune and reputation on the notion that Hartford's gray corporate flannel and Nevada's green casino felt could coexist to the enrichment of all.
Flanked by sleek aides, Mr. Wynn dropped names by the handful (Jimmy Carter has stayed at the Mirage; Dolly Parton and Kenny Rogers treat it like a second home), belittled Gov. Lowell P. Weicker Jr. and flattered his hosts about their intelligence in considering his proposals, which he said would employ 5,000 people and pump $500,000 to $1 million a week into the local economy in supply purchases alone.
But the smooth-as-glass presentation, and even the news that Mr. Wynn likes dolphins so much that he swims with them "three or four times a week" still seemed to some lawmakers to overlook the almost Zen-like question raised by Mr. Wynn's assessment and remedy for the capital city: Is Hartford boring because its economy is depressed and its nightlife is minimal, as he contends, or because its very identity is boring?
Like a fragile ecosystem that could be shattered from undue stress, would a more exciting Hartford really be Hartford?
 
Few Have the Vision
 "I can't think of too many places that are as different from Las Vegas as Connecticut," said Representative Irving J. Stolberg, a Democrat from New Haven. "A lot of people don't want to lose that."
There seems little chance that Hartford will get a casino soon. Mr. Weicker has vowed to veto any casino bill, and Hartford's Mayor, Carrie Saxon Perry, has also announced her opposition. Even the main proponent, Senator William A. DiBella, a Democrat from Hartford who said today that Mr. Wynn's plan makes "infinite sense for this city and this region," concedes that many lawmakers lack his "vision."
Although Connecticut does have one casino, which opened last month at the Mashantucket Pequot Indian reservation in Ledyard, state laws prohibit gambling for profit off the reservation. Mr. DiBella and other supporters say that that will change eventually across the Northeast and the cities that don't act soon could lose out.
Mr. Wynn said that he and Jon Adams Jerde, an architect whose credits include planning for Euro Disney in Paris, would construct a "synergy" of entertainment, hotel and convention center space that would revitalize Hartford's downtown, bring in millions of new tourists and convention visitors and employ thousands of poor city residents.
 
Gambling for Conventions
 Gambling, he said, would only be a means to an end. The casino's revenues would subsidize the convention center, allowing the center to charge lower rates that would in turn capture more convention business for the city and, to complete the circle, more gambling revenues for Mr. Wynn.
Without gambling, the standard convention center that Hartford wants to build in the next decade will have to compete by price alone, dooming both the city and state to long-term subsidies and cutthroat competition without guarantee of success, Mr. Wynn argued. Gambling might not be ideal, he conceded, but the world has changed.
"If you can get a steel mill to come to Hartford, I say do it right away," he said.

HEADLINE: Reebok Fights to Be No. 1 Again

BYLINE: By KIM FOLTZ

 BODY:
Most days, weather permitting, several Reebok executives spend their lunchtime playing pickup basketball on the asphalt court at the edge of the company's parking lot near Boston. The game is friendly, but serious, as the men and women players join in for the exercise and to promote corporate camaraderie.
But most of all, it is a practical training ground in the competitive spirit driving the company these days: Reebok wants to be a winner again. 
 Ever since Nike took away its title in 1989 as the nation's No. 1 seller of athletic shoes, Reebok has been waging a fierce marketing battle to win back the prestige and sales appropriated by its rival.
It is continuing the fight this year with a new ad campaign called "Life Is Short. Play Hard," and it is gambling that a steady stream of new shoe designs and gimmicks will catapult it back into first place.
"We hadn't been hitting on all cylinders during the last few years," said Angel Martinez, Reebok's corporate vice president for new business development. "But we are starting to now."
In the last two years, Reebok International Ltd., based in Stoughton, Mass., has increased its share of the domestic market to 24 percent from 22 percent. Nike Inc.'s share, meanwhile, has held steady at 30 percent of the $5.82 billion athletic shoe market.
"Reebok is getting closer and closer to Nike by beating up the other players in the marketplace," said John Horan, editor and publisher of the Sporting Goods Intelligence Management News, an industry publication. "Reebok has a huge advantage because it can afford expensive promotional campaigns."
Reebok's current campaign is tied to the coming Summer Olympics. Like much of Reebok's past offbeat advertising, the new commercials feature a humorous competition between two members of the United States Olympic team, the decathletes Dave Johnson and Don O'Brien, both of whom boast they are the world's best athletes. And as with some of Reebok's past campaigns, this one has also been criticized as not being focused enough on the shoes.
Although Nike is a sponsor of the Summer Olympics, Reebok will be the exclusive athletic shoe and active-wear advertiser during Olympic broadcasts. In addition, the company has designed the uniform that American winners will wear when they step up to accept their medals.
 
Battle of Inflatable Shoes
 Nike's Air series of shoes with pre-filled air cushions helped the company move into first place. In turn, Reebok began to revitalize its sagging image with the Pump inflatable shoe, which allows for a more custom-fit by pumping air into inflatable chambers in the shoe.
But company executives know the popular Pump cannot do the job alone. Since its introduction, the Pump has accounted for about 16 percent of Reebok's annual sales. So far, some six million pairs of Pump shoes have been sold for a total of $750 million.
The Pump's popularity has helped to give the company bottom line a healthy boost. Last year, Reebok's worldwide sales increased by 26.6 percent, to $2.7 billion. Profits also jumped to $234.7 million in 1991, compared with $176.6 million the previous year.
As the market for the Pump matures, sales are expected to drop by as much as 30 percent this year. "The Pump got the energy flowing again at Reebok," said Bob Meers, president of United States operations. "But it's only part of Reebok, it has to evolve."
 
$220 Million for Ads
 To help offset that decline, Paul Fireman, Reebok's chairman, said the company would spend about $220 million on advertising this year, substantially more than the $140 million it allocated in 1991. Some analysts said that level of spending might help Reebok slow the Nike juggernaut a little. This year, Nike plans to spend about $150 million.
To keep customers' interest, especially prime ones in the 12-to-18-year-old group who continually change their taste in shoes, Reebok last year introduced several redesigned shoes. Among them is a double-pump version with two inflation gadgets to pump air into more areas of the shoe. Another is a sturdier shoe called the Blacktop, which the company says is made for playing basketball on the rough surfaces of outdoor courts.
In January, at a trade show for sporting-goods manufacturers and retailers in Atlanta, Reebok introduced an advanced version of the Pump that makes it easier to inflate the interior of the shoe around the foot. The Insta-Pump, which is inflated using a small canister of carbon dioxide, instead of manually, is intended to give greater support for runners and tennis players. If the Insta-Pump proves to be popular, Reebok plans to use the technology in all of its athletic shoes eventually.
With the Insta-Pump, some analysts say Reebok may have taken the lead in technology. "The Insta-Pump is on the cutting edge in athletic shoe technology," Mr. Horan of Sporting Goods Intelligence said. "Reebok has demonstated that it can make a better shoe. The other brands will be forced to follow suit."
But making headway in the women's market will not be easy for Nike. Reebok first made its reputation with hot-selling aerobics shoes mainly aimed at women. Reebok still dominates the women's athletic shoe market with a 49 percent share, company executives said, and its Step Aerobics, a new exercise program intended to replace the more old-fashioned jump-and-kick aerobics, is helping it to keep market share.
Not coincidentally, Reebok sells Step aerobics shoes and also markets the portable plastic steps that exercisers sometimes stack up three or four at a time.
The company has also begun to branch out into other areas of athletic wear that it hopes will be as rich as footwear has been. The company has put a greater emphasis on its apparel division, which includes casual and athletic wear for adults under the Reebok, Allesse and Rockport brands, as well as Weebok, a new line of clothes and shoes for children.
"In the past, we had not made apparel a serious business," said Marilyn Tam, president of the apparel products group. "Now we have some of the top people in the business."
 
Chief Executive's Role
 Many Reebok executives attribute the company's revival to John Duerden, who became the president and chief executive of the company in 1990. A former Xerox executive, Mr. Duerden has used his buttoned-down corporate style to temper Reebok's entrepreneurial zeal. "This was a big company that needed some discipline," he said. "You can't just make shoes at random."
Mr. Duerden streamlined the company's management so that only 12 executives report to him. Now, the company feels it can move more quickly to accommodate the company's core of fickle customers, who love new types of shoes. "To keep up with the marketplace, we now have to change one-third of the products we produce two times each year," Mr. Duerdan said.
He has also mandated that pleasing customers is as important as designing shoes. Reebok now keeps closer tabs on whether retailers are getting enough of the right merchandise on time. Even Mr. Duerdan calls 10 retailers each week to listen to their complaints or bask in their praise.
In a sort of marketing show-and-tell, Reebok has begun to open its own stores that company executives say are intended to demonstrate to retailers the best way to sell Reebok shoes, clothing and other athletic gear. The first Reebok Concept store opened in Boston last year and the next one is scheduled to be completed in May in Manhattan. "These shops are not intended to compete with other retailers," Mr. Meers said. "These are living merchandising laboratories." Nike has opened similar stores.
 
Some Traditions Survive
 But Mr. Duerdan did not tamper with some Reebok traditions. On his first day at Reebok's headquarters, an unsuspecting Mr. Duerdan walked into the third-floor conference room to sit in on what he thought would be a run-of-the-mill meeting about new products. The room was jammed with employees from every level of the company. The scene was chaotic as executives shouted at co-workers, waving new shoes and sometimes hurling them at each other to make a particular point. One designer had been reduced to tears by a particularly scathing review.
"I couldn't believe it," Mr. Duerdan said. "I tried to put limitations on these meetings, but I realized I couldn't because they were too much a part of the company's culture."

HEADLINE: Court Halts Projects Planned for Pine Barrens

BYLINE: By JOSH BARBANEL, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: ISLANDIA, L.I., March 11

 BODY:
A divided State Appellate Court has ordered a sweeping environmental review of the last large tracts of undeveloped pine forest on Long Island, overturning hundreds of zoning decisions by local governments.
In the decision, the State Appellate Division in Brooklyn barred any development in the environmentally sensitive Pine Barrens, an area of almost 200 square miles, until a study has examined the cumulative effects of hundreds of developments planned there. 
 Environmentalists said the decision would force the creation of a master plan that would save much of the unusual woodland, with its rare species of plant and animal life, and preserve some of the purest water in the region, which lies thousands of feet beneath the Pine Barrens. The vote, which overturned a lower court decision, was 3 to 2.
 
Tool for Environmentalists
 The suit, if upheld on a probable appeal to the state's higest court, the Court of Appeals, could give environmentalists a new tool that could be used to require comprehensive planning before projects could be approved in other environmentally sensitive regions on Long Island and across the state.
"The same theory would apply to the Adirondacks, the Catskills, the Great Lakes and along the Hudson River," said Michael B. Gerrard, a lawyer with Berle, Kass & Case, who represented the Long Island Pine Barrens Society in the suit. "This is one of the most important environmental decisions handed down by the state courts in the past decade."
The decision could delay for years as many as 250 projects proposed by private developers across the region, from small housing developments to a huge development project with a 150-acre mall and 12,000 homes planned near the Long Island Expressway in Yaphank. The projects were valued by developers at as much as $11 billion.
 
Stalled by Recession
 But most of the projects have already been stalled by the recession and uncertainty over the Pine Barrens lawsuit that has been wending its way through the courts since 1989.
"There are many developers hanging on by their eyelids," said Edwin M. Schwenk, executive director of the Long Island Builders Insittute, which represents residential developers. "With this decision, the right of towns to effectively plan their own destiny has been superseded."
Patricia C. Moore, the Riverhead Town Attorney, called the decision a "nightmare" of clashing jurisdictions between three different town zoning bodies and a variety of state agencies. She said that she would recommend that the town appeal the decision.
But in Southampton, the Town Supervisor, Fred Thielle, said he would probably recommend to the Town Board that it drop out of the case. "Rather than spending town funds on lawyers -- in what is essentially a battle between environmentalists and developers -- I would prefer to spend it on planning," he said, "deciding where to build and where not to build."
The Pine Barrens -- harsh forests dominated by pitch pines that took root in the sandy soil -- once covered much of Long Island, but were cut down and replaced by tract houses and strip malls.
Rainfall on the pine barrens percolates down through thousands of feet of sand and gravel to deep aquifers that are Long Island's only water supply. Water from the aquifer is so pure that the Suffolk County Water Authority is considering marketing it in bottles across the country.
In 1987, the State Legislature designated the Central Pine Barrens and seven other Long Island sites "special ground-water protection areas" and called for a study of the level of development that could be permitted without polluting the underground water. The study was not binding on town governments.
In its decision announced today, the Appellate Court ruled that the action of the Legislature in setting up a ground-water protection area triggered a higher level of review under the state environmental quality review law and required a detailed comprehensive impact statement covering the entire area.
The decision covered projects 30 miles or more apart, including those in virgin woods as well as projects, especially in western Suffolk County, in already developed areas. It would also probably have an impact on a proposal, opposed by environmentalists, to convert an airfield used by Grumman into an international freight airport.
"The various projects -- although functionally unrelated -- are similarly linked by virtue of their potential to adversely affect an irreplaceable natural resource located within a discrete geographic area," said Justice William C. Thompson, in the majority decision. He was joined by Justices Geraldine T. Eiber and Sondra Miller.
 
Albany Case
 Though the outcome of the case on appeal is uncertain, the Appellate Court decision is grounded in a prior decision by the Court of Appeals in a case involving a specially designated Pine Bush preservation area in Albany.
In that case, the court ruled that once the city had set up special environmental rules, any project had to take into account the cumulative impact of all development in the areas.
In a dissent, Justice Thomas R. Sullivan said that the Legislature in designating special groundwater protection areas made sweeping policy statements but adopted no guidelines or standards. He was joined in the dissent by Justice John Copertino.
A draft water-protection-area study, carried out at the behest of the Legislature, called for Suffolk County to buy some environmentally sensitive land and for five-acre zoning in much of the Pine Barrens to protect the underground water supply.

Control Data Official To Be Chief at Quantum

BYLINE: By LAWRENCE M. FISHER

 BODY:
The Quantum Corporation, a leading disk drive manufacturer, said yesterday that William J. Miller would join the company as chief executive. Mr. Miller joins Quantum after 11 years with the Control Data Corporation, where he was most recently executive vice president, as well as president of information services.
As chief executive, Mr. Miller, who is 46, succeeds Stephen M. Berkley, 48, who will remain actively involved as chairman, the company said. Quantum, based in Milpitas, Calif., does not have a president. 
 "Bill brings to Quantum a unique combination of hard-disk-drive industry experience, leadership and proven ability to grow a business," Mr. Berkley said in a statement. "These are all qualities that will be important for us as we put the strategies in place to continue building our business."
Founded in 1980, Quantum is a leading manufacturer of hard disk drives for personal computers. Its largest customer is Apple Computer Inc. Analysts say Quantum has been performing well and that the executive change came as a surprise.
"Steve Berkley is a vital guy and has done a great job boot-strapping Quantum," said John Rossi, an analyst with Robertson Stephens & Company in San Franicisco. "He has driven them through a heavy growth stage in the last two years," he said. On the other hand, he added, "Bill Miller has a good reputation in the industry and is probably a good choice."
At Control Data, Mr. Miller was previously president and chief executive of Imprimis Technology, a wholly owned subsidiary at the time. He was credited with the turnaround of Imprimis, a billion-dollar company specializing in hard disk drives for larger computers, before it was acquired by Seagate Technology in 1990.
Before that, Mr. Miller led the small-disk division of Control Data's data-storage products group, the predecessor of Imprimis. Earlier, he held senior management positions in marketing and legal support.
Mr. Miller said in a telephone interview that he relished the chance to run a disk drive company again after his favorable experience with Imprimis. "Quantum's a terrific company, on a course that's real compatible with what I believe in," he said.
He received his B.S. in economics and his law degree from the University of Minnesota.

Tax-Exempt and Taxable Yields Slip a Bit

BYLINE: By ELIZABETH M. FOWLER

 BODY:
The yields on tax-exempt funds moved down a little more for the week ended Monday, while the taxables moved down slightly for the week ended Tuesday, according to IBC/Donoghue's Money Fund Report.
"Despite the lower rates the assets of the tax-free funds remained close to recent highs," said Walter Frank, economist for Donoghue's. The average tax-exempt yields, he pointed out, were competitive with taxable yields for the high-bracket taxpayer, which might explain the steadiness in the assets of the tax exempts. 
 Mr. Frank said the yields on taxable funds were still declining, "but since open-market rates have moved up slightly in recent weeks, we should see that reflected very shortly in the yields of the money funds."
The seven-day compounded average yield for the tax-exempts was down 7 basis points, to 2.50 percent, from the previous week, while the seven-day simple yield dropped to 2.47, also down 7 basis points. A basis point is a hundredth of a percentage point.
In the same period, the 30-day compounded yield was 2.61, off 10 basis points; the simple yield was down 9 basis points, to 2.58.
 
Top Performers
 The top Connecticut fund again was the Fidelity Spartan Connecticut Municipal Money Market Portfolio, which reported a seven-day compounded yield of 2.91, down 3 basis points.
In New Jersey, the top fund again was the Fidelity Spartan N.J. Municipal Money Market Portfolio, with a yield that dropped to 2.83 percent, down 22 basis points.
In New York, the top fund again was the Salomon Brothers N.Y. Municipal Money Market. It had a seven-day compounded yield of 3.36, down 12 basis points.
Assets of the tax-exempt funds, rose by $901 million, to $98.9 billion. Donoghue's said the average number of days to maturity of securities held in the tax-free portfolios remained unchanged at 52.
Of the funds monitored by Donoghue's with assets larger than $100 million, the Strong Municipal Money Market Fund of Milwaukee continued to lead with a seven-day compounded yield of 3.38, down 12 basis points from the previous week.
 
Taxable Funds
 The assets of the taxable funds rose by $4.1 billion, to $499 billion. Mr. Frank said the increase was from institutional buying because there was a small outflow by small investors.
Mr. Frank said the average days to maturity of holdings in the taxable funds held steady at 57.
The average seven-day compounded taxable yield dropped 4 basis points, to 3.79 percent, from the previous week, while the seven-day simple yield declined 3 basis points, to 3.72.
The 30-day compounded yield on the taxables declined 3 basis points, to 3.84 percent, from the previous week, and the 30-day simple yield dropped to 3.77, also off 3 basis points.
The Fidelity Spartan Money Market Fund led the way as the taxable fund with the highest yield -- 4.45 percent.
By comparison, the average bank money market account, a prime competitor of money funds, was at 3.68 percent, off 2 basis points, according to The Bank Rate Monitor's national index.

HEADLINE: Small Business Aid Backed By House Panel and S.E.C.

BYLINE: AP

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, March 1

 BODY:
A House panel, with its Republican members on board, recommended increases in Government-backed loans to small businesses today.
Meanwhile, the Securities and Exchange Commission, as expected, proposed changes in regulating mutual funds to make it easier for small businesses to raise money through the stock market. 
 The House Small Business Committee unanimously said the Government should guarantee $18 billion in private loans to credit-pressed small businesses between now and 1994.
The approved measure contrasts with more modest requests by the Bush Administration, which originally sought to guarantee about $11 billion in loans between now and late 1994 and only recently asked Congress for more.
 
Soaring Loan Demand
 Under the program, the Small Business Administration acts as a guarantor for small business loans that might not otherwise have been granted. Demand for the loan guarantees has soared during the recession.
Because the Government must set aside only a fraction of the amount in loans it guarantees, the $18 billion in loan guarantee authority recommended by the committee would actually cost the Government about $1 billion.
But many obstacles stand between today's action and an actual increase in Government-backed lending. Because of budget constraints, Congress must cut money from other domestic programs to clear the way for the additional guarantees.
In proposing changes in regulating mutual funds, the S.E.C. is taking up the proposals of its chairman, Richard C. Breeden, for easing the regulatory burden on small companies, which are having problems raising money just as banks are lending less.
The commission agreed to propose a plan that allows mutual funds to increase their stake in small companies, which cannot sell their securities as easily as big companies can. The panel also proposed legislation that would create a new class of less-regulated mutual fund geared to supplying venture capital.
But the expected highlights of Mr. Breeden's plan are proposals for cutting the red tape that often makes it too expensive for small companies to register their securities with the S.E.C. before selling them.
 
Simplifying the Process
 The proposals would simplify the disclosure forms that companies must fill out and lower the standards for qualifying to use the easier, and cheaper, disclosure documents.
The S.E.C. was expected to seek public comment on the proposals before a final decision to be made sometime in the future.
Mr. Breeden's proposed changes would reduce the amount of information some companies have to supply investors, opening him up to criticism that he is sacrificing investor protection for short-term aid to the economy -- and possibly a political gain for his former boss, President Bush, in an election year.

HEADLINE: Record Orders For U.S. Chips

BYLINE: Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: SAN FRANCISCO, March 11

 BODY:
Orders for semiconductors in the United States set a record in February, the Semiconductor Industry Association reported today.
The data suggest that despite the recession, computer companies and other makers of electronic gear seem to be ordering components, perhaps in anticipation of greater sales. 
 The trade group also reported that the book-to-bill ratio, an important index of the industry's health, rose to 1.12 for the three months ended in February, compared with 1.09 for the three months ended in January. A ratio of 1.12 means that for every $100 worth of products shipped, $112 of orders were received, a sign that sales should increase.
Daniel Klesken, semiconductor analyst at Robertson Stephens & Company in San Francisco, said he thought there were strong shipments of particular chips, not strength industrywide. He added that the industry ratio always tended to rise in the spring.
The industry group said the February figure for bookings, or orders, was $1.52 billion, up 4.9 percent from January. The figure for billings, or shipments, was $1.36 billion, up 2.6 percent.

Dollar Off After Intervention By Switzerland and Japan

BYLINE: By The Associated Press

 BODY:
The dollar was mostly lower against other major currencies yesterday after the Swiss and Japanese central banks entered the market.
Analysts said the dollar ran into resistance after the Swiss National Bank intervened to support the weakening franc and the German mark. Traders used the intervention as an excuse to liquidate large dollar holdings. 
 The Swiss bank's actions worked, as the dollar fell to 1.5075 francs, from 1.5165 late Tuesday in New York. In earlier European trading, the dollar fell to 1.5085 francs, from 1.5170.
The dollar also fell to 1.6635 marks, down from 1.6705, in New York, and to 1.6650 marks, down from 1.6715, in Europe.
 
Yen Declines Anyway
 The Bank of Japan, however, was unsuccessful in its attempt to prop up the yen, which has been battered by the weakening Japanese economy and the falling Tokyo stock market. Although the Japanese central bank sold dollars, the United States currency still ended the day with a gain against the yen.
The dollar rose to 133.40 yen in New York, from late Tuesday's 132.90. In Tokyo overnight, the dollar closed at 133.70 yen, up 1.70 yen. In London, it was quoted at 133.55 yen.
John McCarthy, chief foreign exchange dealer with ABN-AMRO Bank N.V. in New York, said central banks were the main sellers. He said other players selling dollars were motivated more by technical factors than by a belief the dollar was fundamentally weak.
The British pound advanced against the dollar, closing at $1.7260 in New York, up from $1.7175. In London, the pound rose to $1.7250, from $1.7160 late Tuesday.
Other late dollar rates in New York, compared with late Tuesday's prices, included: 5.6485 French francs, down from 5.6725; 1,246.50 Italian lire, down from 1,251.00, and 1.19585 Canadian dollars, down from 1.19725.
In the precious metals market, gold rose $1.70 an ounce, to $350.70, on the Commodity Exchange in New York. The Republic National Bank later quoted a bid of $349.95, up $1.15.
Gold rose in London to a late bid of $349.25 an ounce, from $348.65. In Zurich, the metal was unchanged at a bid of 348.75. In Hong Kong, gold fell 43 cents an ounce, to a bid of $349.74.

Miracle Saves The Toolworks

BYLINE: By Lawrence M. Fisher

DATELINE: SAN FRANCISCO

 BODY:
THE Software Toolworks Inc. used to be a struggling producer of games and educational programs, mired in losses and shareholder suits, abandoned by securities analysts. Then came the Miracle.
The Miracle Piano Teaching System is an electronic keyboard with teach-yourself-to-play software that runs on the Nintendo game systems and I.B.M.-compatible, Apple Macintosh, or Amiga personal computers. Pushed by $1 million a week in advertising, the Miracle sold about 40,000 units during the December quarter at prices from $379 to $479, suggested retail, and has sold slowly but steadily since then. 
 The two analysts who follow Software Toolworks say that while the Miracle accounts for only 25 percent of revenues, it has helped redefine the company. Software Toolworks has made strides in other product areas, and now warrants investors' attention again, they say.
But they caution that Software Toolworks is in the middle of, rather than through with, a turnaround, and that shares in the company remain a speculative purchase. The stock, which traded as low as $2 last year, peaked at $8.50 in November before settling a little over $6. It closed yesterday at $6.0625 , down 6.25 cents, in over-the-counter trading. The company, which is based in Novato, Calif., has been modestly profitable in the first nine months of its 1992 fiscal year, which ends March 31.
"We are very encouraged by the progress management has made," said Robert F. Kleiber, an analyst with Piper, Jaffray & Hopwood in Minneapolis. He rates the stock a speculative buy. "They are not perfect, but they have put some product out that makes sense," he said. "The Miracle indicates a high level of creativity; it's a very nice product that does exactly what they say it does."
In addition to the Miracle, which numerous reviewers have said really can teach the user to play, Software Toolworks has a very successful program that teaches typing, "Mavis Beacon Teaches Typing!" that has sold more than 1.5 million copies since 1986, and a chess tutorial program, the Chessmaster 3000, Mr. Kleiber said. The company recently introduced versions of these for the Windows operating system, as well as atlas and reference programs that work with Windows.
Mr. Kleiber gives much credit for Software Toolworks' improvement to Robert Lloyd, a former All-American basketball player at Rutgers, who joined the company as president and chief executive in October 1990. "He's done a great job of cleaning up," Mr. Kleiber said, adding that the company's "balance sheet is still not a pretty sight."
Software Toolworks "is not out of the woods yet, but the last few trees are clearly in sight," he said.
Lee S. Isgur, an analyst with Volpe, Welty & Company in San Francisco, is also recommending purchase of Software Toolworks but acknowledges that the company's turnaround is progessing more slowly than he anticipated. "The bad news is that the improvement is not occurring at a faster pace, but given the current economic situation, it may be unrealistic to ask for more," he said. "The good news is that the turnaround that began last summer continues."
The Miracle has established a new product category, and is an even stronger product on personal computers than it was on Nintendo, Mr. Isgur said. The success of the product at Christmas helped persuade retailers that Software Toolworks was a viable supplier, he said, adding that major chains, like Radio Shack and Target, that carried the Miracle only at limited locations last year, will carry it throughout their stores in 1992.
One problem with the Miracle, Mr. Isgur said, is that it currently accounts for a disproportionate share of the company's $28.2 million in inventory, more than half. This is because Software Toolworks committed to buying components in large volume in order to hold prices down, he said. "They have to sell enough Miracles to free up capital," he said, predicting that this is unlikely before next Christmas.
Mr. Isgur also likes the company's other product lines, noting that Software Toolworks is "probably the largest and most diversified manufacturer of CD-ROM product," referring to atlases and other reference software that run on compact disk drives for personal computers. In the educational market, he is particularly enthusiastic about the company's recent license to develop a geography program featuring Mario, the hero of Nintendo's most popular games.
Software Toolworks "had a profit this quarter, which will give them a modest profit for the year," Mr. Isgur said, adding: "Next year, they will have a much bigger profit, maybe 50 or 60 cents a share. If they do 60 cents, the stock is a screaming buy; if they only do 35 cents, maybe it's a little ahead of itself. That's the tough call."

HEADLINE: Scrawny Economy but Tables Are Lush

BYLINE: By ELAINE LOUIE

 BODY:
THIS year may be one of fiscal restraint, but not necessarily at the table. Table settings are currently baroque, and excess of a sort is cherished.
"In the 80's, tables were simple and utilitarian and, after a while, the plain table got boring," said Peri Wolfman, co-author of "The Perfect Setting (Harry N. Abrams, 1986), which has just been reprinted. "Now people are setting more opulent, more abundant tables." 
 Ms. Wolfman is a co-owner of Wolfman-Gold and Good Company, a housewares store in Manhattan's SoHo district.
Jewelry designers, like Stephen Dweck in Manhattan and Pierre Casenove in Salins, France, are getting in on the act, and it comes as no surprise that their serving pieces and candelabra are as jewel-like as they are functional.
This decade, then, is the moment for Michael L. Cipriano. Some people are to the manor born. Mr. Cipriano, a 31-year-old interior designer, is to the table born.
From 1985 to 1990, he was display manager for Chelsea Passage, the gift area at Barneys New York. Since 1990, he has been a consultant to the Manhattan store, and sets the tables there twice each week. For this article, he was invited to set the table shown above, one that he describes as luxurious but not in a formulated way.
At night, Mr. Cipriano reads up on the 1920's, a time he calls the golden era of the tabletop ornament. "People put little glass birds, seashells and little Murano glass figurines on the tables," Mr. Cipriano said. "Now they're called tchotchkes."
On weekends, he haunts flea markets and antique shows for, well, table accessories. It was his passion for collecting that led him into designing tables.
He is one of the few people who can recognize a bonbon spoon from a dessert spoon.
"Now you'd take a bonbon with your fingers, but if you had a bonbon in the 20's, you'd take it on a spoon, and then with your fingers," Mr. Cipriano said. "A bonbon spoon is a quirky little nicety."
In his Gramercy Park apartment, he has dozens and dozens of Victorian porcelain cake dishes, tea cups and saucers, 19th-century English and American sterling silver sugar spoons, petit four shovels and trowels.
"In the 19th century, silversmiths combined materials: silver and gold, silver and copper, and silver and enamel," Mr. Cipriano said.
It is possible to overdress and overeat. But it is nearly impossible to overdo a table setting.
"You don't have to have Baccarat or Waterford," Mr. Cipriano said. "Crystal can be some little flea market find, or your mother's or grandmother's, or made by an artisan you come across. You can fall in love with one plate and buy it as a set of dinner plates, and fall in love with another plate and buy that as a set of salad plates.
"It's luxury in little pieces."

HEADLINE: BASEBALL;
Bonilla's Seasoning Spices His Career

BYLINE: By JOE SEXTON, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: PORT ST. LUCIE, Fla., March 11

 BODY:
Throughout his childhood in the Bronx, the constraints of climate and economics left Bobby Bonilla wildly hungry for more baseball. And so it was more just the desire to play than to succeed spectacularly that Bonilla's start in professional baseball, late and unremarkable as it was, satisfied most.
"I'd had potential, had talent as a kid," said Bonilla, the $29 million right fielder for the Mets. "But I didn't have the opportunity to play enough. So when I was signed by the Pirates, I was crazy just to play. I loved it. But there was some serious seasoning to be done." 
 The refinement of Bonilla at the plate has now stretched over a decade of professional experience, and the developmental chart that has resulted is an intriguing mix of variation, consistency and curiosity.
He has, after all, hit 32 home runs one year, 18 the next. A natural right-handed hitter, the switch-hitting Bonilla has batted .268 for his career from the right side, .286 from the left. He walked 45 times and struck out 103 times in 1990, then walked 90 times and struck out 67 times in 1991. He hit .300 in his first full season as a regular in 1987 and .302 in his most recent season while never posting an average better than .281 in the three seasons in between.
 
'So Many Different Labels'
 "There have always been so many different labels," said Bonilla. "At the start, it was hard for me to tell which one was me."
Bonilla, imposing with enormous hands and powerful legs, was a slight kid through his first threee years at Lehman High School.
"I didn't shoot up until the 12th grade," said Bonilla. "But I'd always hit a couple out, no question about that."
The early suspicion, then, was that Bonilla could be a power bat, and that was how he was typecast when Pittsburgh signed him as a nondrafted free agent in 1981. But from his first seasons in rookie ball through several undistinguished seasons in the low minors, Bonilla never hit many home runs, his 11 in 136 games for Nashua at the Class AA level his highest total. And his .264 batting average during that 1984 season in Nashua was his best in the minors.
"I was supposed to a guy with pop from both sides, but I never, ever did much in the minors," said Bonilla, who began to bat from both sides in the 10th grade. "So, sure, there were holes, and plain experience was the biggest one. Then, in 1985, I broke my leg and I spent four months watching. And nothing more than watching turned out to be a great learning experience for me."
A season later, Bonilla, having been lost in a special draft after he was left unprotected by the Pirates, was playing in the majors for the White Sox and then later in the season with the Pirates after a trade returned him to Pittsburgh. He wound up with a combined .255 average and 3 homers.
 
Startling Breakthrough
 But in a startling breakthrough, Bonilla hit .300 in 1987 for the Pirates and by the end of the season he was the regular in the cleanup spot. He hit 15 homers and drove in 77 runs.
"That season, I realized I could play in the majors," said Bonilla. "And in 1988, I realized that not only could I just be someone up at the plate, but that I could be someone who could make a difference."
Bonilla hit 24 homers and collected 100 r.b.i. in 1988. He followed that in 1989, what he calls his most gratifying year at the plate given the injuries that savaged the Pirates and often left him naked in the order, with 24 homers and 86 runs driven in. And then, with the full explosion of the once unprocessed talent, Bonilla smashed 32 homers and drove in 120 runs in 1990, more than any other Pirate since Willie Stargell in 1971.
 
Every Year Is Different
 "For me, every year has been different, and I haven't been able to predict what was coming or explain it after it came," said Bonilla. "In 1990, everything I hit hard went out. It was pretty wonderful."
But Bonilla nevertheless thought he might have been too aggressive. He didn't like his strikeout total of 103 or his extremely modest mark of 45 walks for a run producer of his caliber. And so last year, Bonilla compiled his most disciplined season at the plate ever.
He hit only 18 homers, but his average was .302 and he drove in 100 runs. His 44 doubles led the league and his 68 extra-base hits ranked third.
"I cut down on my swing, determined that I wasn't going to be swinging from my rear end trying to do what I couldn't do," said Bonilla. "The greatest stat is runs produced, and so there ain't nothing wrong with 44 doubles, 18 homers and 100 r.b.i."
"I haven't had a year, yet I've been satisfied with," Bonilla said.
 
INSIDE PITCH
 The Mets collected 10 hits and DAVID CONE gave up two runs over four innings in a 4-2 triumph over the Houston Astros at Kissimmee. PAUL GIBSON, JEFF INNIS and JULIAN VASQUEZcombined to pitch five innings of scoreless relief. VINCE COLEMAN went 2 for 3 with a run-scoring triple.

HEADLINE: A Great-Tasting Budget Bill

 BODY:
Tastes great / Less filling. That false dichotomy sold a lot of beer. Today, the House of Representatives will vote on a similar dichotomy: Reduce the deficit / Increase domestic spending. Logic argues for a "yes" vote. Those goals may seem contradictory but in budgets as in beer, there's no reason the nation can't have both.
The vote will come on a bill sponsored by John Conyers, the Michigan Democrat, to remove firewalls in the 1990 budget law. Those barriers forbid Congress to switch money from defense to domestic programs. Once those barriers are down, Mr. Conyers and the Democratic leadership propose splitting the peace dividend saved from declining military budgets between deficit reduction and public investment. 
 In opposition, President Bush and Republican leaders argue that the only acceptable way to use the money is to reduce the deficit. They say only deficit reduction can spur growth and, besides, firewalls are needed for fiscal discipline. Mr. Bush and his allies are doubly mistaken.
Public investment is every bit as important to growth as private investment. And the Conyers bill would only shift spending among programs; it wouldn't raise the deficit a dime or erode discipline.
The 1990 budget law was designed to reduce the deficit by about $500 billion over five years through modest spending cutbacks and tax hikes. Without debate, Congress agreed to separate caps on domestic, international and defense programs. The amendment defaced an otherwise laudable bill, blocking Congress from doing what it's elected to do: make choices.
What was politically perverse in 1990 has now become fiscally irresponsible. The demise of the Soviet Union now makes frivolous tens of billions in proposed defense spending. But Congress has precious little incentive to capitalize on the golden opportunity. It can cut military spending but the entire saving must go to deficit reduction. Congress isn't likely to undertake painful tasks like closing bases on behalf of the grand abstraction of deficit reduction.
Besides, deficit reduction alone performs no magic. Smaller deficits help the economy because they mean the Government siphons less out of private capital markets. That leaves more money for entrepreneurs, leading to faster growth in investment, productivity and wages.
But there's another key to economic growth: Public investment in telecommunications networks, water treatment, education, training, research. These have been slighted in the Reagan-Bush years, yet study after study shows that such public investments produce returns as high as, or higher than, private investment.
Mr. Bush threatens to veto the Conyers bill because he assumes Congress will throw away the peace dividend on wasteful expenditures. That's a legitimate worry. But the remedy is not to veto Congress's capacity to choose; it is to veto wrong choices it might later make.
Deficit reduction; increased public investment. The economy needs both. Both taste great.

HEADLINE: Who's Presidential?;
No Candidate Is Better Than Bush

BYLINE: By Thomas H. Kean; Thomas H. Kean, New Jersey's Governor from 1982 to 1990, is president of Drew University and chairman of the state's Bush-Quayle campaign.

DATELINE: MADISON, N.J.

 BODY:
Presidential elections grant Americans a rare opportunity to examine issues and candidates. The problem is that campaigns also open a season of political negativism that usually exaggerates America's difficulties and overlooks our successes.
This climate is victimizing George Bush. His critics pound relentlessly on his perceived failures, especially his handling of the economy. Yet, these critics largely ignore many remarkable successes of the past four years -- and the great promise of the next four years. 
 Mr. Bush (and Ronald Reagan) have presided over some of the greatest victories in this country's history. Long after the current recession has faded from memory, Americans will be reaping the dividends of the peaceful collapse of Soviet Communism; the liberation of Kuwait and Panama; the largely unexpected advance of democracy in Africa, Asia and Latin America, and the free trade agreements with Canada and other nations.
Conversely, the President's challenger, Pat Buchanan, and the Democratic candidates seem to lack any solid vision for how to deal with foreign policy and security demands. The Democrats' only major plank -- cutting the defense budget even deeper than Mr. Bush has proposed -- ignores threats America may need to counter in coming years.
This lack of vision leaves many questions unanswered. After disarming America, how would Jerry Brown, Bill Clinton or Paul Tsongas respond to a regional nuclear threat from Iraq or North Korea? Would they know how to counter the emergence of a new authoritarian regime in the former Soviet Union that is armed with nuclear warheads? Could any of these contenders muster the will to commit American forces intelligently and prudently if a threat to our interests emerged? We know that the Democrats shun the Strategic Defense Initiative, so how would they insure America's defense against an accidental or orchestrated nuclear attack? Absent a realistic Democratic response, Americans must be skeptical of Mr. Bush's challengers. His demonstrated skills in foreign policy are not abstract; they are a fundamental requirement of the job.
Mr. Bush's foreign policy victories are not his only successes that are being overlooked. In education, for example, he has introduced one of the most promising reform plans in decades. His America 2000 program includes greater community and business involvement, greater choice for parents in selecting their children's schools and the introduction of promising experimental schools. At the root of his reforms is an acute understanding that tinkering with the American educational system has failed to yield major improvements.
Instead of embracing America 2000, Congressional Democrats have sought to dilute and destroy it. Their suggested remedies rest not on real change but on the failed approaches of the past: more and more spending without accountability.
Similar foot-dragging hampers Mr. Bush's economic reforms. Congressional Democrats contended that he lacked a program, yet when he put forward a constructive blueprint in his State of the Union Message and requested prompt action, what he got was procrastination and maneuvering. And now the Democratic leaders are busy pushing an alternative plan that lacks most of the pro-growth policies Mr. Bush has advocated.
Americans should view the economy in its proper historical perspective. Standing with Jimmy Carter several weeks back, Paul Tsongas should have refocused the minds of Americans on something: The last time Democrats controlled both the White House and Congress, people were waiting in gas lines, burdened with 21 percent interest rates and suffering under the dual swords of double-digit inflation and unemployment.
The political season may be a time for negativism. But it should also be a time for remembering that there is a lot to be proud of -- and even more reason for hope.

HEADLINE: Essay;
The New Despotism

BYLINE: By WILLIAM SAFIRE

DATELINE: WASHINGTON

 BODY:
All the political munchkins had persuaded their principals that, in a recession, foreign policy was a no-no. Foreign aid? Kiss of death.
Along came Richard Nixon this week to give all the candidates and their lockstep pollsters a swift kick in the teeth. 
 He reminded a foolishly intimidated Establishment what leadership was about: "Not simply to support what is popular but to make what is unpopular popular if that serves America's interest."
To wake up a world traumatized by conventional wisdom, our only thinking ex-President used a new medium and an old device.
He rejected the mass media, who tend to paint their tails white and run with the antelopes. He chose not to go the op-ed route, overused by purveyors of opinion.
Instead, drawing on the Lazarsfeld Theory of Two-Step Communication, Mr. Nixon wrote a memorandum and sent it, with a personal cover note, to the 50 people interested in foreign affairs that he believed most capable of affecting public policy.
It is the most prestigious list to be on since the "enemies list" of 20 years ago. A former national security adviser called me to say "Did you see what Nixon is saying?" In the steam room of the Army-Navy Club, a longtime policy maker wondered whether Nixon's tight-circulation blast at the West's "pathetically inadequate" response to the needs of Russian reformers would get through.
James Baker, whose phony photo-op Russian-aid conference was scorned in the Nixon memo, is not on the list. But Brent Scowcroft at the White House is, and brought it to the attention of President Bush, who discussed it with ex-President Nixon early this week.
The non-secret memo made its way into the hands of Daniel Schorr, writing an Op-Ed piece for The New York Times, and Times news editors immediately saw its news value as implicit criticism of Mr. Bush. Tom Friedman's front-page news story and next-day analysis not only exposed White House timidity but the shallowness of the position of Candidates Clinton and Tsongas.
The memo formed the basis of a speech delivered at a two-day policy conference in Washington sponsored by the Nixon Library. CNN telecast the speech worldwide live, and excerpts are on the nightly newscasts. The memo got around.
It cannot be ignored. But President Bush says only, "I don't have a blank check for all of that."
The new medium works, but what gave the memo force is not the repetition of Nixon's frequent calls to help Mr. Yeltsin, nor even his criticism of Western leaders and candidates for failure to heed that call.
Nixon goes against the grain of timidity and challenges the isolationists on political grounds. The man whose career began in the era of "Who Lost China?" now raises the specter of "Who Lost Russia?" To be timid now will cost a political leader dearly later.
He understands the vacuum sucking the life out of politics today: the absence of a global villain. For voters who need to be against something, Nixon supplies "the New Despotism." And it's no chimera; the danger, when you think about it, is real.
"If a new despotism prevails," warns Nixon, "everything gained in the great peaceful revolution of 1991 will be lost. War could break out as the new despots use force. . . . China's totalitarians [!] would breathe a sigh of relief. . . . A new Russian despotism . . . would be even more dangerous than Soviet totalitarianism."
If he's wrong, and the West spends $20 billion a year extending freedom, no harm done; but if he's right, and the New Despotism arrives, the U.S. alone would be spending 20 times that every year; no peace dividend; and our children would live in fear of nuclear destruction. Woe betide the politician on the wrong side of that.
Two decades ago, I went to furtive gatherings of Nixon hands; we called ourselves "the February group" and avoided notice. At the bipartisan, star-studded conference this week, with Nixon in his final comeback urging the assembled leaders to reaffirm national purpose, it was good to see many of those faces looking proud again.
My favorite Nixon, Julie Eisenhower, caught the wonderment: "We couldn't be sure this day would come. But I never stopped believing."

HEADLINE: Highlands Proposal Came as No Surprise at All

 BODY:
To the Editor:
Your Feb. 22 report that plans for a huge preservation area in the New York-New Jersey Highlands, an area where the states border, have surprised and angered residents is highly misleading. The New York-New Jersey Highlands regional study by the Forest Service is certainly no secret, and its recommendations are not intended to bar future economic development of the Highlands area. 
 Over the last year the Forest Service held more than a dozen public meetings in Highland communities. These hearings, sponsored by nine county governments, attracted more than 1,000 people -- including farmers, developers and landowners -- who came and testified on the work of the Forest Service and the content of the draft study report. Notices of these meetings went to more than 2,000 residents. There were articles in newspapers that serve the Highlands area before these public hearings.
The report presented the opinions of the vast majority of citizens and elected representatives who chose to testify. These people support Forest Service recommendations for conservation measures to increase local prosperity while protecting a landscape that provides 3.7 million northern New Jersey residents with drinking water and attracts more than eight million recreational visitors a year -- more than twice as many as visit Yellowstone National Park.
Meeting that challenge is the real story of the Highlands, and one that should be of concern to all who care about the New York-New Jersey area's economic future and quality of life.

HEADLINE: National Health Plan Anticipated by Truman

 BODY:
To the Editor:
In "California's Medical Model" (editorial, Feb. 17), you cite the medical plan put forth by John Garamendi, California's Insurance Commissioner, and say that it offers a model for every state. 
 On Nov. 19, 1945, President Harry S. Truman sent to Congress his medical health plan: "A request for adoption of a national health program" (H.R. 380-79th Congress, 1st Session).
In his 11-page request for legislation, President Truman emphasized that medical services are personal and that the nationwide system must be highly decentralized in administration and that the people remain free to choose their own physicians and hospitals.
His five-point plan included all citizens because all Americans ought to be assured, the proposal stated, "the right to adequate medical care and the opportunity to achieve and enjoy good health as well as the right to adequate protection from economic fears," such as sickness.
It seems to me that the plan coming out of California must just be the one President Harry S. Truman sent to committee almost 50 years ago. The buck has finally stopped -- I hope.

HEADLINE: BUSH CITES LIMITS ON AID TO RUSSIA

BYLINE: By THOMAS L. FRIEDMAN, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, March 11

 BODY:
Responding to criticism by former President Richard M. Nixon that he has not done enough to support democratic reforms in the former Soviet Union, President Bush said today that his Administration does not have a "blank check" to finance extensive aid programs.
 Mr. Bush did say that his Administration was now considering contributing to a multibillion-dollar international fund to stabilize the ruble, a key ingredient for economic reform in Russia. While other Administration officials have said United States support for such a fund was under consideration, this was the first time Mr. Bush himself had expressed his interest. 

 
Bush Response
 Nevertheless, when asked about Mr. Nixon's criticism at a White House news conference, Mr. Bush said: "Where we might have a difference, is we're living in a time of constrained resources. There isn't a lot of money around. We are spending too much as it already is. So to do the things I would really like to do, I don't have a blank check for all that. I think the question should be addressed to President Nixon."
 Mr. Bush's White House news conference was held in the morning, just a few hours before President Nixon, in an address to a foreign affairs conference across town, repeated his criticism of the American and Western response to the collapse of Communism and the breakup of the Soviet Union.
 The foreign affairs conference, sponsored by the Nixon Library in California, served as the occasion for the former President to make one of his most high-profile visits to Washington since he resigned the Presidency in disgrace in 1974 following the Watergate scandal. Mr. Nixon addressed the gathering of prominent foreign policy experts, foreign ambassadors and former Nixon Administration cabinet members at lunch. Then, President Bush addressed the conference himself in the evening.
 In his evening address, Mr. Bush, making no mention of the financial constraints he spoke about at his morning news conference, told the Nixon gathering that "turning our back on the world is no answer."
 "We invested so much to win the cold war," Mr. Bush said. "We must invest what is necessary to win the peace. If we fail, we will create new and profound problems for our security and that of Europe and Asia. We must support reform, not only in Russia, but throughout the former Soviet Union and Eastern Europe."
But Mr. Bush, who hailed Mr. Nixon as "one of the greatest statesmen of the 20th century," confined his remarks to generalities and outlined no new initiatives or spending plans to translate his declarations into action.
 
Recalling Harry Truman
 The 79-year-old Mr. Nixon, for his part, spoke for 30 minutes without notes or a lectern, and appealed to President Bush and Congress to join together in a bipartisan effort to transform the former Soviet republics into democracies. He said they should employ the same vision and energy that President Harry S. Truman used to persuade Mr. Nixon and John F. Kennedy, when they were both young Congressmen, to support the beginnings of the Marshall Plan 45 years ago.
 "All of the pollsters are telling their candidates, don't tackle foreign policy, and particularly not foreign aid, because foreign aid is poison as a political issue," Mr. Nixon said. "They're wrong and history proves it. In 1947, I recall vividly as if it were yesterday what Harry Truman did."
 In that year, Mr. Nixon said, President Truman's approval rating was 35 percent, and the Congress was overwhelmingly Republican controlled.
 "And yet, I remember Harry Truman -- jaunty, some said a little cocky -- coming down before a joint session of the Congress and asking for millions of dollars in aid to Greece and Turkey to prevent Communist subversion and possibly Communist aggression. It was a very tough vote for two very young and both, as history later indicated, rather ambitious young Congressmen."
 
Kennedy and Nixon Together
 The liberal Democrats in Mr. Kennedy's Massachusetts district were against military foreign aid, said Mr. Nixon. And the conservative Republicans in his own California district were against all foreign aid.
 "Under the circumstances, however, after considering it, we both voted for it," he said, "and a majority in that Republican House and the Senate voted for that program and that was the program which later was developed into the Marshall Plan and later into NATO, which not only contained Communism but bought the time that was essential for Communism to fail."
 The next year, recalled Mr. Nixon, Harry Truman won the election for President. What is more important, he added, is that that action by a Democratic President was supported by a Republican Congress.
 "And then you have a situation at the present time, where we have a Republican President with a Democratic Congress with the opportunity to take action which would provide aid to Russia and the other countries that we have mentioned here which would assure the victory of freedom," said Mr. Nixon. "That is the question, then, that Americans must face today, political Americans, all Americans, and I think we know what the answer should be."
 
Warning of 'New Despotism'
 The brunt of Mr. Nixon's argument today tracked closely with a memo he had circulated to friends and foreign policy experts in recent weeks, in which he stated that the United States and the West were missing a great opportunity to transform Russia and its neighbors to democracy by providing enough aid to insure the success of President Boris N. Yeltsin of Russia. Without such help, said Mr. Nixon, "a new despotism" will take hold where the Communists once ruled.
 The several hundred foreign policy experts gathered for the Nixon speech gave him a standing ovation. Mr. Nixon, though, did not take any questions, and therefore did not give any details on how he proposed the Government would pay for the aid he is talking about.
 Yet his appeal found admirers. Max Kampelman, a former Reagan Administration arms control negotiator, said of Mr. Nixon's speech, "It was the clearest voice we have heard from any political figure of either party during this period."
 Because of the attention Mr. Nixon's criticism has received, however, it may break the virtual silence that both Republicans and Democrats have kept on foreign policy issues thus far in the Presidential primary campaigns. Whether or not it changes the Administration's behavior, Mr. Nixon has forced has forced Mr. Bush to address the Russian aid question, which the White House has been avoiding for some time.
 "One thing Nixon is doing is giving the President the political cover with the Republican conservatives to go ahead with more aid -- if he wants it," said William Hyland, editor of Foreign Affairs Magazine. "The question is what will Bush do with it."

HEADLINE: THE 1992 CAMPAIGN: Democratic Voters;
Polling Shows Top Candidates Are Vulnerable

BYLINE: By DAVID E. ROSENBAUM, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: MIAMI, March 11

 BODY:
Both Bill Clinton and Paul E. Tsongas have significant weaknesses among Democratic voters even in the states where they won primaries on Tuesday, according to surveys of voters leaving the polls.
About 20 percent of the voters surveyed, not only in the South but also in Massachusetts and Rhode Island, said they planned to vote for George Bush in the general election. 
 Moreover, a third of the Democratic voters in the two New England states and a fifth in the five Southern states that held primaries on Super Tuesday said they thought less favorably of Mr. Clinton, the Governor of Arkansas, because he managed to avoid being drafted in the Vietnam War. Mr. Tsongas picked up a disproportionate share of the voters who said they felt that way, indicating the issue might be a fertile one for Republicans should Mr. Clinton win the Democratic nomination.
 
Cancer Worries Cited
 As for Mr. Tsongas, a significant number of Democrats said they were worried that his battle with cancer might make him unable to serve effectively. Mr. Tsongas, a United States Senator from Massachusetts from 1979 to 1985, retired at the end of his term because he had lymphoma, a cancer of the immune system. He and his doctor now say he has been cured.
About an eighth of the Democratic voters in Massachusetts and a tenth in Rhode Island said they were concerned about the cancer, as did about one-fifth in the South. Fewer than 40 percent of such voters in New England, and only a small fraction of such voters in the South, voted for Mr. Tsongas.
There is often a big difference between what voters say in the spring and what they do in November. So voting patterns in the primaries are often not as relevant to the probable outcome of the general election as they might appear. About a third of the voters in Tuesday's Democratic primaries in the South and about a quarter of those in Massachusetts and Rhode Island said they voted for Mr. Bush over Michael S. Dukakis, the Democratic nominee, in 1988.
One surprise in the voting patterns was the strength of Edmund G. Brown Jr. among voters who decided on whom to vote for in the last few days before the election. For example, in Massachusetts, Mr. Brown won only 15 percent of the overall Democratic vote, but he won 18 percent of those who decided how they would vote on Election Day and 30 percent of those who decided in the last three days.
 
Threat to Front-Runners
 Mr. Brown seems to have drained strength away from the front-runners -- Mr. Tsongas in New England and Mr. Clinton in the South. The capacity of the former California Governor to win over those who decide at the eleventh hour could prove important in Illinois and Michigan next week. Preliminary polls in those states last weekend showed about a third of the voters still undecided.
As has been the case throughout the primary season, Mr. Tsongas ran strongly among highly educated, affluent white voters, but was generally unable to cut into Mr. Clinton's support among all other Democrats.
Mr. Clinton won three-quarters of the black vote in Florida and about 80 percent elsewhere in the South. Outside of New England, he ran especially well among voters who said their own financial situation was worse than it was four years ago.
In Florida, the closest of Tuesday's contests, Mr. Clinton and Mr. Tsongas more or less split the Jewish and white Roman Catholic vote, but Mr. Clinton won solidly among white Protestants.
Mr. Tsongas did relatively poorly among blue-collar voters even in Massachusetts. He won only 52 percent of their vote, the exit polls showed, as against 67 percent of the overall vote.
The economy was the overriding issue in voters' minds. Given a list of issues, 48 percent of the Democratic voters in the South and more than half in New England said the economy was among the one or two issues that mattered most to them. Medical care, the next most important issue, was mentioned by about 3 voters in 10.

How the Poll Was Conducted
The Election Day exit polls were based on questionnaires completed by voters Tuesday as they left voting stations throughout eight states: Florida, Louisiana, Massachusetts, Mississippi, Oklahoma, Rhode Island, Tennessee and Texas.
The polls were conducted by Voter Research and Surveys, an organization created in 1990 by ABC News, CBS News, CNN, and NBC News.
In Florida, results are based on 1,794 Democratic primary voters and 1,509 Republican primary voters leaving 60 polling places throughout the state; in Louisiana, 1,086 Democratic voters and 811 Republican voters in 40 polling places; in Massachusetts, 1,359 Democratic voters and 963 Republican voters in 40 polling places; in Mississippi, 1,074 Democratic voters and 783 Republican voters leaving 30 polling places; in Oklahoma, 1,206 Democratic voters and 650 Republican voters in 25 polling places; in Rhode Island, 1,020 Democratic voters and 376 Republican voters in 19 polling places; in Tennessee, 1,021 Democratic voters and 895 Republican voters in 30 polling places. And in Texas, results are based on 1,847 Democratic primary voters leaving 60 polling places and 1,504 Republican primary voters leaving 47 polling places throughout the state.
In the Democratic primaries, the margin of sampling error was plus or minus three to four percentage points.
In the Republican primaries, the margin of sampling error was plus or minus three to five percentage points except in Rhode Island, where it was seven percentage points.
In theory, in 19 cases out of 20, the results from such polls should differ by only a few percentage points in either direction from what would have been obtained by seeking to interview all primary election voters who turned out. In addition to sampling error, the practical difficulties of conducting any survey of voter opinion on Election Day may introduce other sources of error into the poll.

HEADLINE: THE 1992 CAMPAIGN: Republican Voters;
Fault Lines in Bush's Base of Support

BYLINE: By PETER APPLEBOME, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: MIAMI, March 11

 BODY:
Despite President Bush's decisive victory over Patrick J. Buchanan in Tuesday's primaries, surveys of voters in eight states reveal several potential problems that could work against him in the fall.
Interviews with voters leaving the polls indicated that Mr. Bush's ratings were tied to the health of the economy; that his approval ratings fell in the states outside the South or with fewer voters born in the South, and that there was a continuing gulf in the voting choices of women and men. 
 As in past primaries, the findings, by Voter Research and Surveys, showed that Mr. Bush's ratings largely reflected voters' views of the economy and its impact on them.
That pattern held true again Tuesday as voters in the three states that have seen perhaps the most significant economic reversals in recent years, Florida, Massachusetts and Rhode Island, registered the highest disapproval ratings for Mr. Bush's performance.
 
Strong in Mississippi
 Almost two in five voters in all three states said they disapproved of Mr. Bush's performance. On the other hand, almost seven in 10 voters in Mississippi, a state whose economic fortunes never boomed and never busted, said they approved of Mr. Bush's performance.
The surveys showed a bleak view of the economy from Florida to New England. In Massachusetts, where the most pessimistic view of the economy was expressed, 85 percent of Republican primary voters rated the economy poor or not good. In Rhode Island, 82 percent of voters had the same assessment.
But even in the states with the brightest assessment of the economy, Mississippi and Tennessee, 72 percent of Republican voters described the economy as poor or not good. Voters with the bleakest view of the economy were consistently the most dissatisfied with Mr. Bush's performance.
In Massachusetts and Rhode Island, 57 and 56 percent of Republican primary voters, respectively, gave him a positive rating.
His highest approval ratings came in Mississippi, where 69 percent of Republican voters gave him a positive job rating, and in Tennessee, where 66 percent did so.
It is likely that cultural and regional factors, as well as economic ones, played a role in the vote.
Some political analysts said Southern Republican voters tend to be less likely than voters elsewhere to turn against a sitting President.
There is no way to be certain how much a role was played by economics and how much was due to cultural factors. But it is striking that the percentage of Republican primary voters saying they would vote for a Democrat, or not vote at all, in the fall was highest in the states farthest removed from the South or the least Southern in nature. Thus, 23 percent of Republican voters in Massachusetts, 19 percent in Florida and 18 percent in Rhode Island indicated that they did not expect to vote for President Bush.
 
On to the Midwest
 But in Texas and Tennessee only 12 percent of Republican primary voters said they would not support the President. In Mississippi, the figure was 13 percent. Analysts will be closely watching the readings in Michigan and Illinois next week to see if Mr. Bush's support is as strong outside the South.
Once again, the poll results showed a striking gap between male and female voters in the Republican primaries. Tuesday, it worked in favor of Mr. Bush. In the eight states that voted, his vote among women exceeded Mr. Buchanan's by margins ranging from 9 percentage points in Rhode Island to 16 in Massachusetts.
But men also made up a disproportionate share of the Republican electorate. They accounted for 53 percent of the Republian electorate in the five Southern states of Florida, Mississippi, Louisiana, Tennessee and Texas.
In Massachusetts, men made up 60 percent of the electorate. In Rhode Island, they made up 59 percent.
 
Duke Is Big Loser
 It is possible that Mr. Buchanan's harsh style and message accounted for most of the difference between him and Mr. Bush. But both the difference between men and women in the Republican electorate and the huge gap in their voting pattern could pose problems for Mr. Bush in the fall, particularly if he moves farther to the right in response to Mr. Buchanan's campaign.
The day's biggest loser in the Republican contests clearly was David Duke, the former Ku Klux Klansman and Louisiana state representative whose candidacy fizzled to insignificance on what he had hoped would be his day in the sun in his home region.
His performance may have helped put in perspective his two well-publicized races for Governor and United States Senator in Louisiana. In those earlier contests, many said they were voting for him, despite his past, either as a protest, as an endorsement of some of his ideas or as a vote against his opponents, particularly in his race for Governor against Edwin W. Edwards.
Many of his supporters in the earlier contests were Democrats, not Republicans, but poll results in the Republican primary tended to back the idea that Mr. Duke's support in the past was not wholehearted.
In Louisiana on Tuesday, Mr. Duke got the votes of only 23 percent of Republican voters who said they had voted for him for Governor last November. Mr. Buchanan got 36 percent of Mr. Duke's earlier supporters while Mr. Bush got 41 percent.

HEADLINE: CREDIT MARKETS;
Long-Term Rates Move Upward

BYLINE: By KENNETH N. GILPIN

 BODY:
Comments by President Bush helped to push up long-term interest rates during slow trading in the credit markets yesterday.
At a news conference, Mr. Bush told reporters he was more concerned about the health of the economy than in keeping long-term interest rates low. 
 Treasury bond prices, marginally lower during early trading, slumped after the President made his remarks.
"The market interpreted that remark to mean that the Administration will keep the heat on the Fed to push short-term rates lower and push for a tax-cut package," said Ward McCarthy, a managing director at Stone & McCarthy Research Associates in Princeton, N.J. "And, with so little going on, the comments got an exaggerated response."
Mitchell Held, chief financial economist at Smith Barney, Harris Upham & Company, said that "with rumors floating around that the February retail sales numbers are going to be strong, it was not a good thing for Mr. Bush to say." He added: "You get the sense that the market is still jumpy about the notion the economy is recovering."
 
Retail Sales Rise Expected
 Most Wall Street economists do expect that the retail sales report, which is due out today, will show that sales were healthy last month. But the analysts said the figures may exaggerate the strength because there were five Saturdays in February, the day when most consumers do the bulk of their shopping.
As prices of bonds and intermediate securities fell, prices of short-term securities firmed somewhat. Traders said there were rumors that an investor leaving the stock market had bought as much as $1.5 billion worth of two-year notes.
In the secondary market for Treasury securities, the 8 percent 30-year bonds of 2021 were offered in late trading at a price of 10015/32 , down 22/32 , to yield 7.95 percent, compared with 7.89 percent late Tuesday.
Among outstanding Treasury note issues, the 7 1/2 percent 10-year notes were offered at 9931/32 late yesterday, down 1/2 a point, to yield 7.50 percent. The 6 3/4 percent five-year notes dipped by 10/32 , to 9915/32 , to yield 6.87 percent. But prices of the 5 3/8 percent two-year notes rose by 1/32 , to 9921/32 , to yield 5.56 percent.
Short-term Treasury bill rates fell slightly.
Three-month bills were offered at a discount rate of 3.99 percent late yesterday, down one basis point, or one one-hundredth of a percentage point. Six-month bill rates fell by a like amount, to a late offered rate of 4.14 percent.
Issuance of new investment-grade corporate bonds was strong again yesterday, as more than $1 billion worth of new securities were priced.

J. P. Morgan Securities won the remaining $85 million worth of bonds, and reoffered these securities to investors at yields from 3.20 percent in 1993 to 6.40 percent in 2008.
The securities are rated AAA by both Moody's and Standard & Poor's.
In the secondary market for tax-exempt municipal bonds, traders said that prices of most widely quoted bonds fell by about 1/4 of a point.

HEADLINE: CREDIT MARKETS;
Long-Term Rates Move Upward

BYLINE: By KENNETH N. GILPIN

 BODY:
Comments by President Bush helped to push up long-term interest rates during slow trading in the credit markets yesterday.
At a news conference, Mr. Bush told reporters he was more concerned about the health of the economy than in keeping long-term interest rates low. 
 Treasury bond prices, marginally lower during early trading, slumped after the President made his remarks.
"The market interpreted that remark to mean that the Administration will keep the heat on the Fed to push short-term rates lower and push for a tax-cut package," said Ward McCarthy, a managing director at Stone & McCarthy Research Associates in Princeton, N.J. "And, with so little going on, the comments got an exaggerated response."
Mitchell Held, chief financial economist at Smith Barney, Harris Upham & Company, said that "with rumors floating around that the February retail sales numbers are going to be strong, it was not a good thing for Mr. Bush to say." He added: "You get the sense that the market is still jumpy about the notion the economy is recovering."
 
Retail Sales Rise Expected
 Most Wall Street economists do expect that the retail sales report, which is due out today, will show that sales were healthy last month. But the analysts said the figures may exaggerate the strength because there were five Saturdays in February, the day when most consumers do the bulk of their shopping.
As prices of bonds and intermediate securities fell, prices of short-term securities firmed somewhat. Traders said there were rumors that an investor leaving the stock market had bought as much as $1.5 billion worth of two-year notes.
In the secondary market for Treasury securities, the 8 percent 30-year bonds of 2021 were offered in late trading at a price of 10015/32 , down 22/32 , to yield 7.95 percent, compared with 7.89 percent late Tuesday.
Among outstanding Treasury note issues, the 7 1/2 percent 10-year notes were offered at 9931/32 late yesterday, down 1/2 a point, to yield 7.50 percent. The 6 3/4 percent five-year notes dipped by 10/32 , to 9915/32 , to yield 6.87 percent. But prices of the 5 3/8 percent two-year notes rose by 1/32 , to 9921/32 , to yield 5.56 percent.
Short-term Treasury bill rates fell slightly.
Three-month bills were offered at a discount rate of 3.99 percent late yesterday, down one basis point, or one one-hundredth of a percentage point. Six-month bill rates fell by a like amount, to a late offered rate of 4.14 percent.
Issuance of new investment-grade corporate bonds was strong again yesterday, as more than $1 billion worth of new securities were priced.
Among the issuers was the BankAmerica Corporation, which offered $350 million worth of five-year, non-callable notes through an underwriting group led by Lehman Brothers.
The 7.5 percent notes were priced at $99.351, to yield 7.659 percent, 82 basis points over the prevailing yield on the Treasury's 6 3/4 percent five-year notes at the time of pricing.
The securities are rated A-2 by Moody's Investors Service and A by the Standard & Poor's Corporation.
Delta Airlines offered a total of $300 million worth of notes and debentures through underwriters led by Goldman, Sachs & Company.
The $100 million worth of 10-year notes were sold as 8.50 percent securities and were priced at $99.627 to yield 8.556 percent, 1.10 percentage points over the prevailing yield on the Treasury's 7 1/2 percent 10-year notes at the time of pricing.
 
30-Year Debentures Priced
 The remaining $200 million worth of 9.25 percent 30-year debentures were priced at $99.56, to yield 9.294 percent, 1.37 percentage points over the prevailing yield on the Treasury's 8 percent bonds of 2021 at the time of pricing.
The securities are rated Baa-1 by Moody's and BBB-plus by Standard & Poor's.
In the tax-exempt municipal bond market, the state of South Carolina sold roughly $200 million worth of bonds in a two-part competitive bid.
A bid from a group led by Goldman, Sachs won $114 million worth of securities, which were then reoffered to investors with yields from 3.10 percent in 1003 to 6.25 percent on securities maturing in 2005.

HEADLINE: New York Region Concludes: Don't Expand Transit; Fix It

BYLINE: By IVER PETERSON

 BODY:
The $1.46 billion highway and mass transit rebuilding program announced in New Jersey last week is part of a regional attack on congestion and delays, which officials believe are undermining the economic future of the metropolitan area.
The theme of this effort is that the region's network of roads, railroads, bridges and tunnels is essentially complete. The challenge to transportation planners in New York, New Jersey and Connecticut is no longer what it has been for the last 200 years, building new routes across an ever-expanding megalopolis. Now, officials in Albany, Trenton and Hartford say, the task is to build more efficiency into what already exists. 
 Several factors have led to the shift in emphasis. Tightened land-use rules, particularly in New Jersey, are making it harder for development to sprawl at will with the expectation that roads will follow. The Federal Government's stringent Clean Air Act will start forcing drivers out of their cars by the middle of the decade unless pollution-generating traffic jams are reduced. And state economic development officials say the region is losing out to other, newer cities whose transportation networks are quicker and more efficient.
"Fiscal constraints, recent mandates from Washington and common sense demand new solutions in how we move people and goods," said Thomas M. Downs, the New Jersey Transportation Commissioner, in announcing the state's huge rehabilitation plan on March 4. "We can no longer build our way out of traffic congestion. We must instead repair, modernize and better manage our existing system."
 
Competing With South
 Mr. Downs was speaking for New Jersey, but he was echoing sentiments that have been expressed for months in other state capitals in the region.
"We have a lot of work to do," said Michael T. Saunders, deputy commissioner of the Connecticut Department of Transportation for policy and planning. "The overall competitive posture of the Northeast is dependent on its infrastructure, and ours is older, and it is subject to much more difficult weather, than our competition in the South and Southwest, and we are losing a lot because of it."
That means an emphasis on refining and restoring systems to enhance mobility.
"Mobility is the word we're all talking about," said David Murray, a spokesman for the New York State Department of Transportation. "That means thinking about moving people and goods, not just cars and trucks. That means park-and-ride, mass transit, high-occupancy vehicles. And improving what we have instead of trying to put down more pavement."
 
Cutting Friction in System
 Mr. Downs said in an interview before his new plan was announced, "I think of it as taking the friction out of the system we have."
The New Jersey program includes $282 million to repair badly deteriorated roads, including $55 million for Route 17 and Interstate 80 in Bergen County; $115 million to smooth traffic flow by synchronizing traffic lights on important local roads and to install automatic toll machines on the New Jersey Turnpike, Garden State Parkway and Atlantic City Expressway, $190 million to upgrade New Jersey Transit and about $40 million in recreational, tourist and freight projects, mostly to improve access to the New Jersey Shore.
Much of the money for these efforts will come from the recently enacted Federal Intermodal Surface Transportation Efficiency Act, which will pump more than $20 billion into the ailing system of roads, bridges and rails in New York, New Jersey and Connecticut over the next five years.
The money comes as the region's roads and bridges show the effects of long neglect during the years of official emphasis on building anew instead of maintaining what exists.
 
Huge Percent Needs Work
 Of New York State's 36,148 miles of primary and secondary roads in 1990, 41 percent, or 14,829 miles, were poor or fair, engineering categories for roads needing repair, resurfacing or rebuilding.
In New Jersey, 58.1 percent of the primary and secondary roads, or 6,241 miles out of 10,739, were deficient, while in Connecticut 44.3 percent, or 3,056 miles out of 6,895, were deficient. The figures come from the Federal Highway Administration.
Nationwide, the highway administration estimates that 57.3 percent of 1.07 million miles of primary and secondary roads are deficient.
In Connecticut, Interstate 95 between the New York State line and New Haven is at an "F" level of traffic flow, the worst on a congestion scale, during much of the day, state officials said.
 
An Antique Bottleneck
 In New Jersey, cargo moving between Newark Airport and Port Elizabeth, which form the hub of an emerging international trans-shipment center, is choked to a trickle at the two antique lanes of the Doremus Avenue bridge, a constant headache for drivers and transportation officials that will be alleviated somewhat under the new construction program.
In New York State in 1991, according to the Federal Highway Administration, 12,201 out of 17,304 highway bridges, or 70.5 percent, were structurally deficient, which usually means that they are posted to carry limited weight, or obsolete, meaning that they are sound but too narrow or too light to handle the traffic intended for the roads they serve.
In New Jersey, 3,066 of 6,041 bridges, or 50.8 percent, were deficient, and in Connecticut 1,878 out of 3,863 bridges, or 48.6 percent, were in need of repair or replacement. Nationally, the highway administration said, 39.1 percent of the more than half a million highway bridges were below standard.
New York and Connecticut have suffered notorious bridge catastrophes in the last decade. The Schoharie Creek bridge on the Gov. Thomas E. Dewey Thruway near Amsterdam, N.Y., collapsed in 1987, killing 10 people, and 3 people died in the 1983 collapse of the Mianus River Bridge on Interstate 95 in Greenwich, Conn. In both cases, poor maintenance and inspections were blamed.
 
Disaster Spurred Connecticut
 The Mianus collapse galvanized Connecticut into embarking on a $7.2 billion, 10-year highway and bridge reconstruction program that will be aided by the $2 billion in highway funds the state will receive under the new Federal transportation bill.
Since his election last year, Gov. Lowell P. Weicker Jr. has directed that special attention go to the state's crowded southwestern corridor, the I-95, Federal Highway 1 and Merritt Parkway network between Greenwich and New Haven.
Part of this effort will be to get local residents to break a bad habit they developed during the years of rapid growth and congestion: using the interstate for local trips.
"The situation right now is that I-95 in the southwest corridor has become like Main Street," Mr. Saunders said. "People who are only going one or two miles are getting on it and fighting for space with people who are driving from Florida to Maine. To the extent that we can, we'd like to provide an alternative for local traffic and leave I-95 for the long-distance drivers."
"Over 40 percent of our $2 billion Federal highway money, about $800 million, is in the bridge program," Mr. Saunders added. "So while we have tremendous needs on the bridge side, we will have the funds to make a strong attack on them."
In New York State, traffic in the Hudson River Valley north of New York City doubled during the last decade, and although it has just 11 percent of the state's population, or 2 million people, it experiences a quarter of the state's traffic congestion, state officials said.
 
Coordinating Hudson Valley
 Last year, Franklin E. White, the New York State Transportation Commissioner, created a pilot program for the Hudson Valley's seven counties -- Westchester, Rockland, Putnam, Orange, Dutchess, Ulster and Columbia -- to unify state transportation planning and spending there, so that no decision is made on, say, road-widening without considering its impact on mass transportation and even environmental protection. If the approach works, it will be applied to the rest of the state.
Under the program, there will be some money for traditional road widening, said Alan N. Bloom, the regional director, to channel traffic onto main arteries and away from the secondary roads that now take the overflow. The Taconic State and Hutchinson River Parkways and the Cross Westchester Expressway are among the major routes that are scheduled for added capacity.
"But we can't just build our way out of the problem," Mr. Bloom said in an interview. "The days of trying that are over." Instead, there will be new park-and-ride lots for commuters; better parking at train stations, including expensive but necessary rail-side parking decks; and lanes reserved for cars with at least two or three passengers on the Tappan Zee Bridge and on some major roads.
 
Infrastructure With Sense
 Finally, Mr. Bloom has been ordered to dip his administrative toe gingerly into local land-use rules, a touchy issue for municipalities empowered by the state constitution to govern who builds what and where.
"We know land use is controlled by the locality," Mr. Bloom said. "So we are trying to do what they have already done in Florida, in New Jersey, Vermont, Maine, in Maryland. We're trying to encourage development where you can put the infrastructure, and that means planning to provide infrastructure where it makes sense and not just in a haphazard way, because someone put a shopping center there or an office there."
The New Jersey state plan, which is to be published in its final form this summer, similarly gives state priority to local efforts to control growth. The plan would enable state agencies to withhold the needed roads, bridges, sewers and permits for any proposed development that violates the state's guidelines of clustering growth in in already developed areas.

THE DEATH OF AN EDITOR
In his years as editor of El Diario, Manuel de Dios Unanue had become the subject of a kind of running joke among his colleagues about the many threats he had received from anti-Castro Cuban groups, drug dealers and others he had angered. Mr. de Dios was on the front page again yesterday -- in a bold red headline that said "Sangre de Periodista," "A Journalist's Blood."

HEADLINE: Effort to Gut Tax Bill Fails In the Senate

BYLINE: By ADAM CLYMER, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, March 12

 BODY:
The Senate struggled tonight to clear obstacles to passing its election-year tax bill after confronting unexpected difficulty in killing a bipartisan attempt to strip the heart of the measure, a $300 tax credit for children. Senators agreed to try to complete action on the bill on Friday.
Two Democrats, Carl M. Levin of Michigan and Bob Graham of Florida, proposed eliminating the tax credits and spending the $28 billion designated for the credits on deficit reduction and public works instead. 
 Mr. Levin argued that the tax cut, which would benefit 17.8 million families, would omit three-fourths of middle-income families and that if Congress really wanted to help the nation's children it would reduce the national debt. Under his proposal, three-fourths of the $28 billion would have gone to deficit reduction. More middle-class Americans, he said, "say they want us to cut the deficit to get our economic house in order than are saying, 'Provide me a tax cut.' "
 
Long Wait for Roll-Call
 Although the rules call for 15-minute roll-calls, the Democratic leaders took an hour and three minutes to assemble the votes to kill the measure. Several Democrats were persuaded to change their votes, and the eventual tally was 57 to 39 to kill the proposal.
Earlier, the motion to kill the proposal had been behind, 50 to 46, as Republicans almost solidly supported the dissident Democrats, successfully spreading disarray in the rival camp.
This flurry was symptomatic of the tired politics surrounding the bill, which Democrats are using to argue that they care about the middle class while Republicans favor the rich.
The bill itself would pay for the $300 credits for children under 16 with increased taxes on about 800,000 well-off taxpayers, raising the top bracket from 31 to 36 percent on individuals with taxable incomes of more than $150,000 and couples with incomes over $175,000. It would also impose a 10 percent surtax on taxes attributed to incomes of more than $1 million.
It is these tax-increase proposals that have led President Bush to say he will veto the bill, just as he has threatened to veto a somewhat different set of proposals for tax increases and middle-class tax cuts in a companion House bill. No one in either house of either party believes a veto can be overridden.
 
Little Defense of Bush Plan
 But while Republicans scorned the Democratic measure, they offered little defense of President Bush's own program, the seven-point proposal of capital-gains cuts, accelerated depreciation allowances and incentives for the real estate industry.
Senator Warren B. Rudman, Republican of New Hampshire, assailed the Democratic bill as a "purely political proposal, the only purpose of which is to try to accentuate class divisions and portray Republicans who oppose it for sound economic reasons as being the party of the rich."
But he said the Bush proposal, while including some "more carefully targeted tax cuts" with some "prospect for stimulating the economy," was also defective. "The Administration's proposal loses all beneficial value by their refusal to pay for it," he continued, adding that it was based on an "accounting gimmick" and "fictitious savings."
"The two proposals are worse than doing nothing," he added. "If we do nothing, economic experts agree that the economy will, albeit slowly, work itself out of the recession. Doing nothing, at least, has the virtue of not making things worse in an effort to score political points and show the American people that we care."
 
Several Amendments Passed
 In the evening the Senate passed several amendments to the bill, some of which were plainly destined for quick discard in conference.
One such change was a proposal by Senator Arlen Specter, Republican of Pennsylvania, who proposed allowing penalty-free withdrawals of up to $10,000 from Individual Retirement Accounts for the purchase of new cars. Senator Lloyd Bentsen, the Texas Democrat who heads the Senate Finance Committee, called it "bad tax policy" but accepted it for consideration to save time.
Another such proposal, accepted on a voice vote, was an effort by Senator Harry Reid, Democrat of Nevada, to prohibit states from taxing pensions received by persons who do not reside in the taxing state.
But Senator Howard M. Metzenbaum won acceptance for a proposal, already in the House bill and backed by the Bush Administration, that would require purchasers of assets of defunct savings and loan institutions to account for assistance from the Federal Government, which is tax-free, when calculating gains or losses on sales of those assets.
That proposal would raise $500 million over the next five years, and Mr. Bentsen quickly moved to use that money and more by proposing to increase, to 100 percent, the deductibility of health insurance premiums paid by owners of small businesses. Only 25 percent is now deductible.
 
Wrangling About House Bank
 That spate of activity followed a slow afternoon. After Mr. Rudman's speech and the Levin-Graham effort, the Senate avoided action for more than two hours by wrangling about the House Bank and the bad checks written on it.
Senator Jesse Helms, Republican of North Carolina, said the "scandal in the House of Representatives is a dead cat also lying on the doorstep of the United States Senate" because many Americans do not distinguish between the two houses of Congress.
After repeated complaints that his attack violated Senate procedures by disparaging the House, Mr. Helms settled for a resolution, adopted without dissent, that no similar Senate bank should ever be established.
With no House-Senate conference on the bill planned before next Wednesday, the only real urgency for Senate action derived from senators' personal schedules. Mr. Bentsen The general expectation was that a House-Senate conference would go quickly, even though the two bills contain many major differences.
Democrats in both Houses want to get the bill to Mr. Bush so that he cannot complain that they took no action by his March 20 deadline, even if he dislikes the actions they took.
 
Major Differences in Bills
 But the Senate bill contains two major elements not touched on in the House bill. One is a Bentsen proposal designed to make it easier for small businesses to get health insurance coverage and to limit rate differentials and increase the portability of insurance policies for people who change jobs. Another is also a Bentsen plan, to make contributions to individual retirement accounts again tax-deductible and to create a new kind of I.R.A. whose income would be tax-free after five years.
Even on the basic stuff of the bills there are significant differences.
For example, the Senate's $300 credit, available in whole or part to families with incomes of $60,000 or less, would be permanent. The House has a temporary, two-year credit for one-fifth of Social Security and Medicare taxes paid by a worker, up to $200 for an individual or $400 for a working couple. And the House tax increases go to 35 percent, not 36 percent, but take effect at lower levels, starting at $85,000 of taxable income for an individual and $145,000 for a couple.
 
Problem on Capital Gains
 The bills also differ on how to reduce taxes on capital gains, though neither would go so far as the Bush proposal, which would reduce the maximum rate from 28 percent to 15.4 percent.
The Senate has a progressive rate, which cuts taxes on moderate-income taxpayers from 15 percent to 5 percent, while leaving a top rate of 28 percent for the better off.
The House would index capital gains against inflation. Under its approach, if someone bought stock for $1,000 and sold it for $1,500 after the cost of living had gone up by 25 percent, only the real profit of $250 would be subject to tax and not the $250 attributable to inflation.
Both House and Senate bills include provisions that would reduce to an effective 14 percent rate the taxes on new investments in small businesses if they were held five years.

HEADLINE: THE 1992 CAMPAIGN: Democrats;
Brown Draws Some Blue-Collar Support and a Campus Crowd

BYLINE: By KAREN DE WITT, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: FLINT, Mich., March 12

 BODY:
Edmund G. Brown Jr., the former Governor of California whose insurgent campaign has been reeling around the nation in search of supporters, appeared to have found some fertile ground in this state among union members and college students, particularly in economically distressed cities like this one.
Mr. Brown picked up endorsements today from Arthur B. Blackwell 2d, chairman of the Wayne County Commission, and from two of 15 other commission members. 
 Mr. Brown, who has taken to wearing a blue jacket given to him by a U.A.W. local in the state, today spoke to about 300 students, supporters and unemployed workers at the University of Michigan branch campus here, reiterating the anti-establishment, anti-big-money message of his "take back America" campaign.
 
Goodbye Jobs?
 Mr. Brown stressed his opposition to the United States-Mexico trade agreement. He said the agreement was a way to get cheap foreign labor and export American workers' jobs.
It is a message that resonates among union workers.
Mr. Brown said the International Union of Electrical Workers had encouraged him to remain the race. And Edward J. Carlough, president of the Sheet Metal Workers' International Association, has sent out videotapes to members of his his union saying that he supports Mr. Brown.
The Brown campaign in Detroit operates out of a Sheet Metal Workers office.
 
The Right Message
 Mr. Brown also railed against the politicians who he said had been co-opted by "the thousand-dollar campaign contribution" of the "moneyed interests" who cared little about the jobs, health and safety concerns of his audience. He attacked both his rivals for the Democratic Presidential nomination: Gov. Bill Clinton of Arkansas and Paul E. Tsongas, the former Senator from Massachusetts, as "more of the same."
It was just the message that Julie Harrington, 35 years old, and two friends who drove from Petoskey, 300 miles north of here, wanted to hear.
"This sign says it all," said Ms. Harrington, who held a hand-painted placard with the word "greed" in a circle with a slash through it.
"I want reform, and he's the only candidate talking it," said Ms. Harrington, who described herself as a waitperson and whose husband, Fred, is an electrical worker.
Senator Donald W. Riegle Jr., the senior Democrat from Michigan, introduced Mr. Brown at today's gathering, prompting Mr. Brown to quip, "The establishment may be joining our insurgent campaign."
But Mr. Riegle, who was in the city to visit his ailing father, was neither campaigning for Mr. Brown nor endorsing him.
"I certainly endorse some of his ideas, though," Mr. Riegle said. His district includes this depressed car-manufacturing city.
 
Toward Main Street?
 Mr. Brown also had a private meeting with Mayor Woodrow Stanley of Flint. Though not endorsing Mr. Brown, Mr. Stanley said that he, too, was intrigued by some of Mr. Brown's ideas.
"Those ideas have to find themselves into the main street," said Mr. Stanley, who noted that his city had an unemployment rate of 27 percent. "I've heard far too much about a middle-class tax cut and not enough about how that will help the cities. I want a vision that restores."
Mr. Stanley said that he expected to meet with the two other candidates in the next couple of days and would then make an endorsement.
In endorsing Mr. Brown, Mr. Blackwell said: "Speaking as an African-American and an elected official, Brown's message is very strong, very succinct, and it means a lot to us, particularly his emphasis on jobs."
 
Message Is Heard
 On Wednesday, Mr. Brown traveled to Marquette in Michigan's sparsely populated Upper Peninsula.
"We're making Michigan a major focus," Mr. Brown said. "We're here to bring the message to everyone. This is not the same old thing."
The strategy is apparently having some success. Mr. Brown was met at the airport by 150 enthusiastic people, organized with one day's notice in the wake of two major snow storms.
"He's fresh," said Jere DeFant, who organized the event. She said the turnout was exceptionally large given the area's population.
"He's talking about the things we're interested in: the environment, radically revising the tax system and a universal health system," she said, adding that Mr. Brown's message was hitting the right notes with mine and timber workers.
Mr. Brown ended the day in Chicago speaking to 600 students at Loyola University.
He returns to Michigan over the weekend, working hard for a victory or a strong showing in the Michigan and Illinois primaries on Tuesday that he said would "shock the daylights out of the Washington political establishment."
As he told a cheering audience of 1,400 students at Western Michigan State University Wednesday night: "From a nuisance, we've become a wild card. Next week we'll become a movement and change the nature of politics in this country."

HEADLINE: Kinnock Alters Course, Raising Question: Where's He Now?

BYLINE: By CRAIG R. WHITNEY, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: LONDON, March 12

 BODY:
Neil Kinnock, the leader of Britain's opposition Labor Party, had his last joust in the House of Commons today before the April 9 elections.
Why, Mr. Kinnock, looking very prime ministerial in a dark blue suit, wanted to know, wouldn't Prime Minister John Major join him and the Liberal Democratic leader, Paddy Ashdown, in a televised campaign debate? 
 Mr. Kinnock was trying "to whip a little fervor into this chestnut," Mr. Major contended. Besides, he and Mr. Ashdown would be lucky to get a word in edgewise with the eloquent but wordy Labor leader.
"Whipped chestnuts is a new one on me," Mr. Kinnock said, charging Mr. Major with being afraid to debate the real issues raised by a prolonged recession. What the Prime Minister had said, in rejecting the debate proposal, was this, "Every party politician that expects to lose tries that trick, and every politician who expects to win says no."
 
Voters Have Reservations
 For the first time in more than a decade, Labor has a chance of winning a British general election, according to all the polls. But they also show that when they cast their ballots April 9, many voters will have reservations whether Labor's leader, Neil Kinnock, would make a good Prime Minister.
The paradox that Mr. Kinnock, whose 50th birthday is March 28, faces is this: He transformed his party and its positions, after a decade in the left-wing wilderness, so thoroughly that many people now wonder what he really stands for. Personally, all polls show that he is the least popular of the three main national party leaders, far behind the Conservative Prime Minister, John Major.
A Gallup survey published in The Daily Telegraph last Friday, for example, showed that the proportion of voters who thought Mr. Major would "make the best Prime Minister" was 41 percent, compared with only 25 percent who thought Mr. Kinnock would. The poll was based on 10,405 interviews conducted through month of February.
Mr. Kinnock predicted Labor that would win the election with a 20-seat majority in the House of Commons, which would require an unprecedented gain of 127 seats over what the party has now. But win or lose on April 9, the short, balding Welshman with the mellifluous voice will get all the credit or take all the blame. Which it will be is, at the moment, impossible to tell, with the public opinion polls early in the campaign showing Labor and Conservatives running neck and neck.
 
A Marked Change in Views
 He himself makes no bones about how much his views have evolved since his own student days, or even since the early 1980's. At University College in Cardiff, Wales, in the 1960's, and right up the beginning of this decade, both Mr. Kinnock and his wife, Glenys, were members of the Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament. The last time he ran for Prime Minister, in 1987, Mr. Kinnock still supported unilateral British nuclear disarmament, to the dismay of the Reagan Administration, and Labor lost decisively.
Mr. Kinnock got his party to drop its commitment to unilateral disarmament in early 1989, just before the collapse of Communism in Eastern Europe. The Kinnocks also let their membership in the anti-nuclear campaign lapse in 1991.
Mr. Kinnock would probably include British nuclear weapons in future disarmament talks, a position Mr. Major has not yet espoused, and Labor's past positions are no longer of much concern since the disintegration of the Soviet Union last year.
Things were very different when Mr. Kinnock took over the party leadership in 1983, after Labor's second consecutive defeat at the hands of Margaret Thatcher. Mr. Kinnock, then 41, had been parliamentary private secretary to his mentor, Michael Foot, an erudite left-wing Laborite who had lost the election after Mrs. Thatcher's victory in the Falklands Islands.
But the militantly Socialist positions of the day had cost Labor in other ways as well. A 10th of Labor's Members of Parliament deserted the party to form the Social Democratic Party, with such distinguished former Labor leaders as Roy Jenkins, David Owen and Shirley Williams among the defectors.
 
Youth Shaped by Hardship
 The new party faded away after Mr. Kinnock began making his changes. But when he began, little in his background suggested that he would be the man to force the changes. Born in Tredegar, in Wales, into a miner's family in 1942, Mr. Kinnock's youth was shaped by hardship and what he himself called "proletarian politics."
At his university, he took a degree in industrial relations and history, and met Glenys while he was chairman of the Socialist Society and she was campaigning against the bomb.
As late as 1983, he was saying that Labor could never accomplish the social and political change it sought without "a major extension of public ownership and control."
But by 1990 he was telling BBC Television that nationalization of British industry was "simply not something that's on offer." Instead, a party platform published that year promised a moderate policy in which its government would do more than the Conservatives had supposedly done to foster a climate in which private enterprise could flourish.
Mr. Kinnock's Labor Party pledges itself to prudent low-inflation economic policies. "We will not spend, nor will we promise to spend, more than Britain can afford," it says, adding that it is firmly committed to enthusiastic British membership in the European Community and in its monetary system. The party's election manifesto will be published next week.
The American Ambassador, Raymond G. H. Seitz, gave a dinner for the Kinnocks last week and paid tribute to the Labor leader's transformation of his party. Mr. Kinnock, who has been to the United States only twice since 1987, sidestepped a question today about President Bush's comment Wednesday that his respect for Mr. Major knew no bounds. President Bush, Mr. Kinnock said, had "made an honest, measured and reasonable response" to the question he had been asked at a White House news conference.
Mrs. Kinnock, like her husband, is confident about who will win. She said the family expected to move into 10 Downing Street in April, but will keep the house with the red door in Ealing for their two children, Rachel and Stephen, both at college.

HEADLINE: THE 1992 CAMPAIGN: Campaign Journal;
For New Ideas, It's a Week That Isn't

BYLINE: By JOHN TIERNEY, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: CHICAGO, March 12

 BODY:
As sanctimonious as ever, the Democratic Presidential candidates are all on television here, attacking traditional politicians and promising radical reforms. But viewers may be wondering what exactly makes these enlightened rebels so different.
Gov. Bill Clinton of Arkansas, who likes to calls himself an "agent of change" against the "brain-dead politics" of the past, arrived here to pose for the cameras and effusively praise Chicago's Mayor, Richard M. Daley, the heir and namesake of America's most famous machine politician. Meanwhile, Mr. Clinton's television advertising is lambasting one of his opponents in next Tuesday's primaries in Illinois and Michigan, former Senator Paul E. Tsongas of Massachusetts, for daring to even mention some new ideas. 
 Mr. Tsongas, who likes to stress his devotion to the issues and his abhorrence of attack advertising, is running commercials that essentially call Mr. Clinton a liar without offering any evidence.
And former Gov. Edmund G. Brown Jr. of California, who promises to save politics from the evils of moneyed contributors and lobbyists, is now suiting up in the uniform of one of Washington's more powerful special-interest groups.
 
Fashionable Jackets
 Mr. Brown's fashion statement, on display at factory gates and in front of microphones, consists of his trademark white turtleneck under a shiny blue warmup jacket with the logo of the United Automobile Workers. He does not seem to have taken off the jacket since he unveiled it to prime-time television audiences on Tuesday night in interviews that he conducted with network anchors from the U.A.W. union hall in Romulus, Mich.
"These people have been ripped off," Mr. Brown repeated in the interviews as he stressed his opposition to a free-trade pact with Mexico. "Jobs are being exported to Mexico and everywhere else, and these people feel it. They're angry and they know that neither Bush nor even the leadership of their own party care about what's happening in their families and their neighborhoods."
Mr. Brown looked pleased when David Brinkley of ABC News quoted the candidate's promise to "challenge the corrupt political system dominated by the Washington elites." But Mr. Brown did not seem to include the auto workers' union among these elites, even though it is a well-established presence in Washington and has its share of critics.
"If Jerry Brown wants to talk about who's ripping off working people, the U.A.W. would be a good place to start," said James Bovard, the author of a book on protectionism, "The Fair Trade Fraud" (1991, St. Martin's Press ). He faults the union for supporting restrictions and tariffs on imports of foreign cars.
 
'It's Highway Robbery'
 "Brown is pandering to a union that gives hundreds of thousands of dollars a year to Congressmen to keep restrictions on imports," Mr. Bovard said. "Those restrictions added $1,600 to the cost of the average new car during the mid-1980's. It's highway robbery to make an American car buyer, who on the average makes a lot less money than than an auto worker, pay an extra $1,600 to bankroll the auto workers' high salaries."
Mr. Tsongas also tried the warmup-jacket look, wearing one during a visit to a predominantly black high school here, but the visual highlight of his campaign so far has turned out to be less flattering. As his plane was taxiing at Chicago's Midway Airport on Wednesday, preparing to take him to Michigan, a wheel got stuck in the mud next to the runway -- and, unluckily for Mr. Tsongas, not far from television cameras.
Cheap symbols and visual puns are always tempting to journalists in need of something new to say on the campaign trail, and this one was irresistible because of its timing right after Mr. Tsongas's poor showing on Super Tuesday. What better way to show his "stalled campaign"?
The wheel stuck in the mud starred on the local evening newscasts. Even after the plane finally took off, WMAQ-TV featured a live report from the airport that gave the pun one further twist -- "Now the candidate's only other job is to avoid the political mud likely to be slung at him along the campaign."
Today Mr. Tsongas flung a little mud himself in an advertisement broadcast by television stations in Michigan and Illinois. It features drum rolls and rising music accompanying shots of Mr. Tsongas as an announcer says, in the voice of a hard-bitten detective: "This is Paul Tsongas. He's not pretty. He's not very polished."
Mr. Tsongas lacks politicians' endorsements, the announcer continues, "because he doesn't just make promises, he tells the truth." He has "ideas and the guts to make 'em stick." Then the music stops abruptly, and the announcer recites the words scrolling across the screen: "He's no Bill Clinton. That's for sure. He's the exact opposite."
For anyone who missed the first reference to truth, the ad ends: "Paul Tsongas. He's not afraid of the truth."
 
Other Contradictions
 One of Mr. Tsongas's aides describes the commercial as "going negative in a positive way." There may be some other contradictions -- if Mr. Tsongas is not an opportunistic politician, why is he smearing his opponent without offering any proof or chance for refutation? -- but it seems to be one of the campaign's more effective commercials.
Mr. Clinton was on the news this evening inspecting cheesecake at a factory and denouncing Mr. Tsongas's commercial. He promised to stick to the issues, which are the basis for his new commercial in Illinois attacking Mr. Tsongas. It shows a copy of Mr. Tsongas' booklet, "A Call to Economic Arms," next to a small photograph of the former Senator that looks awful enough to have come from his driver's license.
Pages flip as the announcer cites specifics, and the ad ends with the booklet shutting. "Isn't it time we closed the book on the 1980's?" the announcer says. "Paul Tsongas. More of the same."
It, too, is an effective advertisement, and it contains some truth: One of Mr. Tsongas's proposals, cutting the capital gains tax, is reminiscent of the 1980's.
But other ideas singled out in the ad, including the possibility of reducing future cost-of-living increases in benefits to wealthy Social Security recipients, are in fact popular among many of the reform Democrats that Mr. Clinton likes to associate himself with. Many neo-liberals have argued, for instance, that poor young workers in Detroit should not be subsidizing retirees in Palm Beach.
 
Back Home in Chicago
 But this is not really a week for new ideas, at least not new ideas that can be easily attacked with conventional techniques like 30-second commercials. And Mr. Clinton looks very comfortable falling back on the old politics.
The Arkansan appears regularly on the screen offering uncontroversial proposals like "putting people first" and "people-based economics." He does not explain what non-people-based economics would be, but he has the proper triumphant look of the front-runner.
So does his wife, Hillary, who took Mr. Clinton back to her old high school and demonstrated exactly how malleable campaigners can be.
Viewers who watched Mrs. Clinton's appearance on the CBS News program "60 Minutes" a few weeks ago detected a Southern twang as she talked about her marriage and Tammy Wynette, but there was no trace of it this week when she went back to her high school in the Chicago suburb of Park Ridge. In fact, for some reason it sounded as if her Chicago accent was coming back.

Blackwell, left, whose endorsement Mr. Brown sought. (Peter Yates for The New York Times)

HEADLINE: U.S. and Jordan, Allies Again, Share Views on Iraq

BYLINE: By BARBARA CROSSETTE, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, March 12

 BODY:
King Hussein of Jordan, visiting Washington for the first time since the Persian Gulf war, met with President Bush today and later agreed to press for "full Iraqi compliance" with United Nations resolutions against Baghdad, the White House said.
Thus the King and the President appear to have begun mending ties. The relations, formerly close, ruptured last year when the Jordanians refused to join the forces ranged against Saddam Hussein of Iraq. 
 "He is my friend, and I welcome him back here," Mr. Bush said as the King arrived at the White House. It was the first meeting between the two since August 1990, although Secretary of State James A. Baker 3d and the King have met since then.
"The King feels that the relationship is back on track," Marwan J. Muasher, a spokesman for the Jordanian Government, said this evening. "Both sides want to look toward the future."
 
Relationship Inches Forward
 Administration officials have been encouraged by King Hussein's support for the Mideast peace process: Israeli talks with a Jordanian delegation have apparently accomplished more than talks with the Lebanese, Syrian and Palestinian delegations, officials say.
Experts on the region also said the King had brought to Washington new information on the position of the Palestinians since the latest round of Mideast peace talks ended last week.
But in the Administration and in Congress, there is still apprehension that Jordan continues to weaken the effect of a United Nations-mandated embargo on Iraq by allowing Baghdad to purchase in Jordan or ship through the country tons of goods and equipment in violation of sanctions. Only humanitarian goods like food and medical supplies may be imported by Iraq.
The Senate Foreign Relations Committee has been seeking since late last year to block resumption of military aid to Jordan, citing the reports of embargo violations. Jordan denies it is violating United Nations resolutions.
King Hussein will meet Congressional leaders on Friday to discuss aid and other issues. The Bush Administration began to restore non-military aid last summer.
 
'Courageous and Forthright'
 While acknowledging past "difficulties" with Amman, President Bush told reporters at a photography session after greeting the King, "Jordan has taken a very courageous and forthright position on the peace talks."
The White House said King Hussein spoke to the President about Jordan's difficult economic situation and was assured that "the United States would continue to do what it could to help Jordan directly and through international financial institutions."
 
Hussein's Problems at Home
 "Jordan's economic situation is terrible," said Robert B. Oakley, a former diplomat who now directs Middle East projects at the United States Institute for Peace, a Government-backed institution in Washington. Jordan has lost most of its trade with Iraq and the income gained from serving as a port for Iraqi exports.
"More than 300,000 Palestinian-Jordanians were driven out of jobs in the gulf," he said. "From being employed and sending money home, they've come home to join the unemployed and become a burden."
Mr. Oakley, who recently toured the Middle East, said the King had to face other tensions that predate the Persian Gulf war. As an example, he said the King "has to face a Parliament with a plurality of Muslim Brothers opposed to the existence of Israel and the peace process."
In addition, Mr. Oakley said, there are close ties between the Jordanian and Iraqi military, forces that worked together in the Iran-Iraq war with the approval of the United States, which was interested then in building up Iraq at Iran's expense.
Those Jordanian-Iraqi ties can now be looked at two ways: The Iraqis could attempt to unsettle Jordan if the King moved too close to the United States, or Washington might see the ties as a route to the Iraqi military, where it hopes to encourage rebellion against Saddam Hussein.

HEADLINE: Rise in Japan Antitrust Fine

BYLINE: AP

DATELINE: TOKYO, March 12

 BODY:
Responding to United States criticism that illegal monopolies face only light penalties in Japan, the Fair Trade Commission said today that it plans to increase the maximum fine to 100 million yen, about $752,000.
The change is the latest in a series of steps Japan has taken to make it costlier for businesses to engage in anti-competitive practices. 
 Last year, Japan raised surcharges to be levied on sales made by companies operating in illegal cartels to 6 percent from 1.5 percent. It also imposed prison terms of up to three years for violators.
Hiroshi Kasahara, the Fair Trade Commission's spokesman, said the new fines would be levied against corporations convicted of price-fixing, bid-rigging or monopolistic actions.
The maximum fine for individuals who violate the Anti-Monopoly Act will remain 5 million yen, or $38,000, -- the same maximum now for corporations, he said.
The plan was endorsed today by a special council of the governing Liberal Democratic Party, Mr. Kasahara said. The revision is to be submitted to Parliament, where passage is assured, and the commission plans to put it into effect some time in the fiscal year starting April 1, he said.
Reiichi Yumikura, chairman of the committee on competition policy for the Federation of Economic Organizations, said Japanese industry considered the proposed increase in fines "very severe."
But Mr. Yumikura, who is president of the Asahi Chemical Industry Company, a major maker of synthetic fibers, said in a statement that the Government should extend the coverage of the anti-monopoly law. The law now has many exceptions, he said.

HEADLINE: OTB Officials Take On Critics At a Hearing

BYLINE: By SELWYN RAAB

 BODY:
The top executives of New York City's legal off-track gambling parlors clashed with state and city officials yesterday over whether the system was on the verge of losing money and should be sold to a private company.
A City Council committee asserted in a report that while profits declined in the last two years executives of the New York City Offtrack Betting Corporation authorized $267,000 for travel, meal and lodging; $40,000 for dining out and entertaining legislators; $428,000 to maintain a fleet of cars; $20,000 for an executive bathroom; $8,000 for employees to take a course in women's studies at Cornell University and $1,050 in political contributions. 
 The president and chief executive of the agency, Hazel N. Dukes, disputed many of the findings of excessive spending as inaccurate or as justifiable costs for an agency with an annual budget of more than $100 million. At a hearing in City Hall, Ms. Dukes, who was appointed by Mayor David N. Dinkins in July 1990, maintained that she had put into effect economies that would save $7.6 million a year and that plans were in the works that would increase the city's share of OTB revenues.
She challenged an assertion by the State Comptroller, Edward V. Regan, that about 70 of the city's 95 off-track branches were unprofitable. She said two were in the red. Ms. Dukes asserted that that a principal reason that revenues had dropped was the Legislature's requirement that OTB turn over more than $80 million a year to the racing industry.
Ms. Dukes, asked by Councilman Israel Ruiz if she felt she was "not getting a fair shake" as an administrator because she is the first black president of the corporation, said that staff members of the Council's Finance Committee "had tried to find every disgruntled employee to testify" against her.
"I am as clean as clean can be," she said as supporters in the second-floor chamber applauded.

HEADLINE: THE 1992 CAMPAIGN: Illinois;
Clinton Hopes Groundwork of 1991 Will Keep Him Rolling in the North

BYLINE: By ROBIN TONER, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: CHICAGO, March 12

 BODY:
Gov. Bill Clinton was keenly aware of the Super Tuesday trap that his fellow Southerner, Senator Albert Gore, fell into four years ago when he rolled out of the South with a string of primary victories -- and skidded to a halt in the North.
That explains why the Arkansas Governor began establishing a northern beachhead in Illinois last year. Now, with an array of endorsements and a foundation of political support cultivated for months, Mr. Clinton is hoping for a decisive victory here on Tuesday to cap his Super Tuesday sweep and push him substantially closer to the Democratic nomination. And former Senator Paul E. Tsongas of Massachusetts, who opened a campaign office in Illinois only a few weeks ago, is trying to make a virtue out of necessity. 
 Mr. Tsongas's new television commercial in Illinois declares, "He's not the guy with all the endorsements from politicians because he doesn't just make promises." Former Senator Adlai Stevenson 3d, whose endorsement was one that Mr. Tsongas has managed to acquire, said in an interview today: "He's the underdog. He's had very little organization, very little money, but I think the message resonates."
 
'Strength Is Broad'
 Paul Green, an expert on politics at Governors State University, said Mr. Clinton should be considered the favorite here but added that his "strength is broad, but not very deep."
Both The Chicago Tribune and The Chicago Sun Times published public opinion polls last weekend showing a tightening race between Mr. Clinton and Mr. Tsongas, but those surveys were conducted before Mr. Clinton got a burst of good publicity from his Super Tuesday victories. Some Democrats say that many Illinois voters are only beginning to focus on the race.
Mr. Clinton paid a highly publicized call on Mayor Richard M. Daley this week, but the Mayor remains neutral, although "friendly neutral," as one Clinton supporter put it. Still, Mr. Clinton has garnered the support of numerous Chicago pols, including many of the people around Mr. Daley. Mr. Clinton's campaign is heavy with veterans of Illinois politics, like David Wilhelm, the campaign manager, who also managed Mr. Daley's 1989 and 1991 campaigns.
Mr. Clinton, who prospered by building biracial support in the South, has also won some important endorsements here from black politicians, like former Mayor Eugene Sawyer, Commissioner Danny K. Davis of Cook County and Attorney General Roland Burris. Mr. Clinton's slate of delegates and endorsers spans the ideological and factional continuum of Democratic politics here, several Democrats said.
"They've spent a lot of time contacting and recruiting people, and it's paid off," said Thomas Hynes, the Cook County Assessor, who signed on with the Clinton campaign last year.
 
Mrs. Clinton's Hometown Roots
 Added to this are Hillary Clinton's hometown roots here and what many Democrats described as the affinity of southern Illinois for a Southerner.
Against this, the Tsongas campaign is vowing to regain control of the campaign debate here, after spending the final five days of the Super Tuesday primaries on the defensive. "Ultimately, it will depend on whether Paul Tsongas's message can overcome Bill Clinton's machine," said Dennis Kanin, the Tsongas campaign manager. "In Florida, we got sidetracked a bit because we wanted to set the record straight. We're just not going to get diverted this time."
Mr. Tsongas's television advertising tries to resurrect the anti-politician appeal that stood him in good stead in earlier primaries. "He's not pretty," the announcer declares. "He tells the truth. He has ideas to make our economy grow, build jobs and invest in future generations." The announcer adds: "He's no Bill Clinton. That's for sure."
Mr. Clinton's television advertising echoes the lines of attack set out in Florida, arguing that Mr. Tsongas's bitter medicine for the economy is simply a replay of "trickle-down economics" and would mean another "capital gains cut for the rich" with higher gasoline taxes and lower cost of living increases for the rest of America.
Kitty Kurth, who is coordinating the Tsongas campaign here, demanded, "If they have all this organization and all this strength," why "have we got all this negative campaigning?" Tsongas campaign officials say they are looking for votes across the board, but based on earlier contests, the suburbs and particularly the lakefront areas are considered fertile ground.
 
Tsongas and Labor Vote
 Mr. Tsongas is also trying to reach out to groups that have not been a mainstay of his support, including blacks and organized labor. But several labor officials here said he faces a big hurdle on that front: his refusal to endorse legislation that outlaws the hiring of permanent replacement workers for striking employees.
"I don't care who it is, where it is," said Paul Giblin, Illinois legislative director for the United Auto Workers. "If you're against that, that's apple pie and motherhood." Mr. Giblin, whose union had been supporting Senator Tom Harkin of Iowa, who withdrew from the race this week, said he expected auto workers in Illinois to wind up in various camps.
Some, he said, might go to former Gov. Edmund G. Brown Jr. of California, who is making a concerted effort for labor votes. Others, he said, were backing Mr. Clinton. But Mr. Giblin said he heard very poor reviews of Mr. Tsongas's "pro-business" appeal from the "people I get feedback from."
Even before Mr. Harkin's withdrawal, Mr. Clinton had some labor backing of his own. Here in Illinois, the American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees was mailing literature supportive of Mr. Clinton to all 65,000 members in the state, as well as running phone banks.
 
Concern About Electability
 For all the talk of organization, however, Mr. Wilhelm, the Clinton campaign manager, said he expected the battle here to revolve around the two men's economic policies. "Illinois has 9.3 percent unemployment," Mr. Wilhelm said. "This is a state that's been a victim of trickle-down economics."
The Tsongas forces, meanwhile, are hopeful that their message can triumph once again. Ms. Kurth said the campaign had acquired 2,500 volunteers in the last two weeks. Mr. Stevenson said: "He's at least projecting the image of a man with the courage to tell the truth. That goes a long way"
Mr. Stevenson said that many of the elected officials backing Mr. Clinton "are doing so with little conviction and a great deal of concern about electability."
He added, "That is not to say they're any less concerned with Tsongas's electability."

HEADLINE: Surgeon General Warns of Smoking in Latin Lands

BYLINE: By WARREN E. LEARY

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, March 12

 BODY:
Latin America and the Caribbean are on the verge of an epidemic of smoking-related disease like the one that has plagued the United States and Canada unless governments work to stem the popularity of cigarettes, the United States Surgeon General said today.
Issuing the annual Federal report on the health effects of smoking, the Surgeon General, Dr. Antonia C. Novello, said the threat required coordinated action among all countries. 
 While 80 percent of the 526,000 smoking-related deaths each year in the Americas occur in the United States and Canada, she said, Latin America is primed to be the "growth" region for cigarette-related disease as disproportionate numbers of young people and women take up the habit.
The report said the popularity of smoking in Latin America was more sensitive to price than in North America, and the per capita consumption of cigarettes in Latin America declined in the 1980's because of economic recession. But health officials fear that the incidence of smoking will start rising as economic conditions improve, Dr. Novello said.
"It seems to us this is the perfect window of opportunity now to take action," she said at a news briefing. "Knowing these facts, it is our hope that hemisphere neighbors, poised to follow the same path, can avert the death and disease that inevitably result from tobacco use."
Smoking's prevalence in Latin America is 37 percent for men and 20 percent for women, Dr. Novello said, compared with 30 percent for men and 25 percent for women in the United States. But in some urban areas in Latin America, 50 percent of youths smoke, and the rate among women, particularly young women, is also rising rapidly, she said.
Dr. Novello's report called for systematic studies to determine how many people smoke in Latin America, how smoking is viewed culturally, how tobacco is produced and consumed and how taxation and legislation might be used to curb smoking.
Among the things that account for some of the rising popularity of smoking in Latin America, it said, are advertising, urbanization, growing population, improving education and the entrance of more women into the workforce. If considering the economic effects of the growth and sale of tobacco, the report said, Latin nations should note that health costs associated with smoking will far exceed the benefits.
Joining Dr. Novello at the briefing, the director of the Pan American Health Organization, Dr. Carlyle Guerra de Macedo, said governments must give a higher priority to controlling tobacco. He called for international studies, with assistance from the United States, to help the extent of the problem and a commitment to keep smoking from becoming epidemic.
In a separate report, the Federal Centers for Disease Control in Atlanta said surveys of teen-age smokers showed they chose the most heavily advertised brands when they took up cigarettes.
The agency said in its Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report that survey findings indicated smokers aged 12 to 18 preferred Marlboro, Camel or Newport cigarettes, the three most heavily advertised brands. Adult smokers also made Marlboro their first choice, followed by Winston and Salem. But adults smoked a wide variety of other brands, the report said.
The report noted that the preference for Camel jumped noticeably the year after the beginning of an advertising campaign featuring a cartoon camel, "Old Joe." On Monday, Dr. Novello called on the makers of Camel cigarettes to end their ad campaign featuring the character because studies suggested that it might encourage children to start smoking, a charge the R. J. Reynolds Tobacco Company denied.
Thomas Lauria, a spokesman for the Tobacco Institute, an industry group, said it was not extraordinary that younger smokers chose the most popular brands since adults did also. The industry does not encourage teen-age smoking, he said, but there is no evidence that advertising dictates who starts smoking and when. After people start smoking, he added, advertising influences brand choice.

HEADLINE: Latest Plan to Cure Welfare Troubles Borrows W.P.A. Blueprints of 1930's

BYLINE: By JASON DePARLE, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, March 12

 BODY:
In this season of welfare discontent, one of the oldest ideas in social policy is getting talked up as the newest solution: the Works Progress Administration, Franklin D. Roosevelt's sweeping public jobs program.
The creation of a new W.P.A. has long been a favorite idea of few policy hounds and unsuccessful candidates. But today it reached a kind of political maturation when a group of Congressional Democrats announced a legislative plan to make it a reality. 
 Roosevelt used the program as an alternative to the dole in combating unemployment, putting an army of jobless people to work building roads, bridges, schools, stadiums, culverts, courthouses, and other structures, many of which endure.
Senators David L. Boren of Oklahoma, Paul Simon of Illinois and several others see an updated purpose: giving welfare recipients the dignity of serious work, while offering taxpayers the benefits of tangible returns.
"The taxpayers get very little for what they are spending," said Mr. Boren, who is calling his program the Community Works Progress Administration. "Those on welfare are deprived of a sense of personal worth which comes from the satisfaction of performing useful work."
W.P.A.-style proposals are a variation on "workfare," but much more ambitious than the kind of programs that have recently been tried, which involve limited hours, modest work projects and are all limited to welfare recipients.
A quarter of the slots in Mr. Boren's program, for instance, would be open to people who are not on welfare. And he is putting an emphasis on building and repairing things, while many recent workfare jobs have involved less visible tasks, like filing.
Mr. Boren was quick to acknowledge that in today's cash-tight Congress, a modest pilot program might be all he could realistically expect. And he can expect to encounter many pockets of opposition after formally introducing the bill in the next few weeks. In the past, many liberals have dismissed such proposals as punitive "slavefare," while conservatives have conjured public works images of six people leaning on shovels while one digs a hole. In addition, public employee unions have resisted the proposals, which would provide rival sources of public labor.
But the plan is significant because it puts forth a welfare proposal far more radical than most now being discussed.
"For all the rhetoric about welfare, the nation has not been committed to coming up with the bottom line -- an actual job," said Sheldon Danziger, a professor of social work and public policy at the University of Michigan. "By now we've learned that if we really want to tackle the welfare problem, the Government has to act as an employer of last resort."
The talk of a new W.P.A. comes as welfare rolls reach record levels each month, many states are cutting benefits and a number of conservative politicians are trying to gain political advantage from denouncing the system.
In recent weeks, President Bush has added his voice to the chorus of critics, with campaign commercials that promise to "change welfare and make the able-bodied work."
Beneath the suddenly roiling surface of politics, the country has been stressing two different approaches to welfare revision in recent years.
One school, led by Senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan of New York and Representative Thomas J. Downey of Long Island, both Democrats, stresses the education and training of families on welfare. The two sponsored the 1988 Family Support Act, which now provides up to a $1 billion a year in Federal matching funds for states to train recipients.
But only about 60 percent of that money is now being spent, since states have had difficult coming up with their part of the matching funds. And in an economy where many people with more education and longer work histories are also unemployed, welfare recipients continue to face strong disadvantages.
The second approach, often called "the new paternalism," seeks to alter the behavior of the poor through financial rewards: those who stay in school get small bonuses in their welfare checks, for instance, while those who are frequently absent suffer financial penalties.
While these programs have a popular appeal, reinforcing middle-class values held by many voters, the amounts of money involved are usually modest, generally about $50 a month. And past studies of financial incentives have suggested that such small amounts have had little effect on major decisions like whether to work or marry.
The W.P.A.-type proposals are much bolder since they offer not just an incentive to get a job, but the real thing: the job itself.
"It represents a logical and radical approach that few politicians have been willing to support up to this point," said Mickey Kaus, who wrote an influential 1986 article in The New Republic calling for the replacement of welfare with a system of guaranteed Government jobs.
"Liberals have been unwilling to be tough enough, and conservatives have been unwilling to spend the money," he said.
Martin Anderson, a senior fellow at the Hoover Institution who served as President Reagan's domestic policy adviser, took a harsher view, citing the potential for big boondoggles.
"Jobs in the public sector are grossly inefficient," he said. "It's a bad idea, whose time has passed."
Senator Boren's plan would retain the current welfare system for women with young children and those enrolled in a education or training program. But most others would have to take public works jobs for up to 32 hours a week. The jobs would pay either the minimum wage, or 10 percent more than a welfare grant, whichever is higher.
The program would be run by the Labor Department. Local community groups, called private industry councils, would receive a set amount of money and design the kinds of public works projects they wanted to conduct.
Co-sponsors of the measure include Senators Harry Reid of Nevada, Carl Levin of Michigan and Thomas Daschle of South Dakota, all Democrats. In the House, Representative Glenn English, an Oklahoma Democrat, pledged to introduce similar legislation.
 
A More Expensive Approach
 At a news conference today, they acknowledged that the plan would be more expensive than simply mailing welfare checks. Supervisors must be hired, and building supplies procured.
But standing before the grainy, black-and-white photographs of Depression-era projects, the Democrats ticked off a list of W.P.A. accomplishments in the agency's six-year span, which ended in 1941: 650,000 miles of roads, 18,000 playgrounds, 125,000 buildings.
"We face a basic choice," said Senator Simon. "Do we pay people for being productive or nonproductive?"

HEADLINE: THE 1992 CAMPAIGN: In the Suburbs;
Clinton Pursues Disaffected Democrats

BYLINE: By GWEN IFILL, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WARREN, Mich., March 12

 BODY:
Arkansas Governor Bill Clinton set out to woo disaffected Democrats in suburban Macomb County today, appearing at an organized question-and-answer session where he tried to blend "old Democratic values" with a call for greater individual responsibility.
The Bush Administration, he said, has no strategy to preserve the automobile industry, reform health insurance or decrease crime. 
 Mr. Clinton calls for everyone, including members of unions, to accept change that would include relaxed work rules and increased opportunities for education and health care.
 
'Old Values'
 "Michigan is being punished now because your national Government has no strategy to take advantage of trade," Mr. Clinton told an overflow crowd at Macomb Community College here.
"I'm trying to give you a new Democratic Party based on old values that will make you want to come home to the Democrats in this county," he said. "But I'm telling you, there's nothing I can do to get around the fact that we have got to come together around values and across racial lines. And if we're not prepared to do it, we're not going to make it as a country."
But Mr. Clinton must convince the alienated Democrats who have voted for the Republican Presidential nominee in three successive elections here that the Governor of a small state who favored legislation promoting increased trade with Mexico is the best alternative.
Surveys taken of voters as they have left the polls around the nation in recent weeks have shown that Mr. Clinton is more likely to be an attractive choice for blue-collar and black voters.
In recent years, Macomb County, a working class, white-majority area, has become the most fashionable political laboratory for Democrats seeking to win back first the Senate and now the White House.
 
'I Want to Believe'
 It served no less a purpose today. "I want to believe in Bush," said Joan Telton, a registered nurse who came to hear Mr. Clinton speak today. "But look at what's happened in the last four years. It hasn't really touched my family, but that's because my husband is willing to go out and work 15 or 20-hour days. We're spending all of our time working."
Mr. Clinton and his advisers are convinced that Paul E. Tsongas holds little appeal to such voters because the former Massachusetts senator has become so closely identified with business interests. And Mr. Clinton is determined, as well, to neutralize Edmund G. Brown Jr.'s potential for attracting angry votes seeking to register a protest.
Stan Greenberg, Mr. Clinton's poll-taker, noted that Mr. Brown, the former Governor of California, is using Michigan as a base from which to broaden his appeal by pitching hard to union voters. But Mr. Clinton is seeking to convince these same voters that he can address their unhappiness more effectively.
Mr. Clinton must first quell some fears among voters in Illinois and especially Michigan who distrust his record on labor issues, a subject that has been raised repeatedly during two days of campaigning in and around Chicago and Detroit. Union members have been particularly skeptical of his support for speeding up a free-trade agreement with Mexico that they feel will reduce American manufacturing jobs.
 
Union, Nonunion
 "I am pro-worker," Mr. Clinton said in Chicago today. "I am not anti-union. I believe that most people in the work force work in nonunion jobs, so I have to address union and nonunion. This is a false fight. We get into the choice of union and nonunion. That is the choice of the people in the work force."
Earlier today, Mr. Clinton again faced criticism from Mr. Tsongas, who has continued to paint Mr. Clinton as someone unfit to be President.
Mr. Clinton said Mr. Tsongas's attacks on his character were rooted in frustration because in Michigan and Illinois "we finally started having an economic debate again."
But Mr. Clinton predicted that he would survive the criticism leveled at him by political opponents or by any further investigations into his background.
"I have no control over what you write or what others say," Mr. Clinton told reporters. "I know what my character is, and the only way to demonstrate it is by living.
"I've been called everything but a blue goose," he said.

HEADLINE: THE 1992 CAMPAIGN: Courting Labor;
Tsongas Tells Auto Workers Of 'Problem With Democrats'

BYLINE: By RICHARD L. BERKE, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: DETROIT, March 12

 BODY:
Paul E. Tsongas ventured into labor territory today wearing an automobile union windbreaker, but his message at an auto parts plant here was one that workers are not used to hearing.
Only during questioning from workers did the former Massachusetts Senator acknowledge his opposition to legislation championed by labor that would bar employers from permanently replacing striking workers. He also told them he supports the free trade agreement with Mexico that most unions oppose. 
 And Mr. Tsongas sounded like a Republican when he called for more venture capital investment and took issue with traditional Democratic economic policies.
"The problem with Democrats," he said, "is that they give all these things away. It doesn't create jobs. The Democratic Party's got to get its act together and understand how you can bring the economy back."
 
'Problem Is Not Past'
 Mr. Tsongas recalled his high ratings with labor during his Congressional career but said relations soured over his opposition to the striker replacement bill, which is backed by Gov. Bill Clinton of Arkansas.
"The problem is not the past," Mr. Tsongas said at a news conference at the Hermes Automotive Manufacturing Corporation, which has laid off more than half its workers in recent years. "The problem is the issue of striker replacement."
Insisting that arbitration was a better remedy, he said: "If there's a strike, if there's a lockout, the community gets killed. People lose their jobs."
Perhaps sensing that he does not go over well with union audiences, Mr. Tsongas abandoned talk of striker replacement and other topics critical to organized labor at a gathering later today in union hall at Rockford, Ill. Not once did he even mention the word labor. His only effort to identify with the audience on labor was in recounting the decline of his hometown, the "great textile city" of Lowell, Mass.
"Lowell's decline is what I grew up with," Mr. Tsongas said. "It's not a memo."
But his staff distributed flyers saying that Mr. Clinton "had one of the worst records on labor issues of any Governor," and noting that Arkansas is a "right-to-work state." The flyers offer a taste of television commercials that the Tsongas campaign plans to begin broadcasting on Friday in Michigan and Illinois that go after Mr. Clinton's labor record.
Mr. Tsongas has not been timid about criticizing Mr. Clinton on the issue. In conversations this week, he said, union officials told him they were nervous about whether Mr. Clinton could win a general election after accusations of an extramarital affair and efforts to avoid the draft during the Vietnam War.
Given his economic philosophy, it was far from clear that Mr. Tsongas could win labor support by finding fault with his chief rival.
"He's got some courage in walking into Michigan and auto worker territory and talking like he's talking, since his economic message is not that much different from George Bush's," said Donald R. Sweitzer, a senior campaign adviser to Senator Tom Harkin of Iowa before he withdrew from the race this week. "But the bottom line is he'll be rejected Tuesday by the people he's talking to today. Labor folk have a problem with both of these guys but less of a problem with Bill Clinton."
While Mr. Tsongas was greeted politely at the Hermes plant, at least one worker was not impressed with him or Mr. Clinton. "I favor Mr. Brown," Anthony Zentarski, who works in the paint shop, said of former Gov. Edmund G. Brown Jr. of California. "He just seems more in touch with the common worker."
At both labor events today, listeners said they wanted to hear what Mr. Tsongas had to say but were reluctant to commit their vote to him.
Greg Reiter, a firefighter in Rockford, noted that Mr. Tsongas did not say much about labor. "I like his ideas on rebuilding the country," said Mr. Reiter. "But there are questions he hasn't answered."

HEADLINE: U.S. Retail Sales Jump In Month

BYLINE: By ROBERT D. HERSHEY Jr., Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, March 12

 BODY:
Retail sales surged in February, and were far higher in January than first estimated, the Commerce Department said today in a report that analysts called the strongest evidence of economic recovery so far.
Sales soared 1.3 percent last month, after climbing 2.1 percent in January. 
 These were the first back-to-back sales gains exceeding 1 percent since 1985, and they prompted economists to scramble to raise forecasts of first-quarter national output.
 
 
'Recovery Is Here'
 "Recovery is here -- and it is on a firm footing," said Samuel D. Kahan, an economist at Fuji Securities in Chicago. "This clearly lays to rest fears about a double-dip recession."
The gains were "huge," said Edward F. McKelvey, senior economist at Goldman, Sachs & Company. "You can't find anything wrong with them," he added. "They're true strength."
The Bush Administration hailed the report, which suggested an economy increasingly likely to get noticeably better in this election year. "This economy is moving," Treasury Secretary Nicholas F. Brady told a luncheon audience at the National Press Club. "It has started. You can feel it."
The unexpectedly large sales gains sent tremors through the credit market, which fears that too rapid a recovery will revive inflation. Interest rates surged, with the return on 30-year bonds pushing above 8 percent for the first time since early November. [Page D13.]
 
 
Tighter Credit Is Possible
 The Federal Reserve is now considered most unlikely to lower interest rates further in this business cycle, and some analysts are beginning to discuss the prospect that the Fed may tighten credit, which would be likely to raise rates.
But despite increasing confidence that the fledgling recovery will not suddenly swoon, as did last year's, most economists continued to expect that the revival would be halting and uneven. Such caution was consistent with other Government figures published today showing that first-time claims for unemployment insurance rose 22,000, to 459,000, in the latest week, the highest level in a month.
And one of the most politically sensitive indicators, the unemployment rate, may well continue to rise even in an expanding economy, as people who had given up looking for jobs are encouraged to look again, but without immediate success.
Democrats took a dim view of last Friday's unemployment report showing that the jobless rate rose two-tenths of a point in February, to 7.3 percent. Senator Lloyd Bentsen, the Texas Democrat who heads the Finance Committee, said that people moving back into the work force "ran into a brick wall."
 
 
'On the Right Track'
 Still, analysts were highly impressed by the sales figures. Retail sales, which are considered one of the best indicators of current economic conditions, account for a third of gross domestic product and half of all spending by consumers.
"These data confirm that the economy is indeed on the right track," asserted Marilyn Schaja, an analyst for Donaldson, Lufkin & Jenrette.
The 1.3 percent gain in February, to $157.7 billion, included every type of retailer except food stores and was just as strong when the automotive group, which accounts for 21 percent of the total, is excluded.
Sales now stand 4.6 percent above the level of February 1991, suggesting a modest rise in the volume of goods moving across retail counters, since consumer inflation over the period was a bit over 3 percent. The department adjusts its retail data for seasonal, holiday and trading-day variation, but not for price changes.
 
 
Big January Revision
 But while the February gain was nearly twice as large as generally expected, even after strong gains previously reported by department stores, the bigger jolt came from the fact that this occurred from a raised January base. The revised 2.1 percent gain reported today, to $155.6 billion, compared with a modest gain of six-tenths of a percent first reported for January four weeks ago.
In a re-evaluation of her forecast, Ms. Schaja predicted that gross domestic product would accelerate to a rate of 3 percent "by the second quarter" and that it was now "extremely clear that the Fed will probably not ease policy again in this cycle."
Mr. McKelvey said that the data released today prompted him to raise his estimate of first-quarter G.D.P. from negative growth to a rate slightly greater than 1 percent.
But while the recovery would likely continue, he said, it would be held in check by various factors, including firmer interest rates and a weakening of European and Japanese economies that is likely to reduce demand for American exports.
 
 
Durable Goods Up 2.3%
 The February sales gain was 2.3 percent for durable goods, which include long-lasting items like furniture and cars and account for 36 percent of the nation's retail business. Sellers of building materials, hardware, garden supplies and mobile homes racked up a 5.7 percent gain, while automobile dealers gained 1.4 percent. Sales of furniture, home furnishings and equipment rose 1.3 percent.
Among nondurables, items from clothing to motor oil, the gain was eight-tenths of a percent last month, with gasoline stations enjoying the biggest advance, of 3.1 percent. Sales of apparel and accessory stores climbed 2.3 percent, department stores and other general merchants posted a 1.4 percent increase, drug and proprietary stores gained 1.2 percent and restaurants and bars edged up one-tenth of a percent. Sales of food stores, however, declined eight-tenths of a percent.
For January, the revisions that more than tripled the initial estimate were about $900 million for auto dealers, more than $800 million for general merchandise stores, and $400 million for stores selling home furnishings.
The 2.1 percent jump for the month was the biggest since February 1991 and meant that the first two months of this year produced consecutive gains of 1 percent or more for the first time since August and September of 1985.
 
 
Many Concerns Remain
 Yet growing optimism about the economy, paced by a comeback in housing, was accompanied by concern among many analysts about a still-sluggish job market, pinched incomes, high debt and low -- albeit steadier -- consumer confidence.
When asked to explain how consumers could be stepping up their retail purchases in such an environment, Mr. McKelvey said it remained something of a mystery. It might partly be explained by larger and earlier tax refunds this year and by money the Internal Revenue Service has acknowledged sending to many people it mistakenly thought qualified for a low-income credit.
Another reason for the restrained recovery was cited by Gordon Richards, economist for the National Association of Manufacturers. He pointed to "substantially overbuilt" inventories that will have to be reduced in coming months before new demand prompts companies to raise output.

HEADLINE: Villa Victoria Journal;
In the Drug War, U.S. Sows Dollars, Reaps Hate

BYLINE: By NATHANIEL C. NASH, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: VILLA VICTORIA, Bolivia

 BODY:
The woman, who would identify herself only as Gabriela, sat sullenly in the loft of a rickety hut with her tiny children. She had become the latest target in Bolivia's halting war on cocaine.
An hour earlier, an elite Bolivian anti-narcotics squad had barreled down a dirt road in a pickup truck and stopped at her house. A quick search behind the house revealed a path that led across streams and through swamps to a crude jungle laboratory for making cocaine base. 
 After dismantling the laboratory, the police had returned to Gabriela's home, where a search turned up 20 bags of coca leaf -- worth $350 -- that would probably have been used that evening in the lab.
"We know the people hate us," said Lieut. Ramiro Cuba Diaz, leader of the raid. "When we do this, we're taking their livelihood away from them."
 
Top Drug Traffickers Seized
 In the last three years, the Bolivian Government and the United States have tried to make this country a showcase in the fight against cocaine. Washington has spent $121 million to train Bolivia's crack police unit and equip it with M-16's, helicopters and four-wheel-drive vehicles, and an additional $293 million to help Bolivia develop altenative crops to cocaine and to pay farmers $800 for every acre of coca they agree to cut down.
Officials say that this year the Government has arrested more than a dozen high-level drug traffickers, shut down several big laboratories and seized almost two tons of cocaine base, an intermediate step in the refining process. But it is evident in talking with peasant coca farmers that the Government has yet to win the hearts of the people.
 
Broken Promises
 The field of conflict is well defined. There is a legal market in Bolivia for coca leaf chewed by local residents and for herbal tea and home remedies. Almost all the Bolivian coca that is bound for the illegal cocaine trade is grown here in the Chapare, an area about the size of New Jersey that butts up against the Andes and spreads out into the Amazon basin. As many as 150,000 Bolivians eke out a living growing coca.
In Peru, where two-thirds of the world's coca leaf is grown, attempts by stop cultivation and cocaine trafficking are severely hindered by the presence of leftist guerrillas. But in Bolivia, the main resistance to eradication of coca farming is economic.
Farmers who have accepted Government payments to cut down their coca plants and switch to other crops have found that at harvest time the price paid for their bananas, grapefruit, pineapples or other crops is so low that it does not support their families, or that the roads and bridges that the Government promised to build to get the produce to market have yet to be built.
After three years of intense efforts to get Chapare farmers to switch to other crops, the number of acres planted in coca has been reduced by only 15 percent, to about 84,000 acres.
"I think coca is here for good," said Pastor Garcia, who described himself as a middleman whose job was to transport coca. "It's the only product you can grow that you know you can sell the same day and earn enough to stay alive."
The industry seems vibrant enough at the coca market some 20 miles from here in Villa 14 de Septiembre. Under a corrugated metal roof that provides protection from the blazing jungle sun and torrential downpours, Andean women in felt hats, puffed skirts and brightly colored shawls sit on bags of coca leaf waiting for buyers. Hundreds of bags are for sale.
Villagers say there are no drug traffickers here, only legitimate buyers who will truck the coca to Cochabamba, some 100 miles into the mountains, where it will be sold to companies that make harmless herbal teas. But Government officials say most of the merchandise sold will eventually be bought by trafficking organizations and transported deep into the jungle to begin the process of making cocaine for the European and North American markets.
Officials argue that even though the numbers of laboratories raided and the amounts of cocaine seized went down in 1991, the size of labs being seized now is much larger and that intelligence gathered from jailed traffickers who are cooperating with the authorities should yield much more in the future.
 
Farmers Are Resentful
 "Two years ago, Umopar was corrupt, nonfunctional and would go into every operation yelling, kicking and screaming," said an American counternarcotics official, referring to the Bolivian drug police by their acronym. "Now they have cleaned up their unit and we have stepped back, putting them out in front. Now they take the initiative."
But in conversations with more than 20 coca farmers recently, only one spoke well of Umopar. Since September there have been over half a dozen incidents when peasants have tried to stop the police from destroying crops or when drug traffickers have shot at Umopar officers or agents of the United States Drug Enforcement Administration. One peasant has been killed and one D.E.A. agent wounded in recent shoot-outs.
"If there were real development, all our members would change to another crop," said Abelino Espinoza, a director of the coca market in Villa 14 de Septiembre. "But there is no market for these products yet. As far as we are concerned this 'development' is a deception by the Government. So we continue with coca."

Raids by elite anti-narcotic squads in the area, however, have reduced the acres planted in coca by only 15 per cent. "We know the people hate us," said an officer after a recent raid. "When we do this, we're taking their livelihood away from them." (Nathaniel C. Nash/The New York Times)

HEADLINE: Business Executives in a Survey Start to See Signs of Turnaround

BYLINE: By STEVE LOHR

 BODY:
Eyeing their cash registers, showrooms and shop floors, many American business executives are starting to see signs that the nation's sluggish economy is at last turning the corner.
Nearly half of 490 business executives surveyed in a New York Times/ CBS News Poll, see some inkling of improvement. Forty-seven percent of the executives, representing a randomly selected cross section of American industry from multibillion-dollar corporations to small family firms, said they were convinced that the economy was getting better. Forty-four percent said it was staying the same, while only 9 percent described it as getting worse. 
 This guarded optimism appears to be a recent sentiment. W. John Devine, chairman of Child World Inc. of Avon, Mass., a toy-store chain with 125 outlets in the Northeast and Midwest, marks the shift from the start of this year. Store sales stopped falling and increased a bit for the first time in 15 months. "It's nice to see plus signs in front of the numbers for a change," Mr. Devine said.
 
Retail Sales Surge
 Child World's experience was repeated at many other stores around the country. The Commerce Department reported yesterday that retail sales surged 1.3 percent in February, and said that results in January were also far higher than previously reported. [Page D1.]
Retailing is not the only industry where executives are feeling more encouraged. In Sterling Heights, Mich., Don Holton, president of Automotive Plastic Technologies Inc., has also begun to see an uptick in orders for the molded plastic parts it makes for Chrysler, General Motors, Mazda and Toyota. "We're kind of bullish about what's going on here," he said.
Chun Chiu, president of Quality Semiconductor Inc., has noticed the improvement as well. His Santa Clara, Calif., company makes specialized chips that go into computer work stations. "It's increasing very slowly, but demand has been growing since the start of the year," Mr. Chiu said.
Business executives make the expansion and cutback, hiring and firing decisions that are closely linked to larger forces in the American economy like consumer confidence and spending. And the business people polled from Feb. 18 to March 6, who were mainly senior executives, at companies with yearly revenues of $5 million to more than $500 million, are considerably more upbeat in their assessments of the economy's path than most Americans -- though it could be that business people always tend to be more optimistic than others.
In a nationwide New York Times/ CBS News Poll of the public last month, only 13 percent of the people questioned replied that the economy was getting better, with the rest saying it was worse or the same.
To be sure, the business executives do not see strong economic activity, based on their own sales and orders. Fifty-six percent of those polled replied that the condition of the economy was still "fairly bad" and 15 percent more said "very bad." And the poll results, plus follow-up interviews with more than two dozen of these executives during the last week, indicate that there are regional differences, with the Northeast, Michigan and Southern California generally lagging behind the rest of the country.
Sloan's Supermarkets Inc., which has 46 food stores in Brooklyn and Manhattan, saw its sales dip 2 percent last year, and the softness has continued so far this year. "I don't see any signs of improvement yet," said Jules Rose, the chairman of Sloan's.
And the recovery many executives foresee will not be abrupt but gradual, more an economy rising from its knees than one sprinting ahead, they say.
 
Backing Up Optimism With Cash
 Still, the businesses that see sales and orders rising did express a willingness to back up their incipient optimism with their pocketbooks. Fifty-two percent of the companies said they planned to increase their capacity to produce goods and services, while 4 percent plan reductions and 42 intend to hold steady.
The companies intend to wring more production and sales from their current employees and will be cautious about hiring new workers. Only 38 percent of the companies said they planned to take on new workers, well below the 52 percent share that intend to increase capacity. The executive poll and interviews suggest that while the worst of the layoffs, which have made consumers so skittish, may be over, job growth will be slow at best.
In this economy, even optimists like Mr. Holton, the supplier of plastic auto parts near Detroit, which employs 1,220 people, are reluctant to take on new workers and run the risk of laying them off if the recovery fizzles. "Our game plan is to watch this thing carefully," he explained. "If growth continues, we'll try to meet the demand through productivity enhancements and overtime for our current workers."
"We're not going to take people on and let them off," Mr. Holton added. "The last thing you want to do is jerk your work force around."
But for all the caveats, the tentatively upbeat tone of the executive poll and the interviews do mirror the rising optimism that has been reflected in a string of encouraging economic statistics recently, from the strong retail figures released yesterday to increases in production, new orders and new export activity during February.
And last week, the United States Chamber of Commerce said business optimism nearly tripled from December to February. It reported that 47 percent of the more than 7,900 executives it had questioned said the economy would improve in the next six months, compared with 18 percent in the previous survey.
"Things have turned," said David Hale, chief economist of the Kemper Financial Companies in Chicago. "The question is whether it is sustainable."
 
Uptrend Seems On Firmer Ground
 The recovery is modest and the outlook is not certain. Yet unlike the economic improvement that began last spring after the Persian Gulf war and stalled by late summer, the current uptrend appears to be more firmly grounded in economics than the postwar euphoria of last year, executives say. The decisive moves by the Federal Reserve Board to sharply lower interest rates last year are having an effect on consumers by lowering interest payments on personal loans and mortgages, freeing up more spending money.
The Banc One Corporation, like many of the nation's banks, has witnessed a rush of homeowners seeking to refinance their mortgages to take advantage of the lower rates. During January and February, the 800 Banc One offices in Ohio, Indiana, Illinois, Texas and Wisconsin received more than 8,800 mortgage applications, about 65 percent of which were refinancing requests. Typically, the refinancing share would be below 25 percent.
"The interest rate drops we've had really do make a difference," said John B. McCoy, chairman of Banc One, a Columbus, Ohio, bank holding company. "The refinancings spill over to greater discretionary income for consumers. We're also seeing a decline in credit card and installment loan delinquencies. So the consumer is in better shape."
The impact can be seen in the housing market. New-home sales rose 12.9 percent in January, and the supply of unsold houses sank to the lowest level in five years. In some parts of the country, the next step in the recovery of the housing industry -- building new homes -- is beginning, with new-home starts up 5.5 percent in January.
Michael Hobbs of New Canaan, Conn., builds everything from $100,000 alterations to $2 million homes. Things were slow in the luxury residential market until February. But his company, Hobbs Inc., is now working on a half-dozen projects, twice as many as late last year. And architects' plans -- the source of new work -- are coming in at a brisk pace. "There's a lot of building going on now in Fairfield County," Mr. Hobbs said.
At Shope, Reno & Wharton, a Greenwich, Conn., architecture firm that designs luxury houses, typically costing $500,000 or more, inquiries from people who want to build new homes are streaming in. The 20-architect firm now receives an inquiry a day, compared with one a month last year. "We are very busy," said Allan Shope, a partner. "It started this year and it is directly related to lower interest rates."
In addition to lower rates, Mr. Shope said that his well-heeled clients had been encouraged to go ahead and build a new home because most believe that "the recession has bottomed out." A recent pickup in housing starts, led by luxury homes, may be a hopeful sign, but it does not mean the local housing industry has recovered from its deep decline, Mr. Shope and others stress.
 
Building Industry Remains Depressed
 In Connecticut, for example, the number of residential building permits issued in January doubled from a year earlier. Still, the permits taken out in January 1992, despite the rebound, were only about half the level of the 1987-90 period in the state. And the modest rebound in housing starts has not spilled over to commercial construction like office buildings.
So the construction industry as a whole, which employs carpenters, electricians and laborers, remains depressed. "I hope something is starting, but we've not seen any evidence of it yet," said John Cunningham, president of the United Brotherhood of Carpenters 210, whose 1,700 members in Fairfield and Litchfield counties derive four-fifths of their work from commercial construction.
In Southern California, the moribund commercial construction industry is likely to remain a drag on that region's economy for some time. With the 1980's office boom a memory, Joseph W. Bailey, a Santa Barbara, Calif., general contractor, has seen his business slide from one with 125 people and annual revenues of nearly $20 million during the late 1980's, to a staff of 75 people and estimated revenues of less than $12 million. "I see building activity continuing to fall," Mr. Bailey said. "In two or three months, we'll be down to 50 people unless things pick up."
Things are little better these days at Santa Cruz Motors, which sells BMW, Mazda and Oldsmobile cars. John Kiefer, the owner, sees a bit of good news for Detroit since Oldsmobile sales are rising. But in Santa Cruz County, where roughly three- fourths of the new cars sold are imports, the uptick in Olds sales has not been enough to offset the general decline. At Mr. Kiefer's dealership, new-car sales are off 25 percent this year. "Quite honestly, it just tanked since November," he said.
The big California economy, hit hard by the sharp fall-off in construction and defense industry cutbacks, is experiencing no recovery. The state's economy will shrink by eight-tenths of a percent this year, after falling 2.4 percent in 1991, David Hensley, director of the business forecasting unit of the University of California at Los Angeles, estimates.
By contrast, the nation's economy is expected to be nearly flat in the first quarter but pick up to grow by more than 3 percent during the second half of 1992, according to the Blue Chip consensus of more than 50 economic forecasters.
 
More Confidence In Competing
 The optimism expressed by many executives seems to be based partly on their own confidence that they are now better able to compete at home and abroad, even in difficult times. The efforts in recent years to become more streamlined and improve customer service, they say, have been difficult but have paid off. The New York Times/CBS News Poll found that 73 percent of the executives rate their industries "very good" or "fairly good" in terms of their ability to compete with other industrialized countries, including Japan.
The streamlining process is quite visible among big corporations like General Motors, I.B.M. and others. Yet from the interviews with business people, it is clear that much of the rest of American industry has embarked on the same path.
Take the example of Mark Roberts Inc., a Bartlesville, Okla., car dealership that sells Hondas and Chrysler mini-vans. Bartlesville is a company town, the home of the Phillips Petroleum Company, and the big company has trimmed its headquarters payroll recently by roughly 20 percent to save costs.
Anticipating a downturn in the local economy, Mark Roberts sold a smaller dealership in nearby Enid to set aside a cash cushion to ride out the downturn. Mr. Roberts also trimmed his work force slightly, from 44 last summer to 38 today.
But he also made investments, so that his dealership could increase its share of the local market. He spent $140,000 on 10 cars that are lent to customers who need them when their cars are brought in for servicing. Today, all cars brought to the Roberts garage for repairs are washed and vacuumed without charge, and a complimentary carnation is placed on the passenger seat. The result has been that car sales at Mark Roberts Inc. are running ahead of last year, despite the cutbacks by the town's big oil company.
"The only difference between me and Phillips is that the big companies make the paper and we don't," Mr. Roberts said. "All businesses have to become leaner and more efficient."

How the Poll Was Conducted
The New York Times/CBS News Poll of American business executives is based on interviews with 490 senior executives at companies throughout the United States, interviewed by telephone from Feb. 18 to March 6.
The sample of companies and executives called was provided by Dun & Bradstreet Information Services. The sample was randomly dawn from those listed in their nationwide data base of both privately held and publicly owned companies.
Companies with $5 million or more in annual revenues were eligible for the survey. Within each company one executive at a senior level was interviewed. Titles eligible for the poll included chief executive, president, chairman, executive vice president, senior vice president, owner and partner, starting from the top down.
Because smaller companies are most numerous, in order to provide more reliable comparisons between companies of various sizes, those with larger annual revenue were sampled at a higher rate. The completed sample included 274 interviews in companies with $5 million to $99 million in annual revenue, 121 interviews in companies with $100 million to $499 million and 95 interviews in companies with $500 million or more. The completed sample was then weighted by revenue size to reflect the actual distribution of all listed companies in the country.
In theory, in 19 cases out of 20, results based on such samples will differ by no more than six percentage points in either direction from what would have been obtained by seeking out senior executives at all listed companies in the country with annual revenues of $5 million or more.
The potential sampling error for smaller subgroups is larger. For example, for the biggest companies, those with $500 million or more in annual revenue, it is plus or minus 10 percentage points.
In addition to sampling error, the practical difficulties of conducting any survey can introduce other sources of error into the poll. (pg. D4)

HEADLINE: CREDIT MARKETS;
Long-Term Bond Yields Top 8%

BYLINE: By KENNETH N. GILPIN

 BODY:
Evidence that consumers emerged from a fourth-quarter funk and spent money at a healthy clip in January and February pushed yields on long-term Treasury bonds above 8 percent yesterday for the first time since early November.
The big gains most likely mean that recovery is under way, analysts said, although not at the rapid pace the sharp rise in retail sales suggests. 
 Indeed, even as the Government was reporting the gains in retail sales, it also said that initial unemployment claims rose by 22,000 during the last week in February, to 459,000, the highest level in a month.
Still, the sales gains, along with other recent signs of recovery, were strong enough to make further easing in monetary policy by the Federal Reserve Board unnecessary for some months at least, the analysts said.
 
Gain in Retail Sales
 For a variety of reasons, economists had been expecting that retail sales figures released yesterday would show a good gain in February, but the 1.3 percent rise reported by the Commerce Department was at the high end of expectations.
The big surprise was a sharp upward revision in the January numbers. Retail sales rose by 2.1 percent, the Government said, not the six-tenths of a percent increase that had been previously reported. It was the first back-to-back rise of 1 percent or more in retail sales since 1985.
"The numbers show that consumption in the first quarter will be much higher than anticipated, and that will give people confidence that growth in the second quarter will be stronger than many thought, including myself," said Joseph Liro, a senior vice president and money market economist at S. G. Warburg & Company.
Nevertheless, analysts said consumers were unlikely to keep spending at such a rapid rate because important fundamentals that generally herald a sustained rise in consumption remained weak.
"The economy is improving, and we are in a recovery," said Donald J. Fine, chief market analyst at the Chase Manhattan Corporation. "But these numbers were an overstatement of the improvment. This type of spending growth is way above growth in personal income, and it is unlikely that consumers will be willing to take on more debt to sustain it."
Bruce Steinberg, an economist at Merrill Lynch & Company, said, "A couple of months of good retail sales data are very nice, but we should be getting some good numbers after being in the tank for the last two years."
Over the next few months, Mr. Steinberg said, "it will be the bond market that will keep the recovery from getting too out of hand."
 
Long-Term Securities Sales
 Bond traders, who fear recovery will bring rising inflation with it, reacted quickly to the sales figures by selling long-term securities.
By late in the day, the Treasury's 8 percent 30-year bonds of 2021 were offered at a price of 99 5/8, down 7/8 point, to yield 8.03 percent, compared with 7.95 percent late Wednesday.
Bond yields have briefly reached the 8 percent level on several occasions this winter, but yesterday marked the first time since Nov. 5 that yields rose above that level and stayed there.
In the secondary market for Treasury notes, the 7 1/2 percent 10-year notes were offered at 9910/32 late yesterday, down 22/32 , to yield 7.59 percent. The 6 3/4 percent five-year notes were offered at 99, down 15/32 , to yield 6.99 percent. And the 5 3/8 percent two-year notes were offered at 9913/32 , down 1/4 point, to yield 5.69 percent.
Short-term Treasury bill rates rose slightly.
Three-month bills were offered at a discount rate of 4.01 percent in late trading, up two basis points, or two one-hundredths of a percentage point. And six-month bill rates rose by four basis points, to a late offered rate of 4.17 percent.
A number of corporations offered new debt issues despite the sharp rise in interest rates.
Among the issuers was Bear, Stearns & Company, which priced a $150 million offering of noncallable 12-year senior notes.
The 8 3/4 percent securities were priced at $99.792, to yield 8.778 percent, 1.20 percentage points over the prevailing yield on the Treasury's 7 1/2 percent 10-year notes at the time of pricing.
Bear, Stearns acted as lead manager for the underwriting. The securities are rated A-2 by Moody's Investors Service and A- by the Standard & Poor's Corporation.
Bear, Stearns and the BT Securities Corporation acted as co-lead managers on a $200 million underwriting for the Stone Container Corporation.
The 10 3/4 percent senior subordinated notes were priced at $99.50, to yield 10.831 percent.
The high-yield securities are rated B-2 by Moody's and B+ by Standard & Poor's.
In the tax-exempt municipal bond market, a bid from a group led by Smith Barney, Harris Upham & Company won a competitive offering of $229.71 million worth of Louisiana general obligation bond.
The securities, which are insured by MBIA Inc. and the Ambac Indemnity Corporation, were reoffered to investors with yields from 3.50 percent in 1993 to 6.70 percent in 2012.
Because the bonds are insurerd, the issue is rated AAA by both Moody's and Standard & Poor's.
In other developments, the Federal Reserve reported yesterday that all three measures of the nation's money supply rose in the week ended March 2.
The money numbers were a bit stronger than anticipated, but elicited no reaction from credit market participants.
Nevertheless, "strength in the money numbers will continue to reinforce the belief that the recovery is here and could be stronger than originally forecast," analysts at MMS International, an economic forecasting and service company, noted in their daily market commentary.

HEADLINE: BUSINESS PEOPLE;
A Top Officer at Aetna To Join Liberty Mutual

BYLINE: By ADAM BRYANT

 BODY:
After 18 years with the Aetna Life and Casualty Company, Edmund F. Kelly is leaving to take on more reponsibility at a smaller insurer, the Liberty Mutual Insurance Group.
Liberty Mutual, based in Boston, named Mr. Kelly president and chief operating officer yesterday, filling roles most recently held by the company's chairman and chief executive, Gary L. Countryman. 
 Liberty Mutual, the country's largest writer of workers' compensation insurance, said Mr. Kelly had been hired for his broad background and track record of successes. At Aetna, Mr. Kelly was most recently a group executive, overseeing many financial products and building the managed health care business.
Mr. Kelly's task at Liberty Mutual, where he starts on April 1, will include developing those products, but he acknowledges that he will be joining the company with little personal experience in workers' compensation.
"I arrive with zero baggage in some areas," Mr. Kelly, 46 years old, said yesterday in a telephone interview.
By some measures, the scope of Mr. Kelly's responsibilities will remain roughly the same at Liberty as at Aetna: He will manage more than $40 billion in assets and about 20,000 employees.
Mr. Kelly said his strategy for his new post had not yet been formed. The workers' compensation field holds special challenges because the laws are different in each state. The system, a way to reimburse employees for economic hardships resulting from injuries and illnesses caused on the job, is an industry marked by soaring expenses. In the last decade, the costs of the insurance programs in all 50 states have risen roughly 150 percent, an increase attributed largely to rising medical expenses, litigation fees and the cost of expanding benefits.
Mr. Kelly joined Aetna in 1974 and held senior-level positions in its employee benefits division. As part of a corporate reorganization in 1991, Mr. Kelly was named one of four group executives sharing the majority of operating responsibilities.
Mr. Kelly graduated from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology with a Ph.D. in mathematics in 1970. He will be relocating to the Boston area from his home in Simsbury, Conn., where he lives with his wife, Debbie. They have one adult daughter.

HEADLINE: New Unemployment Claims Rose 22,000 in Late February

BYLINE: AP

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, March 12

 BODY:
The number of Americans filing first-time claims for unemployment benefits rose to the highest level in more than a month in the last week of February, the Government said today.
Analysts said the increase was not worrisome enough to shake their belief that an economic revival had begun. 
 The Labor Department reported that the number of people filing new claims for jobless benefits increased by 22,000, to 459,000, for the week that ended on Feb. 29. The increase reversed a drop of 21,000 the week before.
 
Higher Figure Expected
 Economists had been expecting the numbers to bounce higher, because the previous week included the Washington's Birthday holiday, which gave laid-off workers one less day to file claims.
Given the strong showing for retail sales in January and February and other favorable reports, many economists said they were revising upward their estimates of growth for the January-March quarter this year.
But it will still be some time before the upturn in demand will translate into lower unemployment figures, analysts cautioned.
"The recovery first shows up on the spending side, then output and then employment," said Robert Dederick, an economist for the Northern Trust Company of Chicago. "It hasn't had time to show up in employment yet."
 
 
Unemployment May Rise
 The jobless rate hit a six-year high of 7.3 percent in February, and some economists believe the rate could climb as high as 7.5 percent in coming months before it starts to improve gradually in the second half of the year.
Samuel D. Kahan, an economist at Fuji Securities in Chicago, said the rise in jobless claims showed that the economy was still "not firing on all of its pistons." He said the coming economic activity was likely to be "nothing to get excited about."
Because the weekly number can be so volatile, many economists track the four-week average for claims. That figure rose to 451,500 for the last week in February, up from 445,250 in the previous week. The moving average and the one-week total were both the highest since Jan. 18, when the one-week claims figure hit 460,000.

HEADLINE: Ford to Expand Offer Of One Price for Escorts

BYLINE: By ADAM BRYANT

 BODY:
The Ford Motor Company said yesterday that it was expanding nationwide a marketing program for its Escort LX that has won over many reluctant shoppers: one price, no haggling.
The pricing strategy has increased sales during a five-month test among dealers in the Northeast, Southeast and West. Dealers say consumers appreciate the simplicity of the one-price program, in which the 1992 LX models -- including four-door sedans, two hatchback models and station wagons -- are sold for $9,999. The models are equipped with many options, including air-conditioning, but an automatic transmission costs $732 extra. 
 By comparison, the sticker prices of those models would be as much as $1,700 higher, although most buyers negotiate for a lower price.
 
 
Restyled 1993 Models
 The national program will begin in May on the restyled 1993-model Escorts, and a Ford spokesman said the fixed price would probably be a few hundred dollars higher. Though dealers are strongly urged to participate, Ford cannot require them to do so.
Ford's decision highlights the auto industry's effort to simplify the car-buying process, in part by eliminating customers' bargaining with dealers. Industry experts say Ford is also responding to a key strategy of General Motors' fledgling Saturn division, whose no-dealing sticker prices have scored points with consumers. The Ford Escort, a subcompact, competes directly with Saturn models.
"Haggling is a sore point with consumers," said Peter J. Haag, senior vice president of MOR-Pace, a consumer research firm in suburban Detroit.
Indeed, auto leases are proliferating partly because they eliminate bargaining, industry experts say. And car buyers are increasingly flocking to services that find and buy cars for them. Auto Advisor, in Seattle, guarantees that it will find the lowest-priced car in a designated area for a fee that averages $390. The business grew by 50 percent last year, compared with 1990, said Ashly Knapp, its founder. "The No. 1 reason is people dislike confrontation with dealers," he said.
The roughly 2,400 Ford dealers testing the one-price program reported Escort sales in January and February that were 20 percent higher than those who did not offer the program, a company spokesman said. In the previous five months, the percentage of Escort buyers who previously owned imports jumped 50 percent. Over all, sales of Escorts are down 12 percent this year from a year earlier.
"It's done extremely well for us," said Gordon Stringfield, general sales manager of Larry Geweke Ford in Marysville, Calif. He said Escorts now make up 25 percent of his Ford car and truck sales, up from 17 percent before the program began. While the dealer profit is smaller on the designated models, the greater volume means higher revenues, he said.
Ford sold about 250,000 Escorts in 1991. The auto maker expects to sell as many as 350,000 this year, depending on the economy. Most Escorts are built at a Ford assembly plant in Wayne, Mich., although some, including the sporty GT model, which will not be included in the one-price program, are produced in Mexico.

HEADLINE: COMPANY NEWS;
Dayton's Net Fell by 18.3% In Quarter

BYLINE: By STEPHANIE STROM

 BODY:
The Dayton Hudson Corporation, which operates several department store chains and the Target discount chain, reported sharply lower earnings yesterday for the fourth quarter that ended Feb. 1.
The company said the results reflected weak Christmas sales, continued stiff competition that has put pressure on its profit margins and a recessionary economy in California, where it does about 35 percent of its business. 
 Fourth-quarter earnings fell 18.3 percent, to $192 million, or $2.47 a share, compared with $235 million, or $3.50 a share, in the corresponding period last year.
 
Shares Retreat on Bad News
 Reacting to the bad news, Dayton Hudson shares fell yesterday by $5.625, to $61.25, in fairly heavy trading on the New York Stock Exchange.
Kenneth A. Macke, Dayton Hudson's chairman, said in a telephone interview from the company's headquarters in Minneapolis that he was surprised by the stock market reaction. "We thought our earnings were very much in line with what the analysts had projected," he said.
Mr. Macke said that while the problems that dampened the company's most recent earnings were continuing, Dayton Hudson was planning conservatively and slashing its operating expenses. Earlier this week, Dayton Hudson announced that it would layoff 630 employees in its embattled department store division, which includes the Dayton's, Hudson's and Marshall Field's chains.
Mr. Macke said sales in February exceeded the company's expectations. Dayton Hudson had projected that sales in stores open at least one year would increase 2 percent to 4 percent last month, but they climbed 6 percent.
The company also said it had put a more favorable inventory accounting method into place.
The company's full-year 1991 results were in line with most investment analysts' estimates. Several said they expected the company's income to remain flat, or perhaps even decline slightly, in the first half of this year and then pick up around mid-summer.
"We're still looking for them to sort of back into a relatively strong performance in 1992," said Jeffrey M. Feiner, a retail analyst at Salomon Brothers.
Mr. Macke said that Target would continue to fuel the company's growth and strength.
 
Grab for Discount Market
 In mid-1991, Dayton Hudson belatedly decided to make a grab for more of the discount market by reducing prices at Target and emphasizing its selection of consumer commodities, long after Wal-Mart and K Mart had embarked on similar competitive strategies.
Although the strategy has taken a big bite out of gross margins, analysts say it is sound and likely to pay off in the second half of this year, when comparisons will be equal. The company has been forced to compete by slashing prices in all its divisions, which ate into its profits in 1991, analysts said.
"We think the promotional atmosphere everywhere has leveled off," Mr. Macke said. "But the country is still overstored, and we will continue to be very aggressive on pricing."
Target's operating profit dropped 1.7 percent, to $458 million, from $466 million in 1990. But sales increased 11 percent last year, with sales in stores open more than a year up 4 percent.
Operating profits at Mervyn's, a chain of moderately priced department stores, plummeted 22.4 percent last year, primarily because more than half of its sales are made in its recession-ridden California stores. Sales in stores open more than one year declined 1 percent.
"If you look at Mervyn's sales outside California, they're much stronger," said Wayne Hood, a retail analyst at Prudential Securities Inc.
Mr. Hood noted that although the divergence between sales in California and sales in the rest of the country continued to widen at the Mervyn's division, the gap was closing among Target stores.
For the year, Dayton Hudson's earnings plummeted 26.9 percent, to $301 million, from $412 million in 1990. Sales increased 9 percent to a record $16.11 billion, from $14.74 billion a year earlier.

HEADLINE: Economic Scene;
Weak Economy Pins Bush Down

BYLINE: By Leonard Silk

 BODY:
PRESIDENT BUSH is struggling to get out of a crossfire coming, on one side, from former President Richard M. Nixon, who has criticized Mr. Bush for not doing enough to sustain democratic reforms in the former Soviet Union, and, on the other side, from his Republican challenger, Patrick J. Buchanan, for not putting America's interests first. Mr. Bush is pinned down in his efforts to move by the nation's weak economy and the huge budget deficit, which this year will exceed $400 billion.
Mr. Nixon warned Mr. Bush that if he does not act more boldly to keep economic and political freedom alive in the former Soviet Union, he will face the accusation, "Who lost Russia?" Mr. Bush said he would like to do more but he just doesn't have the resources. "There isn't a lot of money around," he said. "We are spending too much as it already is. So to do the things I would really like to do, I don't have a blank check for all that." 
 On both the tax and expenditure sides, the President has compounded the problem of what he called "constrained resources." In response to Mr. Buchanan's assault on Mr. Bush for not keeping his 1988 campaign pledge: "Read my lips. No new taxes," Mr. Bush apologized, said it was his greatest political mistake and that he would never raise taxes again.
On the expenditure side, Mr. Bush has aggravated his resources problem by yielding to Pentagon pressures for only minimal cuts in military outlays, despite the collapse of the Soviet threat and the end of the cold war. The determination of the Pentagon's leaders to hold on to large forces and big budgets was revealed by the classified 46-page policy statement, prepared under the supervision of Paul D. Wolfowitz, the Pentagon's Under Secretary for Policy. The statement clearly needed the authorization of Secretary of Defense Dick Cheney. The document asserted that the United States' political and military mission in the post-cold-war era would be to insure that no rival superpower would be permitted to emerge in Western Europe, Asia or the former Soviet Union.
Senior White House and State Department officials harshly attacked the document, titled Defense Planning Guidance for Fiscal Years 1994-99, calling it "a dumb report." Leading opponents of the Wolfowitz draft are considered to be the national security adviser, Brent Scowcroft, Secretary of States James A. Baker 3d and Deputy Secretary of State Lawrence S. Eagleburger.
Mr. Bush, however, made clear more than two months ago in his State of the Union address that he would resist pressures for deeper cuts in military spending than he would propose in his new budget. His plan calls for Defense Department budget authority to remain within a few billion dollars of $270 billion from 1992 to 1996. Corrected for assumed inflation, this would represent a reduction of about 15 percent in military spending from 1992 to 1997. Or, as Mr. Bush said: "By 1997, we will have cut defense by 30 percent since I took office. These cuts are deep, and you must know my resolve: this deep, and no deeper."
A group of Democrats, led by Les Aspin, chairman of the House Armed Services Committee, contend that much deeper cuts are both possible and desirable, in the interests of peace and economic strength -- and in light of the vanishing Soviet threat and rising economic superpowers in Japan and Europe.
"Now that the old Soviet threat is gone, the first question is whether the idea of threats is still useful," Mr. Aspin said. He noted that Gen. Colin L. Powell, Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, does not think so, and has stated repeatedly that "we no longer have the luxury of having a threat to plan for" and that the level of United States forces is no longer based on apparent threats.
The Pentagon's document for guiding the preparation and planning of military budgets and forces offers as its defining concept the importance of keeping the United States the world's sole superpower. "We must maintain," it says, "the mechanisms for deterring potential competitors from even aspiring to a larger regional or global role."
With the blast from the National Security Council and State Department, Mr. Bush is now caught in a second crossfire over whether the United States should pursue a "lone superpower" policy -- which Pentagon hard-liners and those leaning toward an America First line would favor -- or a more collaborative role, in which other countries and the United Nations would assume a greater responsibility for security, including its economic burdens.
The lone-superpower line would continue the past practice of preparing to wage war against defined threats. The second approach would aim to build collective responsibilities for preventing wars, whether the threat is from the territory of the former Soviet Union or any other source. The two approaches have different implications for future military spending, United States budget deficits and national economic growth -- as well as for the means and freedom to deal with other national objectives, at home or abroad. The first is high-cost, high-risk, the second is lower-cost, with burdens and risks more widely diffused. Mr. Bush must make up his mind.

HEADLINE: FUTURES/OPTIONS;
Gold Contracts Fall to $348, Lowest Price in 4 1/2 Years

BYLINE: By The Associated Press

 BODY:
Prices of gold futures sagged well below $350 an ounce yesterday, amid fading expectations for either stronger inflation or higher gold prices.
Gold for April delivery fell $3.40 on New York's Commodity Exchange, to $348 a troy ounce, a new four-and-a-half-year low. 
 Silver and platinum futures also fell sharply, despite economic data that suggested the United States economy was improving -- ordinarily a constructive sign for those markets.
Oil prices posted moderate gains in a late flurry of mostly technical buying on the New York Mercantile Exchange.
March silver dropped 6.1 cents on the Commodity Exchange, to $4.086 an ounce. April platinum fell $3.30 on the New York Mercantile Exchange, to $360.10 a troy ounce.
 
Retail Sales Data Cited
 Analysts said the decline began overnight on the European market with heavy selling of gold and gold futures by Middle Eastern investors and gold producers. Reasons given for the selling were varied.
Bette Raptopoulos, metals analyst with Prudential Securities Inc., said American gold traders responded to the dollar's gains after the Government reported a 1.3 percent jump in retail sales last month. It was the first time sales had risen more than 1 percent for two consecutive months since 1985.
An improving economy makes it less likely the Federal Reserve Board will cut interest rates further, which in turn lowers the chances of a burst of inflation that might send investors running for the perceived safety of gold.
 
April Oil: $18.83
 But Peter Cardillo, research director at Westfalia Investments Inc. in New York, said the metal markets ignored the retail sales. Prices fell, he said, because precious-metal producers typically make sales commitments at this time of year and were selling futures to lock in prices.

Consumer Spending Report Bolsters Dollar in Trading

BYLINE: By The Associated Press

 BODY:
The dollar rallied against other currencies yesterday after the Government released better-than-expected consumer spending figures for February.
Analysts said the dollar rose sharply in early trading and was carried higher by the Commerce Department's report that retail sales rose 1.3 percent last month. But while the consumer spending figures were stronger than anticipated, the dollar gave up some ground later in the day as traders with large dollar holdings decided to sell rather than risk a decline, said Mike Faust, a foreign exchange analyst with MMS International. 
 Currency traders were somewhat nervous after central banks, including the Bank of Japan and the Swiss National Bank, intervened in the market earlier this week to stop the dollar's advance against their currencies.
The retail sales figure was the latest in a series of statistics pointing to a recovery. The data heartened investors, who saw better prospects for a rise in interest rates.
The dollar draws support from higher interest rates, which make American investments more attractive to buyers from overseas.
The Government also said the number of Americans filing first-time claims for unemployment benefits rose to 459,000 in the last week of February, pushing the claims figure to its highest level in a month. The numbers, however, had little effect on the dollar, analysts said.
The dollar rose as high as 134.65 Japanese yen and 167.75 German marks.
The American currency ended the day in New York at 134.25 yen, up from 133.40 late on Wednesday. In Tokyo, the dollar rose to 134.00 yen from 133.70 yen; in London, it rose to 134.25 yen.
The dollar also rose to 1.6700 marks in New York, from 1.6635 Wednesday. In European trading, the dollar advanced to 1.6715 marks from 1.6650.
The British pound fell against the dollar, dropping to $1.7140 in New York, from $1.7260 on Wednesday. In London, sterling fell to $1.7085 from $1.7250.
Other late dollar rates in New York, compared with late Wednesday's quotes, included: 1.5100 Swiss francs, up from 1.5075; 5.6710 French francs, up from 5.6485; 1,252.00 Italian lire, up from 1,246.50, and 1.19675 Canadian dollars, up from 1.19585.

Manpower's New Inquiry

BYLINE: Reuters

DATELINE: LONDON, March 12

 BODY:
The Department of Trade and Industry in Britain has begun a new investigation into the 1987 takeover of the Manpower employment agency by Blue Arrow P.L.C., a department spokesman said today.
Last month, four employees of the securities giant County NatWest and a stockbroker from UBS Phillips & Drew Ltd. were convicted of conspiracy to defraud in connection with the bid that created the world's largest employment agency. 
 The case focused on a possible conspiracy to cover up a failed rights issue of 837 million, or about $1.7 billion at the time, by Blue Arrow to finance the takeover.
Blue Arrow itself, now renamed Manpower Inc. and based in the United States, was not charged. County NatWest, NatWest Investment Bank and UBS Phillips and Drew were acquitted in January.
On Monday, Lord Alexander, the chairman of County NatWest's parent, the National Westminister Bank, asked for a new inquiry into the matter. He cited accusations made by The Economist magazine last week that the bank and its chief executive, Thomas P. Frost, had misled Government inspectors and concealed documents during the last Blue Arrow inquiry.
But a department spokesman said the inquiry was not being made at NatWest's request.
"This is a new investigation under Section 432 of the Companies Act," he said, stressing that such investigations were made because of information the department had, not at the request of the company involved.

A Gift by Saatchi
In the 1980's, when the English collector Charles Saatchi bought or sold, the art world talked. His choice of purchases, which were often considered eccentric by other collectors, and his habit of buying many works by one artist and then rapidly selling them off, has been a subject of great interest among gallery owners and artists, auction-house experts and collectors. 
 This week, the talk is about the announcement that Mr. Saatchi has given nine works by contemporary British artists to the Tate Gallery in London. It is the first time the advertising magnate has donated artworks to any institution other than his own small London museum. The news came only days after Saatchi & Saatchi, the London-based advertising agency he founded with his brother, Maurice, disclosed losses of $103 million for 1991. The company also announced a $22 million profit over the last three years from the sale of the bulk of the advertising agency's art collection. In 1991 alone, sales from Saatchi & Saatchi's art totaled about $4.25 million.
Hugh Impey, a company spokesman, declined to comment on exactly which works had been sold or where. But he did say that while selling art has not been the main activity of the company, it has been its main profit center over the last two years. "We've been hit by over-expansion and enormous debt as well as the decline of advertising in Britain and the United States," Mr. Impey said. "So the sale of art has served us well."
For Mr. Saatchi, a man who has been known to spend millions on a single work of art, the gift is really quite small; the museum estimates its total value at only $170,000. What is interesting, however, is that he chose to give art by relatively young British artists, an area Mr. Saatchi has been avidly collecting and exhibiting at his small, private London museum. The presence of these works in the Tate's collection can only help increase their value, along with that of works he still owns by the same artists.
But in recent months, Mr. Saatchi has gained notice more for his aggressive sales of works from his collection than for what he has purchased. At Sotheby's auctions of contemporary art in New York in November, 35 of the 79 works offered belonged to him. At the time, art-world experts thought Mr. Saatchi was trying to raise money to pay debts he owed to the auction house. Mr. Saatchi is expected to sell many more works this spring. Sotheby's said the final count had not yet been decided, and as usual he would not allow his name to be associated in the auction catalogue with the works he would be selling. Sotheby's declines to comment on Mr. Saatchi's financial dealings with the house.
Mr. Saatchi is, however, allowing his name to be displayed beside the artworks he is donating to the Tate. These include works by artists Mr. Saatchi has been buying in quantity, ranging from well-known figures like the sculptor Richard Deacon to lesser-known names like the painter Jeffrey Dennis.
Unlike donors in America who, for the moment anyway, can claim substantial tax deductions for giving works of art to museums, Mr. Saatchi does not have the benefit of a write-off under the English tax code.
Part of the public's fascination has always been Mr. Saatchi's Greta Garbo-like posture; he almost never gives interviews, and this week his office said he was too busy to return telephone calls. Another reason collectors and dealers are intrigued with Mr. Saatchi is his well-known practice of selling artworks within months of buying them. Nicholas Serota, the Tate's director, said, "At this point, Charles's collection falls into two parts: fine classic postwar artists and young British artists."
Mr. Serota said he was particularly pleased with the museum's gift because it represented the end of a 10-year rift between the collector and the Tate.
"In 1981, we had a show of 12 new works by Julian Schnabel," said Sir Alan Bowness, a former director of the Tate. "Over half the works came from Saatchi's private collection, and the press accused him of promoting the artist's work and imposing his own taste on a museum. At the time, Charles felt his effort to help a public institution was met with unfair criticism."
Sir Alan said this episode had prompted Mr. Saatchi to start a museum of his own. "But that was all 10 years ago," he added. "By now he has established his credentials."
The Saatchi Collection, as his small museum on Boundary Road in Northwest London is called, has no permanent holdings; it is really a rotating public showcase for whatever from his collection he feels like showing at any one time. "Therefore it isn't strange that he should be donating works to the Tate," Mr. Serota said. He said the decision to donate these works had resulted from discussions he had had with Mr. Saatchi about the Tate's holdings. The new additions help round out the museum's collection.
"Now we have a serious and strong representation of these artists," Mr. Serota said. "We only had a small, early Julian Opie, for example; now we have in important one. We had a very early Richard Deacon and a recent work from 1991. There was a substantial gap which has now been filled."
 
Museum Plan in Limbo
 While all museums have been affected by the economy, the Newport Harbor Art Museum in Newport Beach, Calif., is one institution that has been directly affected by the suffering real-estate market. And by its own ambitions.
Five years ago, Orange County, a generally affluent area south of Los Angeles, decided to expand its small museum of contemporary art and started a $40 million fund-raising campaign. Donald Bren, who heads the Irvine Company, a major real-estate developer based in the city of Newport Beach, donated 10.5 acres for the site of the new building. Renzo Piano, the celebrated Italian architect who designed the Menil Collection's building in Houston and was co-architect with Richard Rogers of the Pompidou Center in Paris, was chosen to design the new building.
Two years ago, Mr. Piano was dismissed because, on being told his design was too expensive to build and asked by the board of trustees to provide a less expensive plan, he declined. Several months later, the trustees asked the New York City architects Kohn Pedersen Fox Associates to come up with another design.
But Kohn Pedersen Fox's scheme may not be built either. In December, before the new architects had a chance to finish the plan, the trustees voted to postpone the fund-raising campaign because of the poor economy and a slowdown in the real estate market, and to delay the new building indefinitely. By 1988, the campaign had brought in pledges of $10 million; the museum declines to release more recent figures. Michael Botwinick, the museum's director, said the institution had so far spent about $1 million on designs.
"Most of the money and support in the 80's in Orange County came from real estate," Mr. Botwinick said. "It only makes sense that we would catch the same cold. After all, cultural institutions in Pittsburgh suffered when the steel industry broke down. There's no question all of us are vulnerable."
Now the museum is in a holding pattern, hoping to resume its plans when the economy picks up. So far neither the exhibition schedule nor museum hours have been cut back. Kohn Pedersen Fox is finishing the conceptual phase, basic drawings and models as a sales tool for the museum in anticipation of a turnaround in the economy. "The big issue is how much money they can finally raise and how much the scheme will have to be modified," said Eugene Kohn, a partner in the architectural firm.
Mr. Botwinick reported that Mr. Bren has specifically said there was no time limit on his commitment to donate the land for the new building. But the museum director said he wasworried about the pledges the institution was counting on. "Confidence is shaken," he said. "Even when the economy picks up, the rules will have changed. Someone who seven years ago said, 'Put me down for $1 million,' may well have second thoughts."
 
Town House Is Sold
 The Manhattan town house at 36 East 75th Street belonging to Habsburg Feldman, the Geneva-based auction house that opened a New York City branch in 1987 in the hope of competing with Sotheby's, Christie's and William Doyle, was sold yesterday to a private family. The auction house closed its doors in New York five months ago. Now it has also stopped trading operations in Geneva.
"But Habsburg Holdings still exists," said Geza von Habsburg, one of the founders, who is a great-grandson of Emperor Franz Josef of Austria. "And part of Habsburg Holdings is Antiquorium, who are still holding sales of clocks and watches." Antiquorium is headed by Osvaldo Patrizzi, another founder.
Mr. Habsburg, who ran the Christie's office in Geneva for nearly 20 years, said he was a guest curator for "Faberge and His Patrons," an exhibition scheduled to open in June 1993 at the Winter Palace in St. Petersburg and then go to the Musee des Arts Decoratifs.

A 'Waltz' That Lacks Uplift?
"The Baltimore Waltz," Paula Vogel's play about a brother and sister's fantasy trip to Europe while the brother is really dying of AIDS in a Baltimore hospital, finishes a seven-week run at the Circle Repertory Company this weekend. It had been scheduled to open later this month at the Capital Repertory Company in Albany, but the theater's artistic director, Bruce Bouchard, abruptly canceled the production, calling the play "a very tough and challenging work that asks an audience to work for 90 minutes." So? What's the problem? "My audience believes that I'm obsessed with death," Mr. Bouchard says.
Might it be that the audience has a problem with a play about AIDS? "Oh, it's not the subject matter," Mr. Bouchard says. "The play is a terribly moving catharsis. I wept until I thought I'd have a seizure." 
 Well, it turns out that "The Baltimore Waltz" is being replaced by "The Sum of Us," the Australian comedy about a gay man who is encouraged by his father to have a gay relationship. It had a successful run Off Broadway last season. Mr. Bouchard predicts that "The Sum of Us" will make two and a half times the income of "The Baltimore Waltz," which he says is essential to his Save the Theater campaign, since the Capital Rep is having financial difficulties. "It is in fact a hardball economic decision," he says. "I can make more money with an uplifting play than a cathartic play. Also, I could not get a corporate sponsor for 'The Baltimore Waltz.' People said the subject matter is tough. I got a corporate sponsor for 'The Sum of Us' in a second. But this was not a cavalier decision for me. I am not in business to disappoint playwrights."
Ms. Vogel's agent, Peter Franklin, says, "Bruce Bouchard never bothered to tell me he was canceling the play and he never expressed his reasons."
Ms. Vogel says: "Bruce doesn't even want to give the subject a chance. He didn't want to offend anybody. I don't consider Albany to be a backward place. It is the state capital. But when it comes to this subject, it's cold out there."
Mr. Franklin says a number of theaters have asked him about producing "The Baltimore Waltz," which, for starters, is to open in early April at the Alley Theater in Houston and Center Stage in Baltimore.
 
For Want of $120,000, a Furor
 Talk of resignation abounds at Circle Repertory Company after the postponement of the Broadway production of Lanford Wilson's "Redwood Curtain." Mr. Wilson, who was among the co-founders of the theater in 1969 with the director Marshall Mason and the theater's artistic director Tanya Berezin, says the board of directors refused them the financial support necessary to produce the play on Broadway. All three are members of the board.
The short version of this very complicated history is that Ms. Berezin, along with Mr. Wilson and Mr. Mason, the director of "Redwood Curtain," decided that Circle Rep itself should produce the play directly on Broadway since, Ms. Berezin says, they thought the theater could make more money than commercial producers have by transferring its plays in the past. ("Prelude to a Kiss," "Burn This," "Tally's Folly" and "The Fifth of July" are examples.) But Max Weitzenhoffer, a commercial producer who is president of Circle Rep's board, says he told the creative trio up front that the board would make a loan of only $60,000 toward the $800,000 the production would cost to take to Broadway after runs at the Seattle Repertory Theater and the Philadelphia Drama Guild.
"The company is not just Lanford," Mr. Weitzenhoffer says. "And I cannot make the board finance a Broadway show."
Fair enough, Ms. Berezin says. But after plans fell through to finance the play with an alliance of nonprofit theaters, the trio turned to individual investors and raised all but $120,000 of the $800,000. That's when they appealed to the board for last-minute help, Ms. Berezin says, and were denied, forcing the postponement.
Both Mr. Wilson and Mr. Mason say they feel betrayed as artists by the people whose mission it is to support them. "I felt abandoned by the board," Mr. Mason says. "I am considering a resignation, but that is not a threat, I'm just looking out for our artistic well-being." Mr. Mason is scheduled to direct Larry Kramer's new play, "The Destiny of Me," at Circle Rep next season.
Mr. Wilson says: "There's a lack of support from the board, no question about it. If we did resign I get the feeling they would be real happy to redefine themselves without us, but we'll cross that bridge if we come to it."
Ms. Berezin says now that "Redwood Curtain" is playing in Philadelphia and many commercial producers are interested in bringing it to Broadway, she is optimistic about healing the rift with the board. "As the artists grow, we've got to grow with them," she says. "I think it can be done."
 
What's Happening at Steppenwolf

"Wrong Turn at Lungfish" may not win any awards for most appetizing title, but considering the play was written by Garry Marshall (who directed "Pretty Woman") and Lowell Ganz, who co-wrote "City Slickers," "Splash" and "Parenthood," the odds are on its side. The play ran at the Steppenwolf Theater Company in Chicago in 1990. Now, the producers James B. Freydberg, Jeffrey Ash and Jean VanTuyle will present a rewritten version at the Coronet Theater in Los Angeles for a six-week run from May 19 through June 28. The four-character dramatic comedy about a young street couple's relationship with an elderly erudite hospital patient will probably star George C. Scott, Laurie Metcalfe and Tony Danza. (Really.) Mr. Marshall will direct. Mr. Freydberg says a New York run is possible for the fall.
Meanwhile, at Steppenwolf, the world premiere of "The Song of Jacob Zulu" opens April 12 featuring the South African vocal group Ladysmith Black Mambazo. Zakes Mokae, who won a Tony Award for his performance in "Master Harold . . . and the Boys," will star in this first play by Tug Yourgrau, based on the true story of the trial of a 19-year-old black South African.
 
Gershwin, Gershwin Everywhere
 If you believe that there's no such thing as too much Gershwin, go to Rainbow and Stars on March 31, when the revue " 'S Wonderful, 'S Marvelous, 'S Gershwin!" will open for a six-week run starring Jo Anne Worley, Judy Blazer, Carol Woods and Peter Reardon. The show will be produced by Gregory Dawson and Steve Paul, who presented the sellout Rogers and Hart revue there last fall.


GRAPHIC: ABC will present Neil Simon's "Broadway Bound" on March 23, starring Anne Bancroft, above, Hume Cronyn, Jerry Orbach, Jonathan Silverman, Michele Lee and Corey Parker. The play, set in 1948, is the third in Mr. Simon's autobiographical trilogy ("Brighton Beach Memoirs," "Biloxi Blues") and follows Eugene Jerome's struggles to start a career as a comedy writer.

HEADLINE: In Hard Times, Just Plain Bars Are Timeless

BYLINE: By BRYAN MILLER

 BODY:
IN the New York metropolitan region, there are Bars and there are bars. In the former, beers go for $4, the bartender wears a vest and a substantial pub-style menu is displayed on a chalkboard. In the latter, beers go for as little as $1.50, the bartender wears a faded New York Giants T-shirt and asks if you want a glass with your brew, and no matter what's on the menu, it's wise to stick to hamburgers.
The earthier bars are never referred to as taverns, pubs, lounges or, heaven forbid, night spots. In fact, they are rarely referred to at all except perhaps in the context of a news story. ("The car ran onto the sidewalk in front of the Suds Cafe.") Yet these unvarnished watering holes play a crucial role in the tragicomedy of big-city life. They serve as inexpensive sources of recreation, as anodynes to frazzled urban nerves and, in some cases, as democratic forums where people from different walks of life converge. 
 And in a time of economic distress for the hospitality industry in general, these fringe establishments are thriving, some in the most unlikely places, based on visits to a dozen such haunts and interviews with proprietors of many others. One would expect to find gritty, working-class bars in, say, Queens and Staten Island and marginal areas of Manhattan. What's surprising, though, is that many thrive in the gentrified neighborhoods of TriBeCa, Greenwich Village and midtown Manhattan, as well as in well-heeled towns like Greenwich, Conn.
"I would say that right now they are the places that are surviving this economy the best," says Raymond Foley, the publisher of Bartender Magazine. "People want value when they go out. They are also looking for a home base. The local bar offers both."
One vintage bar in Chelsea that seems to have a secure future is the Peter McManus Cafe on Seventh Avenue. It's an inviting place in a rough-and-tumble sort of way, with a well-worn tile floor, lead-paned windows and a splendid carved mahogany bar. A back room has eerie green and blue banquettes and cocktail tables.
The owner, Jim McManus, is a slow-moving, cocky Irishman with a 60-megabyte memory of anecdotes. "I started with my father and my brother 56 years ago," says the thick-set, silver-haired owner with obvious pride. "This place was a drugstore before that." In the middle of a chat, Mr. McManus launches into a discourse on how to make a perfect rob roy. "Swirl the shaker with the scotch and vermouth very gently," he admonishes. "You don't want to bruise the vermouth; it's delicate. Like wine."
At 7 P.M. on this day, the bar is filled with a casually clad, risible crowd ranging from business suits to blue jeans and flannels. Mr. McManus's son, Jamo, who is 38 years old, works here. He represents the third generation in the business and heads the kitchen, where generally satisfying pub fare like sandwiches, steaks and casseroles is prepared.
Jim McManus can spin tales taller than the head on a fresh draft beer. "One day Errol Flynn walked in here and was looking pretty gone," he recalls. "He said, 'I'll have a double vodka on the rocks.' I said, 'You're not gonna get it from me,' and I showed him the door."
Then there was the time that Burt Lancaster came in with Leonard Bernstein. "It was during the Vietnam War, and Lancaster made some remark about the American flag," Mr. McManus remembers.
He, too, was shown the renowned door.
 
A Social Symphony
 Most patrons of Carnegie Hall have probably walked past P. J. Carney's bar many times without ever noticing it. Little did they know that a social symphony of great color and texture holds forth there nightly. The small oval room with a U-shaped bar and scattering of tables and booths attracts a remarkable cross section of New Yorkers: businessmen, artists, students, musicians, itinerants, even some turnaways from the nearby Planet Hollywood restaurant. Carney's may not have the hood of the Batmobile on the wall, but it certainly has a better shepherd's pie (made with beef, not lamb) as well as a good hamburger and fish and chips.
Opened by P. J. Carney in 1927, then passed along to his son, the bar was purchased 10 years ago by a tall, thin, soft-spoken Irishman named Desmond Crawford. For many years this convivial little spot has been a favorite hangout for teachers and students of the Art Students League around the corner. It's a diverting place to spend a late weekend afternoon when the jocular regulars drift in.
Robert Cenedella, a teacher and full-time artist, has been going to the bar for more than 30 years. He treasures the place for its timelessness. "Nothing ever, ever changes here," Mr. Cenedella says, sipping an English ale at the horseshoe-shaped bar. He recalls going to P. J. Carney's with his mentor, the artist George Gross. "I had my first beer in that booth over by the window," he says. "It had to be, oh, 1959. I remember that seat because it had a broken spring that would stick you when you sat down. Well, two weeks ago, I sat over there with some students and the same spring caught me in the rear end!"
When Mr. Crawford is asked if he would ever change anything in the bar, he doesn't even pause to think it over. "Not a chance," he replies. "People feel as if this is their home and don't want people changing things around in their living room."
Among others who stop by P. J. Carney's for the ambiance and Irish ales are the neighborhood resident Buster Poindexter, the pop singer, and the musicians Cy Coleman and Joe Jackson.
 
Afterwork Clubhouse
 Milady's, at the corner of Prince and Thompson Streets in SoHo, is rather nondescript from the outside. Inside, though, about 6 P.M. on Fridays, it becomes a raucous after-work clubhouse. The spacious room has rec-room paneling, sound tile, red-and-white-checked tablecloths, Connie Francis on the jukebox and a big color television mounted overhead.
Two advertising executives shoot pool in one corner. Nearby a group of men and women in the printing business take their usual table. "I come here every day," says Martin Moore, 33, a printing company executive. "I even bring customers here to eat at lunch. We play pool, have something to eat. They feel they've done something rather than just sit in a restaurant."
Frank Genovese, the 35-year-old owner, grew up a few blocks from the bar, and later worked there before buying it 10 years ago. "I thought of making this place much fancier than it is," Mr. Genovese says. "But then in my experience the chi-chi places make a lot of money for a very short time -- but then?" He says his bar is having its best year in memory.
Milady's is primarily a neighborhood bar, although periodically celebrities like Madonna ("She comes with two huge people and has a club soda at the bar") and Sylvester Stallone drop in for fresh homemade ravioli or the house favorite, a charred chicken salad with five types of greens and a mustardy vinaigrette. Main courses top off at $9.
 
Accent on Food
 In fact, many of the old neighborhood joints emphasize food. For example, the 46-year-old Star Tavern in Orange, N.J., is locally renowned for superior, light-crusted pizzas with all kinds of toppings. It's a big barn of a place with an elongated bar, two overhead televisions blaring hockey games, and a 100-inch-television screen that descends for special sports events. The owner, Gary Vayianos, 38, agrees to talk only after he finishes playing electronic bowling with a customer.
The same thing that endears local bars to big-city customers applies here. "You don't change the place if it works," says Mr. Vayianos, a former practicing lawyer. "We have everyone from welfare mothers to millionaires from Montclair in here. It's a real mix. And they like the way it is." When he recently tried to remove a small section of the bar to create a passageway, he said, "customers got all upset about it, asking me who gave permission for that."
 
Ambiance: Macho
 The Bruce Park Grill, in dignified Cos Cob, Conn., is similarly close to being an icon among its bibulous, sports-oriented crowd. It has a decidedly macho ambiance: a dim, smoky mood, a long shuffleboard set running nearly the length of the room and plangent rock music that could create waves in a gin and tonic. Every other male customer looks like a former linebacker, and the $2.50 beers go down like Gatorade.
The octogenarian owner of the town's most colorful hangout, the Mianus River Tavern, better known as Augie's, refused to speak on the record for fear that publicity would change the gritty character of his blue-collar bar. He is so protective that the bar is not even listed in the Greenwich phone directory. Augie's is right out of an Edward Hopper painting, a wonderfully preserved -- or neglected, depending on your perspective -- tableau of Greenwich when most residents worked with their hands, not with their stockbrokers.
A magnificent carved oak bar dominates the faded, threadworn room. A few Formica-topped tables are lined up along the cherry red leather banquettes. Local electricians, builders and town road crew workers pack the spartan back room daily to fill up on "the cheapest lunch in Greenwich," as they refer to Augie's. Hamburgers, for example, are $1.25.
 
With a Past
 Down on far west Spring Street in SoHo is the Ear Inn, a saloon with pedigree. Several years ago, 326 Spring Street was named to the National Register of Historic Places. The first bar on this site opened in 1812 when the riverbank was 15 feet away and this neighborhood housed a substantial number of men who worked the piers.
You couldn't tell its lofty status from the interior, with its splotched old bar, slatted wood ceiling and dark, cramped feeling. Dangling over the bar on this visit is a giant hand-scrawled message from a former patron: "I won't miss work but I will miss you people next year when I'm in Jerusalem."
Some fear the Ear Inn may be losing its character as a local joint judging from the number of dark suits showing up there after work. "Ten years ago there was a frightening group of characters at the bar," says Thomas White, an investment counselor in Manhattan. "You looked in the door and had serious reservations about going inside. Now it's so much better."
The Ear Inn is popular among neighborhood residents for dinner. The straightforward and generally satisfying fare includes soups, chicken breast with mozzarella and ham, broiled salmon with a ginger-scallion sauce and spaghetti with meatballs. The most expensive item, the salmon, is $8.75.
The phone rings behind the bar. The bartender, holding the mouthpiece to his stomach, shouts, "PHILLLLLLLLL! Are you here?"
Phil shouts back over his beer, "If it's female, I'm at the health club."
"I'm sorry, ma'm," the bartender responds. "I believe he's gone to work out at the club."
Now, try that at the Oak Room.

 BODY:
The MONY Syracuse Senior Golf Classic has been dropped from the Senior PGA Tour, officials said today, leaving dates open from June 19-21.
The 10-year-old tournament, one of the Senior PGA's original stops, fell victim to the recession as organizers said they could not attract enough sponsors to continue to hold the 54-hole tournament at the Lafayette Country Club. 
 Last year, it cost $708,000 to stage the weeklong event. Organizers said they were about $200,000 short this year.

Don't Hold Your Breath for Paramount Deal, Fans

BYLINE: By RICHARD SANDOMIR

 BODY:
So, Engulf and Devour (the friendly old epithet for Paramount Communications' acquisitive forerunner, Gulf and Western), is ready to gobble up the New York Yankees and make George Steinbrenner a bad memory?
Well, not yet, even if there is an inherent logic to the entertainment company's owning the very team whose games appear on Paramount's very own Madison Square Garden Network. 
 Yes, Paramount acknowledged yesterday a report that Steinbrenner and some of his merry limited partners had been talking to company officials about buying the team. But Paramount also said, "We have not received any concrete proposals nor have we made any."
Stanley Jaffe, the president of Paramount, was unavailable for comment.
Let's say Boss George is going gonzo over his banishment from baseball by Commissioner Fay Vincent and wants out. Paramount would not run into interference on corporate ownership of a baseball team, which major league baseball has permitted in several cities.
"There's no problem with corporate ownership," said Vincent. "We have corporate owners in St. Louis and Toronto." In Chicago and Atlanta, too.
Vincent is friendly with Jaffe and remembers him fondly from the days when Jaffe produced the movie "Kramer vs. Kramer" for Columbia Pictures, when Vincent ran the studio. Vincent said he learned of the Paramount-Yankees talks from Jaffe.
(Imagine if Vincent asked his old pal Stanley to get George off his back by buying the Yankees? Whoops, just a fantasy.)
If Paramount were a true buyer, it would not be likely to run into the problem of media ownership of teams, an issue that has centered on superstations like TBS and WGN, where signals are beamed nationwide and compete with local teams' broadcasts in other cities.
Baseball officials have tolerated the Atlanta Braves' ownership by Ted Turner, whose TBS superstation airs Braves games, and the Chicago Cubs' ownership by the Tribune Co., whose WGN airs Cubs games.
Paramount would certainly reap a certain cable TV harvest with the Yankees in the corporate stable because it would then have three teams -- the Yankees, the New York Rangers and the New York Knicks -- to own and televise on MSGN.
And it would put the Yankees under Bob Gutkowski, the president of Madison Square Garden, who negotiated the MSGN deal with the Yankees. Lord knows, he would be an improvement over Leonard Kleinman, Daniel McCarthy, Joe Molloy, Hal Steinbrenner, Shakes the Clown or any member of the conga line of Steinbrenner's post-banishment corporate brain trust.
Buying the team would free Paramount of future payments on its $486 million TV deal with the Yankees, now entering its fourth year of 12, but would naturally impose on it the spiraling costs of running the team. Any kind of deal would be an upfront buyout designed to control an asset that is MSGN's cornerstone.
"This is in effect repurchasing their rights fee," said Bob Pollichino, group vice president and general manager of SportsChannel, which owns the New York Mets cable rights.
But events may be preceding reality. Paramount may no more want to buy than Steinbrenner truly wants to sell or wants to give up his reinstatement fight. Perhaps some of the limited partners are just fed up and want to cash out.
An industry source familiar with the Paramount-Yankees talks said Paramount didn't anticipate taking any action for several months, pending Steinbrenner's campaign for reinstatement by Vincent as the team's managing general partner.
But an analyst with the investment firm First Boston, Martin Romm, discounted reports that Paramount would buy the team. Romm views any talks with the Yankees as a way to negotiate a reduction in rights fees for the rest of the MSG pact.
"The issue is the value of the contract today versus the value when MSG signed it," said Romm, who said the deal is worth substantially less than it was when it was struck in 1988 because of the team's poor record and the management turmoil that has existed since Steinbrenner's exile in 1990.
From another part of yesterday's statement, one might deduce that Paramount would like to reduce its rights payments: "Obviously, we are concerned about the future of the team since we have a major investment in it."
Romm added, "Paramount's concern is to protect the investment they made." He speculated that if Paramount were to consider acquiring the Yankees, it would demand that the remaining value of the MSG contract be discounted, thus reducing the team's purchase price. Various estimates have placed the market value of the Yankees at between $200 million and $300 million.
Another analyst, Christopher Dixon of Paine Webber, provided scenarios for what Paramount might pay for the Yankees. Assuming that Paramount required a 15 percent rate of return on its investments and using rough estimates of the Yankees' revenues and expenses, he said the team would be worth $140 million with $20 million in cash flow, or $245 million with $35 million in cash flow.
Baseball economics would not necessarily be in Paramount's favor if it owned the Yankees. Player salaries are escalating at an unprecedented pace, and there is the likelihood that national TV revenues will fall after 1993.
In addition, the Houston Astros and the Baltimore Orioles have found no buyers after being up for sale for quite a while. Tom Monaghan, the owner of the Detroit Tigers, recently put his team on the auction block.
How much of a premium Paramount would want to pay for the Yankees above recent team-sale prices of about $80 million and the $95 million pricetag for expansion teams in Miami and Denver remains to be seen.
"Paramount won't buy the Yankees at a scorched earth price," said Romm. "What drives their ego is to create value for the shareholder, and you don't create value by overpaying for the Yankees."

End Foreign Ownership Of the Yanks

BYLINE: By GEORGE VECSEY

 BODY:
THE guard had his orders. Nobody without a pass was allowed to stand around at courtside of the Miami Arena before a game between the Heat and the Knicks. The guard went around checking every scruffy reporter, every official, every ball boy. No pass, no loitering.
The mild-mannered gent in the suit did not have a pass. Didn't even pretend. Just shrugged and held out his empty hands. 
 "But he's the boss," a reporter said. "His company owns the Knicks."
"Ya gotta have a pass," the guard said.
Some owners we could mention might have blustered, might have cajoled, might have threatened. Stanley Jaffe, the chief operating officer of Paramount Communications, just went to his seat. I had never seen Stanley Jaffe before this moment last November, and I haven't spotted him since, but this was not a bad first impression of a man from a corporation that just might buy the New York Yankees.
Normally, I would be horrified at the prospect of a huge corporation's purchasing part or all of the Yankees. But in this case, Paramount would be taking the Yankees away from George M. Steinbrenner, and how bad could that be? A currently successful octopus replacing a rogue elephant down on his luck.
George Steinbrenner won four pennants from 1976 through 1981 by being ahead of his time in spending money on talented free agents. But he destroyed the organization by chasing good people away, by distracting the players, by getting nuts about being on television and the back pages of the tabloids.
It does not work having Steinbrenner suspended for life after paying a gambler to acquire dirt on a Yankee player. His employees keep waiting for the psychic message of what George would do if he were here. It is time for him to sell the club. Stay home in Tampa. Get a life.
I used to think the ideal solution would be for some personable and rich New Yorker to buy the Yankees. Somebody like The Donald. But Trump also got nuts, building too many gambling joints in Atlantic City and making whoopee when he should have been talking to his bankers. (Don't Trump and Bill Clinton kind of look alike?)
Maybe the age of individuals is over. Maybe there are no personable and rich New Yorkers who could afford the Yankees anymore, not at prices like $300 million. Instead, we are into the age of giant companies like Paramount, which owns Madison Square Garden, the arena and the network, as well as the Knicks and the Rangers and goodness knows what else.
It would be better if TV networks did not own ball clubs. Sometimes the Atlanta Braves right fielder is facing directly into the setting sun for no other reason than that Ted Turner and his TBS people want a baseball game to blend directly into a prime-time movie. It makes perfect sense for the Chicago Cubs to play in the National League West, but the team owner, the Tribune Company, also owns WGN and does not want more games from the Pacific time zone.
Baseball used to say it wanted only local ownership with community roots. The Tribune Company at least thinks Chicago, and the Busch company thinks St. Louis, and Paramount does have some of its major tentacles in New York. It is unfortunate that the Seattle Mariners tapped out while so many Americans are blaming Japan for the economic troubles left by the Reagan-Bush years. If a Seattle-based Japanese investor could help keep the Mariners in the Pacific Northwest, that would be the best solution.
Talk about foreign ownership; if corporate ownership could run Steinbrenner out of town, that would be liberating. Not that I'm fond of giant corporations. I liked Paramount better as Gulf and Western, the kind of ominous name straight from some old novel or movie, the kind of company that would evict widows and close down farms.
Gulf and Western tended to torment its own sports executives. Its anonymous corporate hit men drove the late Michael Burke straight to Ireland. It's hard to get straight answers in bureaucracies. One executive says we're pushing cheeseburgers this week; another says hot dogs. Which is it, guys? Ask Dave DeBusschere. Ask Craig Patrick. But lately, Paramount seems to have come through its identity crisis. There is an air of stability and confidence in the place. Maybe even a tad of respect and trust.
Oh, and about that guard at the Miami Arena. After running off the gent in the suit, he started to fret: "Is he really the boss?"
"Really," somebody said.
"Uh-oh," the guard said.
But it was cool. Stanley Jaffe never came back with the cavalry or the police or the guard's boss. Never played off-with-his-head, like some owners we could name.

HEADLINE: On My Mind;
Politicians Of Silence

BYLINE: By A. M. ROSENTHAL

 BODY:
I hope it will not annoy the Presidential candidates and other seekers of political office if I bring up a subject that they hardly mention as they dash around campaigning.
Drugs. You remember -- drugs, as in drug addiction, drug crime, drug disease, drug homeless, drug madness, drug guns, drug blood and drug babies. And as in The War Against Drugs, declared by Washington, way back, about three years ago. 
 Maybe it is not worth talking about anymore. Maybe the Bush Administration was right: declare victory, put it on the back burner and put out the pilot light. Then announce a new war, against a different national killer, like the capital gains tax or something.
And maybe all those state legislatures and governors were right to answer recession pressure by whacking away at treatment of drug addicts.
After all, it is a proven fact that drug addicts are too zonked out to vote. And it is another proven fact that middle- and upper-class Americans do not worry about drugs unless they hit their own families or neighborhoods.
So politicians assume, doubtless correctly, that Americans are too stupid to understand that one day some addict from a mean street somewhere might wander into their neighborhood and teach them a civics lesson by sticking a knife in their ribs.
Not everybody has forgotten. In New York City, about 750 people got together Wednesday at a benefit dinner organized by Tina Brown, editor of Vanity Fair, and by the Morgans Hotel Group. The purposes were to help the work against drugs with time and money, and honor Dr. Mitchell S. Rosenthal. In the past 25 years, he has not forgotten for an hour.
Dr. Rosenthal is head of Phoenix House, largest of the 250 American therapeutic communities. They are based on a no-magic treatment for addiction.
The prescription is for about one year of hard work -- all day, every day in a disciplined environment -- that has two objectives. The first is to equip addicts mentally, physically and spiritually to keep off drugs, forever.
The second is to give them the education, work habits and self-respect needed to earn a living in the world outside.
No magic, no guarantee. But 70 percent of the addicts who stick it out for a year stay clean and useful to themselves and society. Each addict costs about $45 a day in philanthropic or tax money. Pennies, compared with the tens of billions spent building prisons and stocking them with addicts on a perpetual round trip between street and cell.
Education against drugs, by schools and volunteer groups like the Partnership for a Drug-Free America, is making drugs less chic in schools.
But about 6.5 million drug users so abuse themselves that they cannot function in or for the American community. They fill jails, clog hospitals with needle-AIDS and TB, crowd shelters and provide morgues with a steady, dependable supply of the corpses of their victims.
Therapeutic communities will not end the drug problem, but they will help, a lot. Dr. Rosenthal says about 100,000 beds are needed. About a tenth that number exist now, more than half in New York and California.
And meanwhile the housing, land and shops for vocational training are available in closed military bases. The therapeutic communities plead helplessly for this wasted resource.
Since so many politicians are reluctant to bring up drugs now, how about legalizing the whole thing so we can stop bothering our heads? Dr. Rosenthal, like most drug experts, says it would be suicide for America. But then, nothing is perfect.
Oh, certainly, there would be more drug use and abuse. But to keep drugs out of sight of most Americans, electrified walls could be built around the poor white or black and Hispanic neighborhoods infected by drug addicts.
Then armed guards could be posted at gates. Addicts could be shot if they tried to get out. Other residents would have to show passes from the special legalization police.
Behind the walls, addicts could kill each other off; burying them would be cheaper than treatment. Maybe bounties could be paid for death certificates of crack babies. They would just drag through life anyway.
Yes, come to think of it now, it could work. Trees could even be planted near the walls.

Nixon's Tricky Crusade

BYLINE: By LESLIE H. GELB

 BODY:
In a memo circulated privately to his worshipers but meant to bludgeon President Bush publicly, Richard Nixon lays down this warning: If the U.S. doesn't get its act together to save Boris Yeltsin, the question of "Who lost Russia?" will be even more politically devastating in the 90's than "Who lost China?" was in the 50's.
I've got three quarrels with the Old Trickster's latest endeavor to help humankind: 
 First, the way he states the issue about Russia is as wrong and almost as phony as it was when he played that destructive game over China in the 1950's.
Mr. Nixon knows who lost China -- the Chinese: the corrupt and incompetent Nationalist Government led by Chiang Kai-shek, which the U.S. could not have saved from Communism with billions of dollars or bombs.
Mr. Nixon and the right-wingers who dreamt up this issue had no program to "save" China. Their sole purpose was to terrorize and defeat Democrats.
While he does have a plan to "save" Russia, Russia -- like China -- is not ours to win or lose. If democracy fails there, the blame will belong almost exclusively to the Russians. Not to Boris Yeltsin and his democratic advisers. They are good and seemingly capable people. But they are trying to do the nearly impossible -- convert 1,000 years of Russian backwardness, corruption, dictatorship, bureaucratic inefficiency, passivity, narrow nationalism and a huge, chaotic economy into a modern capitalist democracy.
Mr. Yeltsin and the Russians have a long, punishing road ahead. The most important thing for them to understand is this: They are responsible for their own fate. The worst thing for them to believe is that the West can or will save them.
Second, the West nonetheless should do all it sensibly can to help Mr. Yeltsin. And here Mr. Nixon repeats some useful points, but dodges the tough questions.
He calls for more humanitarian aid, a corps of Western manager/ teachers, greater access to Western technology and markets, debt rescheduling, a currency stabilization fund and the like. His contribution on these ongoing efforts is to argue for greater urgency.
But he finesses the issue of what should be expected of the Russians. He says, for example, that the West should stabilize the ruble "as soon as Russia gets control of its money supply." That's almost like saying as soon as it solves all its economic problems.
And he is silent on how to pay the bill, some $2 billion to $5 billion yearly for the U.S. alone. The only conceivable source of cash is the Pentagon budget. But the Old Trickster does not mention that honey pot.
My favorite Nixon point is the one about creating a single organization to coordinate all aid to Russia. It's absolutely essential, as I wrote two months ago.
Lastly, what troubles me about Mr. Nixon and the other foreign policy mandarins who applaud his new crusade is that they seem perpetually more interested in Russia than America.
They insist we should do everything we can to help Russia. Otherwise, they say, we will never forgive ourselves for missing this historic opportunity. Their imperative is to give even if it's wasted -- like the almost $50 billion in Western aid that has already "disappeared" in the last two years. But many of these same mandarins would never dream of "wasting" money on homeless, uneducated and unemployed Americans -- or see the plight of Americans as a historic challenge.
The expectations of the foreign policy mandarins like Mr. Nixon are also cockeyed. On the one hand, they maintain that a few billion Western dollars and a lot of Western love can spell the difference between success and failure in Russia. On the other hand, many of them argue that only the naive believe a minority kid can be educated or national health care made affordable in America.
By their thinking, everything is possible in Russia; nothing in America. By their thinking, it's fine to throw money down a Russian sinkhole, but the toughest standards must be applied to money spent at home.
I am all for an urgent, sensibly organized, comprehensive plan to aid Russian democracy. But I would do no less, and far more, for America. And the question I would put to Mr. Nixon and his faithful flock is this: Who is losing America?

HEADLINE: THE MEDIA BUSINESS;
F.C.C. Loosens Restrictions On Owning Radio Stations

BYLINE: By EDMUND L. ANDREWS, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, March 12

 BODY:
The Federal Communications Commission today more than doubled the number of radio stations that a single company may own and also allowed a single owner to have as many as three AM and three FM stations in a single city.
The action, approved 4 to 0 with one abstention, comes as the industry is enduring its worst recession in decades. The F.C.C.'s chairman, Alfred C. Sikes, has argued that allowing greater consolidation will allow broadcasters to cut costs. 
 Andrew C. Barrett, the only black on the commission, abstained. In a rare public outburst, he accused his colleagues of paying "lip service" to minority broadcasters and leaving him out of last-minute negotiations.
Mr. Barrett, a Republican from Illinois, argued that the commission was "grossly altering" the ownership structure of the industry. Although he abstained, Mr. Barrett said he would probably change his vote to a formal dissent when the commission published the final rule in several weeks.
Key Democrats in Congress, who favor stricter limits as a way to preserve diversity in radio, quickly objected and promised to introduce legislation to reverse the decision.
But the chances are strong that the new rule will ultimately remain in place. While members of the House are clearly upset, senators who disagree with the change have restrained their comments in recent weeks. President Bush generally favors deregulation.
The rules adopted today, which take effect on Aug. 1, will permit a single person or company to own as many as 30 AM and 30 FM stations nationwide. Under the current rules, one owner may have no more than 12 AM and 12 FM stations nationwide and no more than one of each in any market. Minority owners are currently permitted up to 14 AM and 14 FM stations.
The changes are likely to lead to spirited bidding for some stations. Large broadcasting companies that are close to the old limit -- including CBS, Capital Cities/ABC, Group W-Westinghouse Broadcasting and Infinity Broadcasting are believed to be eager to buy additional stations in large markets.
But it is unclear whether the new ownership limits will have much immediate effect in New York and the other largest markets because big-city stations are generally profitable and under less pressure to sell.
"I think there will be a lot of interest, but I don't know how many opportunities there will be," said Robert F. X. Sillerman, head of the Sillerman Companies in New York, which owns 50 percent of WNEW-AM and has investments in many other stations.
But Mel Karmazin, the president and chief executive of Infinity, had said when the new rules were first proposed: "We would love to have another station in New York, Los Angeles and Chicago. A change in ownership rules would be very favorable to us." Mr. Karmazin was out of the office and could not be reached today.
F.C.C. officials said the old rules had long been outdated because radio stations face ample competition from cable television and other forms of communication.
In a staff report on the industry intended to shore up its decision, the F.C.C. said that more than half of all stations in the country were losing money. Because many broadcasters could neither turn a profit nor sell their licenses, 153 stations simply shut in the last year.
The move is also part of a broader effort initiated by Mr. Sikes to loosen a wide range of other restrictions, including rules that limit a company to 12 television stations. Television was not addressed in today's action. F.C.C. officials said that in the next few months they also would accelerate action on a proposal to allow television networks to acquire cable television outlets.
The five commissioners spent the last week trying to resolve differences. Mr. Sikes and Sherrie P. Marshall generally supported a staff recommendation to eliminate the national ownership limits and allow companies to acquire four AM and four FM stations in a single city. Mr. Barrett, Ervin S. Duggan and James H. Quello wanted to move more cautiously.
 
Market-Size Formula
 Besides lifting the national ownership limits, the new rule will revise the so-called duopoly rule that barred a company from owning more than one AM and one FM station in a single city The new regulation would raise the limits based on the size of the market.
In cities with a total of fewer than 15 stations on both bands, a company will not be allowed to buy stations that account for more than half the market share of listeners. In all the bigger cities, the limit will be 25 percent.
In the cities with fewer than 15 stations a company may own three stations, but no more than two FM stations. FM stations, with their superior sound quality, are generally more profitable than AM stations.
Companies would be allowed to buy two AM and two FM station in cities with between 15 and 29 stations; three AM and two FM stations in cities with between 30 and 39 stations, and three of each in cities with more than 40 stations, like New York.
"We're delighted with the F.C.C. action," said Stephen A. Hildebrandt, chief counsel of Group W Radio, which owns a total of 17 AM and FM stations, including WINS in New York City.
 
'Competitive Disadvantage'
 Members of minorities in the broadcasting industry argued that the new rule would make it hard for people who own small stations to "trade up" to larger ones. The rule "means you put at a competitive disadvantage those who cannot afford to buy multiple stations," said Lois Wright, vice president of the Inner City Broadcasting, which owns WLIB-AM and WBLS-FM in New York and is general counsel for the National Association of Black-Owned Broadcasters.
But the angriest reaction came from Mr. Barrett, who complained that he had not learned about the final agreement until someone outside the F.C.C. presented it to him. "Don't play games with me," he told Mr. Sikes.
The commission also placed some restrictions on what are known as time-brokering agreements, under which one station can lease most of its air time to another station nearby. Under such agreements, which have become popular in the last year, the station that turns over its airtime usually becomes what amounts to a robot transmitter for the other.
The F.C.C. has permitted these arrangements but reuled today that a station could only enter one if it would be eligible to buy the other station under the limits set today.
In a related action, the commission asked for comment on a proposal to let banks and other lenders hold a security interest in a broadcast license as collateral for a loan.

HEADLINE: THE 1992 CAMPAIGN: White House;
BUSH GIVES BREAK TO AUTO INDUSTRY ON GASOLINE FUMES

BYLINE: By KEITH SCHNEIDER, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, March 13

 BODY:
Four days before the Michigan primary, President Bush told business executives today that the Government would not require automobile manufacturers to install pollution-control devices on new cars to capture gasoline fumes released into the atmosphere during refueling.
In making the announcement just three days after the primary in Texas, Mr. Bush settled a long dispute between auto makers and oil companies over which industry would be required to invest in new equipment to clear the air of benzene and other chemical compounds that contribute to urban smog. 
 The oil industry, which dominates the Texas economy, today lost the dispute that began 17 years ago, when the Government first considered controlling the fumes from refueling. The decision was roundly criticized by lawmakers and environmental groups as well as the oil industry.
 
A Tradition of Campaigns
 Doling out political favors has been an election-year tactic of Presidents for decades. Environmental officials asserted privately this week that Mr. Bush's strategy is driven by the belief that there is only one political gain available to him from the recession: packaging his stepped-up attack on environmental regulations as an effort to help business and preserve jobs.
The Environmental Protection Agency said today that it would soon issue a new regulation under the Clean Air Act of 1990 directing service station owners in about 45 cities to install rubber collars on nozzles and vapor-recovery systems on pumps.
The Government said the average cost of such systems, already in use in California as well as the District of Columbia and other Northeastern cities, is about $2,200 a pump and $20,000 to $40,000 for each station. The environmental agency estimated the cost of installing fume-trapping canisters in cars at $20 to $30 for each car.
 
Small but Vital Step
 Gasoline fumes contain substantial quantities of benzene, a known cancer-causing chemical, and organic chemicals that combine with nitrogen oxide and other compounds to form smog. Except in cities that require containment systems at service stations, fumes that accumulate in gasoline tanks escape into the atmosphere during refueling.
The E.P.A. said today that gasoline fumes account for 2 percent of the urban smog problem. The agency said that although that percentage is small, there are so many sources of smog that identifying one and reducing it sharply would be a major improvement.
Mr. Bush and William K. Reilly, the Administrator of the E.P.A., said the decision in favor of the automobile industry was the result of new studies by the Department of Transportation. They found that installing canisters near gasoline tanks to capture the fumes would be a risk to passengers because of the increased chance the canister would catch fire or explode in a collision.
In addition, William G. Rosenberg, the assistant administrator of the environmental agency for air and radiation, said that the automobile industry deserved a break from requirements of the Clean Air Act, since it is already required to reduce emissions in new cars by developing more advanced engine and tailpipe controls.
"This was perceived to be the least-cost way for the consumer to pay, and a fairer distribution of the economic burden," Mr. Rosenberg said.
 
Under Immediate Attack
 The action by the Bush Administration was attacked today by lawmakers, environmentalists, independent station owners, and the Center for Auto Safety, a Washington-based consumer group.
"The on-board canisters were a cheaper and better way to control volatile emissions than the vapor-recovery systems at gasoline stations, which are expensive and difficult to maintain," said Senator Max S. Baucus, Democrat of Montana who was a principal author of the Clean Air Act. "The so-called environmental President is playing politics with clean air."
The Center for Auto Safety disputed the Government's contention that vapor canisters were a safety risk. The group has said that cars already have similar canisters installed to control emissions and the Government has never maintained that they were a danger.
Environmental groups said the Clean Air Act, which the President vigorously supported, requires installation in cars and gasoline stations of systems to control gasoline fumes. Waiving one requirement was a purely political move that would do nothing to reduce pollution from vapors in less smoggy cities, they said.
 
An Act 'Held Hostage'?
 The Natural Resources Defense Council today listed 11 other regulations under the Clean Air Act that have been proposed by the environmental agency but which have been blocked by the White House. One covers emissions of toxic chemicals from factories, one of the largest sources of air pollution. "The Clean Air Act is being held hostage by the White House," said David D. Doniger, a lawyer with the group.
Independent gasoline marketers also criticized the President's action, calling it expensive, unnecessary and likely to reduce competition. They said the cost of installing vapor-recovery systems could put hundreds of stations out of business and allow the big oil companies to gain a much larger share of the $130 billion retail gasoline market.
The Petroleum Marketers Association of America said that although independent businessmen own two-thirds of the 175,000 stations across the country, they pump just 45 percent of the gasoline.
"The big oil companies don't like this much either, but they are in much better financial position to afford the vapor-recovery systems," said Phillip R. Chisholm, executive vice president of the association. "They have the advantage of their size. They also have higher concentration of stations in the markets that are most affected by this rule, which means they can get the contractors who do this work first and at lower costs."
As Mr. Bush campaigns against Patrick J. Buchanan, the conservative commentator who is challenging him for the Republican nomination, he is doing what politicians at all levels do in an election year: dispensing pork.
In addition to President Bush's announcement last week of a $514 million reclamation project to straighten the Kissimmee River in Florida, he has reduced some environmental regulations.
In the past month, the Administration relaxed regulations on the natural gas industry in Oklahoma. It also announced its intention to seek Congressional approval to bypass the Endangered Species Act in the Northwest to allow cutting of the last stands of virgin forest. Backers say that would preserve 30,000 jobs.
It was revealed this week that the Administration joined sides with the coal industry in a Federal Court lawsuit the industry hopes will weaken enforcement of the nation's strip-mining law. Earlier, the White House announced a program to remove regulation of the biotechnology industry, including making it easier for agricultural biotechnology companies to test living genetically-engineered organisms outdoors.

New Hope in Inner Cities: Banks Offering Mortgages

BYLINE: By LESLIE WAYNE, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: PHILADELPHIA

 BODY:
In blighted North Philadelphia, where gutted homes intersect with broken dreams, the banking industry is meeting the inner city.
Prodded by Federal laws and an aggressive community-action group called Acorn, banks here and in other cities across the country have started making mortgage loans in neighborhoods they have traditionally avoided. 
 In Philadelphia, bankers are setting the rules for this kind of lending. So far, $60 million has been lent in a widely watched program. It matters little if an applicant has a small income, an irregular job pattern or collects welfare or food stamps. He or she might still qualify for a mortgage, bankers here say -- a radical departure from tradition banking practices.
 
Benefits for Neighborhoods
 To bankers, the inner city is an "underbanked" market, in their parlance. And what they are finding is that making mortgages to inner-city borrowers promises to strengthen their bottom line in the long run, while not hurting it in the short term. More important, these loans have profound social and economic benefits for inner-city neighborhoods and for the quality of urban life in general.
"There's a lot of good business to be had," said Cathy Bessant, a senior vice president at Nationsbank, the North Carolina giant that recently committed $10 billion over the next 10 years for a variety of loans to inner-city neighborhoods across the nation. "About 60 percent of American households have an annual income of less than $25,000. It's a huge market that is absolutely underbanked and there are not many underbanked markets out there."
Since 1985, at least 29 banks across the country have put more than $500 million into inner-city mortgages. This translates into 16,000 mortgages. And more money is on the way. By far the biggest pledge is the $10 billion from Nationsbank, recently created by the merger of the NCNB Corporation and the C&S/Sovran Bank. And the Chemical Banking Corporation, which recently merged with the Manufacturers Hanover Corporation, has promised to set aside $750 million for inner-city mortgages in New York.
But lending to the inner city is not exactly like lending to the suburbs. Banks must adopt different underwriting standards to determine who is creditworthy and who is not -- for instance, looking at the steady repayment of small bills instead of at wealth. They must also develop creative marketing techniques to attract borrowers unfamiliar with mainstream lending. And banks are finding it necessary to provide intensive financial counseling before making any loans. These changes have not come easily.
"Few bankers do this out of the goodness of their heart," said Michael Shea, housing director for Acorn, formally known as the Association of Community Groups for Reform Now, a national nonprofit group. "If there was no community pressure and the law, few banks would do something. But now a lot of bankers see it's in their self-interest."
For banks familiar with the ways of corporate America and the board room, meeting with community-based groups of poor people is not something willingly done. But the recent wave of bank mergers, which must be approved by Federal regulators, has created an opportunity for housing advocacy groups to be heard.
There are many such voices. But by far the loudest belongs to Acorn, which has some 70,000 members, a $10 million annual budget and two decades of active history.
In Washington, Acorn once tied red ribbons around a Crestar Bank branch to object to what Acorn saw as the bank's practice of redlining, or denying mortgages to inner-city areas. With tactics like this, the nation's largest banks have come to the negotiating table just to silence objections that could derail or create costly delays to a merger.
 
'A Little Window Opens'
 "The banking industry has done all it can to avoid community reinvestment," said Deepak Bhargava, an Acorn legislative representative in Washington. "Our opportunity to be taken seriously is only when a bank goes to the Federal Reserve and says it wants to merge. That's when a little window opens for us."
A Federal regulator concurs. "Acorn is street-tough rough and they bedevil the bankers," he said. "But they've gotten banks to commit millions they otherwise would not have lent."
In Philadelphia, where Acorn has been most active, Ray F. Desiderio, a senior vice president at the Continental Bank, remembers the day the group threatened to oppose its 1986 merger with the Midlantic Bank. The threat, later withdrawn, was enough to get Mr. Desiderio to Acorn's shabby office here.
"The first meetings were rough," he said. "They were in North Philadelphia on a hot summer's night. Acorn's demands were an inch thick and we were caught flatfooted. When we looked at their demands, it was obvious we had to look at our policies."
His bank has since lent $20 million to the inner city.
 
The Process
Matching People With Mortgages
 A long, creaky staircase goes up to Acorn's office, where there's a hum of activity as low-income people are matched with mortgages. In one corner, Marilyn Ashley, an Acorn counselor, fields telephone calls and explains the program. Low-income people trickle in to fill out mortgage applications.
In another room, a representative of the Mellon Bank, one of the state's oldest banks, processes a mortgage for a middle-aged woman on her lunch break. No one who gets a mortgage ever has to go beyond this office.
"The major difference between this and traditional lending is that I'll come to you and I'll fit into your schedule," said Mike Garcia, a Mellon mortgage representative, as he photocopied documents. "A lot of branches don't have the expertise for this kind of lending. So they call me and I go out."
Mr. Garcia, who spends part of his week here, said he's seen it all -- from people who sign "X" for their name to a 70-year-old first-time home buyer who took out a 30-year mortgage.
Last year, Mr. Garcia processed 212 mortgages, for a total of $5.7 million in loans. About 30 percent came through Acorn, which represents mainly black home buyers. An additional 40 percent came through a similar program run by a Hispanic community group and the rest from groups representing Vietnamese and Irish low-income neighborhoods.
At one desk, Allison Hughes of Acorn tells a young woman who works as a probation officer what documents she needs to buy the house she now rents. At another desk, Ms. Ashley meets with a middle-aged man who received a house from the city without charge, but has no money to fix it up. She suggests giving the house back and instead joining Acorn's financial counseling sessions to learn to budget for a down payment and buy a modest house in better shape.
He is followed by a couple who speak only Creole and who were having trouble with their application. The couple brought along a young woman who translated while her own two children played in her lap and Ms. Ashley's. Ms. Ashley does many things to help people -- just that morning, she gave a wake-up call to a man who works nights and who asked her to help him keep his appointment.
 
The Rewards
Banks Say Loans Help in Long Run
The Philadelphia banks in the program, Mellon, Continental and Fidelity,, say their experience shows that a well-structured program can break even in the short run and promises intangible and financial gains over the long haul. The banks charge sufficient fees to cover costs and work hard to keep delinquencies and foreclosures low.
"These are not conventional loans and we make sure that we don't lose money," Mr. Desiderio said. "But they are totally beneficial to us because they improve our trade area. In the long run this will drop to the bottom line."
Bankers believe that as poor neighborhoods stabilize, the entire region benefits, which affects a bank's future profitability.
What is more, these mortgages help banks fulfill somewhat vague obligations of the Community Reinvestment Act of 1977, which requires banks to invest in communities that provide them with deposits.
"What happens to these neighborhoods when there are no loans?" said Bruce Dorpalen, Acorn's housing coordinator in Philadelphia. "You limit sales to those who pay cash or who make large down payments. Who is that? Absentee landlords or drug dealers.
"There is a market for these houses. Where bankers get religion is when then see they can do this with no risk."
 
The Counseling
Agency Works To Aid Applicants
 The key to success is counseling and marketing.
In Philadelphia, Acorn and similar groups counsel potential buyers in the responsibilities of home ownership and screen applicants for the banks. Sometimes, the applicants work more than a year with counselors to straighten out their finances and save for the down payment.
Each year, Philadelphia banks and Acorn hold a fair where hundreds of low-income people come and the banks vie for business. John V. Killen, an executive at Fidelity Bank, thinks of himself as the Phil Donahue of the fair. With microphone in hand, he plunges into the audience to get people to relax. "I once had 200 people rolling in the aisles," he said. "Many of them are bashful, shy and in need."
The terms of these loans might well cause most bankers to wince -- at first. A typical borrower earns from $10,000 to the mid-$20,000's a year and gets a mortgage -- which averages about $22,000 -- a percentage point or more below market rates. Fees are lowered and lending standards allow even welfare payments and food stamps to be counted as income.
Since many inner-city residents have never had checking accounts and pay only with cash, many have no credit history. So, banks look at rent and utility payments and outstanding debts to determine creditworthiness. Normally, banks require two years of steady employment. But here, since so many low-income residents switch jobs frequently, banks look for steady income, even if from many jobs.
 
The Customer
A Return Home To His Own Place
 One of the home buyers is Calvin Williams, who works in the personnel section of a department store. Mr. Williams, a divorced father of two teen-agers, has just bought a row home in the Strawberry Mansion section, a neighborhood balanced between forbidding, vacant homes and those that are occupied but well guarded.
For the last two years, Mr. Williams had been living in a New Jersey apartment and read all he could about home buying, including literature Acorn had distributed at work.
"I was born and raised in North Philadelphia and the only way to help the neighborhood was to go back, live there and keep up a home," he said. His friends thought he should move to a more stable area. But he wanted the house he found, and it was close to where his mother and daughters lived.
 
Federal Reserve Report
 He said he preferred dealing with a community group rather than going directly to a bank because "the whole notion of a mortgage is scary and it was a relief to go one-on-one with someone I could relate to."
While Mr. Williams was applying, he read about a Federal Reserve report last October showing widespread discrimination against blacks in home mortgage lending. The report looked at more than five million mortgage applications and found that blacks were turned down twice as much as whites, even at the same income level.
As a black, he was concerned, and went to the Federal Reserve Bank in Philadelphia. When he saw that the Mellon Bank, one of the three working with Acorn, had a good record, he decided to give it his business.
"The Mellon person agreed to meet me at the Acorn office and everything was done on premises," Mr. Williams said. "That took away all the starchiness."
Just before Christmas, he got his mortgage and by the holiday he was going back and forth in his Volkswagen moving furniture, one carload at a time.
Like nearly all borrowers in the program, Mr. Williams's monthly mortgage is less than what he was paying in rent -- and for more space. "I feel blessed that everything fell into place," he said. "This block is holding together and to protect my investment, I am going to have to live here."
 
Working Together
Banks and Acorn Lobby Jointly
 With nearly 3,000 mortgages given out here so far, bankers elsewhere are calling for information.
They are told that delinquency rates are higher than traditional mortgage portfolios, but foreclosures are lower. Continental, however, has been able to bring delinquencies to conventional levels by calling borrowers who are late and getting them counseling.
Mr. Killen at Fidelity, which has lent some $25 million in the program, said he was working with Acorn to develop regular post-mortgage counseling. "We don't want the legal bills of foreclosure and we don't want people out on the streets," he said.
But the mergers that have helped create the lending programs are also a cause of concern for some. LaVerne Butts, a Philadelphia Acorn official, fears that mega-mergers may leave the poor in the dust. "Where's the accountability?" she asked. "We're doing wonderful things, but we're still swimming against the tide. Many of these banks still don't view low- and moderate-income people as people. When they get so big, who do you lean on?"
 
Aiming at Secondary Market
 Yet at present, the three Philadelphia banks seem responsive. They have lobbied with Acorn in Washington to find ways to make it easier to package these mortgages and sell them in the secondary market. This would reduce the banks' risk and free up more money to lend.
The biggest buyer of mortgages is the Federal National Mortgage Association, known as Fannie Mae, which resells them to investors. But Fannie Mae has been reluctant to buy such unconventional mortgages. Acorn hopes that large commitments like that of Nationsbank will help bring pressure on Fannie Mae. Already, Nationsbank is talking about joining with Acorn's Washington lobby.
"You wouldn't picture it," Ms. Bessant of Nationsbank said, "but community-based groups and giant banks lobbying together is a pretty powerful combination."

HEADLINE: Dow Up 27.28 to End Week at 3,235.91

BYLINE: By ROBERT HURTADO

 BODY:
Stocks advanced yesterday in moderate trading after a smaller-than-expected rise in producer prices indicated that inflation was being restrained.
The Dow Jones industrial average closed at 3,235.91, up 27.28 points for the day and 14.31 for the week, while the broader market was stronger, too. 
 The lower producer price numbers reduced the fear of inflation and diminished the chances that the Fed might tighten credit.
 
'Triple Witching Hour'
 Analysts at MMS International expect the market to trade in a narrow range into next week, ending with next Friday's "triple witching hour," when March options on individual stocks, the March Standard & Poor's 500 futures and options on the S.& P. futures all expire.
Vincent Graziano, head of equity trading for Labe Associates, noted that since mid-February, the market remained confined to its tight trading range of 3,200 to 3,300 on the Dow.
"While it looks for further signs of an economic recovery, the market will likely do what it has for the past month, and that is to move in no clear direction," Mr. Graziano said.
Volume on the New York Stock Exchange was 177.9 million shares, down from 180.3 million on Thursday, with gaining issues ahead of losers, 987 to 675. The S.& P. 500 index rose 1.95 points, to 405.84, while the American Stock Exchange composite gained 0.47 point, to 404.06. The Nasdaq composite was up 2.70, to 618.62, and the Russell 2,000 was up 0.77 point, to 206.76.
The stock of Litton Industries jumped 1 1/8, to 97, after its board approved a 2-for-1 stock split. Pfizer, on the other hand, fell 1 1/4, to 71 3/8, after the Food and Drug Administration said it wanted the company to warn patients of the possible higher rate of fracture for some large heart valves. The F.D.A. said it might be necessary to replace the valves.
Athena Neurosciences, a pharmaceuticals manufacturer, rose 1, to 13 1/2. David Webber, an analyst with Alex. Brown & Sons, initiated coverage of the stock with a "buy" rating. The analyst said the rating reflected his optimism about the company's research into Alzheimer's disease and its research into other areas of new drugs for neuro-degenerative diseases like multiple sclerosis, Parkinson's disease and epilepsy.
Lotus Development rose 1 7/8, to 38 5/8, after several analysts repeated buy ratings for the software company after a meeting with management that included a demonstration of several new products.
T2 Medical, which operates infusion therapy centers where patients are given medicine and nutrients intravenously, rose 2 1/2, to 47 1/2. Donaldson, Lufkin & Jenrette adjusted its recommendation on the stock to "very attractive" from "moderately attractive."
VLSI Technology, rose 1 5/8, to 9 1/2. The company and Intel, unchanged at 64, are in talks on a technology sharing agreement, in which Intel would acquire a minority equity interest in VSLI.

HEADLINE: COMPANY NEWS;
Rockwell to Cut Earnings By $1.5 Billion This Year

BYLINE: By RICHARD W. STEVENSON, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: LOS ANGELES, March 13

 BODY:
The Rockwell International Corporation said today that it would reduce its earnings this year by $1.5 billion to reflect a change in the way it accounts for the health-care costs of its retirees.
At the same time, Rockwell said that it saw no signs of an economic turnaround and that because of the resulting weakness in its automotive- components, factory automation and electronics businesses, it now expected full-year earnings per share to be down by 15 percent, not including the effect of the accounting change. 
 In taking the charge, Rockwell became the latest company to adopt an accounting rule that requires future retiree health-care costs to be accounted for in advance rather than as they are incurred.
As a result of the change, Rockwell said it would restate its earnings for the three months ended Dec. 31, the first quarter of its fiscal year. The company said the change would result in a loss for the first quarter as well as for the full fiscal year, but did not say what the restated first-quarter earnings would be. As originally calculated, the first-quarter earnings were $123.3 million, or 54 cents a share, down 13 percent from the comparable period a year earlier.
 
Stock Price Falls

 
 On the New York Stock Exchange today, Rockwell shares closed at $26, down 75 cents.
The company, which is based in Seal Beach, Calif., had previously warned that it might have trouble this year posting earnings comparable to last year's. In addition to its commercial businesses, Rockwell is a primary supplier to the National Aeronautics and Space Administration and a leading Pentagon contractor.
Donald R. Beall, Rockwell's chairman and chief executive, said the company still hoped for an economic turnaround by 1993. "With the improvements we expect in our automotive and factory automation businesses, our outlook is for earnings higher than 1992," Mr. Beall said.

HEADLINE: 2 S.&. L.'s and a Bank Are Closed

BYLINE: By MICHAEL QUINT

 BODY:
Two savings institutions and one bank in the New York area were closed yesterday, and their depositors face losses if their account balances surpass the $100,000 insurance limit set by the Federal Government.
All three institutions -- Central Federal Savings Bank of Mineola, L.I.; the Broadway Bank and Trust Company of Paterson, N.J., and the Danbury Federal Savings and Loan Association in Connecticut -- were victims of the sharp decline in real estate prices, which led to defaults on loans by developers and other customers. 
 Customers, branches and insured accounts at all three were transferred to healthy banks nearby. Deposits will continue to be insured and customers may use their checks and automatic teller cards until the branches open for business on Monday.
 
Limit on Deposits
 To limit the cost of the failures, Federal regulators arranged for healthy banks to acquire only the deposits insured up to the $100,000 limit.
For multibillion-dollar banks and savings institutions, the practice of Federal officials has been to arrange for the transfer to a healthy bank of all deposits, whether insured or not. Depositors in many smaller banks have been covered only up to the legally required level. Officials of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation and the Resolution Trust Corporation have never said exactly how big a bank must be for all of its deposits to be protected, and they could not be reached late yesterday to explain their decisions on the three New York area banks.
The largest of the failed banks was Central Federal, which had assets of $675.5 million and 12 branches, mostly on Long Island. Chemical Bank paid $3.5 million to acquire about $500 million of insured deposits from about 80,000 accounts and will open Central Federal's branches for business on Monday.
Although Central Federal had been declared insolvent and placed under Government control in December 1990, some customers continued to hold uninsured deposits totaling about $2.8 million. Those customers are expected to lose part of their money, with the amount of the losses depending on how much the Government recovers when it sells Central Federal's loans.
Chemical, which already claims to be the largest bank on Long Island, promised to waive all fees for Central Federal customers through June and to hold unchanged the interest rates paid on existing certificates of deposit and other accounts.
In New Jersey, Broadway Bank and Trust, with $386.4 million in assets, was closed and the Federally insured deposits at its eight branches were transfered to the Hudson United Bank of Union City, which paid the Government $3.4 million. The Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation said that as many as 255 accounts with uninsured deposits of $6.3 million above the $100,000 insurance limit could suffer a loss.
Jeff Connor, the New Jersey Banking Commissioner, said uninsured depositors that had business accounts might be eligible for a loan that could cover the amount of their loss. The loans, which would be the first of their kind, would be issued by Hudson United and guaranteed in part by the New Jersey Economic Development Authority.
 
Reminder of Problems
 In Connecticut, Danbury Federal was closed and its deposits at six branches were transfered to the Bristol Federal Savings Bank. Bristol paid the Government $922,000 for the $115.7 million of deposits, but there are additional deposits of $1 million that are not covered by insurance and not transferred to Bristol.
While none of the three were comparable in size to the Dollar Dry Dock Bank, which was sold to Emigrant Savings Bank earlier this month, or Crossland Savings, which was declared involvent recently and is now owned by the Federal Government, their troubles are a reminder that the problems of local banks are not over.

HEADLINE: U.S. Vehicle Sales Rose 14% in Early March

BYLINE: By DORON P. LEVIN, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: DETROIT, March 13

 BODY:
Sales of North American-made vehicles rose 14 percent in early March, compared with an unusually weak period last year. Although sales remained soft, analysts took heart from auto makers' reports of strong sales to individuals, as opposed to fleet buyers.
Sales of cars rose 9.4 percent, to 142,943, for the March 1-10 period, from 130,640 a year earlier. Sales of light trucks, which include mini-vans and sport-utility vehicles, were 90,183, a 22 percent increase from sales a year earlier of 73,905. Together, sales totaled 233,126, a 14 percent increase from 204,545 in the 1991 period. 
 The seasonally adjusted annual selling rate for domestic cars was 6 million, compared with 5.9 million a year earlier and 5.9 million in late February.
Of the nation's Big Three auto makers, both General Motors and Ford showed sales gains in cars and light trucks. An estimate for the Chrysler Corporation indicated a gain only for light-truck sales and a decline for cars. Chrysler sales must be estimated for the 10-day periods, because the company releases only monthly figures.
 
 
Big Gains in Retail Sales
 "For the past two months there has been a dramatic, underlying change in the mix" of retail and fleet sales, said Wendy Beale Needham, automotive analyst for Smith Barney, Harris Upham in New York. "The domestic auto makers are enjoying double-digit increases in retail sales and declining sales of fleet vehicles." Sales to retail customers are typically much more profitable than those to rental companies and other fleets.
Auto makers do not normally break out fleet sales from other sales. But Joel Pitcoff, a spokesman for the Ford Motor Company, said Ford's sales to individual retail customers were up 28 percent in the period, compared with an overall 5.4 percent increase in the company's car sales.
A day earlier, at a press briefing, Ross Roberts, general manager of the company's Ford division, said, "We've begun hearing positive comments from our dealers in the Northeast United States for the first time in a few years."
Auto makers, dealers and analysts are straining to find positive signs of a turn in the market. Tom Webb, chief economist of the National Automobile Dealers Association, said: "There's no doubt about it, the recovery is real. Trucks and vans are downright hot, and newly restyled lower-priced cars are selling much better."
But Mr. Webb conceded that he based his optimism on the fact that sales were not lower, given the high level of unemployment and weak consumer confidence.
Indeed, the aggregate sales figures were not strong, and some dealers reported that demand was erratic. "We saw a pickup in February, but things have gotten slow again," said Mark Herrmann, a G.M. dealer in Yonkers. Mr. Herrmann theorized that negative economic reports, like news of the rising unemployment rate, had made shoppers more wary about buying cars.
 
 
G.M. Car Sales Up 17.4%
 At the General Motors Corporation, car sales rose 17.4 percent, to 67,804 for the March 1-10 period, and light- truck sales rose 10.9 percent, to 34,294. G.M.'s GMC truck division and all of G.M.'s sales divisions except for Buick reported sales gains. G.M.'s Saturn models also continued to sell briskly.
The 5.4 percent gain at the Ford Motor Company represented sales totaling 40,717; Ford's light-truck sales rose 29.8 percent, to 30,121.
Ward's Automotive Reports, a trade publication, estimated that Chrysler's car sales fell 12.6 percent, to 13,550; Ward's projected that Chrysler's light-truck sales rose 31.1 percent, to 22,550.
At the Toyota Motor Corporation, Bob McCurry, the auto maker's executive vice president of United States sales, said, "I'll need to see a couple of more months of steady improvement before I'm convinced we're breaking out of a recession."
 
 
Toyota Gains 37.3%
 The auto maker posted a 37.3 percent increase in sales of cars built at its three North American plants, selling 6,555, compared with 4,774 a year earlier.
The Honda Motor Company showed a bare increase of three-tenths of 1 percent in car sales, to 9,372. The Nissan Motor Company sold 1,358 domestic cars, down 20.1 percent. The Mitsubishi Motors Corporation sold 1,623 domestic cars, more than double its sales a year ago of 695.
As a group, the Big Three's share of domestic car sales fell to 85.4 percent in early March, from 85.7 percent a year earlier. The Japanese "transplants" -- companies that build cars in North America -- increased their share of domestic car sales to 14.6 percent, from 14.3 percent.
In light trucks, the Big Three dominated with 97 percent of the market, up from 96.5 percent a year earlier. The transplants held a 3 percent share of the light-truck market, down from 3.5 percent a year earlier.

HEADLINE: Senate Approves Tax Plan

BYLINE: By KEITH BRADSHER, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, March 13

 BODY:
In an unexpectedly close vote, the Senate passed election-year tax legislation this evening that President Bush is sure to veto.
The vote was 50 to 47, with four Democrats crossing party lines and three Democrats not voting. All 43 Republicans opposed the measure. 
 During the three days of debate, Democrats and Republicans traded accusations about who bore responsibility for the Federal budget deficit and who was more willing to provide tax breaks for special interests.
 
Two Points of View
 Senator Lloyd Bentsen, the Texas Democrat who heads the Finance Committee and managed the bill on the Senate floor today, said the measure would make the tax code fairer, promote economic growth and avoid enlarging the deficit.
But Bill Bradley, Democrat of New Jersey, took the Senate floor late in the afternoon to announce that he opposed the Democratic bill because it would not reduce the deficit and included "billions of dollars stuffed in the pockets" of real estate, oil and gas interests.
"The truth is that it is too little, too late to jump-start the economy," he said. "It will open up new loopholes that primarily are used by wealthy Americans and corporations."
 
Democratic Opponents
 The Democrats who voted against the bill were Howell Heflin of Alabama, Ernest F. Hollings of South Carolina, Bob Kerrey of Nebraska and Richard C. Shelby of Alabama. Senator Bradley did not vote, explaining that he had an agreement with Donald W. Riegle Jr. of Michigan, a supporter of the bill, who could not be present for the vote. And Tom Harkin of Iowa was absent.
Mr. Bradley was one of the main architects of the tax legislation in 1986 that eliminated or reduced many of tax breaks geared to specific industries, some of which would be reinstated in the new bill.
Among its provisions, the Senate bill would increase the income tax rate to 36 percent from 31 percent for single people earning more than $150,000 and couples earning more than $175,000. The tax rate on income exceeding $1 million would be 39.6 percent.
The extra revenues would be used to provide a $300 tax credit for children, restore the deductibility of contributions to individual retirement accounts for all taxpayers and provide $7 billion in tax breaks for home buyers and the real estate industry.
Republican and Democratic senators had introduced several amendments to spend more on reducing the deficit or expanding public works projects, all of which quickly failed. On Thursday, several Democrats nearly succeeded in tearing out the centerpiece of the Democratic bill, the tax credit for children, and replacing it with a reduction in the deficit and more public works.
The attention paid to the deficit, said Senator Joseph R. Biden Jr., Democrat of Delaware, came partly as a response to rumblings among some Democrats that tax increases for the affluent would be used to provide tax cuts for the middle class instead of reducing the deficit. But, he said, "it's a rumble instead of a revolt."
Indeed, with few exceptions, Democrats maintained that their plan would make the tax code fairer.
 
'Tax Fairness Is a Mirage'
 Republicans, meanwhile, argued that higher taxes for some groups would worsen the budget deficit by encouraging more Federal spending.
"Tax fairness is a mirage that disguises tax increases," said Senator John McCain, Republican of Arizona.
Passage of the bill clears the way for a conference of House and Senate leaders, perhaps beginning on Wednesday, to eliminate the many differences between the measures. The leaders of both chambers then hope to gain passage of the conference's bill by next Friday, the deadline set by President Bush in his State of the Union address.
Mr. Bush has threatened to veto any legislation that includes tax increases, which appear in both bills. Today, in a speech to the Economic Club of Detroit, President Bush again promoted his own package, especially cuts in the capital gains tax rate, and acceleration of depreciation allowances.
"I will veto job-destroying tax increases and fight for job-creating incentives," Mr. Bush said, calling the Congressional tax measure "a $90 billion tax increase."
Although the President's March 20 deadline has no legal force, Democratic leaders in the Congress have raced to meet it to avoid accusations of inaction.
Along the way, the Senate took up a long series of amendments, passing several and voting down the rest.
New York's two Senators, Alfonse M. D'Amato and Daniel Patrick Moynihan, sparred repeatedly, with Mr. D'Amato, a Republican, introducing two amendments on welfare policies that passed on voice votes. One amendment would withhold some Federal money, now spent on poor families with children, from states that do not require work of adult welfare recipients without dependents. The other amendment would allow states to limit welfare benefits for people who have just moved from other states.
Mr. Moynihan, a Democrat, said that requiring welfare recipients to work was impractical unless the Federal Government also provided $5 billion over five years to create jobs for them.
Also passed on a voice vote was an amendment by Senator Dennis DeConcini, Democrat of Arizona, to allow people who have been unemployed for 12 or more weeks to withdraw money from I.R.A.'s without tax penalties.
 
Bentsen's Late Amendment
 Senator Bentsen rushed one amendment into the bill during the final minutes of debate, without providing any public indication of its content or allowing any discussion. The amendment authorizes $10 million to establish a center in Texas to "promote better trade and economic relations among the nations of Western Hemisphere."
A proposal by Mr. McCain to require a 60-vote majority to raise taxes but only a 51-vote majority to lower them prompted an especially lengthy and vigorous debate.
Senator Robert C. Byrd, the West Virginia Democrat who heads the Appropriations Committee, suggested that it was "demagogic" to favor a reversal of the current rules, which require a 60-vote majority to lower taxes but only a 51-vote majority to raise them.
"If low taxes are good, then no taxes are best of all, according to the logic of the distinguished gentleman from Arizona," he said.
Mr. McCain's amendment was put aside after only 35 Republicans and 2 Democrats voted to set aside a rule barring consideration of such a change. Sixty votes were needed.
The Senate also defeated several Republican amendments this evening that would have replaced the Democrats' tax increases with spending cuts or freezes, or would have helped Midwestern farmers. Each of the bills fell on procedural grounds.
Prominent differences between the House and Senate bills include the House's decision to give a tax credit on Social Security and Medicare while the Senate would give a tax credit for children. President Bush had proposed that a middle-class tax cut take the form of an increase in the personal exemption for children.
The Senate bill also calls for linking to income levels the capital gains tax due on profits from the sale of houses and other assets that have appreciated in value since their purchase. Middle-class taxpayers would pay a capital gains tax rate as low as 5 percent under the bill while wealthy taxpayers would continue to pay the current top rate of 28 percent.
The House bill called for taxing only gains after inflation, while Mr. Bush advocated a reduction in the capital gains tax to 15.4 percent.

HEADLINE: Producer Prices Rise 0.2%, Easing Inflation Concerns

BYLINE: AP

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, March 13

 BODY:
Prices received by producers in February edged up a modest two-tenths of 1 percent as another decline in energy prices helped to offset the biggest surge in food costs in two years, the Government said today.
The Labor Department said the small gain in its Producer Price Index for Finished Goods, which measures inflation just before goods reach the retail level, followed two consecutive monthly declines, three-tenths of 1 percent in January and one-tenth in December. 
 Analysts said heavy rains and flooding in California and Texas pushed up food prices, but they contended there was no indication the underlying inflation rate would rise out of control even as the economy exhibits new signs of life.
A second report today from the Commerce Department said businesses lowered inventories for the first time in five months. Analysts said the inventory reduction, coupled with a report earlier this week of strong improvements in retail sales in January and February, could bring increased production and a growing economy in the months ahead.
"At this point, these are the types of economic conditions you want to have," said Donald Ratajczak, director of economic forecasting at Georgia State University. "The recovery is probably very near if not already here, and there is no inflation."
The wholesale price report was welcomed by the stock market today, where the Dow Jones industrial average rose 27.28 points, to 3,235.91.
But while there was no immediate concern about revived inflation, some analysts expressed uneasiness about price increases at the intermediate and crude stages of production. Intermediate goods climbed five-tenths of 1 percent, while raw commodities jumped 1.7 percent, both after two months of decline. These were consistent with the other recent reports suggesting a step-up in the pace of the economy
 
Food Prices Surge

 In a development likely to be reflected quickly at grocery stores, wholesale food costs soared 1.1 percent in February. Food prices had fallen in eight of the last nine months. The February jump was led by a 26 percent increase in the price of vegetables.
Outside the volatile food and energy categories, wholesale prices rose a tiny one-tenth of 1 percent in February, the best performance since June.
Even with February's overall price increase of two-tenths of 1 percent, the biggest since a similar gain in October, inflation at the producer level was still declining at an annual rate of five-tenths of 1 percent for the first two months of this year as a weak economy restrained prices.
 
Outlook on Inflation
 And even if a sustained economic recovery does get under way this year, analysts are not looking for inflation to worsen. Many are forecasting that wholesale prices will climb about 2 percent for the whole year while consumer prices will rise 3 percent. Such a development, coupled with similarly good results last year, would give the country the best two-year performance on inflation since the mid 1960's.
The reason for the optimism of many economists about inflation is their view that the recovery from the recession will, at least initially, be one of the weakest on record.
"The prolonged weakness that the country is going through has created excess capacity, which will persist, and that will mean that both wages and production costs will remain under downward pressure for some time," said Robert Dederick, chief economist at the Northern Trust Company in Chicago.
In the February report, energy prices edged down for a third straight month, falling one-tenth of 1 percent. But that decline was far smaller than the 2.8 percent drop in January or the 1.4 percent December decrease.
 
Energy Prices Jump
 Gasoline and home heating oil costs actually were up last month, rising by 1.9 percent and 16.2 percent respectively, but those gains were offset, on a weighted basis, by 1 percent drops for both electricity and natural gas prices.
In foods, the overall 1.1 percent increase was the largest since a 1.8 percent surge in January 1990.
In addition to the huge jump in vegetable prices, which analysts attributed to short supplies at the end of winter, egg prices rose 2.6 percent, beef prices were up 3.4 percent and pork prices rose 2.9 percent.
Prices of passenger cars, alcoholic beverages and soap all fell last month, helping to offset increases for magazines and prescription drugs.
The various changes left the Producer Price Index, before adjusting for seasonal variations, at 121.9 in February, compared with 121.4 a year ago. That means goods costing $121.40 in February 1991 would have cost $121.90 last month.

HEADLINE: As Economy Goes Bust, Barter Is Booming

BYLINE: By JON NORDHEIMER, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: BRADLEY BEACH, N.J., March 11

 BODY:
When Chris Hansen inspected the shoals of fresh fish laid out on crushed ice in the S & S Seafood store the other day and decided to buy $19 worth of yellowtail flounder fillets and glistening sea scallops, he was completing an exercise older than the Babylonian marketplace and as new as today's unemployment figures.
Just 90 minutes earlier Mr. Hansen, who owns an office-machines supply store in nearby Neptune, had sold $100 worth of computer paper and printer ribbon cartridges to Jeff Shields, owner of a brake and muffler shop farther down the New Jersey coast at Point Pleasant. 
 In both transactions, the purchases were paid for with a scrip issued by a barter exchange network that Mr. Hansen, Mr. Shields and the seafood store operator, "Captain" Sid Sobel, belong to, along with some 180 other business, professional and trades people in the south-central part of the state.
Across the nation, industry sources estimate, nearly one-quarter million people have joined some 400 barter exchanges to expand business opportunities and, increasingly, keep the credit wolf away from the door.
 
A Way to Move Inventory
 Paul E. Suplizio, director of the International Reciprocal Trade Association, a Washington group representing the industry, said barter trades now were worth $6 billion a year. He said the industry grew at an average annual rate of 8 percent for much of the 1980's, then spurted to 12 percent in 1990 and 1991 as the economy turned down.
Lois Dale, owner of Barter Advantage in Manhattan, which brings New Yorkers together to swap goods and services, has also noticed the effect of the economy.
"In this recession people are looking for another way of doing business, and joining a barter exchange is helping them preserve cash flow," she said.
And Ray Bastarache, owner of Barter Network Inc. of Milford, Conn., said, "Barter is a great tool to move excess inventory at a time when credit is drying up and consumer confidence is low."
While the concept of barter -- exchanging goods and services of like value -- predates the 28-century-old use of cash, the modern model resembles the old one as much as a $1,000 Halston suit resembles a pair of bib overalls.
The new method does not merely match individuals who have something to swap with each other. Rather, members join an exchange, for fees up to $500, and provide goods or services at full value to any member requesting them, earning credits in the form of scrip or trade checks instead of dollars. These, in turn, can be spent with any of the other participating members. An exchange broker serves as a clearinghouse manager and bookkeeper for the members for a commission that averages about 5 percent per transaction.
 
'Not Exactly Monopoly Money'
 "I've developed a lot of business through barter I wouldn't normally get," said Mr. Shields, the brake and muffler man. "People drive their cars here from all over New Jersey to use their credits. One member was in Florida, and he called me up to do his parents' car."
He said he earned $18,000 in barter credits last year and spent them all, mostly on items for his business, which can be written off as a tax deduction, but also for a new satellite dish, driveway and roof for his home.
"It's not exactly Monopoly money you're playing with," he said, "but I've bought all kinds of unexpected things with credits for work I never expected to get."
Members of the New Jersey network can, if they choose, hire a lawyer, have a wedding catered, order baskets of flowers or holiday gifts, get their driveways paved, their hair cut, their air-conditioners repaired, their carpets replaced, or rent video movies -- all without cash changing hands.
Cash is a word that Chris Christiansen, the broker for the New Jersey exchange, reacts to the way an an environmentalist would reflect on the vanishing rain forest.
"Money is drying up and if my membership had to pay cash out of their pockets for the things they want, they'd have to go without them in this credit crunch," said Mr. Christiansen, 46 years old.
 
A National Network
 His barter exchange, Itex of New Jersey, operates out of his home in the Jersey Shore community of South Belmar. Members pay under $200 to join.
The New Jersey exchange is a unit of the Itex Corporation of Portland, Ore., a national network that operates 63 broker offices across the United States. Twenty-two were added in the past eight months. Mr. Christiansen, who joined Itex seven years ago in Denver, was dispatched to New Jersey in 1989 to take over an ailing exchange run by an independent broker.
"When I got here, the economy was booming and there was no incentive to join a barter network," said Mr. Christiansen. "Things were so good, businessmen and professionals I contacted said they were turning away cash business and had no time to hear me talk about the advantages of barter. It took me a year and a half to sign up my first electrician."
Then the recession hit and soon the same business people were pursuing Mr. Christiansen, and they continue to do so. "I have to turn some of them down," he said. "There's only so many dentists and advertising specialists my other clients in the network can use."
 
A Question of Image
 Along with the increasing popularity of modern barter exchanges came an image, not altogether undeserved, that they were a dodge for those trying to avoid income or sales taxes.
The 1982 Tax Equity and Fiscal Responsibility Act conferred new respectability on barter. Under the act, Mr. Suplizio, of the industry association, said, exchanges must report members' names and transactions -- with $1 in trade value reported as $1 in cash value -- to the Internal Revenue Service, just as stockbrokers report their transactions.
In most cases, state and local sales tax on barters and tips are paid in cash.
Most members of exchanges do less than 10 percent of their gross sales in barter, said Bob Meyer, owner and editor of Barter News, an industry quarterly published in Mission Viejo, Calif. He said that figure represented business that probably would not have existed otherwise.
Since expenses like wages and utilities are fixed, and the retail price is not discounted, a $100 "sale" to a barter member may actually represent only $30 in real costs to the provider. But the $100 credit buys $100 worth of goods of services in return, whether it be flounder or computer paper.
"What the recession has done is open up the mind of the small businessman to another way of doing business," said Mr. Meyer.
"The big question is if, after the recession, they're going to find it as exciting an opportunity as they do now."
 
Astrology and Awnings
 In Connecticut, Mr. Bastarache runs one of the largest independent barter exchanges in the country, with 2,200 members, and boasts that he can arrange trades for weddings, births and divorces that do not involve a cent in cash.
His Rolodex also contains the names of a private investigator, an astrologer and a publisher of children's books.
Mr. Christiansen in New Jersey is constantly on the prowl for new clients with services that complement ones already aboard. This week he is searching for an awning supplier and a bicycle repair and rental shop and rejecting queries from builders, beauty parlors and dentists. ("Dentistry is a depressed industry since people feel they can postpone work on their teeth in bad times," he observed.)
More than anything, he said, he hated purging members for infractions like giving other members shoddy service for their trade dollar or overcharging them.
Not so painful was giving the boot to a beauty parlor that on slow afternoons provided male exchange members with services even older than barter economics.
"It took me the longest time to figure out why these guys were getting two $50 haircuts a week," Mr. Christiansen said.

HEADLINE: Senators Compromise on Aid for Israel

BYLINE: By THOMAS L. FRIEDMAN, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, March 13

 BODY:
Two Senators overseeing the foreign aid bill have reached a compromise on $10 billion in loan guarantees sought by Israel that would immediately grant $1 billion in guarantees and leave the rest subject to restrictions set by the President on building new settlements in the occupied territories.
Congressional and Administration officials said today that President Bush and Secretary of State James A. Baker 3d were considering the draft compromise by Sen. Patrick J. Leahy, Democrat of Vermont, and Sen. Robert W. Kasten Jr., Republican of Wisconsin, who are respectively the chairman and ranking minority member of the foreign operations subcommittee. 
 Mr. Baker met today with the national security adviser, Brent Scowcroft, to discuss the Administration's response.
 
Talks Still Under Way
 According to a senior Administration official, there is still a "significant difference" between the compromise and what the Bush Administration is seeking. The Administration has insisted on either a total freeze on new Israeli settlements in return for the full $10 billion in loan guarantees, or a partial freeze in exchange for a lesser amount of guarantees. It is not clear whether the Administration policy is simply a bargaining position or a firm stance.
The official emphasized that the negotiations were still under way, and various proposals are still being considered the White House.
Israeli officials, who are closely following the legislation, say they are waiting to see the final details of the proposal, and the Administration's response, before their Government reacts. The American-Israel Public Affairs Committee, a pro-Israeli lobby, has been encouraging a compromise.
According to Congressional and Administration officials, the draft includes:
*Authorization of $2 billion in loan guarantees for Israel for each of the next five years.
*Disbursement of the first $1 billion in guarantees within 30 days of passage of the legislation. Out of that first $1 billion, $150 million would be deducted as the prorated amount Israel is expected to spend, between the date of enactment of the legislation and the end of the fiscal year, Sept. 30, on new settlement construction in the West Bank and the Gaza Strip.
This is known in the legislation as the "Leahy deduction," because the Vermont Senator insisted that from each year's gross amount of loan guarantees a sum must be deducted equivalent to what Israel has spent building new settlements. This is to insure that the United States is not directly or indirectly financing such building. The first $1 billion, minus the deduction, would go through immediately and not require Israel to accede to the total freeze in settlements that the President has demanded.
*Disbursement of the second $1 billion in guarantees for 1992, as well as subsequent disbursements of $2 billion a year, could be held up if the President deems the level of settlement building activity "inappropriate."
This language in the draft legislation has been inserted to give the President authorization from Congress to link disbursement of the guarantees to restrictions on the building of settlements.
*Israel would be allowed some "natural growth" in the West Bank and Gaza Strip, even under a total freeze. This means that roads could be built and wells dug -- provided that they are for the general use of both Arabs and Jews.
 
Some Exemptions Allowed
 There are two other building exemptions in the draft. Israel would be allowed to build a certain amount of "security related infrastructure," as well as "scattered dwellings built to accommodate expanded families of those persons living in the territories."
This latter exemption means that a limited number of Israeli families already living in the territories would be allowed to expand their own homes, or build on already developed land, additions to accommodate growing families. This exemption in particular will probably be problematic for the Administration.
With American loan guarantees, Israel could go to private banks and Wall Street and raise the $10 billion at lower than normal interest rates. Israel alone would be responsible for paying back all of the money. The United States Government would have to set aside, however, several hundred million dollars in case of an Israeli default.
Israel has offered to pay that amount, which is fixed by the Office of Management and Budget, provided that it is reasonable. Israel would pay that reserve from the annual $3 billion in economic and military aid it receives from the United States.

HEADLINE: THE 1992 CAMPAIGN: The Challenger;
Buchanan Sees Foreign Influence in Bush's Camp

BYLINE: By STEVEN A. HOLMES, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: DEARBORN, Mich., March 13

 BODY:
As he scratches for votes in Illinois and Michigan, Patrick J. Buchanan is banking on a two elements -- anger and ethnic groups -- to propel his campaign back into political relevancy.
He is playing to anger about Japan's increasingly dominant automotive industry with a commercial that reveals links between some Bush campaign advisers and Japanese lobbying efforts in this country. 
 In the last two days, the challenger, who has so far brushed off suggestions that he bow out, has also continued to hammer the Bush Administration over its economic policies and the President's reneging on his 1988 campaign pledge not to raise taxes.
In Michigan, where the problems of the auto industry have unleashed a wave of economic xenophobia, Mr. Buchanan unleashed the new commercial charging that two advisers to the President and the chairman of the Republican National Committee have been paid agents of foreign interests, including a Japanese trade association.
"Mr. Bush's campaign is virtually a wholly owned subsidiary of Japan Inc.," Mr. Buchanan said at a press conference here. "He has got too many advisers around him or close to him who have interests or linkages to foreign interests and are arguing for these interests, rather than objectively for what is best for the United States."
The commercial asserts that Charles R. Black Jr., a senior adviser to the Bush campaign, was paid $45,000 in 1986 to represent Eitaro Itoyama, a member of the Japanese Parliament.
The commercial also says that James J. Lake, a senior adviser on issues to the campaign, was a lobbyist for the Japan Auto Parts Industry Association. It further says that Richard N. Bond, chairman of the Republican National Committee, was paid $10,000 a month as a lobbyist for the government of Eric Arturo Delvalle, who was President of Panama from 1985 to 1988 when he was deposed by General Manuel Antonio Noriega.
The Bush campaign has acknowledged that the commercial's assertions about the three men are accurate.
While his commercials hack away at the President in Michigan, Mr. Buchanan is using what little time he spends in Illinois to court the ethnic vote, especially Ukranians, Lithuanians and Croatians. Mr. Buchanan reminds these voters that he has championed a number of their causes, like independence for Ukraine, Slovenia and Croatia.
"Mr. Bush could send an army half way around the world -- 500,000 men -- to rescue Kuwait, a little country with an Emir with whom we had no historic ties," Mr. Buchanan told an enthusiastic rally at the Croatian Cultural Center in Chicago Thursday night.
But Mr. Buchanan has been thrown on the defensive by Mr. Bush's latest commercial pointing out that the Republican challenger owns a Mercedes-Benz. At a news conference today, Mr. Buchanan said that the advertisement was factually accurate but refuted its assertion that he called all American cars "lemons." But he admitted that he considered the three Cadillacs that he owned during the 1970's and early 1980's to be of poor quality.

HEADLINE: THE HOUSE BANK;
Lawmakers Brace for Storm on Checks

BYLINE: By CLIFFORD KRAUSS, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, March 13

 BODY:
Dispirited and fearful after voting early this morning to bare the tainted banking records of 355 members and former members of the House of Representatives, the chamber's lawmakers prepared today to place their political fate in the hands of constituents, and hoped for the best.
After a long night of anguished debate and emotional votes, party leaders jockeyed to defend members who had overdrawn their accounts at the House Bank, or to strike the wounded. Lawmakers and members of their staffs said they were rifling through their records to figure out whether they had overdrawn and, if so, by how much. 
 House Democratic leaders caucused to discuss ways to change the discredited House administrative apparatus, but they came up far short of proposals by some in the party to scrap the patronage system and bring in professionals.
Instead, they amended their party's rules to place more control of the House administration in the hands of the House Speaker, Thomas S. Foley of Washington, who even many Democrats complained had been slow to react to the affair in the first place. This was a tentative first step to change what both Republicans and Democrats agreed was an antiquated management system that had set few guidelines to keep members out of trouble.
Many members flew home to confess that they had overdrawn their accounts, but few of them appeared to be among the worst offenders: those who consistently overdrew by $5,000 or more.
A resolution approved Thursday night by a vote of 391 to 36 gives the 24 worst offenders -- 19 current and 5 former members -- 10 days to appeal their cases to the House ethics committee before their names are made public.
All the hundreds of other members who wrote even one bad check will be listed within three weeks, and many must now brace for last-minute primary election challenges from politicians trying to ride the rising wave of anti-incumbency.
Compounding the lawmakers' problem is the difficulty they are having figuring out how embarrassed they should be. Because the bank did not send lawmakers overdraft notices, and because it did not note the overdrafts on their regular bank statements, members are now forced to search for red marks on their canceled checks to know which were overdrawn.
 
How Not to Run a Bank
 "I'm on the list somewhere -- I don't know where," said Representative Dan Glickman, a Kansas Democrat who is now sponsoring legislation to appoint a nonpartisan professional House administrator. "We all worry about it. I'm thinking of setting up my own bank now. I've learned a lot about how not to operate one."
The range in Mr. Glickman's tone, from concern to jocularity, reflected much of the confusion that now hovers over a town where politics is a science. Fearful as many lawmakers were about the consequences of the bank affair, leaders as well as backbenchers conceded that it was hard to know whether it would turn out to be a passing storm or instead lead to a voter rebellion against the Democratic-controlled Congress in November.
Representative Gerry Sikorski, a Democrat, went home to his district near Minneapolis and apologized for 671 overdrafts. "All we can do," he said, "is go around and tell it to people and be as open as we can." He added, "We should have known better."
About 60 House members had already acknowledged in recent months that they had written checks against insufficient funds. Dozens more have joined them in the last couple of days.
House Republicans, spurred by a group of freshmen known as the Gang of Seven, want to push the House ethics panel, the Committee on Standards of Official Conduct, to extend its earlier investigation and look into whether any of those who overdrew their accounts used the money to finance their campaigns. At the very least, the Republicans say, such check writers should be punished for not filing amendments to their financial statements disclosing what were in effect interest-free loans.
"As painful as last night's debate and votes were," said Representative Frank Riggs of California, one of the seven junior insurgents, "it was only the first phase of a two-phased healing process, a complete Congressional catharsis."
The perceived need for reform will undoubtedly be reinforced by the disclosure today that Jack Russ, the House sergeant-at-arms, who was in charge of the bank and unexpectedly resigned on Thursday night, had told friends that Mr. Foley had promised him an interim job to insure that he did not lose his pension.
But some conservative commentators worried that the affair could feed anti-Washington sentiment that has weakened President Bush, a prospect that is driving some Democrats to suggest that they ought to call on the President, Vice President Dan Quayle and former House members who are now in the Cabinet to disclose their old House Bank records.
The conventional wisdom is that the Republicans stand to gain the most from the affair because 60 percent of the House members are Democrats and the House Bank was managed by officials chosen by the Democratic caucus.
Among the first to publicly acknowledge a problem was Representative Duncan Hunter of California, the chairman of the House Republican Research Committee, who admitted that he had overdrawn his account on more than 160 occasions.
About 1 o'clock this morning, just before the final rounds of voting, the House witnessed one of the harshest attacks on the floor in recent history. The speaker was Representative Newt Gingrich of Georgia, the Republican whip, who said the Democrats had tried to cover up the affair.
He suggested, without offering proof, that Mr. Russ's interim replacement, Werner W. Brandt, "may have been involved in actions stopping Capitol police from investigating cocaine selling in the post office."
"Tonight," said Mr. Gingrich, whose emotions seemed to be fueled by the hisses of Democratic members, "we have a post office cocaine-selling scandal, a House banking scandal, and other scandals are coming -- and those who are responsible hiss."
After Mr. Gingrich's speech, the House voted unanimously to list all members who had overdrawn their accounts, as well as the number of overdrafts by each.
It then voted in favor of a proposal to disclose even more: the amounts overdrawn and the length of time overdrawn. But members of the ethics committee argued that this added information would take months to compile and would therefore probably be disclosed just before Election Day this November. The House then reversed itself on this latter proposal.
The affair reverberated across the nation. The Atlanta Constitution, for instance, published an article at the top of its front page under a headline that said, "Check flap hits more Georgia reps," in which local lawmakers made "damaging admissions." One, Representative Charles Hatcher, a Democrat, said he had overdrawn his account 780 times over 39 months.
Democratic leaders tried to make the best of a bad situation by changing granting Speaker Foley sole authority to nominate administrative officers of the House, a power now reserved for the entire Democratic caucus.
Mr. Foley said today that he hoped Congress could soon return to its work to improve the economy and health care. He predicted that "you won't see many" House members defeated in November because of the bank affair.

HEADLINE: THE 1992 CAMPAIGN: Debate;
Candidates Battle for Right to Call Themselves Friend of Middle Class

BYLINE: GWEN IFILL, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: CHICAGO, Mar. 13

 BODY:
Gov. Bill Clinton of Arkansas tonight accused Paul E. Tsongas of trying to "pound these middle-class and lower middle-class people into the dirt" by suggesting that some Medicare benefits could be limited in the future and that a middle-income tax cut was unnecessary.
In an hourlong debate broadcast by the local CBS affiliates here and in Detroit tonight, the Presidential Democratic candidates brought their attack advertising strategies to live television, but in an exchange that often descended into mere squabbling rather than confrontation. 
 "Imagine when there were six of us," Mr. Tsongas observed at one point.
For Mr. Tsongas and Edmund G. Brown Jr., the former Governor of California, the task was to tar Mr. Clinton, who enjoys advantages in organization and money-raising that were only enhanced by a string of Southern victories earlier this week in which he amassed more than 500 convention delegates in a single night.
 
Tsongas Attacks Clinton
 For Mr. Clinton, the strategy was to cast himself as the only true friend of the working class, an assertion Mr. Tsongas sought to tear down by saying that Mr. Clinton has made too many promises and provided too few practical ways to pay for it.
The former Massachusetts Senator said that Mr. Clinton's record as Governor of Arkansas proved that he had only raised taxes and been unable to improve the lot of citizens in his home state during the 11 years he had served as its chief executive.
"In terms of the taxes in Arkansas, the taxes that were raised were on gasoline, mobile homes, groceries," Mr. Tsongas said. "So the argument that we're protecting the poor doesn't wash."
 
Brown Touts Tax Proposal
 He called Mr. Clinton's proposal to reduce taxes for the middle class the Democrat Party's "own version of voodoo economics."
"At some point there has to be discipline in this system so we bring down the deficit," Mr. Tsongas said.
For his part, Mr. Brown said his proposal for a 13 percent flat tax would simplify the tax code and eliminate what he called the "banquet feast of corruption" that grows out of complicated tax laws.
"You can give people training and targeted investments to business and all the education you want until the cows come home," Mr. Brown said. Working people, he said, need power.
Mr. Tsongas also questioned Mr. Clinton's position on the Persian Gulf war. Mr. Clinton has said he supported the use of force against Iraq, but he has also said that he favored keeping sanctions in place longer.
The candidates competed for the right to name themselves the friend of the working class in a debate that was televised in two states that have borne much of the brunt of declining job growth in manufacturing industries.
But they also lost little opportunity to repeat their criticisms of each other at every turn by taking charge of a debate format that was designed to allow them to question each other. Mr. Clinton, for instance, asked Mr. Brown at one point if he felt a nickel-a-gallon gasoline tax that Mr. Tsongas has proposed would be the best way to end dependence on foreign oil.
"Who is that question for?" Mr. Tsongas interjected sardonically.
Mr. Tsongas took his veiled swipes as well, on one occasion saying that he is running for President for a "purpose," not for "ambition," as he has criticized Mr. Clinton for in the past.

HEADLINE: THE HOUSE BANK;
Of Checks and Balances And the Angry Voters

BYLINE: By TIMOTHY EGAN, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: SEATTLE, March 13

 BODY:
Checkbook in hand, JoAnne Squibb rushed to the bank this morning, determined to cover an account that sometimes falls out of balance. She had been reminded of her own precarious financial situation by the morning news, which was full of talk about how nearly 75 percent of the representatives in Congress had overdrawn checks in the House bank.
The more she thought about it, waiting in line at the bank, the angrier she got. "If those people in Congress can't manage their own personal money, how are they supposed to manage ours?" Ms. Squibb, a Seattle hotel worker, asked. 
 Attacking Congress is a sport as old as American democracy. But the check-kiting scandal, and disclosures that are bound to follow the decision to identify all members who had checking overdrafts in the House banking system, is expected to bring a bruising new intensity to a national pastime.
Signaling the dawn of a new political reality this election year, Representative Fred Grandy, Republican of Iowa, said on Thursday, "As of today, your talk show hosts have a topic, your opponents have an issue and your constituents have a reason to support term limits."
 
A Lack of Trust
 Even people professing to care not a whit about politics were talking today in the home state of the House Speaker, Thomas S. Foley, about the furor in the other Washington.
"I don't have a lot of trust in politicians and this just reinforces my view," said Tom Watson, sipping coffee this morning in downtown Seattle.
Asked whether the radio talk programs, which have helped whip up public anger about Congressional raises as well as the overdrawn checks, were making too much of the recent controversy, Mr. Watson said, "I think they should make a big deal out of it because it has to do with the integrity of the individual."
Mr. Foley, who put his own prestige and that of Congress on the line when he campaigned against term limits in this state last fall -- he was credited with helping to sway the electorate against the measure -- has long been held in high regard in his home state. But the check-overdraft problems have changed some views of him. Mr. Foley has admitted, along with other Congressional leaders, that he had at least one overdraft.
"The fact that he bounced checks has changed my mind about him," Patrick Momany, who owns a small tool-cutting manufacturing company, said of Mr. Foley. "I think we should fire all those guys!"
The explanations from some Congress members brought reactions from laughter to anger.
"It's hilarious; you had this one guy saying it was O.K. because every time he did it, he gave money to charity," said Mr. Watson, referring to Representative Duncan Hunter, a California Republican. "Actually, I admire some of them because they said, 'I'm guilty. Throw the book at me.' "
The amount of money at issue did not seem to bother many people.
"Look, anybody in public life is an easy target, so I don't want to take a cheap shot," said John Peterson, who sells, and sometimes hurls, salmon from his stall in the Pike Place Market. "But check-bouncing is illegal. I run a retail business. I'm familiar with the vagaries of bouncing checks. It's not the money; it's the level of honor."
His assistant, Ron Akrish, said this was the first he had heard of the check problems in Congress. Expressing wide-eyed astonishment, he asked: "Are you serious? They purposely bounced checks? Congressmen? That's criminal!"
In fact, it is doubtful that what went on in Congress was criminal. Members of Congress, in effect, had free overdraft privileges; they could overdraw their accounts and the House bank would cover the checks, without charge, because the money was available from other members' accounts. But critics say at the very least those who overdrew should have paid interest on the outstanding money, and perhaps should have reported it to the Internal Revenue Service.
This state, which became the focus of the term limits movement last fall when voters turned down a ballot question that would have thrown out the entire Congressional delegation, has had more than its share of news about the lost honor of politicians.
Less than two weeks ago, Senator Brock Adams, a Seattle Democrat, announced he would give up his campaign for re-election after The Seattle Times reported that eight unnamed women had accused him of sexual misconduct over a 15-year period.
Still, it is unclear whether larger national issues like health care or the economy will matter more in November than a politician's poor personal banking history.
"I voted against term limits in November, but this check-bouncing scandal is tempting me to change my view," said James Galvin of Seattle.
"I don't care about sex or checks," said Janet Wainwright, a movie promoter. "I care about whether they are going to deal with the real issues. I've written a few bad checks of my own, and I can think of worse things to do."
It is when people relate their own checking problems to those of the members of Congress that they seem to become most angry.
 
'What Bothers Me'
 "When I've bounced a check, it's been an accident, not deliberate," said Ms. Squibb. "What bothers me is that they did this knowingly."
It does not matter, said many people interviewed here, whether public or private funds were involved.
"It may be their money, but who covers the kite?" said Mr. Galvin. "Where do they get the money for the overdrafts? This is an abuse of a convenience, yes, but it's also a betrayal of the public trust."
Melissa Meier, an illustrator, said: "Indirectly, it's my money they're playing with. After all, who pays Congress? Taxpayers do. I don't get it. If the I.R.S. holds me to responsible finances, and my bank holds me to responsible banking, then my elected Congressman should at least do the same."

"I voted against term limits in November, but this check-bouncing scandal is tempting me to change my view," said James Galvin of Seattle. (Photographs by Therese Frare for The New York Times)

HEADLINE: THE 1992 CAMPAIGN: Republicans;
A Tough-Talking Bush Visits a Hard-Hit State

BYLINE: By ANDREW ROSENTHAL, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: DEARBORN, Mich., March 13

 BODY:
President Bush campaigned across Michigan like a tightrope walker today, balancing expressions of concern for the faltering economy with tough talk about his critics and the recovery that he says is just around the corner.
Sweeping into the state for a five-hour visit, Mr. Bush was at his most partisan in accusing Senator Donald W. Riegle Jr., Democrat of Michigan, of telling a "bald-faced lie" by suggesting that the Bush Administration might have influenced General Motors' decision not to close a Texas automobile plant and close one instead in nearby Willow Run, Mich. 
 He condemned Congress for barely giving his economic recovery program a "glance" and added that he recognized that Michigan was going through "hard times." The President said, "I came here for that very reason, to look you in the eye and tell you what we are going to do to turn this economy around."
 
No Talk of Sacrifice
 As he said this, Mr. Bush was looking at the members of the Economic Club, a pin-striped business group, rather than the automobile workers who have been hardest hit by the faltering economy in Michigan and who have been so assiduously courted by the Democrats who visited here on Thursday.
Mr. Bush paid one visit to a workplace in Michigan in advance of next Tuesday's primary -- a successful hospital-equipment manufacturer in Kalamazoo, where the unemployment rate is well lower than Michigan's overall 9 percent. And he carefully avoided any talk of sacrifice or belt-tightening.
"All we seem to hear on the news is gloom and doom," Mr. Bush told the business group, which received him warmly. "But let's not overlook some of the fundamentals that indicate we are poised, not there yet, but poised for an economic recovery."
Mr. Bush continued bringing some gesture of executive authority to his campaign stops. He told the Economic Club that his Administration would not require auto makers to install gasoline vapor-collecting canisters on new cars and that he would veto any legislation raising fuel-efficiency standards.
And during his visit to the Stryker Corporation, which makes stretchers, beds for intensive-care wards and other medical equipment, he took a gentle, veiled swipe at David A. Kessler, the head of the Food and Drug Administration. Mr. Kessler has angered the medical industry by curtailing the use of silicone breast implants and announcing that he was reviewing the safety records of other medical devices that were put on the market before 1976.
 
Looking Ahead Only
 Using language suggested to the White House by the medical industry, Mr. Bush said: "We've got to get the life-saving drugs and devices to those who need them. Regulation of the healing arts and health technologies have got to respond to patients' needs and must be based on sound science, not on ideological politics or scare tactics."
The President's campaignreflected the careful line he has been forced to tread between the politically necessary recognition that the economy is suffering and his desire to focus the political debate on what he plans to do about it, not on what has happened to American workers during his Administration.
Painting Mr. Bush as the candidate of strength and optimism and his Democratic, and Republican, opponents as the candidates of "gloom and doom" is also a central part of the President's re-election strategy.
So, in his upbeat speech today to the Economic Club, Mr. Bush said, "There's no sense pretending that things are better than they are, but there also is no sense underestimating our strengths and exaggerating our weaknesses."
Mr. Bush's visit here was aimed at keeping Patrick J. Buchanan's showing on Tuesday as low as possible in a state that the Bush campaign fears is ripe for the conservative challenger's message of protest.
The Bush campaign is only just starting to set its sights on Gov. Bill Clinton of Arkansas, the leading Democratic candidate, and Mr. Bush plans to go to Mr. Clinton's home state of Arkansas, the only state he has yet to visit as President, on Tuesday, reportedly to call on Sam M. Walton, the founder of Wal-Mart Stores.
But Samuel K. Skinner, the White House chief of staff, insisted the trip, had "nothing to do with politics."
Mr. Bush's visit to the Stryker plant seemed designed in every way to accentuate the positive.
The President spoke from a stage that had been set up in front of racks on which shipping crates had been arranged as a backdrop -- each of them stamped "export" and some of them bound for Japan.
To bolster his argument that American companies can compete in the international marketplace with aggressive management and that the tougher trade barriers advocated by Mr. Buchanan are not necessary, the President said that Stryker is "the number-one seller of artificial hips in Japan."

HEADLINE: Beliefs

BYLINE: By Peter Steinfels

 BODY:
Numbers alone cannot explain the interest in the turmoil within the Christian Science Church. One peculiarity of the church is its prohibition against giving membership figures, but the estimated total of 150,000 to 170,000 ranks Christian Science below the International Church of the Foursquare Gospel and the Coptic Orthodox Church. There are more Roman Catholics in North Dakota than Christian Scientists in the United States.
But Christian Science is a faith whose current financial and spiritual travails overlap with those of many other religious groups. It is also a native American species, a distinct contribution to the world's religions. It is a belief that at one moment seems respectable almost to the point of colorlessness, and at the next moment seems wildly unconventional, almost to the point of dangerousness. 
 A faith whose "discoverer and founder" is always referred to as "Mrs. Eddy" can never mask its genteel face. No doubt Mary Baker Eddy was at least partly the invalided Victorian author whose occasionally muddled metaphysical prose Mark Twain gleefully satirized. But she was also a rebel against Puritanism, yet one whose relentless pursuit of religious truth and organization of a new church demanded a good deal of Puritan iron.
Struggling to reconcile human suffering with her belief in a loving and sovereign divinity, Mrs. Eddy concluded that the material world of the senses is not God's creation. It is, instead, a tragic misperception blocking access to spiritual reality.
It is not surprising that most of her countrymen found Mrs. Eddy's solution to the problem of evil unconvincing. Unfortunately, they also accused her of sweeping aside the power of sin and disease with the broom of mental suggestion or mere willpower.
In fact, Mrs. Eddy's desire to restore bodily healing to a central place in Christianity, far from a doctrine of childish faith or positive thinking, was only part of a larger call to seek redemption from sinfulness and the illusion of material life through constant prayer and self-renunciation.
Christian Science at its best fosters a life of discipleship that other faiths can immediately recognize. And even believers who strongly reject Mrs. Eddy's basic premise about the ultimate unreality of matter can detect in it the common religious conviction that the world people see and touch is not the sum total of things.
All this would be reason enough to take an interest in the fate of the First Church of Christ, Scientist, in Boston, the world headquarters and Mother Church of Christian Science. Having started a series of expensive television and publishing ventures, the Mother Church now faces a financial crisis and accusations that it has been sacrificing religious integrity for media power.
The question of the red ink in Boston is linked to the much more profound question of how an aging, shrinking church can regain its vitality. That is a question being asked these days by churches many times the size of the Christian Scientists.
To the current Christian Science leadership, which remains in command despite this week's shuffling of posts, huge investments in a Boston television station, a 24-hour cable channel, a nightly news broadcast, an international shortwave system and a slick new monthly magazine were more than up-to-date extensions of The Christian Science Monitor, the church's highly respected newspaper. They were also ways to shake the church from its doldrums and let more people know of Christian Science's concern with the world's problems.
But can a religious body be reinvigorated by new programs and organizational measures?
To some distinguished Christian Scientists, the church's new media empire was the religious equivalent of junk bonds. They objected not only that it was financially imprudent but, more important, that it also was a distraction from a spiritual renewal -- a return in prayer, study and discussion to the sources of their faith in the Bible and Mrs. Eddy's writings.
The leadership and the critics are divided by two other questions that haunt many religious groups. First, is religious renewal likely to be achieved by emphasizing what is distinctive in a tradition, or by emphasizing the broad concerns the tradition shares with all humanity?
Second, does renewal require open discussion and robust self-examination within a religious body? The leadership of the Mother Church has repeatedly declared its devotion to a healthy multiplicity of opinions, even citing that to justify publishing a book that was rejected as heretical in the years before its publication was linked to a $98 million legacy to the church.
A very different impression is given by the honor roll of distinguished and loyal Christian Science editors and thinkers who have felt compelled to leave the Mother Church's employment or who have been forced out. But they, too, have not yet had to confront the fact that a genuine return to the sources of Christian Science may raise uncomfortable questions about Mrs. Eddy's metaphysics and the highly centralized church structure she erected.
This raises a final question: How much assertiveness is required for religious renewal, and how much is incompatible with it? A church whose authority is constantly assailed is not apt to flourish; neither is a church where all criticism must be veiled. Christian Science has tended to shun confrontation, trusting that things will eventually be set right by yielding to Divine Mind.
It is precisely the marketplace assertiveness of the church's new media enterprises that has led Christian Science critics to question their spiritual authenticity. But the critics, too, have had to assert themselves in uncharacteristic ways -- through simultaneous resignations, subterranean communication and statements to the press.
There can never be an exact recipe for religious renewal, but at least some of the ingredients are being tested within the ranks of Christian Science.

HEADLINE: Modest Inflation Report No Help for Bonds

BYLINE: By KENNETH N. GILPIN

 BODY:
A report that showed only a small increase in inflation was ultimately ignored by credit market participants yesterday, as traders sold Treasury securities and interest rates moved higher.
Prices of notes and bonds rose sharply immediately after the Government announced that its Producer Price Index rose by a modest two-tenths of a percent last month, and only one-tenth of a percent when volatile energy and food prices were excluded. 
 But the gains, which amounted to as much as 3/4 point on some securities, could not be sustained, as sellers emerged at the higher price levels. Selling of short- to intermediate-term notes was particularly heavy.
Rather than focus on the good inflation news, memories of strong January and February retail sales figures reported on Thursday continued to linger. And preliminary results of a University of Michigan survey reinforced the notion that economic recovery is under way.
 
Consumer Confidence Up
 The survey, taken at midmonth, showed that consumer attitudes improved significantly during the first half of March, and that expectations about the future were brighter.
"The market is very paranoid about the recovery, and the data this week have moved people away from thinking about a recovery with 1 percent to 2 percent growth to one with 3 to 4 percent growth," one bond trader said.
A number of analysts said those fears were overblown.
"The fact of the matter is that while the outlook has improved, the recovery is by no means firmly established," said Norman Robertson, chief economist at the Mellon National Bank in Pittsburgh.
"The rise in short-term interest rates looks awfully premature. And if every positive development on the economy produces another rise in bond yields, we could have an aborted recovery."
Mr. Robertson and others pointed to car sales during early March, reported yesterday at a lackluster six million units, as one early sign that the vigorous spending pattern exhibited in January and February was not continuing in March.
 
Ignoring the Positives
 Market participants, however, failed to react to the auto sales numbers.
"Pessimism is so extreme that we are ignoring some clear-cut positives," said William V. Sullivan Jr., a senior vice president at Dean Witter Reynolds. By late in the day, the Treasury's 8 percent 30-year bonds of 2021 were offered at a price of 999/32 , down 10/32 , to yield 8.06 percent, compared with 8.03 percent late Thursday and 7.92 percent on March 6.
Early in the session prices of the benchmark bond rose as high as 1009/32.
Among Treasury note issues outstanding, the 7 1/2 percent 10-year notes were offered at 9821/32 , down 21/32 , to yield 7.69 percent. The 6 3/4 percent five-year notes were offered at 9815/32 , down 17/32 , to yield 7.12 percent. And the 5 3/8 percent two-year notes were offered at 995/32down 1/4 point, to yield 5.83 percent.
Rates on short-term Treasury bills moved higher.
Three-month bills were offered at a discount rate of 4.04 percent late yesterday, up three basis points, or three one-hundredths of a percentage point. Six-month bill rates rose by four basis points, to a late offered rate of 4.21 percent. And one-year bill rates rose by eight basis points, to a late rate of 4.54 percent.
Prices of issues outstanding in the investment-grade corporate bond market were dragged down by the slide in Treasury prices. Traders said that prices of most issues fell by 1/4 point to 3/8 point.
In the secondary market for tax-exempt municipal bonds, prices of most widely quoted securities were unchanged to down 1/8 point, according to market participants.

HEADLINE: Reynolds Plans a New Version of Winston

BYLINE: By STUART ELLIOTT

 BODY:
In another effort to revive Winston cigarettes, the R. J. Reynolds Tobacco Company plans an ambitious introduction of a different version of its flagship brand that would be more like Marlboro, which overtook Winston in the 1970's to become America's best-selling cigarette.
Winston Select, as the new version is named, will be available nationally by early May, Peggy Carter, a spokeswoman for Reynolds in Winston-Salem, N.C., said yesterday. It is part of broad efforts by Reynolds, the nation's second-largest tobacco company behind Philip Morris, the maker of Marlboro, to reverse declining sales of its familiar brands. 
 Winston Select will taste different from existing Winston varieties, Ms. Carter said, offering what she described as "a smoother, rich flavor."
 
Appeal to Marlboro Smokers
 Winston's taste, she added, "is not as competitive with Marlboro as we'd like." In tests, Winston Select's taste had "a very high appeal to Marlboro smokers," she said.
Attempting to duplicate the appealing features of successful competitive products is a familiar strategy in consumer marketing. Sprite, for instance, the Coca-Cola Company's version of 7-Up, now outsells its rival.
Emanuel Goldman, a tobacco industry analyst with Paine Webber Inc. in San Francisco, termed the decision by Reynolds to call its Marlboro-type Winston by another name "the smart way to do it."
"If it works, terrific; if not, it hasn't damaged the flagship Winston brand," he said.
 
'Full Flavor' Category
 Winston Select will differ from most other new cigarettes in two significant ways. It will compete in the "full flavor" category, which has been shrinking as consumers switch to low-tar, low-nicotine brands. Yet that category remains important because it includes Marlboro, which outsells Winston, the country's No. 2 brand, by almost 3 to 1.
The other difference is that Winston Select will cost the same as Winston and Marlboro. By contrast, many new brands are priced lower to appeal to recession-squeezed consumers. But premium-priced brands produce more profits; hence, the efforts to enhance them.
In an interesting twist, Winston Select will be introduced by Trone Advertising in Greensboro, N.C., a small agency that Reynolds uses for special projects, rather than by FCB/Leber Katz Partners in New York, the regular Winston agency.
Ms. Carter said Trone would handle Winston Select "for the introductory period, at least," adding that FCB/Leber Katz would continue as Winston's agency of record.
 
Arrival of Joe Camel
 Trone is best known for introducing to American smokers in 1988 the now-controversial Joe Camel cartoon character for Reynolds's Camel cigarettes.
Winston Select is the second effort by Reynolds to jump-start Winston sales in less than a year, following the introduction of new packaging, called Flavor Seal, that is designed to keep cigarettes fresher longer.

Japan's Growth In Savings Falls

BYLINE: By Reuters

DATELINE: TOKYO, March 13

 BODY:
Japan's growth in savings fell to a record low 6.5 percent in 1991, the Government reported today, fueling anxiety that the foundation of the postwar economic boom was eroding.
The Bank of Japan said it was the second consecutive year for a record low savings growth. In 1990, savings grew by 7.7 percent. 
 Fears are now mounting that lower savings will constrain investment needed for future economic growth.
Japan traditionally has had a much higher savings rate -- personal savings as a percentage of disposable income -- than the United States. Its rate now is about 15 percent, compared with the United States, savings rate of 5.3 percent.

HEADLINE: CURRENCY MARKETS;
Dollar Is Narrowly Mixed As Traders Adjust Holdings

BYLINE: By The Associated Press

 BODY:
The dollar was narrowly mixed against other major currencies yesterday as traders shrugged off an upbeat inflation report and spent the session adjusting their holdings before the weekend.
Gold also fell marginally, slipping 70 cents, to $346.70 a troy ounce on the Commodity Exchange in New York. The Republic National Bank later quoted a bid of $346.75, off 35 cents from Thursday. 
 In the currency market, there was little reaction to the Government's report that wholesale prices rose two-tenths of a percent in February.
"Basically the dollar didn't trade today," said Walter Simon, a vice president with Bank Julius Baer & Company.
It is common on a Friday for traders to consolidate their positions as a hedge against any weekend news developments that might move financial markets.
Ronald Holzer, vice president and chief trader at Harris Trust and Company in Chicago, said the foreign exchange markets had been moved by events affecting other currencies rather than sentiment about the dollar.
The British pound has fallen in recent sessions in response to opinion polls indicating the opposition Labor Party might win next month's national elections, Mr. Holzer said.
The pound slipped against the dollar in New York yesterday, dropping to $1.7085 from Thursday's $1.7140. In London, sterling rose to $1.7120 from $1.7085.
The Japanese yen, meanwhile, has fallen amid growing signs of weakness in the Japanese economy and continuing declines in the Tokyo stock market. Yesterday, however, the yen was somewhat higher, strengthened in part by the Government's budget agreement for the 1992 fiscal year, Mr. Simon said.
The dollar fell to 133.625 yen in New York from late Thursday's 134.25. In Tokyo overnight, the dollar fell to 133.5 from 134, and in London it fell to 133.55 yen.
The dollar fell to 1.6685 German marks in New York, from 1.6700 late Thursday. In European trading, the dollar fell to 1.6660 marks from 1.6715.
Other late dollar rates in New York, compared with late Thursday's quotes, included: 1.5100 Swiss francs, unchanged from 1.5100; 5.6660 French francs, down from 5.6710; 1,253.00 Italian lire, up from 1,252.00, and 1.19735 Canadian dollars, up from 1.19675.

Airlines Halt Fare Increase

BYLINE: By Bloomberg Business News

DATELINE: CHICAGO, March 13

 BODY:
A plan to raise air fares 2 percent on excursion tickets Saturday has been rescinded.
American Airlines, Continental Airlines, Northwest Airlines, Delta Air Lines and USAir all said today that they would not go ahead with the increase. United Airlines also reportedly canceled its plan to increase fares but company officials were not available to comment. 
 "It reflects the competitive nature of the industry," Robert Decker, analyst with Duff & Phelps said. "It shows there are a couple of carriers that felt nervous enough about traffic levels that they don't want to rock the boat."
America West and Trans World Airlines, both operating under Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection, refused to increase fares for leisure and vacation travelers, and the other carriers finally canceled their own plans.
United, a unit of the UAL Corporation, originally proposed a 2 percent increase for all fares on March 3, but other airlines didnt want to increase business fares during a period of economic weakness.
The airlines then decided to raise only the excursion fare, delaying the actual date several times before finally deciding not to carry out the plan at all.

HEADLINE: The How-To's of Unemployment Pay

BYLINE: By LEONARD SLOANE

 BODY:
With the nation's unemployment rate now at 7.3 percent, the highest in almost 17 years, tens of thousands of Americans are applying for unemployment compensation for the first time. Many find it an uncomfortable and confusing process.
"One of the unusual characteristics of this recession, particularly in New York, is that it is affecting people who never experienced unemployment," said Samuel M. Ehrenhalt, regional commissioner of the Federal Bureau of Labor Statistics. "Contending with unemployment is a job of its own. It's a whole new learning situation." 
 Vivien Shapiro, programs director of the New Jersey Department of Labor, said more white-collar workers and executives are applying for compensation these days. "It's a very different mix than we've dealt with in the past," she said.
Unemployment compensation is an important safety net. Created by the Federal Government in 1935 to partly replace wages during involuntary unemployment, it is administered by the states. And each state has different regulations and procedures.
 
Don't Waste Time
 To find out where to file, look in your phone directory for unemployment insurance services, usually listed in the state government section.
The process for filing is essentially the same from state to state. Here's how it works in New York.
"Take the time to file as soon as possible when you lose a job," said Helen K. Cleary, an official of the State Labor Department. "A person who quits cannot generally collect unemployment insurance, but if you quit for a good cause -- like following a spouse to another state or caring for a seriously ill child -- you still may collect."
In New York, you must have worked for 20 of the last 52 weeks and earned at least $80 a week to be entitled to compensation. You must also be ready and willing to work and actively looking for a job.
More than half of all people applying for compensation make only one trip to an unemployment insurance office, state officials say, with other matters handled through the mail.
For this visit, bring your Social Security card, another form of identification, the address of your most recent employer and as many pay stubs as possible from the past year. Expect to spend about two hours at the unemployment office, state officials say. You will not be asked to return unless you cannot provide the necessary information the first time.
After you file, the state will contact your previous employer for information about why you left the job. Since a company's payroll tax is based in part on its past unemployment record, there is sometimes a discrepancy between the statements given by an employee and an employer. In that case, the Labor Department makes a decision about granting compensation, which can be appealed by either party.
After a waiting period of a week, compensation is paid for each week that you are unemployed and seeking work. The amount is about half of your average weekly salary for the past year, with a minimum of $40 and a maximum of $300. Once you get the first payment, you can qualify for future payments by signing and mailing a benefit payment form, known as a coupon, every two weeks.
"Payments vary considerably by state," said Robert Dederick, chief economist of the Northern Trust Company in Chicago. "But in no state is it large in any meaningful way." The national average weekly benefit is $169; the New York average is $179.
For the second time in three months, Congress in February approved giving additional weeks of benefits to the long-term unemployed. In states with the highest unemployment rates, the maximum number of weeks for benefits is now 59. In states with lower rates, the maximum is 52 weeks.
 
 
WHO PAYS? EMPLOYERS
 Who pays for unemployment compensation? The overwhelming bulk of the financing comes from Federal and state payroll taxes on employers.
The Federal tax on employers is 6.2 percent of the first $7,000 of each worker's wage, offset by a credit that reduces the effective tax to eight-tenths of 1 percent, or a maximum of $56 per worker per year.
State tax rates vary. For example, employers in New Jersey pay a tax ranging from four-tenths of 1 percent to 5.4 percent of the first $15,300 in earnings.
In only two states -- New Jersey and Alaska -- is a state tax also levied on workers to help finance unemployment insurance payments. In New Jersey, workers pay five-eighths of 1 percent of the first $15,300 in earnings.

HEADLINE: Are Your Income Tax Deductions Typical? It May Not Matter

BYLINE: By JAN ROSEN

 BODY:
Taxpayers often want to know whether the itemized deductions on their returns look reasonable, and some take comfort if their own deductions are more or less in line with national averages.
Indeed, these average figures, released by the Internal Revenue Service, are incorporated into the two leading consumer tax software programs for use on personal computers, Turbotax by Chipsoft and Andrew Tobias's Taxcut 1040. When users select "audit" from the programs' menus to have the programs check the returns they have prepared, they are told how much their own deductions deviate from the national averages for their income group. 
 But many tax professionals caution against reading too much into such comparisons. The advise people to take every deduction to which they are legally entitled -- no more, no less -- and to be prepared to substantiate their claims, if necessary.
"There's no such thing as the average person," said David A. Berenson, national director of tax policy for Ernst & Young, the national accounting firm, in Washington. "Those figures can lull someone into a false sense of security. Take what you are legally entitled to take."
 
State Taxes Vary
 Residents of New York, Massachusetts and California, for example, which have high state income taxes, should not feel intimidated because their deductions for state taxes are above national averages. Furthermore, Mr. Berenson said, changes in the economy and in Federal and some state tax laws distort comparisons between 1991 returns now being prepared and filed and 1989 figures, the latest year for which the average figures are available from the I.R.S.
Interest deductions may be lower, he said. Rates have fallen, leading many people to refinance home mortgages, the biggest source of interest deductions. Also, in 1989 people could deduct 20 percent of their consumer interest -- on credit cards and car loans, for example -- but these deductions cannot be taken for 1991.
Julian Block, a tax lawyer in Larchmont, N.Y., and former special agent for the I.R.S.'s criminal investigation division, said, "Those statistics are widely interpreted as what the traffic will bear, and that's not so at all."
Nevertheless, he included the figures in his book, "Julian Block's Year-Round Tax Strategies for the $40,000-Plus Household," (Prima Publishing , 1992; $14.95). Why? "You have to assume your chances for an audit are greater if you're claiming unexpectedly high deductions," Mr. Block said, "and if you recognize that, you may be able to head it off if you attach an explanatory note or statement."
He recalled being assigned to investigate a man of modest means who claimed charitable deductions in excess of what most people with several times his income were reporting. It turned out the man was deeply religious; he tithed 10 percent of his pretax income, and then gave some more to his church, a fact that was substantiated by church records.
Perhaps if he had attached a note to his return there would have been no audit, Mr. Block said, but the number was big enough "to cause the I.R.S. computers to go bananas." The computers do not read notes, but after a computer flags a return, a person looks at it to decide whether an audit is warranted, and he or she might have accepted the explanation in the note, depending on other aspects of the return.
"If you attach anything, it should be brief, not a dossier," he said. Taxpayers should hold on to their original documents in case of an audit.
Daniel Caine, who wrote of Andrew Tobias's Taxcut 1040 computer program for Meca Software, said that he included the I.R.S. averages because "people want to know." He added that if a number is out of line, the user may have made a typographical error -- entering $30 instead of $300 for charitable donations, for example -- and by pointing out the variance from the norm, the program will help the user find the error.
"If it's correct, whether it's bigger or smaller shouldn't matter," Mr. Caine said. The program's interview feature helps users find all the deductions to which they are entitled.
The most common deductions on regular tax returns are for state and local income taxes, real-estate taxes, interest on home mortgages or home-equity loans, and contributions to charities, including churches, synagogues, schools and hospitals.
Medical expenses are deductable only to the extent that they exceed 7.5 percent of adjusted gross income, so few people can take them. Similarly, casualty loss deductions (for property loss or damage) may be taken only to the extent they exceed 10 percent of the adjusted gross income, plus $100 per occurrence, and miscellaneous itemized deductions (like business entertaining or union or professional dues) only to the extent they exceed 2 percent of adjusted gross income.
At Chipsoft Inc., which produces Turbotax, Albert W. Noyes, vice president of marketing, described the program's use of the averages as "an additional data point," not something intended as advice about deductions.
"Theoretically, if you're out of line, it might raise a red flag," he said, "so when you file your tax return, you should be prepared for an audit with all the backup material." Taxpayers should keep canceled checks, medical bills, statements from banks and other lenders, receipts from charities and any other documentation for deductions, he said.
 
Keep It Real
 "You should file based on reality," he added, regardless of how it compares with the averages. The program allows taxpayers to attach statements or notes of the sort Mr. Block recommended to returns.
Mr. Noyes said that the I.R.S. uses the averages in what he termed their "mysterious calculations" for developing taxpayer profiles to decide whom to audit.
But other factors are also considered. Deductions for home offices are widely regarded as an audit flag, because the I.R.S. contends they are an area of abuse. Mr. Berenson said moving expenses could also flag a return, as could business travel and entertainment expenses.
Herbert Paul, a New York tax lawyer, certified public accountant and professor of taxation at New York University, said: "I explain it to my students this way:
"We really have a system of self-assessment in the United States. We report what our income is and list the deductions we think we are entitled to. Uncle Sam has a right to say, 'Show me.' "

HEADLINE: Counting Your Savings

BYLINE: By ROBERT HURTADO

 BODY:
Mortgage interest rates rose slightly over the last two months, but they are still lower than they have been in years. Home buyers and owners can still reduce payments appreciably, or they can choose a shorter mortgage term to cut interest expenses. Here are figures for the interest on a $100,000 loan at the current national averages for 15-year, 20-year and 30-year fixed rates and for the savings that can be realized with 15- and 20-year loans. For comparison, figures are also given for a 30-year mortgage at the average fixed rate available two years ago.

HEADLINE: Kenya Insures Game Park Safety for Tourists;
Political Oppression

 BODY:
To the Editor:
"Violence continued in the Kenyan capital," you report in "Violence in Nairobi Draws a Warning by U.S." (news article, March 5), "when the police fired tear gas canisters and clubbed demonstrators protesting the forceful eviction of women on a hunger strike from a city park." 
 It was with great sadness that I read about the beating of the hunger strikers by the soldiers of President Daniel arap Moi. I was especially saddened because Wangari Maathai was among those beaten unconscious by President Moi's men. You describe her as "a prominent Kenyan environmental campaigner and a member of one of the new opposition political parties."
I met Dr. Maathai when she came to talk on the environment at an Association of Junior Leagues International conference last May. She described how she and other Kenyan women sought to protect the fertility of their land. They had begun the Green Belt Movement: 600,000 women acquired seeds and planted them in rows around their property. These seeds grew into 10 million trees, which held down the eroding topsoil and broke the winds, thus halting desertification. With that one act they protected their environment, insured fuel supply for years and became economically more self-sufficient.
President Moi has described Dr. Maathai as a pawn, a puppet of the opposition parties. Dr. Maathai is the opposition. Those women are the opposition. It was Dr. Maathai who brought international attention to the impending razing of the last public park in Nairobi.
In attempting to develop this park, President Moi is anxious only for the windfall profits from the development of the park.
Dr. Maathai and the democratic opposition to President Moi are concerned about much larger issues: the survival of the majority of Kenyans who are poor and an end to the unplanned, irrational development of Kenya's natural resources. As Kenya moves toward more democracy, people like Dr. Maathai will become more important and people like President Moi need pressure from the United States and the United Nations to loosen his hold on the politics of Kenya.

HEADLINE: Panel Calls for Wider Help For Ex-Soviet Arms Experts

BYLINE: By WILLIAM J. BROAD

 BODY:
In the first detailed plan suggesting how the West should respond to the breakup of the Soviet scientific complex, a panel of America's top scientists and engineers called yesterday for an international effort that is far more swift, costly and ambitious than what has been done to date.
The panel, made up of more than 120 scientists and engineers, said up to $150 million should be spent quickly to bail out Moscow's scientific enterprise and keep its top weapon experts from taking lucrative jobs with third-world despots. 
 It said Western money should bolster Moscow's peaceful research as well, arguing that the redirection of the scientists could fail if the alternative disciplines that might attract them were allowed to languish.
Finally, the panel called on the United States to ease restrictive barriers that now block the importation of high technologies from the former Soviet Union, thereby encouraging another source of jobs and revenue.
 
Urgency Is Stressed
 "Time is of the essence," the panel's chairmen wrote in a report to Dr. D. Allan Bromley, President Bush's science adviser. The chairmen said "temptations are increasing" for Russian military scientists to look for jobs abroad, and added that the American Government should act "immediately and aggressively."
By implication, the report faulted the West's response so far as slow, narrow and parsimonious. The Bush Administration recently pledged $25 million to help establish an institute to keep Russian nuclear bomb designers occupied with peaceful scientific work.
Dr. Bromley's office said that the science adviser would have no immediate response. President Bush has said tight budgets are limiting how much America can do financially for Russia. As for Russian high-technology imports, the Administration is engaged in an internal debate over whether to relax its restrictions.
The ad hoc panel, which met on March 3, was organized by the National Academy of Sciences, a group that advises the Federal Government. Dr. Bromley had asked the academy to counsel him on what steps the United States might take to preserve Russian science.
The co-chairmen of the panel's meeting were Dr. Frank Press, president of the academy and former science adviser to President Carter; Dr. Ashton B. Carter, director of the Center for Science and International Affairs at Harvard University, and Dr. H. Guyford Stever, former science adviser to President Ford.
 
Report's Scope Is Broad
 Much of the urgency in the academy report is based on fears that the collapse of the Soviet scientific complex, especially its nuclear arm, will send scientists and materials into foreign hands in a new kind of international peril. But the report's scope was unusually broad, addressing the whole of the former Soviet scientific enterprise rather than just the parts of it directly tied to military production.
The report argued that America's goal of shrinking and redirecting the Soviet military complex would require aid for weapon and non-weapon scientists alike.
Diverting arms experts into peaceful work, the report said, means that cooperation and financial aid "should not be confined to weapon scientists only" but broadened to insure the vitality of alternative fields, including basic research and industrial technology.
"You want to create something that's a substantial distraction," Dr. Carter, one of the panel's chairmen, said in an interview.
These were among the report's recommendations:
*Part of the $400 million set aside by Congress for dismantling nuclear weapons in the former Soviet Union should be used this year "for immediate support" of the peaceful research of key arms scientists and the most highly qualified non-weapon scientists.
*In addition to spending $25 million for weapon scientists through the recently proposed International Science and Technology Center in Moscow, the United States should direct $25 million or more this year in cooperative programs with non-weapon scientists outside the center.
*A special fund of $50 million to $100 million should be established to help replenish and refurbish equipment, journals and books used in laboratories of special importance. "The United States should take the lead in obtaining the necessary funds from bilateral and multilateral assistance agencies for this purpose," the report said.
*The United States should modify its restrictive policies on the acquisition of advanced Russian technologies and technical expertise.
 
Concerned Over Future Threat
 In recent months, the Administration has blocked the American purchase of rocket engines, satellites, space reactors, spacecraft and other aerospace goods in a bid to force the Russian space and military industry into decline so it poses no future threat to the United States.
But the policy, which threatens hundreds of potential deals by Government agencies and American industry, has come under mounting criticism both in the United States and abroad, and some analysts predict that it may be relaxed or reversed.
Critics of the policy, including some Federal officials, say the acquisition of Moscow's best technologies could save Washington and American industry many billions of dollars in development costs, ease Russia's economic woes, discourage the spread of Russian scientists, engineers and technicians to the third world and help the United States compete with foreign rivals.
The academy report said that in general "substantial bureaucratic and legal barriers exist" to collaborative efforts with the former Soviet lands. A review of the barriers must be undertaken immediately, it said, "to remove all those that derive from the cold war period and no longer serve U.S. interests."

CORRECTION-DATE: March 18, 1992, Wednesday

 CORRECTION:
Because of an editing error, an article on Saturday about a Federal panel's recommendations to bolster Russia's scientific complex misattributed a comment that temptations were increasing for Russian military scientists to look for jobs abroad, and that the American Government should act immediately and aggressively. It was made by the panel's chairmen, not by President Bush's science adviser, Dr. D. Allan Bromley.

HEADLINE: Why Men Hate to Dress

BYLINE: By Hal Rubenstein

 BODY:
A young man laces up a pair of brown suede bucks by Gianni Versace in Barneys New York's shoe department. He stands up, wiggles his toes, bounces up and down, walks about a bit, looks in the mirror, looks at the bottom of one shoe, then turns to his female companion and says, "It's up to you. What do you think?"
The difference between men's relationship to clothing and women's relationship to clothing is simple:
Most women get dressed to look and feel beautiful. 
 Most men get dressed, praying they don't look stupid.
Pity the male, victim of social circumstances beyond his control. Our moms took our sisters shopping as soon as they could walk. But what boy ever heard his father say, "Come on, son, let's hit the stores"? Great a guy as your dad might be, and none come better than mine, most fathers of men reading this magazine handed down the following sartorial legacies: 1) How to tie a tie (one knot only); 2) How to make a part in your hair; 3) How to polish your shoes. That's it.
Is it any wonder that when the average male hears the word "fashion," he goes diving for the remote to click on World Wrestling Federation? Imagine a man who's grown up not knowing how to play football, and who then decides he wants to learn. Whom is he going to ask to teach him? His friends? And get pelted with a lockerful of sarcasm? Odds are, he'll continue to keep his inability to himself, figure out graceful ways to be busy whenever asked to play some "touch" and never fail to show up to watch the Super Bowl.
Now, substitute shopping for football, and it's easy to see why men hate to dress. They don't know how. No one taught us. And who likes doing anything they're no good at?
The truth is, men are probably vainer than women, if only because women have socially acceptable ways of expressing their vanity. Men, however, rarely own up to it. Admitting you want to look good is not considered a strength. And yet, appearance has never held more importance in urban life, which proceeds at a zooming pace, stressing overt youth, obsessing over health. Our contents are increasingly judged by our covers. It's not necessarily an unfair assessment. What you wear, how you look, is a choice, a visual shorthand that signals people what to expect when they talk to you. Unfortunately, although few men were educated to make that choice, most men now realize its importance. For where's the logic in putting in overtime, networking like mad, trying to stand out in a crowd, if you're going to do it while looking like everyone else?
But how do you stop a man from turning to a woman -- or anyone else, for that matter -- to pick out his brogues? It's more than a matter of insecurity. A suit can hang badly with no complications. An ugly tie only hurts the eye of the beholder. But a bad pair of shoes can ruin your day, alter your posture, torture your spine. Only the wearer can determine what feels right. That means men have to trust themselves more. But trust takes confidence, and confidence grows from knowing.
Consequently, men don't need fashion as much as they need information. Fast. For a while, they could get out of playing "touch" when a gray suit, a blue blazer, a few white shirts, a red tie, a pair of khakis, jeans and some plaid shirts qualified as a wardrobe. But recession or not, men's wear has never been more electric, the options never more diverse. With more and more of the work force in fields that afford increasing independence, and fewer and fewer men wanting to emulate the increasingly maligned image of the Wall Street banker, the blue suit has become just another suit, and the revelation is that no one's getting fired for wearing loden crepe. Men's clothes have become softer, more supple, more comfortable, more sensual. And that feels good. In fact, it's slowly dawning on men that clothes can feel even better than good. It's taken years for women not to be regarded as sex objects. Men are just discovering they can be. And tentative as we are about embracing it, we like the attention.
Women approach a fashion magazine with a warehouse of stored reference material. Men are more likely to open one with a stare as blank as a bachelor's freezer. Many women can look at two suits from a designer and grasp the concept of the whole collection. Most men see two suits. It's not that women are smarter (at least, not in this area), but that they're better trained at gathering the facts. They have no trouble walking up to a counter and badgering a saleswoman for information, which is as it should be. Yet I've watched men wander around Bergdorf Goodman's temple to men's wear for hours, like children searching for their parents after a parade, and never utter a cry for help.
Men, however, have never been great at asking for assistance. That's why we've designed these pages to appease fears, anticipate questions, stretch a couple of boundaries and have a little fun. It's been a while since men have had a sense of humor about the way they dress. And clothes really should be a treat. Besides, after looking at some of these prices, you've got to laugh.
Luckily, there is a new generation of young men, fueled by MTV and the high school graduating classes they see on the Fox Network, who are developing individual styles while they're still in adolescence. Even the nerds now look cool. As for those of us long out of caps and gowns, there's work, but the goals can be far more satisfying than merely dressing well. "I look on getting dressed as my first adventure of the day," says the designer Bill Robinson, "and if I can enjoy the adventure, then look in the mirror when it's over, see what I've done, and say, 'Hey, you don't look half bad,' my morning's off to a pretty good start." This, without coffee or a glazed cruller. What Robinson knows is that putting one leg in before the other should result not merely in avoiding screw-ups but in doing something nice for yourself. And what man can hate that? Be patient with men. We're on our way. We just need a little time, a lot of information and a good pair of shoes.
 
 
 
10 SHOPPING TIPS
1. At home, stand naked in front of a full-length mirror. Call it tough self-love, but there's no other way to determine what you're actually working with, and it serves as a reminder that clothing can only do so much. Extracurricular shaping may be necessary.
2. Take stock of your closets. This will not only minimize the impulse buying that results in a fifth navy turtleneck, it also reveals the gaps in your wardrobe.
3. Get ready to shop by dressing to undress. No lace-up shoes, sneakers, bulky pullovers, jeans, festive prints or idiosyncratic necklines. Recommended: a white dress shirt or solid flat-knit cotton turtleneck; black, easy-to-slip-off pants, easy-to-kick-off loafers, clean underwear. You never know.
4. Go alone. Otherwise, you'll never acquire a personal sense of style. Best friends impose their fears. Lovers impose their taste. Be brave. Remember, Stanley made his greatest journey without Livingstone.
5. Prime for time. Don't squish shopping in between aerobics and the multiplex. Allow yourself some open-ended luxury.
6. Let the sales force be with you. Clothes aren't any cheaper if you don't. Quality of service is on the upswing, so don't hesitate to drain the staff dry. There are no dumb questions, only dumb clothes. If a salesman can't answer queries, move on to one you're simpatico with, get the name and then, each time you shop, ask for him.
7. Try everything on. Sculptural pieces by designers such as Dolce and Gabbana may look misshapen on a hanger, but when you try them on, make you feel as if someone retraced your silhouette for the better. Experiment. It costs nothing. But don't plant yourself in front of the mirror as if you were holding two rolls of paper towels under each arm. Relax your shoulders, take your wallet with you and walk around. Stretch, touch your toes, hug a salesman (actually, a test of fit). Feel the fabric against your skin, the requirements your body makes of the garment. Then, when you've finished strutting, get back to the mirror and . . .
8. Look at your rear. You'd better. Everyone else does. Pants should never be so tight as to hide the back center seam, never so loose as to make people think you're hiding groceries. Should you wear briefs, note that men, too, have panty lines.
9. Buy what looks good, not what you "need." Because what looks good is what you need.
10. Try everything on, as soon as you get home. Do it in front of the mirror and in lighting you're used to. Like what you see? Then pay yourself a compliment. May it be the first of many.

HEADLINE: ON LANGUAGE;
Inside the Circumferential Highway

BYLINE: By William Safire

 BODY:
As other Democratic hopefuls. . . . (That's a cliche. Hopefully, we can dispense with the transformation of the adjective hopeful into a noun. Begin again.)
As Democrats pressing their candidature. . . . (Academics will like that word, but it's in the same prissy league as governance and polity; besides, what's wrong with candidacy? Begin again; this is your last chance.) 
 As those guys panting after the Democratic nomination began to show primary results, the telepundit Mark Shields said of Gov. Bill Clinton, "He won the inside-the-Beltway primary."
The Beltway in this usage is the Capital Beltway, a circumferential highway that enables traffic to skirt, or bypass, the city streets. In many American small towns, such a traffic-reliever is called a bypass.
In Britain, the term is ring road or ringway, though some wish to gentrify that to orbital road. The heart of Moscow is circled by the Sadovoye Koltso (sadovoye means "garden"; koltso is Russian for "ring").
Mr. Shields was not, of course, referring to a primary held in Washington, D.C. Inside the Beltway is not a place but a state of mind; used as a compound adjective, the prepositional phrase means "having the conventional wisdom held by self-described political insiders."
The political term first appeared in The Washington Post atop a fishing story in 1977: "Inside-the-Beltway  Trout Fishing Nears." But not until 1983, according to my Nexis search, did its political-insider sense come to the fore. In a Newsweek article an anonymous Democratic campaign manager was quoted as refusing to derogate the possibility of a return by former Senator George McGovern: "If he's perceived as a man on a fool's errand, that's still inside the [Washington] Beltway, not the world as a whole."
Two years later, the phrase still required a bracketed explanation. A United Press International report from Washington quoted Mark Russell, the humorist, making this assessment of Senator Alan Simpson of Wyoming: "Simpson epitomizes the Western disdain for 'inside-the-beltway' [Washington know-it-alls]." In 1991, Senator Charles Grassley of Iowa used the phrase in the Clarence Thomas hearings: "ordinary American people, who look at things differently than are looked at here inside the Beltway."
A few now use the phrase to describe "the real inside skinny"; it is the title of a gossipy news column in The Washington Times. Most prefer the sense of "showing insular thinking, removed from the heartland." John Leo, the stylish essayist in U.S. News & World Report, assessed the opinions of a group of opinionators about Pat Buchanan by pointing out that "Almost every one . . . comes from the same tiny hothouse: the inside-the-beltway punditry industry."
The phrase reflects a populist disdain for central government, though it is most often used by people who live in its environs. Part of the general running-against-Washington movement, it is more anti-ineffectual than anti-intellectual.
Hyphenate the phrase when used as a modifier before the noun it describes. Capitalize the B when making reference to the Washington Beltway, as you capitalize the M in Washington Monument, a rule that covers most use today; ultimately, this important new bit of political slang will lower the case as it takes on a meaning of general insiderness.
Two related phrases:
Beltway bandits are consultants, usually to the defense industry, who practice inside the Beltway; use is lessening because defense contracts are no longer the ripe plums they used to be.
In the loop, a place George Bush denied being during the Iran-contra affair, means "among those consulted," usually a tight circle. Loop, or circle, was used in Chicago at the turn of the century, when the titan Charles Tyson Yerkes built the railway known as the Loop around the downtown business district; the area itself is now known as the Loop. By analogy, the District of Columbia may well become known sometime in the next millennium as the Beltway.
 
POP GOES THE MARLIN
 PRESIDENT BUSH'S press secretary, the moon-faced Marlin Fitzwater, has brought a touch of class to the 1992 campaign. He has introduced poetic allusions to the daily press briefings.
The White House press corps, which prides itself on a sandpapered-fingertip sensitivity to political arcana, has been struck dumb by this phenomenon. Nobody who has worked his or her razor-sharp elbows into the most coveted assignment in Washington has ever started on the poetry beat.
Here is the White House closet intellectual's blast at those Democrats on the House Ways and Means Committee who have disdained the President's economic plan: "weasels going into a hole."
A member of the Poetic Allusion Watch (PAW) -- Sam Abrams at the Rochester Institute of Technology -- was among those who spotted Mr. Fitzwater's direct (if slightly inaccurate) allusion to "Nineteen Hundred and Nineteen," a 1928 poem by William Butler Yeats:
We pieced our thoughts into philosophy,
And planned to bring the world under a rule,
Who are but weasels fighting in a hole.
The subtlety and aptness of Mr. Fitzwater's slouching towards Yeats are astonishing: the poet presages Mr. Bush's New World Order in his plan to bring the disorderly weasel-nations, down in the hole-arena, under the rule of international law. He did not, for obvious reasons, call attention to a later stanza:
We, who seven years ago
Talked of honor and of truth,
Shriek with pleasure if we show
The weasel's twist, the weasel's tooth.
Mr. Bush and his staff are evidently planning to leap down in that weasel hole to get in the fight.
Yeats is big these days on Madison Avenue, too. Dominique F. Nahas of New York calls my attention to the decision by R. J. Reynolds to switch ad agencies, a move that caused John L. Mezzina, whose fledgling agency got the account, to say that the Camel brand "is easier for a small agency because what tends to happen in any large organization is that the falcon can't hear the falconer."
"The falcon cannot hear the falconer" is from "The Second Coming," in which Yeats refers to the wide sweeps that sometimes take the hunting bird beyond the call of the falconer. Coincidentally, it precedes a line that reflects a concern in the White House:
Things fall apart; the center cannot hold. . . .
The best lack all conviction, while the worst
Are full of passionate intensity.

Hollywood Law: Whose Idea Is It, Anyway?

BYLINE: By JOY HOROWITZ; Joy Horowitz writes about the arts for Premiere magazine and other publications.

DATELINE: HOLLYWOOD

 BODY:
In the latest skirmish of the Hollywood plagiarism wars, a lawsuit filed in state court here alleges that the television producer Aaron Spelling stole an idea that H. W. Broido Jr., a merchandise marketer, pitched to him. Mr. Broido charges that Mr. Spelling used his idea as the basis for the hit Fox series "Beverly Hills, 90210."
Damages are not specified. Not yet, anyway. But stay tuned: "A large amount is required," the lawsuit says, "to teach the Spellings a lesson that they cannot continue their exploitive, mercenary, nefarious and corrupt practice of conspiring to take advantage of individuals and their ideas and projects." 
 Welcome to the world of idea theft in Hollywood, a subterranean zone where the mudslinging is rampant, the desperation factor is acute, and the charges and countercharges of ethical misconduct are about as common as the lineup of BMW's and Mercedes in a studio parking lot.
Sometimes friends steal from friends (or accuse friends of stealing). Sometimes writers borrow from books, other movies or television. Sometimes a producer hears an idea and decides it is his own. The theft can be obviously deliberate or accidental. The charge can be serious, or a gold digger's scheme. From writers who are afraid to discuss their work at dinner parties to lawyers who quietly hammer out settlements so long as their terms stay secret, the topic is a messy one that arouses techy responses from many and flat-out denials from others. "If you write a hit movie, the odds are good you'll get sued," says Craig Jacobson, a partner with Hansen, Jacobson & Teller, a major Hollywood entertainment firm. A studio executive offered another view: "Plagiarism is not a forefront issue for us. We don't live in fear of it. Everyone's honorable."
Although no one keeps track of how many plagiarism claims are filed each year, attorneys who have represented both plaintiffs and defendants in these suits say that the overwhelming majority are filed by opportunists trying to cash in on someone else's success. But those cases that seem to have foundation have put all the players in the movie and television industry on the defensive.
"Idea theft," says the entertainment lawyer Pierce O'Donnell, "is a cancer in Hollywood. In an industry where imagination and creativity is the key to success, idea theft is grand larceny. And it is prevalent."
 Mr. O'Donnell, no doubt, is hardly objective when it comes to such matters. For it is he who won a stunning 1990 court victory against Paramount Pictures for the columnist Art Buchwald and the producer Alain Bernheim, who claimed that Paramount and Eddie Murphy stole the idea of "Coming to America" from Mr. Buchwald's film treatment, "King for a Day." Paramount, which will appeal the ruling, continues to insist that the 1988 blockbuster, which grossed $145 million, is an original work.
The damages phase of the trial is continuing; still pending is Judge Harvey A. Schneider's ruling on how much Mr. Buchwald and Mr. Bernheim are owed for their work. Mr. Buchwald is asking for between $1 million and $3 million and Mr. Bernheim seeks between $4.5 million and $15 million for being denied the opportunity to produce the film.
Repercussions from the Buchwald suit appear to be far-reaching. Interviews with dozens of lawyers, agents, writers and studio executives suggest that because of recessionary times and the impact of the Buchwald litigation, charges of idea theft -- easy to make, difficult to prove, expensive to litigate -- are booming. From unconscious borrowing to blatant pilfering, the practice of passing off someone else's work as one's own is especially endemic to Hollywood, where novel ideas are rare, stories are pitched orally, and the line between a remake (where credit is given and paid for) and a rip-off is often blurry.
Ever since Orson Welles and his collaborator, Herman J. Mankiewicz, were sued for plagiarizing "Citizen Kane" from a book about William Randolph Hearst (R.K.O. settled for $15,000 after a hung jury), motion pictures have inspired more plagiarism claims than all printed literature in the past, according to defense lawyers.
 
On the Dockets
What Buchwald Wrought
 Nuisance-value suits, as the studios label them, abound, particularly from what one entertainment lawyer refers to as "oddballs, kooks and weirdos." But the problem goes beyond fortune-seekers. A prominent agent, who spoke on condition of anonymity, says: "I used to tell my clients everything's done on a handshake. Now, I don't trust anyone, and I tell my clients not to, either."
Counters Kenneth E. Kulzick, a defense lawyer who represents major studios as well as insurance companies that cover plagiarism claims: "To say there is a lot of theft -- that is just baloney. A lot of these suits are in response to economic conditions. People are more easily agitated and feel they've been taken advantage of: when they can't do, they sue. The current wave of claims is also due in part to Buchwald, which has given the illusion of easy pickings to get money from production companies. But so far, he hasn't gotten a dime."
Plagiarism charges in Hollywood have become so institutionalized that they are no longer a question of ethical ambiguity so much as business as usual. Beyond Paramount's mounting legal bills on the Buchwald case, now in its fourth year in court, several other charges of idea theft have recently surfaced:
"Beverly Hills, 90210": According to court records, Mr. Broido's pitch, for a show called "Holli Woods," was offered mostly for its spinoff marketing potential, and as an acting vehicle for Mr. Spelling's daughter, Tori. Holli was described in Mr. Broido's claim as a teen-ager "who finds herself uprooted from the most normal Midwestern existence to the magic and dynamism of California." She "moves through a wide variety of delightful, contemporary adventures with her new schoolmates, her brother and a friend who is a boy" and discovers "a world of sunshine, swimming pools, temptations to grow up too quickly. . . ." All these elements are in "Beverly Hills, 90210."
According to court records, soon after introducing Mr. Spelling to his idea in December 1985, Mr. Broido received a letter from Mr. Spelling describing the concept as "absolutely charming." Mr. Spelling, who had previously worked with Mr. Broido on licensing products from "Dynasty," another Spelling show, later sent to Mr. Broido photographs of his daughter, who would star as Holli and be the model for the Holli Woods doll. ("Beverly Hills, 90210" dolls, including a Tori Spelling doll, have since hit the market. Ms. Spelling plays a supporting role in the Fox series.)
"More than a story line was taken," says Mr. Broido, whose suit also names 20th Century Fox and Mr. Spelling's wife, Candy, and daughter, Tori. "It was a whole business enterprise that was ripped off. And there's a huge paper trail to prove it." Mr. Spelling, through his attorney, Maren Christensen of Rosenfeld, Meyer & Susman, would not comment on Mr. Broido's charges.
"For the Boys": Did Bette Midler swipe Martha Raye's story? That is the question at the heart of a threatened lawsuit by the 75-year-old comedienne's seventh husband, the hairdresser Mark Harris, over the movie "For the Boys." He has said in the press that Ms. Midler appropriated a 20-page film treatment that Ms. Raye had submitted to Ms. Midler based on her experiences in World War II, Korea and Vietnam. Ms. Midler's partner, Bonnie Bruckheimer, who co-produced "For the Boys," says Mr. Harris's charges are "ridiculous," though she acknowledges that Ms. Midler met with Martha Raye and others for research.
"Die Hard": In a 352-page suit -- replete with its own table of contents and title, "Anatomy of a Rip Off" -- the Canadian film maker Alexis Kanner claims that "Die Hard" is the "the wholesale cinematic "Xeroxing" and "cinematic rape" of his 1977 movie "Kings and Desperate Men," about a hostage taken by terrorists. The suit alleges that while Mr. Kanner was negotiating with CBS and Fox to distribute his film in the United States, "Die Hard" was being developed by Fox executives, who purloined Mr. Kanner's film. In seeking to dismiss the suit, Fox attorneys describe Mr. Kanner's claim as "legally innocuous chaff."
"Home Alone": "Pere Noel," a 1989 French thriller about a young boy left home alone on Christmas Eve, when he must fend off an intruder as his mother rushes home to save him, bears some similarity to the highest-grossing comedy in movie history, John Hughes's 1990 "Home Alone." "They remade my movie," says the French film maker Rene Manzor. He approached the studio, Fox, in an attempt to reach a settlement agreement, but Fox has denied any similarity between the films. "I have no choice but to sue them," he says. Mr. Hughes has said he came up with the idea for "Home Alone" in August 1989 while en route to Paris for a family vacation and denied ever seeing Mr. Manzor's film.
 
 
The Hush Factor
It's All In the Family
 Few idea-theft cases ever get to trial. Most are dismissed because they fail to meet basic legal standards. The law says ideas are as free as air until they are realized in some tangible form, for example a written story or outline. In copyright-infringement cases, a plaintiff must show that the works in question are "substantially similar" in dialogue, setting, plot, genre and characters. More important, the plaintiff must show that the defendant had access to the original work.
Many seemingly good cases never get filed because writers fear reprisal -- that they'll be blacklisted or perceived as troublemakers -- if they take legal action. If cases aren't dismissed, deals often get quietly struck to avoid unseemly publicity for the studios and to shield studio executives from depositions, court proceedings and the expense of litigation. Settlement agreements with confidentiality clauses barring either side from disclosing terms have become de rigueur. Many even include future script deals and an office on the lot.
Says Mr. O'Donnell: "It's very sanitized, this informal jurisprudence of settling these things quietly. It's typical of Hollywood to sweep its dirty laundry under the mantle of confidentiality agreements." Says one attorney from O'Melveny & Meyers, the firm handling Paramount's defense, who spoke on condition of anonymity: "Frankly, it's because everyone works with everyone else. It's almost like mediating a family dispute."
Last year, Tri-Star Pictures settled out of court for a seven-figure sum, sources say, with Rita Stern and Jeanne Meyers, who claimed that Amy Heckerling's 1989 hit "Look Who's Talking" was stolen from "Special Delivery," a treatment for a comedy Ms. Stern and Ms. Meyers submitted to Ms. Heckerling three years before her film's release. The agreement was struck after United States District Court Judge Matthew Byrne issued a particularly trenchant finding -- that nearly identical dialogue in both works pointed to nothing short of "copying."
Even Disney's 1991 bomb, "The Marrying Man," was the subject of a confidentiality agreement, signed by the playwright and screenwriter Neil Simon, after being sued by the comedian Alan King, an old friend of his. Mr. King claimed that after he told Mr. Simon his idea for a movie -- about a man who marries the same woman four times, based on the true story of a shoe manufacturer named Harry Karl -- Mr. Simon sold it to Disney as his own. While Mr. Simon has denied any wrongdoing, claiming Mr. Karl's story was in the public domain, he and Disney reportedly paid Mr. King a six-figure settlement.
Unlike other litigants, however, Mr. Buchwald has stated that he will never sign a confidentiality agreement. The practice of settling these cases can be especially bothersome to writers who feel they've been unjustly accused and never get to clear their names. David Ward, for example, who won an Oscar for best original screenplay for "The Sting" in 1973, was sued by David W. Maurer for plagiarizing "The Big Con," his 1941 nonfiction book about swindlers. The Los Angeles Times reported that Universal and Mr. Ward, who admitted using Mr. Maurer's book as research, settled the case for $600,000.
"This whole thing has been a real source of pain to me," Mr. Ward says. "If accused, people assume you were guilty. There's no trial. No evidence presented against you. Universal made the decision to settle for purely business reasons."
 
Pitch Pitfalls
The 'Play It Again' Syndrome
 Some safeguards are available to protect against plagiarism beyond copyrights. Every year, the Writers Guild receives about 25,000 submissions -- from pitches to treatments to scripts -- to be registered as a means of preventing idea theft. But even written registration may not be enough legal protection.
Currently, "the most frustration" expressed by writers, says Charles Slocum, who oversees registration at the Writers Guild, occurs when an inexperienced writer pitches an idea to a studio executive, who then takes the idea to an A-list writer.
Harlan Ellison, a science-fiction writer, says plagiarism is systemic. In 1980, a jury awarded Mr. Ellison $337,000 in a copyright-infringement case against Paramount and ABC for the shortlived ABC television series "Future Cop." After the trial, Mr. Ellison rented a billboard opposite the studio with the message: "Writers -- Don't Let Them Steal From You! Keep Their Hands Out of Your Pockets!"
But Mr. Ellison's victory had little effect. Several years later he sued the writer-director James Cameron over Arnold Schwarzenegger's breakthrough 1984 film, "The Terminator," alleging that it was lifted from an episode he wrote for the 1960's TV show "Outer Limits." The case was settled for an undisclosed sum.
Says a studio lawyer: "If I had to listen to as many pitches as these story editors, I'd go nuts. After a while, they all start to blend into each other. It's a tricky thing." But Mr. Ellison says studio gatekeepers simply can't tell whether material is original or not. His point is underscored by a 1980 article in Film Comment magazine for which the screenplay for "Casablanca" was submitted to hundreds of Hollywood agents under the title "Everybody Comes to Rick's." Of 85 agencies that said they read it, only 33 recognized it as "Casablanca," while three wanted to represent it, and one wanted to turn it into a novel.
Rita Stern, the plaintiff in the "Look Who's Talking" litigation, is not embittered. "I don't think people are basically rotten," she says. "In the course of time, you hear something and file it away and it comes out in another form. Some people really think it's their idea by the time it comes out."
But sometimes, she continues, "it's, 'We can get away with it, so let's do it' -- a real brazen attitude." If there is a lesson learned from all this, she says, it's: "Hold onto documentation. Never throw away a letter. Record every phone call.
 
 
 
THE STUDIOS' DEFENSE
 To prevent accusations of plagiarism, studios and production companies will not accept unsolicited material. In fact, there is danger even in acknowledging such material: just before he died last year, Michael Landon was fighting an idea-theft case because, his attorney says, he sent out a "nice letter," saying he had no use for material sent to him. "This was Mr. Good Guy making the mistake of reading it and sending it back," says Kenneth E. Kulzick, a defense lawyer who won Mr. Landon's case. "Michael signed his own rejection letters, which we don't recommend as a rule."
Writers who submit material through formal channels, for example, through an agent, are asked to sign release forms. These forms -- which some lawyers suggest are legally questionable -- say that if a writer whose script is rejected by the studio later claims that the studio developed ideas based on the script, damages will be limited to $1,000. Well-known writers object to such forms.
Studios also insure themselves against claims of plagiarism. Typically, when a motion picture is greenlighted, the studio purchases a package of entertainment insurance, which covers everything from a cast member breaking a leg during production to copyright infringement. That part of the policy, called Errors and Omission, covers the mistakes and oversights a studio might make in verifying the originality of material. Such a premium can cover up to $25 million.
James Tierny, a plaintiff's attorney whose firm handled litigation over "Look Who's Talking," blames the Errors and Omission policy for desensitizing studios to plagiarism claims. "No matter how serious, no matter how important the claim," he says, studio heads can treat it as an insurance matter. "They simply say, 'Turn it over to the carrier.' "

'Basic Instinct': The Suspect Is Attractive, and May Be Fatal

BYLINE: By BERNARD WEINRAUB

DATELINE: HOLLYWOOD

 BODY:
In the 1987 film "Fatal Attraction," Michael Douglas played a happily married man who has a weekend fling with a woman who turns out to be psychopathic and violent. If "Fatal Attraction" served as a metaphor for the 1980's, with its theme of the dangers of extramarital sex and one-night stands, then "Basic Instinct," to be released Friday, is a movie of the 1990's. Its underlying theme seems to be the dangers of sex, period.
In the new film, a troubled San Francisco police detective, played by Mr. Douglas, investigates the savage murder of a onetime rock star. The evidence: a blood-soaked ice pick, a woman's white scarf tied to the bedpost and the residue of sex. The detective embarks on a sensual, violent journey in which he confronts Catherine Tramell, an alluring suspect, played by Sharon Stone, who keeps ice picks around the house, writes books about fictional murders that are too true for comfort, and seduces women as well as men, including the detective, Nick Curran. Every time Nick (Mr. Douglas) rolls into bed with Catherine, the threat of death by ice pick looms. But the provocative author is not the only suspect. 
 "The script, the movie, is open to interpretation," says Mr. Douglas of "Basic Instinct," his most erotic and controversial film since "Fatal Attraction." He says that in appearing in the film, produced by Carolco Pictures, he wanted "to do a more dangerous, sexy thriller" than he has done since that hit. "I still haven't resolved the message of this film in my mind," he went on. "I swear I haven't. Some of it has to do with redemption." Choosing his words carefully, he adds: "There does seem to be a chord here between sex, violence and death."
Ms. Stone agrees. "Certainly this is a time when people have a lot of fear about sex, and the film brings up that issue," she says. "But to me, this is really a very dark and twisted love story. The character is, let's face it, kind of loony tunes. She's very intense, very, very controlling. But it's also a thriller, a two-box-of-popcorn movie."
Few recent movies have stirred as much discussion before opening as the $30 million-plus "Basic Instinct." Carolco hopes that the film will be so successful that it will ease the financial distress that has led the company to restructure.
The script, by Joe Eszterhas, sold for a record $3 million in a transaction that set Hollywood buzzing, even in the easy-money days before the recession. During filming, gay demonstrators in San Francisco protested what they saw as the movie's treatment of lesbians as crazy or murderous. Mr. Eszterhas engaged in public spats with the director, Paul Verhoeven, over what Mr. Eszterhas regarded as the director's insensitive interpretation of the script.
The Dutch-born Mr. Verhoeven established his reputation with action-filled or erotic films like "Soldier of Orange," "Turkish Delight," "Spetters" and "The Fourth Man" before coming to the United States to make the successful "Robocop" in 1987 and "Total Recall" in 1990.
Adding to the controversy about "Basic Instinct" were its sex scenes. The Motion Picture Association of America wanted to give the steamy film an unusual and potentially financially crippling NC-17 rating (no moviegoers under 17 allowed). Alarmed, the film's distributor, Tri-Star, pressed the reluctant director to alter some scenes to win the movie an R rating.
"Actually, I didn't have to cut many things, but I replaced things from different angles, made it a little more elliptical, a bit less direct," says Mr. Verhoeven. Some 35 to 40 seconds were cut from the movie; the original version will probably be shown in Europe.
From his standpoint, sex was not the focus of the film. "I always thought the movie was about evil," Mr. Verhoeven says. "I always thought that with an economy falling down, with the dangers of life all around you -- the danger of AIDS, the danger of crime -- people are more aware of the fact that evil is an existing, everyday factor in your life. But this is my intuition. I don't want to push it. As an artist, as a director, it's sometimes better not to be too clear with yourself about what you're doing. Otherwise you might be pushing too hard."
But the sexual content of the film helped determine the choice of its female star. Ms. Stone, who played Arnold Schwarzenegger's wife in "Total Recall," was cast in "Basic Instinct" only after better-known actresses like Michelle Pfeiffer, Kim Basinger, Geena Davis, Ellen Barkin and Mariel Hemingway rejected her part, largely because it demanded so much nudity and sexual simulation.
Ms. Stone and the director say that what intrigued them about the movie was the fact that the character of Catherine is, as Mr. Verhoeven says, "brilliant, powerful, in complete control, not a victim." Ms. Stone says, half-joking: "People who have seen the movie stand two feet away from me. They speak to me in careful tones. They don't condescend to me at all anymore."
The protests by gay activists that provoked so much publicity during filming are brushed aside with impatience by the two stars and the director. "I had no pressure from anybody, not from Carolco, not from Tri-Star, not from anybody to change anything about the so-called gay issue," says Mr. Verhoeven. "I did it the way I wanted. I was, you might say, politically correct. The gay characters are positive. And the reaction is totally unwarranted. Have they seen the film? No. They read the script. They read the script like fundamentalists read the Bible. They could not visualize the film."
Analyzing the film, Mr. Douglas says: " 'Fatal Attraction' was a picture close to home for a lot of people because you could identify with those characters. It was a reality tale, while 'Basic Instinct' is like a detective novel that people like to read in the privacy of their homes. It's almost Gothic. It's certainly more dramatic. And the real question here is: is anybody really worthy of redemption?"
Mr. Verhoeven says he finds the themes of "Basic Instinct" elusive. He wanted to make a classic suspense film, in the Hitchcock mode (the movie has visual references to "Vertigo" and "Rear Window"), but with a 1990's update.
"In traditional films," the director says, "the killer lurks in a house and the victim walks into the kitchen, turns on the radio, makes coffee, opens a book, gets comfortable -- and then the killer strikes. In this film, the killer hides -- but on the bed. The situation is the same, but the two people are facing each other in bed, not the kitchen."

Much Ado About Shakespeare in Washington

BYLINE: By David Richards

DATELINE: WASHINGTON

 BODY:
History likes dates and this city likes its history. So Monday, March 2, 1992, will probably go down as the day the Shakespeare Theater came of age.
Of course, theaters, like people, mature slowly, erratically even. What may appear to be an overnight transformation has usually been in the works for seasons. A big breakthrough is no more than the accumulation of a lot of small breakthroughs. 
 Still, on March 2, the Shakespeare Theater officially inaugurated its new home in a converted downtown department store here, only a few blocks from the National Gallery of Art. The opening production, "Much Ado About Nothing," is as elegantly assured as any this increasingly assured troupe has managed. But more than that, it's the newly abbreviated name that strikes me as noteworthy: the Shakespeare Theater. Nothing more, nothing less.
If you read it as a declaration of independence -- and you should -- there has been no more heartening theatrical news out of Washington in a decade. While comparisons with the mighty classical theaters of Britain are still ludicrous, the Shakespeare Theater seems positioned as never before to make good on its ambition to become America's foremost classical theater.
For the last 22 years, the company has performed in a replica of the Globe Theater, tucked into one end of the Folger Library on Capitol Hill. As its fortunes waxed and waned, it was known variously as the Folger Theater Group, the Folger Theater and, finally, the Shakespeare Theater at the Folger. For a while, the library provided subsidies, and then, when money got tight, vague moral support, and sometimes not a whole lot of that. But in the early years, the affiliation with a prestigious library worked in the fledgling company's favor and helped to legitimize productions that were barely a notch above amateur.
Lately, however, few would deny that the situation had reversed itself. The theater company was helping to humanize the library and break down its forbidding reputation as an ivory tower. Certainly thousands of people -- 73,081 during the 1990-91 season -- who otherwise might not have set foot in the marble building, came to enjoy their evenings there and wander admiringly through the great hall at intermission.
Ironically, given the success the company was enjoying, there was a real danger of suffocation in staying put. The Folger's cramped Elizabethan stage had long since exhausted the ingenuity of directors and designers, who were obliged to work around fixed pillars and portals, while the 243-seat auditorium taxed the good will of the spectators, an alarming percentage of whom had to cope with obstructed views.
More ominous still, Shakespeare in such intimate quarters was proving economically ruinous. The theater played for 37 weeks last season at 103 percent capacity. Nonetheless, box-office revenues amounted to less than half the $4.5 million budget. Ticket prices had already reached a $42 top, and the company was loath to hike them any higher. A move was imperative.
The troupe is now a long-term tenant of the Lansburgh Building, an ambitious complex of rental apartments, shops and a 447-seat theater, fashioned out of what used to be Washington's preferred middle-class department store. (The entry is at 450 Seventh Street, N.W.) Operating costs will be more or less equivalent to those incurred at the library, but by nearly doubling its seating capacity and the potential for earned income, the company has theoretically hit upon a way to relieve some of the financial pressure.
In addition, it has acquired a modern proscenium stage twice as big as the Folger thrust stage (no pillars, either), an orchestra pit and a spacious lobby. In the handsome oval auditorium that could almost be viewed as a post-modern take on the Globe, there is not a bad seat or an uncomfortable one. The Boston-based architect Graham Gund is responsible for the design, and at a time when the Kennedy Center is beginning to look a little dowdy, it is especially fresh and inviting.
If only for accuracy's sake, the name change was necessary, lest customers head off to the wrong part of town. And yet there's more to it than that. Symbolically, it seems to me, the company is finally asserting a hard-won identity, staking out its claim as an institution unto itself, beholden only to a notion of excellence now tantalizingly within reach.
Its productions have no trouble holding their own alongside the best offerings of the Public Theater's Shakespeare marathon, which, like everything connected with the Public Theater these days, seems to be floundering. Tony Randall's National Actors Theater, which boasts "America's Finest Actors" in "Civilization's Greatest Plays," hasn't tackled Shakespeare yet. But so far, its renderings of Arthur Miller and Georges Feydeau hold out little promise for the day it does. At most of the country's not-for-profit theaters, Shakespeare has always been a staple. But his works are usually part of a spectrum that extends from the Greeks to a brand-new play just out of the workshop. Since they are not governed by an overriding classical esthetic, they tend to be hit-or-miss propositions.
For the greater part of its existence, the Shakespeare Theater didn't offer much better. If some endeavors were easier to take than others, more than a few -- a "Romeo and Juliet" set on carnival grounds, say, and played by gypsies and roustabouts -- were so much gimmickry running wild. Mostly, a dull, enervating competency prevailed. The company got its points for performing Shakespeare, not for performing him well. It was not all that unexpected to find yourself seated next to a spectator who was less interested in watching the play on stage than following it in the opened script on his lap.
Both the silliness and the stuffiness began to abate with the appointment of Michael Kahn as artistic director in the spring of 1986 (May 5, for the historians among us). Mr. Kahn had already run one classical enterprise, the American Shakespeare Theater in Connecticut, and he taught acting at the Juilliard School. (He still does; a few weeks ago he was named director of its drama division.) Among his first acts was to dissolve what had become a seriously inbred acting company and rebuild it from scratch.
As one of the early champions in Washington of nontraditional casting, he inducted a lot of young blood into the ranks. But he was equally determined to draw upon established actors (Pat Carroll, Stacy Keach, Brian Bedford, Avery Brooks), who, it turned out, were willing to give over some of their time at paltry wages if they could play the role of their dreams. It often made for a vigorous mix, even when a production had no particular stylistic innovations in mind.
The current "Much Ado" is, in fact, a good case in point. I suspect that Mr. Kahn's unabashed picture-postcard approach to the romantic comedy is what most people mean when they talk of traditional Shakespeare. Derek McLane's sets and Martin Pakledinaz's costumes seem to take their inspiration from Corot's Italian landscapes -- with their gurgling fountains, grape arbors and tiled courtyards in the foreground, and their undulating blue hills beyond. The soldiers are trim and dashing, the peasants well fed and spirited. The tables groan with food, and red wine flows liberally to the strains of a concertina. Indeed, the production offers such an abundant vision of country life as to prompt a stampede on the Italian tourist bureau.
Beatrice is played by Kelly McGillis and Benedick by David Selby. Because they are not an apparent match, the pairing is all the more beguiling in the end. He is tall and thin, with great spidery legs -- and when he steals across the courtyard, trying not to be noticed, he reminds you of the sweetly goofy creatures Dr. Seuss liked to draw. (In the gulling scene, Mr. Kahn puts the actor through some splendid contortions that have him, at one point, dangling from a leafy arbor and desperately treading thin air.) Mr. Selby sees Benedick as a tad insecure; his expressions of gallantry are awkward; and his flights of enthusiasm accentuate what can only be a late-lingering adolescence. Frankly, I liked him enormously just for not being the stuffed ham the character usually is.
Nor is the smolderingly beautiful Ms. McGillis the usual Beatrice. The actress makes "My lady tongue" less imperiously witty and hints tearfully at melancholy secrets in her past. Banter is how she protects herself; basically, she's shy and ill equipped for passion. When Benedick balks at her command to "Kill Claudio," all she can think to do in the flush of angry confusion is hurl herself at him and wrestle him furiously to the ground.
Like most productions, this one stumbles over the Claudio/Hero subplot. He's always struck me as callow and righteous; she, weepy and helpless. It's no different here. Otherwise, Mr. Kahn has put together an impressive array of solid performances, extending even to those minor roles that, in the past, would have been summarily filled by apprentices more willing than talented. Ted van Griethuysen finds in Leonato, graying governor and father of Hero, depths of dignity and feeling I've never seen elsewhere. (The actor, one of the company's most resourceful, could probably convince audiences that Attila the Hun had a sensitive streak.) Edward Gero's Don John might pass for a country gentleman out for a stroll, if the gravel in his voice and the shiftiness in his eyes didn't indicate baser aims. The deception is deft and subtle.
Floyd King, who leads the comic relief, as Dogberry, gets the predictable mileage out of that bumbler's malapropisms ("Be vigitant, I beseech you"). But he earns even more laughs simply by staring down the world with blissful self-confidence, when he plainly has no idea what's under his flame-colored nose. That he has been padded and made up to look like Napoleon's potbellied cousin -- so potbellied that he has to bend over backward just to stay upright -- only enhances the pomp and merriment.
"Much Ado" is eminently satisfying on its own sunny terms. But it also adds to a growing body of commendable work -- a "Merry Wives of Windsor" in which Ms. Carroll, no less, swaggered hilariously as Falstaff; a "Richard III" in which Mr. Keach played the vile monarch as the ultimate showman; and a "Merchant of Venice" led by Mr. Bedford as a Shylock of uncommon punctiliousness. That's what's so encouraging.
When he first assumed his current duties, Mr. Kahn ruffled some feathers by suggesting that Washington's talent pool was perhaps not sufficient to populate the sort of company he envisioned. "These are the most difficult plays in the world," he explained. "They are also the best, and they demand the best talent. If the best actor lives in Seattle or the best director in New York, that's who should be doing it. This place is called the Shakespeare Theater at the Folger -- not the Washington Shakespeare Theater at the Folger."
Now, it's the Shakespeare Theater. But the argument holds.

HEADLINE: Brazil's Pristine Playground

BYLINE: By JAMES BROOKE; JAMES BROOKE is head of the Rio de Janeiro bureau of The Times.

 BODY:
PAMPERED by the luxury of choosing among 4,600 miles of South Atlantic coastline, Brazilian beach connoisseurs increasingly choose Praia do Forte, a pastoral, seven-mile stretch of white sand, blue water and coconut palms.
While much of Brazil's coast rapidly succumbs to American-style strip development, this fishing village 800 miles north of Rio de Janeiro survives undisturbed, cocooned in a national park and protected by tough zoning laws. In addition to the primeval pleasure of walking for half an hour without crossing a single footprint in the sand, Praia do Forte offers comfortable lodging, excellent seafood and some intriguing birds, sea turtles and other wildlife. 
 At the foot of the village's beachfront lighthouse, turtle observation tanks and a museum display the work of Tamar, the world's largest project to conserve endangered sea turtles. Half a mile inland, the Sapiranga Ecological Reserve enshrines one of Brazil's last stands of primary Atlantic rain forest. And high on a nearby bluff, brooding stone arches and cannon-shaped water spouts recall an era when a 16th-century Portuguese castle here ruled over a private domain five times the size of New England.
The magnet of Praia do Forte draws an elite mix, as the Rio newspaper O Globo recently gushed, "Environmentalists, models, surfers, politicians, and movie and television stars.".
It is only beginning to crop up in American guidebooks on Brazil, but access for Americans is increasingly easy. Every Monday afternoon, Varig flies from Miami to Salvador. By arrangement, a minivan can shuttle visitors from the airport to Praia do Forte, 30 miles north on the newly paved Estrada do Coco, or Coconut Road.
My wife, Elizabeth, and I visited in September, a time when the Southern Hemisphere's winter rains disappear until the beginning of March. But in this languorous corner of the world, "winter" and "summer" have little meaning -- climate tables show that year round temperatures rarely dip below 70 degrees and rarely rise above 84 degrees. During the rainy "winter" months, March through August, the water here loses its smooth, azure quality and appears choppy and green. But swimming and sunning are year-round attractions.
The drive north made us appreciate the tranquil refuge that Praia do Forte has become. A divided highway at first, the road passes supermarkets and a petrochemical complex. Later a ribbon of asphalt, it passes vacation home developments, billboards beckoning weekenders and Brazil's equivalent of fast-food stands.
The state road ends abruptly at the southern edge of the wildlife reserve. At a right angle, an inauspicious, potholed dirt road continues one mile to Praia do Forte. Despite the tourist boom on Brazil's coast, this fishing village remains an intimate hamlet of sandy streets and low cottages with red-tiled roofs. On one afternoon, the only sounds were slapping dominoes played by two old men under the shade of a huge fig tree and the clopping of hoofs of a horse wandering riderless down the main street.
The pastoral atmosphere is no accident.
"Our slogan is: enjoy, don't destroy," said W. H. Klaus Peters, the German-Brazilian mastermind of the resort area, in a conversation in his office at the the Praia do Forte Resort Hotel, the largest of the village's nine hotels and inns.
In the 1960's Mr. Peters built a hotel in Sao Sebastiao, then a sleepy colonial port on the coast of Sao Paulo State. Soon after the hotel opened for business, Brazil's state oil company decided that Sao Sebastiao would be a good site for an oil tanker terminal.
Burned once, Mr. Peters, a Sao Paulo factory owner, thought big when he tried again. In 1972, well before ecotourism was an international byword, Mr. Peters and his brother, Manfred, bought a 25,000-acre coconut plantation that fronted on seven and a half miles of beach. The purchase gave him title to the fishing village of Praia, the castle ruins and the rain forest.
He created a foundation to administer the castle and turned the forest into a reserve administered by Brazil's federal environmental agency. The village's land title he donated to its inhabitants, but only after the municipality, Mata de Sao Joao, adopted in 1989 a series of strict zoning regulations -- a rarity for Latin America.
WITHIN the village of 3,000 inhabitants, buildings are limited to two stories and must be constructed of traditional native materials, such as roofing of colonial tiles or piassava palm fronds. No streets can be paved. No walls can be erected -- only fences. To prevent the kind of real estate speculation that has expelled fishing families from many of Brazil's coastal resorts, outsiders cannot buy village houses. Instead, houses can only be passed down within families. Although the village is open to the public, a police post placed squarely at the entrance discourages squatters and pickpockets schooled in the hard ways of Salvador, a city of 2.5 million people 50 miles to the south.
"Praia do Forte is one of Brazil's last authentic fishermen's villages," Mr. Peters said. "You can dance lambada in the village wearing a gold Rolex and nothing will happen to you."
Outside village limits, construction of vacation homes is limited to two stories, to traditional materials and to Mr. Peters's personal approval. Homeowners are required to plant four coconut palm trees for each one they cut down.
In another conservation effort, Mr. Peters encouraged Brazilian environmentalists to establish here, in 1980, the headquarters of the national turtle conservation project, Tamar, an acronym for tartarugas marinhas, or sea turtles in Portuguese. The richest nesting area along Brazil's coast, Praia do Forte is visited every October by hundreds of female sea turtles, which lay an average of 50,000 eggs in the sand . At first, Tamar workers had to collect eggs for artificial incubation. But due to a public education campaign and a new economic dependence on ecological tourism, fishermen stopped killing turtles and taking their eggs. Today the sea turtle has become Praia do Forte's symbol, featured on T-shirts and postcards sold in craft boutiques all over town.
Half of the proceeds from the sale of turtle shirts and souvenirs at the Tamar gift shop go to supporting what has become the world's largest sea turtle conservation project. Five of the world's eight sea turtle species swim in Brazilian waters and all are endangered. Tamar workers patrol 620 miles of Brazil's top nesting beaches, and this year they expect to release the one millionth turtle hatchling into the sea. The Tamar complex, accessible from the beach at the foot of the village lighthouse, includes a small museum and water tanks so visitors can observe sea turtles close up.
Turtle soup and turtle omelets long ago disappeared from menus of local restaurants. Instead, the village's half a dozen restaurants specialize in the Afro-Brazilian seafood cooking of Bahia State .
Plucked from the sea in the morning, shrimp, crab and fish end up seasoned with peanuts and palm oil on local plates in the evening. Beverages include passion fruit juice and chilled coconut milk. Restaurants, largely clustered around the Praca dos Artistas, or Artists' Square, include Tropical, Le Gaston, Boca Piu, Bar de Sousa and Bom Bordo.
We ate almost all our meals at our inn, Pousada Praia do Forte. Without the swimming pool and organized water sports of the Resort Hotel, the 18-bungalow Pousada has a low-key charm. Our palm-thatched bungalow, Badejo, came with full bath, king-sized bed and a hammock on the veranda, all 25 feet from the high-water mark on the beach.
Nighttime entertainment can be as simple as listening to the crickets as the moon rises over the South Atlantic. For the more active, several village lambaterias perpetuate the lambada, the popular sensual dance step..
During the day, visitors who start at Praia do Forte's landmark, the white-painted lighthouse, will discover the beach's wild beauty by strolling north. About a quarter mile from the lighthouse are the Papa Gente sea pools. Naturally carved from coral reefs, these two sand-bottomed pools fill chest high at high tide with crystal clear water. Unaided by diving masks or snorkels, waders can watch tropical fish swimming around these natural aquariums.
For the really energetic, a 10-mile hike takes one along isolated beaches to Imbassai. More fishing village than tourist town, Imbassai is accessible only by foot, by boat, or by jeep down a dirt track. Don't try to go by horse. The drays for rent in Praia do Forte proved to be lazy and expensive.
You can order lunch in advance from a 10-room inn at Imbassai, Lagoa da Pedra. To avoid sunburn, or even sunstroke, North American visitors should use sunblock year round and should walk only early in the day or late in the afternoon. Praia do Forte is 12 degrees closer to the Equator than the southernmost tip of Florida.
For a midday excursion, we disappeared into the cool and shaded ecological reserve. The Praia do Forte Resort Hotel provided a guide, who led us down forest trails, stopping to point out flora and fauna, including families of small monkeys, as well as a series of waterfalls where locals set handcrafted conical fish traps. Few guides, indeed few people at Praia do Forte, speak English. Non-Portuguese-speaking visitors may want to forgo the guide and wander on their own with a map sketched by a hotel receptionist.
Across from the road entrance to the Praia do Forte Resort Hotel is a lagoon and wetlands that contain another natural area, the Timeantuba Bird Reserve. Exploring by canoe, the casual naturalist can easily spot alligators, and the trained bird watcher can spot many of the 173 bird species that have been identified in the reserve.
Or one can hike or drive the three miles from the Praia do Forte Resort Hotel to the hilltop ruins of what looks like a fortified medieval manor house.
After Portugal laid claim to Brazil in 1500, the first settlers came to the Salvador area from southern Portugal, a feudal area with a tradition of great estates. In 1549 Salvador became the colonial capital of Brazil, and Tome de Souza became the colonial governor. Knowing about as much about Brazil as we know today about the planet Mars, the Portuguese crown awarded to Garcia d'Avila, the governor's bailiff, an estate that stretched over 308,000 square miles, an area about the size of Britain and France combined.
In 1549 the colonial grandee imported cattle and coconut palms from the Portuguese colony in Goa, India. After surveying his new lands, he started in 1552 to build his castle on a low bluff here, the highest promontory for miles around.
"It is the largest secular stone construction from colonial Brazil," said Mr. Peters. Searches of colonial archives in Portugal and in the Netherlands failed to produce a blueprint or even a drawing of the completed structure. Archeologists do not know if Garcia d'Avila dismantled a castle in Portugal and carried it here, or if he built his castle from ship's ballast stones and locally quarried stone.
Today the ruins rise three stories. The low arches, thick walls and fortified church tower reflect fear of sea attacks from pirates and hostile European powers and land attacks from Tupi-Guarani indians.
For over two centuries, the castle and its vast domains remained in the hand of the Garcia d'Avila family, constituting by the end of the 1700's the largest private property in the world, said Mr. Peters, founder of the Garcia D'Avila Foundation. As late as the 1850's, the stone manor house was occupied.
Slowly, the empire ruled from the mansion dwindled from 129 plantations to the sole Praia do Forte plantation that Mr. Peters owns today.
"It is the oldest plantation in continous use in Brazil," Mr. Peters said, waving toward long lines of coconut palms, some descended from coconuts brought here half a millennium ago from the beaches of Goa.

HEADLINE: Perspectives: West Orange;
Home Builders Step Up Construction

BYLINE: By ALANS S. OSER

DATELINE: WEST ORANGE, N.J.

 BODY:
OTHER builders around New Jersey may differ, but Sam M. Gershwin is betting on a pick-up in the home-buying market. He says the evidence is already in hand. It's nothing dramatic, but it's enough to lead the building company in which he is a partner to accelerate production.
Mr. Gershwin is in charge of a town-house development here called The Highlands at West Essex, in rolling country off Oval Road, near the borough of Essex Fells. It is one of several New Jersey projects of Garden Homes Development of Short Hills. Eventually, there are to be 300 houses on the 65-acre site. 
 "This year there is more confidence among the buying public than than last year," Mr. Gershwin said. "We can tell from the number of people who come in and the way they talk. We're getting 35 to 65 visits per weekend, substantially more than last year."
The Highlands also has had 12 sales since the beginning of the year, which is double what it had by this time last year, Mr. Gershwin said.
What the coming months will show about sales is not certain, but what is striking in this Essex County township is that a sense of confidence has led building organizations with financial strength to step up the pace of construction over last year.
Using financing from its own company funds rather than a construction loan, Garden Homes, a long-established development organization, has started the framing for 35 houses at the Highlands, which are in clusters of 4 to 7 units.
At another location in West Orange, the same building organization has begun construction on 70 additional town houses at a project called Scenic Hill, near the Livingston and Short Hills line. "Even in a bad market last year we sold close to 100 units," said the executive in charge, Walter Oberlander. The development has a construction loan from First Fidelity Bank.
And at a third location in West Orange, another long-time New Jersey builder, Bertram Associates, based in Union, has started 50 town houses at a 271-unit project called Crystal Woods, near an established residential neighborhood off Exit 7 of Route 280.
THE West Orange developments also are notable as an illustration of the spectrum of settings and housing product with which builders seek to attract middle-income buyers to town-house communities. The average price is about $200,000 and the range is from $120,000 to $250,000, but the environmental differences among the locations are perhaps even more substantial than the price differences imply.
At Scenic Hill, units sell for as little as $120,000. Three other models sell between $140,000 and $155,000. In West Orange, this is as close to "affordable" as new housing gets.
The trouble spot for the sellers is unemployment, or the fear of it, by a significant number of possible buyers. "Many people still have a nagging fear of losing their job," said Michael A. Borodinsky, head of the central New Jersey branch office of Arbor National Mortgage Company, in Clark, through which many buyers at new developments have obtained mortgages.
The positive elements are that the interest rates have fallen, making home buying more affordable to a wider income range of buyers, said Mr. Borodinsky, and prices have declined. At The Highlands, prices were shaved by 10 percent on two models last August. Sales picked up.
WEST ORANGE is a township of 39,300 people living in about 11,000 housing units, spread out over 12 square miles. There are five golf courses, one of them public.
Roughly 1,500 condominiums were built in the 80's, says Susan Borg, the director of planning and development. "We have had so much development in condominiums that now we're looking not to approve them," she said. In one case last year, the zoning board refused to renew its approval of a 46-unit project on Pleasant Valley Road that lapsed when the builder failed to start construction.
Those projects already approved and begun are far from completed. At The Highlands, for example, 105 houses have been built and occupied. The current, third phase started a year ago and occupancy began in November. Last year's construction pace was 15 to 20 units, Mr. Gershwin said, compared with the 35 to 40 planned this year.
The architect, the Cahill Partnership, based in Reddington Township, has created four house models. The lowest-priced unit sells for $175,000 and constitutes 40 percent of the project. It offers 1,900 square feet of space plus a garage and basement, and illustrates the builder's effort to capture the young professional buyer, often a single person.
There are also two midpriced models, selling between $201,500 and $238,500, and constituting 55 percent of the units, and a $249,500 ranch model with a two-car garage.
Not surprisingly for a development that has brought housing to a new, exclusive location in the community and was long in the planning and development stage, there was an initial burst of buying. But last year, after a "reasonable" March and April, sales slowed drastically. A pick-up after the price cut in August help push total sales for the year to 30.
ALSO well advanced as part of the current phase of construction is a 5,000-square-foot clubhouse near a small lake built for water detention purposes. The secluded location borders the Essex Fells Country Club and a property called Pleasantdale Farm, which is owned by the Allied Corporation and used as a corporate retreat.
Mr. Gershwin sees nothing of the ebullience buyers showed in the mid-80's, when they might have bought a new home before selling one they already owned. That phenomenon was spurred in part by fears of price increases, which builders played upon to stimulate sales.
One buyer representative of the current attitude is Janice Murray, a district manager for A.T.& T. who is in contract to buy a Highlands unit. She sold her house in Plainsboro before buying, and it took her only four days to do it once she allowed buyers to view it. "I priced it fairly and I made sure it was in good condition," she said. "I let no one in until I was satisfied with its condition."
Garden Homes Development is a 32-year-old building company founded by the Wilf family, which was in the lumber business. In addition to town houses it develops single-family houses and commercial projects and it owns rental apartments as well. The single-family sites include Shackamaxon Estates, in Scotch Plains; Concord Park, in East Hanover, and Jade Meadows in Springfield. Other town-house projects are Castle Ridge, in East Hanover township, and Park Place in Springfield.
Crystal Woods, the Bertram Associates project, also is a project of a long-established building organization, whose president is Larry Pantirer. The architect for Crystal Woods is the Chester Partnership, based in Laurence Harbor.
THE project is planned as 265 town houses and 6 single-family houses on 47 acres, built as groups of 3 to 7 units, with motor courts serving private garages. The units are linked by a 10-foot element that the builder calls a lanai, a porch with enclosed storage space beneath that gives the units spatial separation. Occupancy has begun on the 98-unit first phase. There are three models, priced at $175,000, $185,000 and $210,000.
The effect of lower interest rates as an aid to sales was stressed by Mr. Borodinsky of Arbor National Mortgage. With interest rates at 8 percent for a 30-year loan, for example, a household with $74,000 in income could qualify for a 90 percent mortgage on a unit selling for $180,000, he said. A year ago, with rates at 9 1/2 percent, that household would have needed an income of at least $81,000.

HEADLINE: Talking: Mortgages;
Resolving Errors in Payments

BYLINE: By ANDREE BROOKS

 BODY:
THE makeup of monthly mortgage payments has become so complex in recent years that many borrowers wonder whether their lender is correctly calculating how much of the loan has been paid off.
Some borrowers may be concerned that their principal balance isn't dropping as sharply as it should, given the additional voluntary payments they have made. Or they may wonder why a large repayment of the principal is still due at the end of the term on a 15- or 25-year loan. Others may suspect that the payments due on their adjustable-rate mortgages are not reflecting the full extent of the drop in interest rates over the last year. 
 Peter Helie, president of William Pitt Real Estate of Fairfield County, Conn., was surprised to discover after an investigation in January that he had been overcharged by about $800 in interest on two variable-rate mortgages he was carrying. Even as a professional in the business, he said, "most of the time you tend to pay what you're billed without question."
Still others may worry because their loan was sold to a servicing company in another state and errors may have crept into the bookkeeping as a result. Further, the highly publicized accounts in recent months concerning the overstuffing of tax escrow accounts for tax payments by major companies such as General Mortgage Acceptance Corporation have added to the growing unease among consumers.
The borrowers least likely to be victims of errors are those with fixed-rate mortgages who pay their property taxes directly rather than through the lender, said Richard Roll, president of Mortgage Monitor. Founded early in 1991, with offices in New York City and Norwalk, Conn., the company regularly conducts custom audits on a borrower's behalf.
Those whose payments are regularly adjusted because they have a variable-rate loan and those whose taxes are paid by the lender are more prone to error, he said. The danger increases if the borrower has made voluntary payments to cut the principal balance or if the company servicing the mortgage is changed.
There also is a potential for problems if a variable rate loan carries a negative amortization provision. This feature holds the payments due at the same level even if interest rates rise by tapping paid-off principal to temporarily make up the difference. This is the feature, incidentally, that can lengthen the term of the loan unexpectedly.
There are several ways to get to the root of it all. Borrowers can pay a private service to handle the analysis and negotiate with the lender for any refund due. They can do most of the work themselves with the aid of a printout or a computer program supplied by a financial publisher. Or they can work from something called a "transactional history" normally supplied free by the lender.
Keith Gumbinger, an analyst with HSH Associates of Butler, N.J., a company that monitors mortgage rates nationwide, recommends first contacting whatever company is currently handling monthly payments, even if it is not the one that originated the loan. It should be able to provide a detailed payment history at no charge, he said. Much of this information will be needed even if a private company or a computer program will later be used for an analysis.
In some cases, a complete payments history may not be available. Richard DeLeo, vice president in charge of loan adminstration for Countrywide Funding of Pasadena, Calif., a company that services some 270,000 residential mortgages, said some mortgages taken over midstream arrive at his offices with incomplete files.
If so, Countrywide will try to recreate an accurate history. But if there are discrepancies the burden will be on the borrower to substantiate certain payments -- such as voluntary additions to principal -- through canceled checks. If there genuinely seems to be an error, Countrywide will work with the original lender to sort it all out.
BUT, Mr. DeLeo warned that it is unlikely any servicing company will make good on a shortfall or overpayment charged by a prior company that is now out of business. "We don't take the responsibility for someone else's errors," he said.
People who prefer to do the audit themselves can take this information and any pertinent facts listed on the original loan document -- such as the index to be used for rate adjustments -- and work with computer software to get a handle on what's been going on before challenging the lender.
Banker's Secret of Elizabethville, N.Y., sells for $39.95 a computer program and explanatory manual for this sort of analysis suitable for I.B.M. compatible machines. (Box 78, Elizabethville, N.Y. 12523, or call (800) 255-0899)
Peter Kaufmann, a high school mathematics teacher in New City, N.Y., used the program to track the extent to which he should have shortened the term of a $70,000 mortgage he took out in 1984 on a four-bedroom house. He had been paying an extra $100 a month toward the principal balance for five years. The bank, he said, was unable to help. Since it was an adjustable loan, he said, "it had been very difficult to track." The program showed him he would acually cut the loan term in half if he continued to make the extra payments. "It works wonders," he said.
For $15.95 Banker's Secret also will provide a printout of the full amortization schedule from Day One for anyone with a fixed-rate loan. For example, Michael Frasier of Albany is using a custom-modified schedule of this sort to make sure his bank is correctly crediting his voluntary additional payments. Financial Publishing Company of Boston (phone 1-617-262-4040) offers similar services.
Those who prefer to let a professional handle the audit and analysis should contact a company like Mortgage Monitor -- (800) AUDIT-USA -- or Consumer Loan Advocates of Lake Bluff, Ill. -- (708) 615-0024). With Mortgage Monitor the client can pay either a flat $149 or a contingency fee equal to 35 percent of the overcharge. A further $49 is charged if the company has to get the history itself.
The custom audit determines if all rate adjustments were correct, if the correct level of interest was paid on the escrow balances and if the size of the balance is excessive, if the borrower has paid down the principal to an extent that permits the elimination of private mortgage insurance and if voluntary principal payments were correctly credited.
If errors are found, the company will collect the refund from the lender on the client's behalf and make sure corrections are made.

HEADLINE: Cost of Home-Buying Falls to '74 Levels

BYLINE: By SHAWN G. KENNEDY

 BODY:
LAST winter, Lisa and David Osterman toured dozens of homes in and around Princeton, N.J., in search of one to buy. But by spring they threw in the towel and signed a lease for another rental.
"We saw places in our price range," said Mr. Osterman, "but nothing we felt was worth the money." 
 Their decision to wait paid off. Last month, the Ostermans signed a contract to buy a builder's last house in a small development of 9 homes being built in Ewing Township outside Trenton. They will pay $228,000, near the top of their budget, for a 2,700-square-foot, four-bedroom home.
In the last year, the Ostermans' home-buying dollars, like those of thousands of other buyers, have been stretched by a substantial dip in mortgage interest rates, which last month fell to their lowest level in 20 years, and the continued drop in home prices. This double-barreled benefit has not only been a boon to first-time buyers, but, in the New York region, has also nudged some long-absent trade-up buyers back into the market.
"What a difference a year can make," said Mr. Osterman. "We are getting so much more than if we had bought last year. We thought a new home in this area was beyond our $230,000 budget. Better interest rates are helping us afford this house. We are glad we didn't settle for what we could afford last year."
A Mercer County location is important, he said, because the commuting time is about the same to his law office in Newark as it is to his wife's job as a marketing representative of a Virginia-based food company in Philadelphia.
Not since 1974, says the National Association of Home Builders, have homes been as affordable as they are today. Even so, this has not given sales in the New York area or other parts of the country the boost the real estate industry has been yearning for. Industry observers say the lingering effects of a sour economy, the glut of new housing and, most significant of all, fear of the future, are to blame.
From December 1990 to January 1992 interest rates slid by more than 1 percentage point, from 9.84 to about 8.51. Since January, the average rate on a 30-year, fixed-rate loan has bumped up a bit to about 8.8 percent, but mortage money still is much cheaper than it was just a year ago.
Lower rates and lower prices increased the buying power of the typical family by 13 percent from the last quarter of 1990 and the same period in 1991, the National Association of Home Builders has figured. The trade group's calculation was based on the sale prices of 459,476 new and existing homes in 191 markets across the country in that period. John Tuccillo, chief economist for the National Association of Realtors, another trade group that tracks home sales and measures affordability, said that the lower prices and interest rates have had a bigger impact in the New York region than in the rest of the country.
"Prices went so high in the 80's," he said, "so the fallback is more dramatic."
Denise Mangini, a sales associate in the Princeton, N.J., office of Audrey Short Realty, who served as the broker for the Ostermans, said the prices for the first homes built in the development where they are buying were in the $230,000 to $260,000 range.
"I believe it was a break for them to be the last buyers in," she said. "The same home would have been priced higher. By waiting, they saved. And they could have gotten the home for $219,000 -- that was the price of the basic, no-frills model."
The features the Ostermans are putting in added about $9,000 to the price.
By delaying their purchase by a year, the Ostermans benefited in another way. After deciding not to buy last year, they found an apartment at $500 a month less than what they had been paying in their previous location. What they save on rent is going toward the down payment fund.
By summer, when the new home is to be ready, they expect to add an additional $6,000 to $7,000 to that fund.
WHILE brokers say that home and apartment prices have retreated to 1985-86 levels, the real bait for trade-up buyers to venture back has been the dip in interest rates.
"These days it usually takes more than lower prices to entice the people who already own homes," said Robert Eychner, president of a Manhattan real estate company that bears his name. "People have been watching prices drop for more than two years now. They are used to it."
Mr. Eychner said that some of the apartment owners who are testing the waters are looking again because they see that the kinds of units they had to pass up during most of the 80's are now drifting into their price range.
"What is different about the current climate is that interest rates have fallen to the point where the cost of borrowing makes a trade-up worthwhile," said Mr. Eychner, "even for those who might have to give up a profit or take a small loss on the sale of the place they own now."
The 1980's are now notorious for having been a decade of double-digit interest rates and soaring prices. But according to the National Association of Realtors, the median resale price of one-family homes in the metropolitan region has been declining steadily since 1989. That year it peaked at $183,600. In the last quarter of 1991, the trade association put a preliminary median cost at $170,800.
At the same time, interest rates have fallen from 10.27 percent on a 30-year, fixed-rate loan in 1989 to the current level of about 8.8 percent on the same type of mortgage.
To afford a home at the 1989 price, the trade association calculated that a buyer would need an annual income of $63,020. During the last quarter of 1991, it took an income of $52,066 to qualify for a mortgage on a median-priced home. The calculation is based on a down payment of 20 percent of the purchase price.
But all this has not made the region a bargain by any means. New York and its suburbs still rank among the most expensive places to buy a home. Only people in California cities like San Diego, San Francisco and Los Angeles are worse off when income and home prices are compared.
In the San Francisco bay area, for example, the National Association of Realtors put the median-priced home at $252,000 and calculated that a buyer would need an income of about $78,000 to purchase it. The median income for the region is about $34,000.
That the gap between income and prices is still an insurmountable hurdle for many households can be seen in the affordability index of the National Association of Realtors. Its calculations say that families in the New York region with the median income of $33,492 earned only 64.3 percent of what it took to buy the median-priced home.
Still, there has been a significant improvement since 1989, when the median income of $30,867 was only 42 percent of the $63,020 needed to buy the median-priced home in the region.
"There is no question that what we have now is an unprecedented opportunity," said Jay Shackford, director of marketing for the National Association of Home Builders. "The reason that we are not seeing more movement is that people are still nervous. They may not be out of a job but they are seeing the giants cut back and they wonder who will be next. Everything is there but buyer confidence."
Buyers with the most leverage in this market are people like Ingrid Johnson, a professor at the Fashion Institute of Technology in Manhattan, and her husband, Gary Bunton, an investment banker, who bought their condominium apartment in Greenwich Village in the early 1980's, before prices in Manhattan started to soar.
They are close to signing a contract for another Manhattan apartment, which, at 3,000 square feet, is twice the size of the three-bedroom duplex they live in now with their three children.
"We could continue to stay where we are and be comfortable," said Ms. Johnson. "Our daughters are still small and because our apartment is a duplex it seems like more space than if it were on one level."
Their daughters share a bedroom now, Ms. Johnson said, "but we knew the time would come when they would want more privacy and space."
"Interest rates are so good now that we realized if we were going to move there would probably be no better time than now to do it," she added. The last time they checked the market, she said, was about two years ago, just before their third child was born. At the time, she and her husband felt prices were too high to justify a move.
"WE would not have been able to get an apartment that was much bigger than the one we have now," she said. "For a lot more space we would have had to go to the suburbs. We are city people and the commute would not be worth the savings."
The seller of the loft Ms. Johnson and Mr. Bunton plan to buy put his apartment on the market 18 months ago for $1.2 million. The price has been cut several times since then. Mr. Eychner, who is the couple's broker, said they will make a deal at around half the the original asking price.
Ms. Johnson and Mr. Bunton expect to come out ahead with the sale of their Greenwich Village apartment. They plan to ask somewhere in the high $400,000's.
But it has not been only upper-income families who have been able to take advantage of the favorable home-buying climate. Last fall, Danny and Nancy Salgado moved from an apartment in Yonkers into the first home of their own, in Yonkers, after 16 years of marriage.
In their case, it took not only the dramatic change in the home market and the fall in interest rates but also special state programs to make homes more affordable.
Like many families, the Salgados saw their dream of home ownership move beyond their grasp during the 80's.
THEY found that even with two incomes -- Mr. Salgado is a pest-control technician and his wife is an office receptionist -- rent on an apartment large enough for their family of five did not give them much room for putting money aside for a down payment. With a combined income of $43,812, well above the area's median income of $33,492, the Salgados' wages still would not stretch to cover mortgage payments on most homes.
Last year Mrs. Salgado put the family's name in a pool of candidates for an affordable unit in Trinity Court, a new 30-unit townhouse styled complex in Yonkers.
"I had my heart set on buying one of the homes in Trinity Court," said Mrs. Salgado, whose three children are 18-year-old Nancy Lizette, 14-year-old Danny Jr. and 8-year-old Natalie. "But at the same time we were applying for a home there, our daughter was about to start college. Even with the lower price I didn't see how we could make it work."
Their leg-up in the market came in the form of a special low-interest, low- down-payment home-loan program sponsored by the State of New York Mortgage Agency, known as Sonny Mae. The agency's mortgage programs are designed for people who otherwise would have little chance of buying a home.
The agency issues bonds to generate a pool of money for mortgages, and public and private affordable-housing organizations have been using the low rates and favorable prices to put more middle- and low-income buyers into their first homes. The Salgados' income made them eligible for one of the lower-priced homes in Trinity Court.
The three-bedroom unit they bought would normally sell for $124,500. But a $25,000 grant from the state's Affordable Housing Agency brought the price down to $99,500. The down payment on the Sonny Mae loan from the Bank of New York was 5 percent of the purchase price, or $4,975.
"We have a beautiful home now," said Mr. Salgado, "But the best part of being an owner is that we are building equity instead of just paying rent."

HEADLINE: UConn Team's Success Is Well-Kept Secret

BYLINE: By JACK CAVANAUGH

 BODY:
EVEN during this mildest of winters, most evenings are chilly on the University of Connecticut campus at Storrs -- cold enough to make watching a hockey game at the outdoor rink a numbing experience. At a time when the UConn men's and women's basketball teams play their home games in a glitzy new arena, the men's hockey team is one of the few college squads still relegated to playing out in the cold.
Despite that handicap the hockey team has enjoyed its best season ever. That will probably come as news to many UConn basketball fans, quite a few of whom may not know that the university even has a hockey team. 
 While students must rely on a lottery to obtain basketball tickets, no tickets are required to watch the Husky hockey team play. The rink's grandstand accommodates about 1,500 fans, but it never comes close to being filled.
After losing three of their first four games, the Huskies (the nickname seems especially appropriate for this hardy breed of athlete) went unbeaten during their next 23 games before losing last weekend to Babson College in the final of the Eastern College Athletic Conference Division III tournament at Middlebury College in Vermont. (Though most of its sports program are in Division I, the highest level of competition, UConn is permitted to play some sports, like hockey, on a lower level. These Connecticut teams are not eligible to play in national tournaments.)
Despite its sparkling performance, the hockey team played at home before small crowds that averaged 300 and drew practically no media attention. Where the basketball team often attracts as many as 100 reporters, the hockey team, when playing at home, draws 1, from the student newspaper, The Daily Campus.
Lamar Chance of the UConn sports information office provides coverage of the team for about a dozen newspapers in Connecticut and Massachusetts. "After home games I go back to my office and write a couple of paragraphs and file it by modem," he said. When the team is on the road, the assistant coach, Brian Verrier, phones Mr. Chance with a summary, so he can compile a few papagraphs for the newspapers. Do Mr. Chance's stories always make the papers? "At least a paragraph or two, usually do," he said. "But we got better coverage as the season went on."
Not only was this the team's best season ever, but it was its third winning year in a row, something that happened only twice before since hockey became a varsity sport at Connecticut in 1960-61.
Much of the credit for Connecticut's recent hockey success has gone to Bruce Marshall, the head coach since 1988. Mr. Marshall, 29 years old, a 1985 UConn graduate, played varsity hockey for four years and was co-captain of the 1984-85 team, the first Husky squad to qualify for the E.C.A.C. playoffs.
 
Breaking Five Records
 "Our seniors were freshmen when I took over, and we've been together for four years," said Mr. Marshall, whose first team won only 6 of 27 games. "They've been the catalysts this season."
The chief catalyst has been Bryan Krygier, a senior forward from Bloomfield Hills, Mich., who broke five school scoring records this season. Most of those records had been held by his brother, Todd, Mr. Marshall's teammate at UConn, who now plays for the Washington Capitals of the National Hockey League. Bryan Krygier, who is a co-captain of the team, set records in career and season points, career and season assists and season goals.
"Todd was happy for me when I broke his records," said Mr. Krygier, who transferred to UConn after having spent a year at the University of Illinois at Chicago, which plays in Division I. Todd Krygier attended the Huskies' game against the University of Massachusetts, Boston, when his brother broke his career assists record. When he was taken by the Hartford Whalers in the 1988 supplemental draft, Todd Krygier became the first UConn player to enter the N.H.L. His brother Bryan may become the second. Scouts from a half-dozen N.H.L. teams, including the New York Rangers, have watched him in action this season.
A third Krygier brother, Mike, a UConn junior, finished second to Bryan this season in total points and assists and was third in goals scored.
Asked to compare Todd and Bryan Krygier, Mr. Marshall said: "Todd has great speed and a tremendous shot. Bryan is a great playmaker, with exceptional vision and great decision-making skills."
By producing an N.H.L. player, UConn's hockey program was enhanced, the coach said. "It's nice to be able to tell a prospective recruit that Todd Krygier came out of our program," he said.
Selling UConn hockey to prospective players has not always been easy. The main drawback has been the 31-year-old outdoor rink, which has a roof that looks like an overturned ship's hull. Though it extends downward on the sides, the roof still leaves both ends of the rink exposed. Windblown snow has been a problem during games.
"It is a hindrance in recruiting," Mr. Marshall said. "But then, in recruiting we stress the value of a UConn education. And we tell kids that if they're not going to come here because of the rink, then they're making their decision for the wrong reason."
As for being overshadowed by the men's basketball team, Mr. Marshall said that, if anything, its success has helped the hockey program. "Quite often, when I'm talking with a recruit, they'll say, 'I've seen your basketball team on television,' " the coach said.
Bryan Krygier, who scored 36 goals this season to break the previous record of 34 set by Harry Geary during the 1985-86 season, said he was not bothered by playing home games outdoors. "After a while you get used to it," he said.
Not all visiting players do. Most teams dislike playing at UConn. The warming hut near the rink, which serves as a locker room, has no showers. Visiting players have to go to other campus buildings to shower.
 
More Victories, More Fans
 All of the other rinks where UConn plays have locker rooms and showers. And some, like the one at the United States Military Academy, are downright luxurious. When the Huskies and Army played to a 4-4 tie at West Point late last month, about 2,500 spectators were in attendance.
Still, the home crowds at Storrs have been getting bigger. "Since we've been winning, more fans have been coming out," Bryan Krygier said.
Of the 26 players on the UConn squad, only four are from Connecticut. Fifteen are from Massachusetts, and most of the others are from elsewhere in the Northeast.
"There are some great young hockey players in Connecticut, and we'd like to get more of them," said Mr. Marshall, who scouts high school players in New England, New York and New Jersey.
Mr. Marshall knows that luring players to UConn would be much easier if there were a closed-in rink on campus, he said. UConn's athletic director, Lew Perkins, agreed.
He would like to replace the rink, Mr. Perkins said. "But given our priorities and the state of the economy, I'd be lying to you if I said we were going to do it by next season or the year after. But eventually we'll have to do it."
Mr. Perkins estimated that enclosing the rink and installing locker rooms and restrooms would cost $2 million to $3 million. When that happens, UConn will lose the distinction of having one of the few open-air hockey rinks in American collegiate circles, a distinction the Huskies can live without.

HEADLINE: The State of the Manhattan Commute

BYLINE: By JAY ROMANO

 BODY:
A SALESMAN who is a half-hour late for a power breakfast with his biggest customer, or a lawyer who misses most of her daughter's first piano recital, might find it hard to believe. But the daily journey of New Jersey's half-million commuters to and from Manhattan, transportation experts say, has been improving in terms of congestion and delays.
In part, that reflects some substantial investments by the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey in ramp repair and track maintenance. More significant, though, is the fact that the ranks of New Jersey commuters have been dwindling of late. Last year, the total number of individual trips under and over the river, most of them by commuters, was 406.6 million, down about 8 million from 1990. 
 "There's a little less congestion on everything," said Richard C. Leone, the Port Authority's chairman, "and that is very noticeable during rush hours. It's probably a byproduct of the recession."
 
Loss of 300,000 Jobs
 Fewer New Jerseyans have jobs to commute to, he suggested. Over the last four years, New York City has lost about 300,000 jobs.
The Manhattan-bound commuting network includes PATH and N.J. Transit trains, the Holland and Lincoln Tunnels, the Weehawken and Hoboken ferries and the George Washington Bridge.
Because the network is so interconnected, a problem in one area often spills over into others. Word of a stalled train sends riders scurrying to their cars; a delay at one tunnel evokes a backup at the other. But a little competition within the network can sometimes help relieve congestion. The success of the two small ferry lines has siphoned off about 13,500 commuters a day who would otherwise be using the tunnels, rails, bridge or PATH.
An experimental electronic toll-collection program for specially equipped buses using the Lincoln Tunnel is proceeding well, the Port Authority says, and is helping the traffic flow. And the $900 million spent to improve PATH's efficiency and the $100 million spent on improving approaches to the George Washington Bridge have helped substantially, Mr. Leone said.
 
Improved Performance
 Even N.J. Transit trains, sometimes criticized for failing to meet their schedules, have achieved a better on-time performance.
The overall satisfaction with the commuting network expressed by transportation officials, however, is not always shared by individual commuters. Random interviews found some people with new complaints -- a Maplewood resident, for example, who observed an increase in PATH delays in recent months, or a Manalapan resident who complained that the N.J. Transit buses had been more crowded lately.
But in general, those interviewed said either that they had seen some slight improvement in their commute or, more often, that they had seen no particular change in the last year.
One common refrain, however, was unhappiness with the increases in fares paid by many New Jersey commuters. The cost of driving a car back and forth across the bridge or through the tunnels, for example, rose by one-third last April. As of July 1990, fares rose on N.J. Transit trains; the cost of a one-month commuter ticket from Edison, for example, jumped from $139 to $171.
For those Manhattan-bound commuters who use the Port Authority bridge and tunnels to get to work, the future is likely to look a great deal like the present. Mr. Leone says he expects no fare increases in the near future.
An N.J. Transit spokesman, Jeff Lamm, would make no such predictions because of uncertainty over the amount of Federal mass-transit funds that will be available in fiscal 1993.
The Port Authority estimates that by 2015, the commuting population will rise by only 15 percent. Long before then, a number of developments should have improved the transportation network's efficiency.
In light of the success of the ferries, the Port Authority is studying preliminary proposals for additional ferries at other points along the waterfront.
The expansion of the electronic toll-taking program at the Lincoln Tunnel to a greater number of buses and possibly to vans and automobiles should help speed the flow of traffic within the next five years, the Port Authority says.
The major change that is apt to occur first, however, involves N.J. Transit, though its impact will also be felt elsewhere in the commuter network. A recently enacted Federal transportation bill provides funds that will allow nearly all N.J. Transit train passengers to take trains heading directly into New York City. Many of these passengers now use PATH.
PATH SYSTEM
The Port Authority Trans Hudson system carries nearly 100,000 passengers a day into the World Trade Center and to stations from Christopher Street to 33d Street.
A network of buses and trains takes commuters to the main PATH stations in Hoboken, Newark and Jersey City. For example, independently operated vans and buses along with state-owned N.J. Transit buses deliver commuters to Newark's Pennsylvania Station and Journal Square in Jersey City, and passengers switch to PATH trains for the last leg of their journey into Manhattan.
Over the last few years PATH ridership has remained relatively constant at about 52 million passenger-trips each year. But in 1991 it fell by about 600,000.
The PATH fare has remained at $1 each way since 1987, and the Port Authority expects no change in the near future.
N.J. TRANSIT

A public transportation service, N.J. Transit is operated by the New Jersey Transit Corporation, a state agency created in 1979. Its 1,800 buses serve 154 routes, and its 642 trains operate on 12 rail lines.
N.J. Transit buses, along with dozens of independent bus operators, use the George Washington Bridge in Fort Lee, the Lincoln Tunnel in Weehawken and the Holland Tunnel in Jersey City to transport nearly 140,000 commuters into Manhattan on an average weekday.
N.J. Transit trains from the south connect with Amtrak's Northeast Corridor and take some commuters directly into Penn Station in Manhattan. N.J. Transit trains from northern and western New Jersey end their runs at the Hoboken Terminal, where passengers change to PATH or commuter ferries.
Between 1990 and 1991, the total number of passenger trips on direct-to-New York trains dropped from about 23,000 to 21,850.
Over the years, fare increases may have played a role. For example, the monthly commuter fare from Metro Park in Edison to Penn Station in Manhattan was $139 in 1988. In 1991 the same monthly ticket cost $171.
Officials of N.J. Transit are concerned that a rail fare increase may be inevitable if Federal transportation operating subsidies -- the staple of most urban mass-transit systems -- are cut, as anticipated, in President Bush's fiscal 1993 budget.
Within the next few years, N.J. Transit officials say, two major developments are in store for their rail commuters. The projects will be paid for with hundreds of millions of dollars in Federal funds earmarked for capital expenditures. One project will connect the Morris and Essex lines with Amtrak's Northeast Corridor at Kearny. That will make it possible for passengers on those lines to commute directly into Manhattan, bypassing the Hoboken Terminal and the PATH system.
In addition, the Secaucus transfer will allow N.J. Transit passengers from the north to switch at a new station in to trains running directly into New York on Amtrak's Northeast Corridor.
GEORGE WASHINGTON
 BRIDGE
Owned and operated by the Port Authority, the bridge was opened to traffic in 1931. It is the only 14-lane suspension bridge in the world.
On an average weekday nearly 200,000 auto and bus passengers pass through the 31 tollbooths on the New Jersey side. The number of passenger trips in 1991 was 151.2 million, down 4.2 million from 1990.
The fare, which includes travel in both directions, was raised from $3 to $4 in April 1991. A 20-ticket book for the bridge can be purchased for $60, a daily saving of $1.
Over the last year the Port Authority has been making extensive repairs on the ramps and approaches leading to both the New Jersey and New York sides of the bridge. Those repairs have taken place largely at night and on weekends, causing few delays for commuters. As much as $100 million has been spent in the last few years on maintenance and upgrading of the bridge.
LINCOLN TUNNEL
The tunnel, which is also owned by the Port Authority, connects Weehawken on the Hudson River waterfront with midtown Manhattan. It consists of three tubes and was completed in May 1957.
More than 72,000 automobile passengers and 114,000 bus passengers use the tunnel each weekday. The total number of trips in 1991 was 133.6 million, down 1.9 million from the previous year.
Automobile tolls were raised last year to $4 for a round trip and $72 for a book of 20 tickets.
The Port Authority has completely refurbished the north tube -- the oldest of the three tubes -- and plans to start work on the south tube sometime this year. The repairs have had little impact on commuter traffic flow, since they have been done almost entirely at night.
Recently, electronic toll collection devices were installed, enabling specially equipped buses to move through the toll plaza without stopping. The program is still experimental, but officials say some form of the technology will probably be in place for cars, trucks and buses within the next five years.
HOLLAND TUNNEL
 Opened to traffic in 1927, the Holland was the first Hudson River vehicular tunnel. More than a mile long, it serves about 56,000 commuters a day traveling between Jersey City and downtown Manhattan. Fares for the Holland Tunnel are the same as for the Lincoln Tunnel.
In 1991, the total number of trips through the Holland Tunnel was 50.2 million, down 300,000 from 1990.
WEEHAWKEN FERRY
The Port Imperial Ferrybus System, owned by Arcorp Properties in Weehawken, has grown rapidly since it began operations in 1987. During the first year of operation the ferry had about 370,000 passenger trips with two Weehawken dockings and two New York dockings, one at 38th Street and the other at the Whitehall Terminal downtown.
By 1991, with four ferries making a combined total of 100 round trips each day, the total number of passengers had grown to more than two million. That also represented an increase of 360,000 over 1990.
Officials of Arcorp Properties say they are now contemplating some additional ferry service as well as improvements to the existing terminals.
The fare for a one-way crossing to 38th Street is $4; for downtown, $5. Midtown fares include free bus service on the New York side to several areas of Manhattan. Monthly tickets can be purchased for $125 to midtown and $140 to downtown.
HOBOKEN FERRY
A joint venture of the Port Authority, Hartz Mountain Industries and Arcorp Properties, the ferry service started in October 1989. The ferry makes about 60 round trips a day between the Hoboken Terminal and Battery Park City near the World Trade Center. Last year there were more than 1.5 million passenger trips, an increase of 400,000 over 1990. The $2 price of a one-way ticket has not changed since the service began.
Another ferry operator, TNT Hydrolines in Atlantic Highlands, carries an average of about 950 passengers a day from two dockings in Monmouth County to the financial district in lower Manhattan.
Fares for the 20-mile, 45-minute trip average $20 for a round trip. Monthly 40-trip ticket books cost $420. By way of comparison, a similar monthly ticket for N.J. Transit into Penn Station would cost about $250, not including the cost of parking at the train station, and the trip would take about an hour and 15 minutes.

HEADLINE: A Reluctant Rejection On Davids Island

BYLINE: By JAMES FERON

DATELINE: NEW ROCHELLE

 BODY:
WHEN the City Council decided last week to sever the contract that gave Xanadu Properties Associates exclusive rights to build a luxury residential colony on Davids Island, the developer had gone as far as he could go, he said, in reducing the density of the project.
"You reach a point where a project cannot be further downsized," said James M. Kozak, a vice president of the Xanadu partnership. "To further reduce the plan's density would be to end up with a scheme that no bank would finance." 
 The city, for its part, had concluded that the $1 billion project would win neither the necessary two-thirds vote of the County Board of Legislators nor approval by the Secretary of State in Albany. So reluctantly, at least for three of five members of the City Council, Xanadu's request for a contract extension was rejected Tuesday night.
Mayor Timothy C. Idoni, who had been in favor of extending Xanadu's exclusive rights for another five years, changed his mind after a six-hour public hearing Monday night. He praised the plan, nevertheless, as a proposal of "exceptional quality" before joining the rest of the Council in rejecting it.
He also said that "environmental concerns have been carefully and thoroughly addressed" by the developers, in what amounted to their third major version of the plan, and that they had produced "real public access" to the island, a sore point that arose when the original plan barred the public.
Mr. Kozak said, "Everyone wanted public access and parks, but no one was giving us abatements."
"There must be a balance between economics and the environment," he said. "Our plan struck that balance, but it was on a razor's edge. If the plan was downgraded any further it would have been no longer feasible."
 
'They Left the Door Open for Us'
 Gordon Marshall, a Xanadu partner, said he was "gratified that they left the door open for us," referring to the Mayor's stated intention to "open the process to new proposals from other developers, including Xanadu." But Mr. Marshall said it would be improper to approach Gail S. Shaffer, the state Secretary of State, "or anyone else, without being the designated developer."
"If the city should reopen the process, we would like to participate," he said. He said his partners had been having discussions with Ms. Shaffer "and felt we were on the right track" when the City Council acted. He said there was no way of knowing how any new proposal would differ from the most recent version.
He had some words of caution for any interested developer. "I don't think there is an understanding of what has to be done before you can develop that island," he said. "People think it is a bucolic island that only needs to be built on."
"Davids Island has the remnants of Fort Slocum, which it took the Army a year to build," he said. "Buildings are burned out and the former gymnasium, which had a metal arched roof, looks like a pile of metal spaghetti. It would cost $60 million just to dismantle the buildings."
The bridge, which became a focus of disagreement at many levels, "would have cost $40 million," Mr. Marshall said. "We spent over $20 million for all the studies," an investment that other developers would have to repeat "because we consider our results to be proprietary."
 
$130 Million Before the Shovel
 "Then there's another $10.35 million we would owe the city upon closing," Mr. Marshall added. "So that's a total of more than $130 million," he said. "How many developers are prepared to spend that before a shovel goes into the ground?"
Any return to negotiating over Davids Island might be delayed, meanwhile, in the wake of last week's vote. Mayor Idoni said, "Davids Island will still be part of our development process, but downtown has to be our immediate interest."
Many proponents of granting Xanadu an extension cited the poor economic condition of New Rochelle's downtown as underscoring the need for new ratables, or taxable property, that Davids Island promised. Robert Angarola, president of the school board, put it this way:
"New Rochelle is in dire need of development, and it needs it now. Some say the developer has inflated the property taxes the project will produce, but any new revenue is acceptable."
 
The Process Is Called the Problem
 Richard Syracuse, a builder and developer, said, "You won't get another developer in this current economic situation and with New Rochelle's viability in question." The process is the problem, not the developer, he added.
Mayor Idoni, speaking after the vote rejecting Xanadu, was more optimistic about the chances of improving the city's long-stagnant downtown. "We are negotiating with the Starrett Housing Corporation for the construction of 300 rental units and could have a preliminary agreement next month," he said.
"In addition, we are one of four finalists as the site of a new headquarters for Unicef," he said. "Two others are in New York City, and the other is in New Jersey." The Mayor said he hoped New Rochelle would be favored because it "sits astride I-95," the New England Thruway. Unicef is now situated near United Nations headquarters in Manhattan.
Mayor Idoni said the proposal would bring 700 to 1,000 Unicef employees to New Rochelle. They would work in a new 20-story building near the Metro-North tracks opposite a mall on Huguenot Street.
 
A Development Framework Sought
 The Mayor suggested another reason for delaying resumption of Davids Island activity. He thought it would be useful if city officials sat down with interested parties at the county, state and even Federal level to agree on a framework in which a developer could work.
Stephen P. Tenore, the chairman of the Board of Legislators and the New Rochelle representative on the Board, said, "I see an opportunity for the county, the Secretary of State and the city to jointly establish what is acceptable to all before we deal with another developer."
"We should become pro-active instead of reactive," he said. Mr. Tenore had warned that only 1 of 17 county legislators had indicated support for the proposed bridge to Davids Island, and that warning did as much as anything else to kill Xanadu's extension.
"My own interest," Mr. Tenore said, "would be less density, much less height in the apartment buildings and complete public access to the island. He had also objected to a projected 800-boat marina "that would be only 1,000 feet from Glen Island Beach."
 
Lack of an Escape Clause Cited
 He also objected to "the fact that the projected extension for Xanadu provided no escape clause," which would mean the city "would be unable to act for five years even if Xanadu's proposals were rejected by Albany."
The disagreements over Xanadu's proposal covered several aspects of the ambitious plan to turn the desolate island into a luxurious community of residential towers with only two apartments on a floor, scores of town-house units, a yacht club, a marina, a heliport and a 3,465-foot bridge.
The developers first introduced the concept of residential exclusivity, with the public barred from the island. Ms. Shaffer, among others, found this to be elitist and said that turning publicly owned coastal land into private use was unacceptable.
Xanadu then offered a half-acre site near the bridge's island terminus that would be open to the public during daylight hours. That, too, was rejected. The final version contained 19 acres of public promenades and parks, with access extended to a crescent-shaped rocky jetty protecting the marina.
 
Residents Protested Loss of View
 As for density, the original plan called for four 50-story apartment towers, with other families living in town houses on landscaped grounds. Mr. Marshall said the city had hoped for a 4,500-unit colony but that figure was cut to 2,000 and then 1,750.
Shoreline residents in New Rochelle and the communities to the north on Long Island Sound bitterly protested that the plan would adversely affect their view. Building heights were cut to 31 stories and, finally, to one tower of 19 stories and three of 15 stories.
Environmentalists and others were most strongly opposed to the bridge and to a waste-treatment plant that they said would pollute the atmosphere and the fragile waters of the Sound. Xanadu changed its original plan, which provided secondary treatment, to a promise to build a more effective tertiary-treatment plant.
Experts hired by the developers said the tertiary process would reduce the introduction of harmful nitrogen into the Sound to a negligible four parts per million. The Federated Conservationists of Westchester County said the developer's study of Sound waters overlooked information generated by the Long Island Sound Study, a five-year effort.
 
Bridge Stirred Heated Debate
 The argument over the bridge was probably the most heated and the least likely to be resolved because it hinged less on esthetics, which the developers recognized with a slimmer, more graceful design, than on the fact of the span itself. The environmentalists said ferry service was an appropriate alternative.
Xanadu said ferry service would be hazardous in the busy waters between the island and the mainland. The developer also said that automobiles moving across a bridge would produce less pollution than 100 cars starting up cold at the ends of the bridge.
A ferry would require construction of a huge parking lot in south New Rochelle near the shore facing the island. Eight homes would have to be removed from that area for construction of a bridge, the developers said.

ARDSLEY AUTO AUCTION
Fifteen Chevrolets dating from the early 80's to the 90's will be auctioned off Saturday at 11 A.M. in Ardsley. What makes the event unusual is the fact that the cars belong to the Town of Greenburgh and they are being sold as an economy measure. 
 "This is a new policy," said Paul J. Feiner, the Town Supervisor "In times like these we have decided that it is unnecessary for high-level town employees to be issued automobiles at the taxpayers' expense." His car is among those for sale, along with the Controller's, the Town Attorney's and those formerly driven by the heads of all municipal departments.
The auction will be held at the Greenburgh Town Park, on Heatherdale Road, and the cars will be available for inspection from 10 to 11 A.M. For more information, call 993-1540.
 
ADIRONDACK HISTORY
 In almost every nook and corner of the Adirondack Park's six million acres something of interest has been going on this year during the park's centennial. One event taking place in central Westchester is a talk by Barbara McMartin, author of "Hides, Hemlocks and Adirondack History," scheduled at 8 P.M. Wednesday in the Mount Pleasant Library.
The book, published this month by North Country Books in Utica, describes the adventures and misadventures of New York and Boston financiers who invested in tanning and lumber enterprises deep within the Adirondack forests in the 19th century, only to have the projects fizzle out by the 1890's.
Through diligent research Ms. McMartin has dispelled many myths about the demise of the two industries. The cost of building and paying interest on the construction of the tanneries, supporting the towns that grew up around them, frequent fires, the depletion of hemlock stands, the vagaries of the financial world and the difficulty of governing the enterprises by absentee owners on Wall Street were some of the reasons for failure.
Ms. McMartin is chairwoman of the Adirondack Centennial Committee, and she has coordinated more than 50 organizations statewide to produce a calendar of lectures, art and quilt exhibitions, photographic displays, boat races, skiing competitions, concerts, environmental symposiums, nature walks, craft workshops and guided hikes.
Admission to the lecture is free.
 
DANCE FUND BENEFIT
 Music is expected to have charm enough to turn browsers into buyers at an art and collectibles auction for the benefit of the Dance in Education Fund of White Plains. A chamber ensemble of music students at the State University of New York at Purchase will play for potential purchasers of toe shoes autographed by New York City Ballet members who wore them, dance-related dolls, books, jewelry and fine art from prestigious Westchester and Manhattan galleries.
The silent auction and a boutique sale will begin at 6:45 P.M. Saturday in the Performing Arts Center on the campus, followed at 8 P.M. by a dance concert featuring advanced students from the Steffi Nossen School of Dance in White Plains and a piano recital by Jess Meeker, who has composed and performed at Jacob's Pillow in Massachusetts and at the Joyce Theater in Manhattan and during his stint as musical director of the Dance in Education Fund.
Successful bids will be announced during intermission at 9 P.M., and the performance will end at 10 o'clock. For tickets and more information, call 761-7774.
 
TROMPE L'OEIL MASTER
 William M. Harnett does not come to mind as one of America's most memorable artists, yet he enjoyed great celebrity during his lifetime, which ended 100 years ago. An exhibition of 50 Harnett paintings can be seen at the Metropolitan Museum of Art in Manhattan through June 14.
His life and work will be explored in a lecture and slide show Friday by Marvin D. Schwartz, art historian, former fellow at the H. F. DuPont Winterthur Museum near Wilmington, Del., curator at the Detroit Institute of Arts and author of many articles for Art News magazine, Antiques magazine and other publications.
Harnett's forte was trompe l'oeil, so realistic that it aroused the suspicions of United States Treasury agents who were convinced that his depictions of currency were actual bills incorporated into the canvasses. For a time consideration was given to soaking the "bills" off the paintings and arresting the artist as a counterfeiter.
Eschewing traditional still-life subjects of fruit in bowl, deadfowl on table and flowers in vase, he turned to manmade objects, including musical instruments, books, bric-a-brac, pipes and household objects. He also produced innovative miniatures -- exquisitely detailed still lifes measuring four by six inches in addition to realistic life-size paintings.
The lecture will begin at 8 P.M. in the Hiram Halle Memorial Library on Route 4 in Pound Ridge. Admission is free.
 
ROCKLAND BOAT SHOW
 The last big boat show of the winter is to be held Thursday through next Sunday at Rockland Community College in Suffern. The promoters claim that boats purchased at the show will be fitted out for spring delivery.
Fishing and power boats dominate the collection, which also includes day cruisers, sailboards, sailboats, inflatables, canoes and scuba equipment, boating gear and clothing, boat slips and marine publications.
Daily seminars will cover a variety of topics, beginning with freshwater fishing for bass at 5:30 P.M. Thursday. Saltwater fishing, how to get a captain's license, how to select a fishing charter and scuba diving will be among other subjects.
To reach the college, take Exit 14B of the New York State Thruway (Interstate 87) and follow signs for Rockland Boat Event. Hours are 5 to 9 P.M. Thursday and Friday, 10 A.M. to 9 P.M. Saturday and 11 A.M. to 6 P.M. Sunday. Admission is $5. Children will be admitted free with a parent. Call AZA Promotions of Washington Crossing, Pa., at (215) 493-4427 for more information.
 
ON WOMEN'S PROGRESS
 "Women in the Work Force: Have We Progressed?" is the subject of a talk by a woman who has made considerable progress since graduating cum laude from Princeton University in 1974 and subsequently receiving her doctorate from the Harvard Law School.
She is Margarita Rosa, the first woman, the first Hispanic person and the youngest individual to serve as the state's Commissioner of Human Rights, a post for which she was nominated by Gov. Mario M. Cuomo and confirmed by the State Legislature in 1990. From 1985 to 1990 she served as the commission's general counsel and its executive deputy commissioner.
Her talk will begin at 3:30 P.M. Tuesday in Reid Hall at Manhattanville College, 125 Purchase Street, Purchase. Admission is free.
 
ODETTA IN PAWLING
 Odetta, one of America's most dynamic folk singers for more than 40 years, will appear at the Towne Crier Cafe in Pawling Saturday at 9 P.M. A protegee of Harry Belafonte decades ago, she has performed throughout the United States, Western Europe, Russia, Japan, Africa and Israel.

HEADLINE: Is Japan Out to Get Us?

 BODY:
To the Editor:
Robert B. Reich's essay "Is Japan Really Out to Get Us?" (Feb. 9) says there must be hidden motives behind criticism of Japanese economic policies, since the stated motive simply can't be true. "There are several possible explanations for this outpouring, but Japan's recent behavior is not one," he says. 
 Mr. Reich's ad hominem attacks on several dozen authors and books all depend on this assertion, which is simply wrong -- or, at a minimum, is very hotly debated. (For the record: in this essay Mr. Reich made no such attack on me.) This is not the place for a full re-arguing of the case these books present. I will simply mention recent reports by two of Mr. Reich's colleagues at Harvard, Dennis Encarnation of the business school and Robert Lawrence of the Kennedy School of Government, demonstrating that, even now, Japanese practices make it uniquely difficult for non-Japanese businesses to invest and operate in Japan.
The illustrations Mr. Reich did offer to support his point -- for instance, the popularity of some American-brand goods in Japan -- will be familiar to anyone who has ever heard a briefing from the Keidanren, Japan's major-industry alliance. They are political facts, in contrast to academic facts. Like the statistics that politicians will use in their speeches this year, they are very carefully chosen and sometimes deliberately misleading figures, designed to sell a political argument. My point is not that Mr. Reich is being deliberately misleading or that he is anyone's shill. Rather, the point concerns intellectual intensity. If similar statistics came from, say, George Bush or the chairman of General Motors, Mr. Reich would examine them very skeptically -- as he should. But he passes on these factoids about Japan with total credulity.
Mr. Reich's most profound misconception is that the authors he discusses are calling the Japanese system bad or unfair. Virtually every one of these books says that the Japanese system is admirable and superior in certain ways, such as its emphasis on savings. Their main argument is that there are significant, long-term differences between the Japanese and American economic structures. Recognizing these differences doesn't mean that Americans should get mad at Japan. On the contrary: only by recognizing the differences can the countries collaborate in the long run.
In his writings Mr. Reich often describes a "borderless" world, in which American, Japanese and German companies are impossible to tell apart. Everyone can agree on this as an ideal. But the people Mr. Reich criticizes all say that this is nowhere near the reality of corporate or governmental life in Japan, and won't be for the foreseeable future.

HEADLINE: Will Aerospace Be the Next Casualty?

BYLINE: By RICHARD W. STEVENSON

DATELINE: SEATTLE

 BODY:
At least once a day, the giant doors open at one of the Boeing Company's plants here and another plane rolls off the line, helping the company maintain its position as the undisputed worldwide leader in commercial aircraft.
But if Boeing today is an example of American business at its strongest, the company also faces a future in which its dominance -- and that of the entire American aerospace industry -- will be slowly eaten away by foreign competition. That erosion, in fact, is already under way, putting at risk jobs, a huge trade surplus and control of vital commercial and military technologies. And as it accelerates, it is raising questions not just about Boeing's prospects, but about the proper way for the United States to manage its future. 
 Having watched the United States lose leadership positions in automobiles, consumer electronics and other fields, many elected officials and others now say the country must make a stand in aerospace while Boeing is still on top. Indeed, they say, aerospace should serve as a rallying point for a national industrial policy, the ideologically charged concept that Washington should explicitly support those industries whose continued competitiveness is considered crucial to the nation's future. The way in which the problem is addressed in aerospace could have ramifications as well for other high-technology industries, including computers and high-definition televisions.
With the military-industrial base shrinking rapidly in the wake of deep Pentagon spending cuts, the nation's strength in aerospace -- and its ability to build up its military capabilities once again should the need arise -- rests increasingly on the commercial side of the aircraft business.
The United States, particularly under the Reagan and Bush Administrations, has traditionally maintained a free-market philosophy when it comes to the commercial aircraft business.
But in Europe, home of the Airbus Industrie consortium, and in Asia, where Japan, Taiwan and other countries are rapidly developing their own aerospace businesses, governments have adopted policies of explicit support, including direct financial subsidies. As a result, the free-market approach looks increasingly feeble in a world in which the United States is the only major nation claiming to play by free-market rules.
 
Losing an Order
 Boeing has so far held its own, but the competition from abroad has eaten deeply into the business of the only other commercial aircraft producer in the United States, the McDonnell Douglas Corporation. Last year, Boeing and McDonnell Douglas had a combined 67 percent of the worldwide market, as measured by aircraft orders, down from 78 percent as recently as 1987. And McDonnell Douglas won only 8 percent of the orders, compared with 18 percent four years earlier, while Boeing had a 59 percent share, compared with 60 percent in 1987.
"Our ability to maintain market share is very questionable," said Senator Jeff Bingaman, a Democrat from New Mexico who heads a subcommittee on the aerospace and defense industries. "It's been declining very dramatically in the last couple of years and it will continue to decline as long as the present circumstances prevail. At some point, our Government can't just go on sitting on its hands and saying, 'Let's leave it to the free market.' "
The future of the aerospace industry presents a compelling political problem because it involves not only issues of technology, international trade and national security, but jobs -- and the kind of highly paid manufacturing jobs that are the foundation of economies in places like Seattle, Boeing's home, and Long Beach, Calif., where McDonnell Douglas builds its commercial aircraft. The issue of jobs, more than anything else, seems to be softening ideological opposition to the notion of at least limited Government help. Aerospace companies are slashing employment on their jetliner programs because of weak orders from airlines at the same time that they are cutting military-related jobs.
"We are staring down the face of hundreds of thousands of layoffs, both in defense and on the commercial side," said Jerry Cantwell, an analyst at Wertheim Schroder in New York. "Politically, that's a real call to action in an election year, at least in terms of discussing and debating the issue."
The leading Democratic Presidential candidates, Gov. Bill Clinton of Arkansas and Paul E. Tsongas, the former Senator from Massachusetts, both endorse the general concept of industrial policy, and both have proposed specific measures that could help aerospace, including the creation of a civilian agency to promote technological development.
But industrial policy advocates, most of them Democrats, have a lot to overcome. The Bush Administration finds the very notion of Government intervention to be anathema. Proponents of industrial policy often offer only vague programs of their own. And it is an open question whether even a well-crafted industrial policy could or should halt the rapid globalization of aerospace production -- or of any other product deemed of national importance.
 
Military Provenance
 The United States has always had a national policy in aerospace in the sense that the industry has benefited immensely from Pentagon spending and to a somewhat lesser extent from the space program. Boeing's 707, the first truly successful jetliner when it was introduced in 1958 and the plane that started the company's dominance of the business, was derived in part from the Air Force's KC-135 tanker. Today Boeing is applying the expertise it developed in working with lightweight composite materials on the B-2 Stealth bomber to its commercial aircraft development, including its next big project, the 777 long-range twin jet.
Still, aircraft makers themselves remain wary of Government meddling in their business, and for its part, Boeing is not waiting for political debate and action. It is investing heavily in new plants and technologies and is searching constantly for ways to improve productivity and retain its status as the world's lowest-cost producer. Bowing to the realities of the increasingly global market, Boeing is forging closer links with foreign partners and suppliers, especially in Japan, even though that strategy risks training a future generation of competitors.
"We are not complacent about what we need to do to remain competitive and keep our leadership," said Frank A. Shrontz, Boeing's chairman and chief executive.
The most direct challenge facing Boeing and the rest of the industry in the United States is Airbus, the European consortium that receives aid from the governments of France, Germany, Britain and Spain. With the help of lavish government subsidies -- nearly $10 billion over two decades, according to a recent Congressional study -- Airbus in the last two years has shot past McDonnell Douglas to capture the No. 2 spot worldwide in terms of new orders.
Just this month, Airbus beat out Boeing to win an order for nine planes from Delta Air Lines. Boeing said the terms of the deal suggest once again how subsidies provided to Airbus have given it an edge in pricing over its American competitors.
While Airbus declined to comment on the specifics of the Delta deal, the company has long argued in general that its subsidies are in the form of loans that it must repay, and that it has benefited no more from government support than its American competitors have from Pentagon and NASA contracts.
Not surprisingly, McDonnell Douglas has decided that it can no longer go it alone as a builder of jetliners. The St. Louis-based company, which is also the nation's largest military contractor, is pursuing a deal to sell as much as 40 percent of its commercial aircraft business for $2 billion to the Taiwan Aerospace Corporation, a nascent venture largely underwritten by the Government of Taiwan.
With the help of the $2 billion and a low-wage work force in Taiwan, McDonnell Douglas hopes to build a long-range jumbo jetliner, the MD-12, a fuel-efficient and highly automated plane that would be the first competitor to Boeing's immensely profitable 747. The deal with Taiwan has hit some hurdles, but McDonnell Douglas is also discussing the possibility of selling stakes in the company to partners from other Asian nations.
Boeing now faces the prospect of being squeezed between a subsidized Airbus on the one hand and a stronger McDonnell Douglas on the other. Despite assurances from McDonnell Douglas about its continued opposition to government subsidies, Boeing executives are already fretting that the Taiwan Government might provide direct or indirect financial aid on the MD-12 or other programs, creating, in effect, an Asian Airbus. At the same time, some members of Congress wonder whether the deal will ultimately give Taiwan access to McDonnell Douglas's most important technology for military as well as commercial aircraft.
Boeing's warnings about the perils of the McDonnell Douglas deal are undercut somewhat by its own close relationship with Japan's leading aerospace companies, three of which -- Mitsubishi, Fuji and Kawasaki -- are primary subcontractors on the 777 program. Taiwan's aerospace industry, at least, is still in its infancy, but in Japan the industry's development is much further along, partly because of subsidies, loans and political support from the Government.
 
Where Japan Stands
 Japan is not yet ready to build jetliners on its own. But the combination of Government support and the country's technological and financial strengths means Japan could be a full-fledged competitor within a decade or two.
Although Boeing executives said they would not sell an equity stake in the company to a foreign partner, as McDonnell Douglas is doing, they also said that it was too late to turn back the clock on globalization. Companies need partners to provide the financial support necessary to develop new airplanes -- even Boeing cannot afford on its own the $4 billion it will take to develop the 777 -- and foreign partners are the only ones with the cash. In addition, business arrangements with suppliers in a country or a region are extremely helpful, if not essential, in selling airplanes in that part of the world.
"In my view, it's unlikely that we'll continue to be as U.S.-based in the next 20 years as we are today," said Lawrence W. Clarkson, Boeing's vice president for planning and international development. "We have to recognize that to maintain our market share we're going to have to do more international, global things."
The effects of globalization may fall first not on Boeing or McDonnell Douglas, but on the vast network of subcontractors and suppliers across the United States that make up the backbone of the industry.
As Boeing and McDonnell Douglas cede more of their subcontracting work to foreign partners, American suppliers are finding that there is less work for them just when cutbacks in Pentagon spending make it all the more important for them to beef up their business in the commercial aircraft field. Some analysts think the shrinkage of the supplier base is only the first step toward a more rapid dissipation of the nation's strengths in aerospace. Their concerns mounted after the announcement of the McDonnell Douglas-Taiwan deal in November.
 
Increasing the Pressure
 The favored Republican solution -- and the policy most fervently advocated by Mr. Shrontz and other Boeing executives -- is to increase the pressure on France, Germany, Britain and Spain to end their subsidies to Airbus.
"I'm anxious to get rid of the subsidies that exist rather than to try to offset them with others," Mr. Shrontz said. "In the long run, if we end up in a subsidized industry all around, it's the taxpayer who would end up paying the bill."
Industrial policy advocates are quick to point out, though, that even Boeing is a beneficiary of Japanese subsidies through its partnerships on the 777 program. And in any case, they said, neither the European nor the Asian nations show any signs of willingness to abandon their policies.
"It's a great idea," said Representative Barbara Boxer, a California Democrat. "But it won't work. It's extremely unrealistic."
There is a growing consensus that the United States needs to strike a more aggressive posture with Europe on the issue of Airbus subsidies. But beyond that, proponents of industrial policy have so far not articulated any detailed strategy for the post-cold war world.
In the case of McDonnell Douglas, many industrial policy proponents argue that the Federal Government should help the company find an American alternative to the investment by Taiwan, perhaps by loosening antitrust regulations and applying pressure on the rest of the industry to join in a partnership with the company to build the new jumbo jet.
 
A Call for Collaboration
 Industrial policy advocates see considerable potential in encouraging more collaboration between American companies on other programs as well. More broadly, proponents are developing proposals to provide more money for commercially oriented aerospace research and to make it harder for foreign competitors to gain access to research sponsored by the American Government. Some analysts believe Washington should provide more help through the Commerce Department and the State Department to aerospace companies seeking more foreign business.
In Congress, Representative Boxer is developing legislation that would reorient the National Aeronautics and Space Administration away from its overwhelming emphasis on space and back toward its historical role in conducting aeronautical research. And she is pushing a measure that would provide $5 billion worth of loan guarantees to aid companies whose military and commercial technologies are deemed vital to the nation's economic security.
"McDonnell Douglas is the tip of the iceberg for us if we don't come up with some kind of aerospace policy," Mrs. Boxer said. "Boeing is doing fine right now, but you have to look down the road. We're headed in a terrible direction."
 
 
TRAINING THE COMPETITION?
 Are Boeing and McDonnell Douglas risking training their future competitors through their links to Asian aerospace companies? Some analysts think the answer is yes, but both companies say no.
McDonnell Douglas executives maintain that the key skills in commercial aircraft production are design, which the company would continue to control, and final assembly, where the millions of pieces manufactured by subcontractors and suppliers are brought together to create an airplane. McDonnell Douglas, in building the planned MD-12 with its partner from Taiwan, would continue to do the final assembly at a plant in the United States.
Boeing executives make the argument that the key is not hoarding technology, but continuing to make technological advances.
"Technology is pretty perishable," said Frank Shrontz, Boeing's chairman. "There's no way I know of to keep the Japanese from learning this business. I think our challenge is to keep our competitive edge in the technology area, both in terms of products and the processes by which airplanes are built, rather than trying to keep others from getting the technology."
 
 
 
A PARTNERSHIP AT HOME FOR A HYPERSONIC PLANE
 The nation's leading aerospace companies have always been spirited -- sometimes mean-spirited -- competitors. But financial and technological imperatives have increasingly driven them into project-by-project partnerships that could be a model for maintaining the technological edge enjoyed by the United States in aerospace.
One of the most far-reaching partnerships is the combined effort by five of the nation's largest aerospace companies to develop a National Aero-Space Plane.
NASP, as the plane is known, would be capable of taking off from a runway, roaring into orbit at 25 times the speed of sound and then landing again on a runway. Although the plane would be experimental, its development is expected to yield considerable advances in design, materials and propulsion that could ultimately be used in both military and commercial aircraft.
The project, which is being funded by the Pentagon and the National Aeronautics and Space Administration, was originally set up as separate competitions among three airframe producers -- the Rockwell International Corporation, the General Dynamics Corporation and the McDonnell Douglas Corporation -- and two engine makers, Rockwell's Rocketdyne division and the Pratt & Whitney division of the United Technologies Corporation. Two years ago, the companies decided, with the Government's blessing, that the project made more sense as a cooperative venture.
"It's the most complex consortium ever put together in aerospace, and it's working," said Barry Waldman, the Rockwell executive who serves as the program manager.
By working cooperatively rather than competitively, Mr. Waldman said, the team members are "raising the general technology level of all the companies." And, he added, they are also creating a pool of knowledge about hypersonic vehicles that will give the nation a tremendous advantage over foreign competitors.

HEADLINE: World Markets;
The Sentimental View of Europe

BYLINE: By Jonathan Fuerbringer

 BODY:
For much of this year, the anticipation of better times ahead has been driving stock markets in Europe, powering a vibrant resurgence in France, igniting a recent rally in Germany and even providing some buoyancy in Britain.
Analysts say the gains are attributable in part to investors' belief that Europe's very high interest rates will soon be cut. Investors have also bet that Wall Street's strong performance will cross the Atlantic. And they assume there will be an economic recovery in the United States, giving Europe a lift. 
 Anticipation is fine when it is right. But it can get an investor out on a limb, which is not the place to be when events do not pan out exactly as hoped. Last year, for example, the expected economic recovery in the United States vanished.
Last week was not a good one for anticipators. Signals on an American recovery were positive, but otherwise the facts were bad. The odds on European interest rate cuts diminished, in part because of a rise in the inflation rate in Germany. The Dow Jones industrial average stalled a little, and in Britain the election prospects for the Conservative Party soured.
On Wednesday, Thursday and Friday in Britain, the Financial Times-Stock Exchange index of 100 leading shares fell 98.8 points, or 3.8 percent, to close at 2,476.0.
In France, the CAC index of 40 blue-chip shares tumbled 51.63 points, or 2.6 percent, on Wednesday and Thursday to 1,941.75, then rose slightly on Friday. The fall came the day after the index reached its high for the year. And it was just a few days after the index had finally clawed its way back to about where it was when Iraq invaded Kuwait more than a year and a half ago.
In Germany, the DAX index of 30 shares also fell. It was not as sharp as the others, but a 15.92-point drop on Thursday pushed the index below 1,740, which some analysts said could open the way to its sinking below 1,700.
"It is dangerous to believe that sentiment can shrug off the fundamentals forever," said Andrew Bell, European strategist for Barclays de Zoete Wedd in London. At Barclays, Mr. Bell chose not to bet on better times in Europe, which means Barclays has missed some of the gains. "So be it," Mr. Bell said, adding, "Markets can be vulnerable to a change in wishful thinking."
The fall in Britain was a response to new uncertainty about the Conservative Party's chances to win the election on April 9 and stay in power. The party's annual budget, which was issued last Tuesday, was a political disappointment because it was not considered attractive enough to woo many undecided voters.
For Sushil Wadhwani, the lead strategist at Goldman Sachs in London, opinion polls that showed the Labor Party leading have undermined his current strategy. When he wrote his strategy assessment for March, he assumed the Conservatives were poised to win the election and recommended buying stocks ahead of the projected victory to take advantage of the rally that would follow.
"Given the current popularity of Labor in the polls," the outcome of the election is too close to predict, he said. "It is not a very comfortable position to be in as a strategist." He said that between now and the election the FT-SE could swing rapidly in a range from 2,350 to 2,700, responding mostly to poll results.
"We are saying to wait and see what the opinion polls show," said Roger Palmer, chief global strategist at Kleinwort Benson Securities in London. "If you buy now, the market could move 100 points either way on the opinion polls."
In Germany, the hope for a cut in interest rates by the German central bank, the Bundesbank, was evaporating. The German inflation rate for the last 12 months jumped to 4.3 percent in February, up from 4 percent in January. And the Bundesbank president, Helmut Schlesinger, said the country's money supply growth was too strong. Both were signals that the Bundesbank would move later rather than sooner in reducing interest rates.
The French market has also traveled very far in a hurry. The CAC-40 index is up 13 percent this year. Mr. Bell of Barclays said the firm had already recommended taking profits at the end of the February because of the rapid rise.
Mr. Wadhwani of Goldman said political opinion polls were also hurting the French stock market. Recent polls there show that voters are unhappy with the mainstream parties. "That should cause some nervousness," he said.
"The markets have had a strong run against a background of the economic news becoming more disappointing," said Mr. Bell, referring to continued high interest rates in Europe and the prospect that earnings announcements will be disappointing. "So there is a big risk over the next few months."
So Barclays is sticking with its strategy, which prefers hard evidence to sentiment. That means it favors the stock markets in the United States and Japan. And it suggests that Barclays will not prefer Europe until the sentiment looks more like reality.

Ever since former President Reagan installed deejay "Mad Man" Mark Fowler as head of the Federal Communication Commission, the Government has been trying to deregulate the airwaves. Last week, under F.C.C. chairman Alfred C. Sikes, the Bush Administration moved it further along that path. The F.C.C. voted 4 to 0, with one abstention, to increase the number of stations a single company may own to 30 AM and 30 FM stations from a total of 12. It also voted to expand the number of stations a single owner may own in a single city. The new rules, which go into effect Aug. 1, could lead to renewed bidding by broadcasters for existing properties. "We're delighted," said Stephen A. Hildebrandt, chief counsel of Group W Radio, which owns 17 AM and FM stations. But Andrew C. Barrett, the commissioner who abstained, said he may change his vote to nay in protest. The ruling will radically alter ownership, he said. It only pays "lip service" to minority broadcasters.
 
Beating Back Cable
 
Cable has been snatching viewers from broadcast TV for more than a decade. But last month, the "Broadcast Four" -- CBS, NBC, ABC and the Fox Broadcasting Company -- grabbed back some of those couch potatoes. Ratings for the broadcast networks climbed to 46.1 from 42 the month before. Cable's ratings fell to 10.2 from 12. Each rating point is equal to 921,000 households. CBS, which aired the Winter Olympics, was the ratings champ while CNN, without a war to cover, saw its ratings plunge to near obscurity: they fell to 0.6 from 2.4 last year. "Three years ago, the consistent growth of cable would have offset even the Olympics," said David F. Poltrac, senior vice president of research at CBS. Analysts say the broadcasters' gains come from new programming. Now if they could only make money.

Keycorp's Geography
 
Keycorp, the Albany-based bank, has adopted the Star Trek strategy. It goes where few other banks have dared to venture. It is big in Utah, Wyoming, upstate New York and Alaska. Last week, when it acquired Puget Sound Bancorp, it became even bigger in Washington. Puget Sound Bancorp, with $4.9 billion in assets, will make Keycorp the nation's 25th-largest bank. It is already one of the most profitable. It is also conservative. Though it is large enough to make loans as large as $250 million, it has made only 20 loans of more than $12.5 million. "We don't try to compete on the basis of price," said Lee Irvin, senior vice president. "People who shop around will find we are not the cheapest," he said. But they are there.

Taking on Joe Camel
 
Last week, the United States Surgeon General, Dr. Antonia Novello, said, "It's time for Joe Camel to take a hike." Joe Camel is the cartoon character invented in Europe and featured in ads created by Mezzina/Brown Inc. for the R. J. Reynolds Tobacco Company. The problem is the character appeals to kids. According to the American Medical Association, more young children recognize Joe Camel than Mickey Mouse. "Calling for the voluntary withdrawal of a successful advertising campaign is not a traditional role of organized medicine," Dr. Novello said. R. J. Reynolds rebuffed the Surgeon General. "No linkage has been made between advertising and the consumption of cigarette products," the company said.

J. P. Morgan's Mortgage Crunch
 
After banks make mortgages, they often sell them to other banks that turn them into securities. Billions of dollars worth of these securities change hands each day in what is a very volatile market. Last week, J. P. Morgan & Company got caught in those ups and downs. It said it lost $50 million. The losses forced the resignation of Mohamad Sotoudeh, a market strategist who failed to forecast lower interest rates, which caused the market plunge.

Chrysler, Post-Iacocca
 
Finding someone to fill Lee A. Iacocca's shoes when he retires next year as chairman of the Chrysler Corporation has not been easy. Two would-be's went to Wall Street and one wannabe, Robert A. Lutz, Chrysler's president, hasn't been asked. Last week the headhunters turned up a hot prospect: Robert J. Eaton, head of General Motors Europe. "If he came with a good offer I'd have to look at it naturally," he said.
 
 
 
ECONOMY

 
Detroit Resists Higher Prices
 
Detroit often bucks the trend by raising prices even in a recession. Higher prices make up for lost sales. But last month, Detroit was a conformist. According to the Labor Department, the price of passenger cars fell in February. That helped keep the rise in the Producer Price Index to a modest 0.2 percent.

Back to Buying
 
Consumers may not be bursting with confidence right now, but at least they're spending. Last month, according to the Commerce Department, retail sales climbed 1.3 percent after surging 2.1 percent in January. Those were the first back-to-back increases of more than 1 percent since 1985.

A Faster, Cheaper Way to Mars?
 
When Daniel S. Goldin, an executive at TRW Inc., was nominated to head the National Aeronautical and Space Administration last week, it came as a surprise to some. Mr. Goldin, who led TRW's Star Wars satellite research, has no policy-making experience. But what Mr. Goldin brings, the Administration said, is private-sector smarts. He is a "faster, cheaper better kind of guy," said a White House official who spoke on the condition of anonymity. Since the Administration wants to expand the space program (it wants to go to Mars) but do it on the cheap, those are qualities it hopes Mr. Goldin will bring to the job.

 
 
INTERNATIONAL

 
Pointing Fingers Over Russia's Future
 
Former President Richard M. Nixon has gained quite a reputation for his foreign-policy savvy, Vietnam War aside. Last week, Mr. Nixon released a memo to a slew of influential friends complaining that the Bush Administration had done "pathetically little" to help Russia. Mr. Nixon warned that unless the Republics get more help people will be asking, "Who lost Russia?" the way they asked "Who lost China?" He also warned that without more aid Boris N. Yeltsin, Russia's President, might not be able to prevent a "new despotism" in the ex-Soviet Union. But President Bush said the money is not there to bail out Russia. "I don't have a blank check for all that," he said.

Recession With a Japanese Spin
 
They used to call it the English-speaking recession. It brought growth in America to a halt and drove up Britain's unemployment rate to 9.2 percent. But now the recession may start speaking Japanese. A survey by the Bank of Japan showed business confidence there had fallen to its lowest level in four years. The Government is also projecting that industrial production will decline 4 percent in the first quarter of 1992, the sharpest drop since the recession of 1974. Capital investment by manufacturers is also expected to fall. Sound familiar? Not quite. Recession in Japan, where companies are loath to lay off workers, won't raise unemployment much. "This could be severe for corporations but not for individuals" said Yoshihisa Kitai, chief economist at the Long-Term Credit Bank. Many in the United States wish the English-speaking recession could learn Japanese.
 
Mashiro Dozen of Daiwa Securities apologized for a stock scandal that will cost Daiwa $323 million in fiscal 1991. Though he resigned as president, he will remain on the board.
 
Britain's Neglect of B.C.C.I.
 
The Bank of England took its licks last week. A Parliamentary committee in London chastised Britain's central bank for its handling of the Bank of Credit and Commerce International scandal. B.C.C.I.'s British operations were closed last July after an investigation by Price Waterhouse, the accounting firm, uncovered widespread fraud and large losses. Though B.C.C.I. was chartered in Luxembourg, regulators there were not up to the task. But the Bank of England let B.C.C.I. alone. . "We simply do not understand why B.C.C.I. should have been the only bank in the world to be given such preferential treatment," the committee said.

Keeping the Dollar in Its Place
 
Since November, the dollar has been rising against the Japanese yen and German mark. But for a few hours last week the rally seemed in danger when Japan sold dollars."Germany and Japan have a strong bias toward keeping their currencies strong," said Carl Weinberg, chief economist at High Frequency Economics, a consulting firm in New York. Since raw materials are priced in dollars, "a weaker dollar lets them bring down inflation at home at our expense," he said.

I.B.M. Sells Its Own Clones
 
Last year, John Akers, chairman of the International Business Machines Corporation, sent a memo to his troops telling them to fight harder for market share. Last week, I.B.M. Europe showed how it interpreted those words. Rather than pump up its numbers by marketing its own machines, it would buy clones and resell them. The knock-offs will be made by Hong Leong, a Singapore company in which Big Blue has an interest. If it works in Europe, I.B.M. may do the same at home.

Volcker's Newest Venture

BYLINE: By DANIEL F. CUFF

 BODY:
Paul A. Volcker, former chairman of the Federal Reserve Board, seems to be picking up steam these days rather than slowing down. Mr. Volcker, who left the Fed in 1987, is taking on a new assignment, chairman of a joint venture called J. Rothschild, Wolfensohn & Company, which will offer investment banking services in Europe.
The job, announced earlier this month, is an extension of the new career he began in 1988, when he was hired by James D. Wolfensohn to be chairman of Mr. Wolfensohn's investment firm. 
 "We need to have a presence in Europe as the Common Market develops," Mr. Wolfensohn said last week. "The final element is Eastern Europe and the former Soviet Union. There is, of course, largely chaos at the moment but in the longer run there will clearly be opportunities. The time to learn about it and grow with it and be with it is probably now."
Enter the venture with the London-based Rothschild firm. For Mr. Volcker, the new job does not mean spending more time in Europe, which he usually visits several times a year. Mr. Volcker said last week that the venture would be run day to day by an as-yet-unnamed chief executive, "the best guy we can find, preferably a continental European."
Nonetheless, work life is "getting a little too filled," said the man who battled inflation for eight years as head of the Fed and gained a reputation in those days as second only to the President in power. Mr. Volcker, who is 64, already splits his time between Wall Street and Princeton, where he is a part-time professor of economic policy. And he plays a role in another Wolfensohn venture, with the Fuji Bank, that advises Japanese and American companies.
Now he will have to keep a closer eye on Eastern Europe, particularly Russia. "It will be a long pull," he said of the economic development of the eastern nations, "but obviously some of it can be pretty intriguing."

HEADLINE: MARKET WATCH;
Rates Are Up, And Bonds Look Good

BYLINE: By Floyd Norris

 BODY:
The economy is growing, and bond prices always fall when that happens. So sell bonds.
That is the current conventional wisdom on Wall Street. Investors who loved long Treasuries at 7.4 percent as 1991 ended now scorn them at yields above 8 percent. Those who had bought bonds then have lost money, and that is always painful. 
 But while the economic news does provide reasons to hope that the recession is finally ending, it may be that, as Chuck Clough, a Merrill Lynch strategist, puts it, "the bond market is discounting a bunch of things that won't happen." Mr. Clough, who recommended cutting bond positions when prices were high in December, now thinks it is a good idea to buy more bonds.
Bond investors have missed much of the fun. As short-term interest rates plummetted over the past 18 months, bond rates first slipped less, then rose. In the meantime, the stock market took off.
The reason rates are supposed to zoom with a recovery is that private credit demand is stimulated. No doubt there will be some pickup in bank lending, but the biggest part of the private borrowing picture is mortgages, both commercial and residential. It seems unlikely that the net borrowing in those markets is going to take off, Mr. Clough argues. And that should keep total debt demand manageable.
It may also be instructive to note what corporations are doing. Those who can do so are paying off long-term debt by calling bonds, and many are not issuing new long-term bonds to replace them. Instead, they are borrowing at shorter maturities or avoiding debt altogether. New stock offerings are pouring into the market almost as fast as the prospectuses can be printed. Given what investors will pay in the stock market, it is hard for a company with a choice to justify paying the 9 percent to 10 percent needed to borrow long-term.
But if it is foolish for companies to pay this kind of rate, it is even harder to understand why the lenders -- bond buyers -- are so reluctant to receive it. There are always things to worry about in the bond market, and it is certainly possible that there will be a revival of inflation in the long run, or that the problems in Tokyo will force Japanese insurance companies to sell more bonds, or that a host of other things will go wrong. But the huge spread in rates, with Treasury bond yields about twice those of Treasury bills, would seem to be compensating investors for a lot of risk.
And then there is the perspective of Lee Cooperman, the long-time top strategist at Goldman Sachs who now runs Omega Advisors, a New York money management firm. He says stocks are not cheap now and would be highly overvalued if long-term rates keep rising. "I'm not an aggressive bull on bonds," he said, but he is more comfortable with bonds than with many stocks. "If bonds lose money from here, I think the stock market is going to head south."

HEADLINE: A Peace Dividend for Israel?

BYLINE: By PETER PASSELL

 BODY:
If Middle East negotiators ever strike a deal, will Israel's siege economy soon be awash in milk and honey? Much, of course, would depend on the nature of the deal, whether it included Syria and Lebanon, whether it maintained an open economic border between Israel and the West Bank.
Recent history is not encouraging. The "cold peace" with Egypt has yielded few discernible economic benefits. And the most recent negotiations have been marked by a level of bitterness that augurs poorly for future economic cooperation. Even in the best conceivable circumstances, few Israeli economists anticipate an immediate dividend from reduced military spending or increased trade. Some expect that outlays for settling property claims and securing new defense perimeters would actually exceed the initial gains. 
 The real payoff, they say, would only come in the longer term, in the form of an improved climate for private investment. But if it comes, that dividend could be enormous, as both domestic and foreign investors rush to take advantage of Israel's highly skilled work force and access to major markets. Indeed, many economists believe that peace is a key to breaking out of the economy's current slow-growth miasma, a necessity for gracefully absorbing the new Soviet immigrants and raising the Israeli standard of living to that of the United States or northern Europe.
When most people think of peace dividends, they think about cuts in military spending. And by this measure, it seems, few countries in the world have more to gain than Israel. According to the Bank of Israel, the country now budgets 15 percent of gross national product to defense -- three times the United States expenditure. If the costs of civilian shelters, chronic economic dislocation associated with the annual month of military reserve duty and military use of valuable land are included, the bill is roughly half again larger.
Few analysts, though, think a peace accord would lead to quick relief. Nadav Halevi, an economist at the Hebrew University in Jerusalem, argues that the immediate impact on military spending might well be perverse.
Arab negotiators are pressing for the creation of an autonomous Palestinian entity on the West Bank and the return of the heavily fortified Golan heights to Syria. But either action, Professor Halevi notes, would mean a considerable investment in a new fixed defense perimeter, along with an expensive upgrading of surveillance capacity.
Even if the Israeli military was able to contain spending to current levels, the net burden on the Israeli economy could easily increase if a peace treaty reduced Israel's moral and political claims to American aid. Currently that aid equals about $4 billion annually -- 8 percent of Israel's G.N.P. and almost the entire gap between Israel's export earnings and import costs.
The most visible reward to an accord with Palestinians would be the end to the four-year old intifada, the organized resistance to Israel's occupation of the West Bank and Gaza territories. But the tangible gain would not be very large because the resistance is apparently taking a small (and diminishing) toll on the Israeli economy. A 1988 study for the Bank Hapoalim, Israel's largest commercial bank, concluded that the added military costs of containing the intifada ran to just two-tenths of a percent of Israel's G.N.P. While there is no comparable estimate for 1991, official Government figures show that overall military manpower costs -- the bulk of the cost of policing the territories -- have since shrunk.
According to the Bank of Israel, the intifada-proclaimed boycott of Israeli goods did pare sales by about one-third between 1987 and 1989. But half this loss was recouped in 1990 as Israeli goods not labeled by origin trickled back into Palestinian markets. And in any case, notes Howard Rosen at the Institute for International Economics in Washington, the potential damage was never very large because Israeli sales to the territories never amounted to more than one-tenth of Israel's total exports.
Other disruptions linked to resistance to Israeli rule were perhaps more damaging. Tourism fell by 15 percent in the first year of the intifada. And the number of Palestinian workers commuting from the territories dropped by half, initially creating shortages of unskilled labor in Israeli agriculture and construction.
But tourist arrivals in 1991 probably exceeded the record traffic in 1987. And one of the few saving graces of an economy with 11 percent unemployment is that local labor can be found to pick vegetables and lug bricks.
In an analysis for the Institute for Social and Economic Policy in the Middle East at Harvard's Kennedy School of Government, Professor Halevi estimates that overall losses to Israel from the Palestinian insurrection -- and thus the potential gain from its end -- amount to less than 1 percent of Israel's G.N.P. Pinchas Landau, an analyst for the Israel Business Report, goes further. "The intifada," he says flatly, "has become irrelevant to the Israel economy."
What may be relevant is trade. It is widely assumed that a deal on the occupied territories would mean an end to the broader Arab trade boycott of Israel. Here, too, however, economists are skeptical that gains for Israeli exporters or consumers would be great.
Prof. Ephraim Kleiman of Hebrew University sees some potential in what economists call "border trade" -- commerce in goods and services that rarely move very far. Israelis living near Lebanon or Egypt might, for example, sell fresh milk to neighboring Arab villages or repair their trucks. And Professor Halevi looks hungrily at the huge import market in the oil-rich Persian Gulf states. All things equal, he suggests, Israelis' knowledge of Arab language and commercial customs should give them an edge over Japanese, American and European suppliers.
But there is many a potential slip. The Camp David accord brought no bounty in trade with Egypt; a formal end to war with Syria and the gulf states might mean no more. And even with a genuine thaw, predicts Michael Bruno, the former governor of the Bank of Israel, these markets will be tough to penetrate.
The secondary boycott of companies that do business with Israel has deprived Israeli consumers of access to hundreds of brand-name goods and limited trade with Asian industrial powers that have an economic stake in Arab countries. But in the view of Amos Rubin, an economic adviser to Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir, it might not take a peace agreement to reduce the boycott's impact to very modest levels. Since the Persian Gulf war and the subsequent sea change in Mideast geopolitics, he notes, the number of Japanese companies selling in Israel has been multiplying rapidly.
Mr. Rosen offers an entirely different perspective. He argues that the boycott's damage has been more apparent than real. The boycott, he says, "forced Israeli exporters to move up the technological ladder" to win acceptance in the industrialized world. It also helped break domestic political resistance to free-trade deals with America and the European Community -- agreements that guarantee Israeli consumers the benefits of international competition and assure access to the world's richest markets.
The cost of settling resource and private land claims could add to Israel's adjustment bill. Hishan Awartani, an economist at Al-Najah University in Nablus, says that Israel's disproportionate use of water from the Jordan River and the aquifer under the West Bank ranks high among Palestinians' economic grievances. While Israel's population is slightly smaller than that of the occupied territories and Jordan combined, it gulps twice as much water. All told, the region is now consuming about 20 percent more than the amount sustainable from existing sources.
But Ezra Sadan, an economist who heads Israel's Volcani Center for Agricultural Research, counters that the scarcity is a failure of markets, not nature. If Israel stopped subsidizing thirsty crops and all farmers in the region paid the real cost of irrigation, he says, water would cease to be a significant obstacle to growth. Clearly, though, any transfer of water rights to Palestinians or Jordan would generate some initial dislocation for Israeli farmers.
A far more substantial bill could be due on residential property, since more than 200,000 Israelis now live in the West Bank. Neither Israeli nor Palestinian economists are eager to contemplate the political and economic trauma in their mass resettlement.
And perhaps they will never be forced to. Since roughly three-quarters of them are commuters whose attachment to the soil is apparently not based on either religion or nationalism, it might well serve everyone's interest to let them stay in an autonomous Palestinian entity. "The settlers could be a benefit to the West Bank economy," agrees George T. Abed, who heads the Welfare Association, a Palestinian development group in Geneva.
But some transfer of property, with compensation for repatriated Israelis, seems likely. And the burden, particularly on housing, could be heavy since it would come on top of the demands from newly arriving Soviet immigrants.
The gains from peace it seems will have to come from elsewhere.
 
 
MAKING INVESTORS FEEL SECURE
 If experts on the Israeli economy are quick to pile reason upon reason why peace would generate no overnight dividend, they still insist it is critical to Israel's economic future. Indeed, Pinchas Landau, an analyst for the Israel Business Report, argues that the "peace process is being driven by economic imperatives" -- in Israel's case, by the need to accelerate growth, reduce its dependence on foreign aid and provide good jobs for its exploding work force.
From 1951 to 1972 the Israeli economy grew an astounding 10 percent annually -- a rate in the big leagues with Japan, South Korea and Singapore. Since then, however, it has averaged just 3 1/2 percent, barely enough to stay ahead of population growth. Income per person is stuck around $11,000, a comfortable figure by world standards, but a third less than in northern Europe.
The slowdown, economists now acknowledge, was caused largely by excessive regulation and the failure to encourage competition. But they also argue that reforms instituted since Israel's 1985 brush with triple-digit inflation will not turn the economy around unless investors decide Israel is secure from Arab attack.
Investment did surge in 1991, but the lion's share was in Government-guaranteed housing. According to the Government's latest report on the economy, "a much higher level of [industrial] investment is needed for successful absorption of the immigrants. So far, there are no signs of a turnaround of the required scale."
Perhaps most disappointing, foreign investment has been stuck at a mere $200 million annually. "We need strategic investors," says Dov Lautman, president of the Manufacturers Association of Israel -- investors willing to plow billions annually into export-oriented, high-tech enterprises. And a pre-condition, he argues, is a durable resolution to Israel's conflict with its neighbors.
Dov Mishor, the economic adviser to the Minister of Finance, agrees. "If there is peace," he says, "the sky's the limit."

The world of microprocessors has changed dramatically, moving from a linear path based on power to a diversity of specialized chips. As chips advance along many different paths simultaneously, the resulting hubbub could leave customers immersed in a great deal of confusion.
The traditional progression of microprocessing power, from 8086 to 80286 to 80386 to 80486 and beyond, is no longer quite so easy to predict now that the "me too" era is ending. 
 For years, determining what came next was simply a matter of studying the Intel Corporation, which had the high-end personal computer market to itself. Now Intel has rivals on all sides, and it has responded with lawsuits, strategic alliances and an impressive barrage of innovative chips.
"In a couple of years you'll have 25 to 50 different choices in microprocessors, just in terms of what the PC is based on," said Dean McCarron, vice president for technology at In-Stat Inc., a Scottsdale, Ariz., semiconductor market research company. "And this is just talking about the processor. We haven't even thrown in the choices of vendors."
Many companies are seeking to break from the pack (and restore flagging profits) by creating a greater assortment of personal computers, each tailored to specific business requirements. Business PC's may eventually be sold as communications computers, multimedia work stations, graphics and publishing computers, video computers, network node computers, pocket penpad computers, etc.
Choosing a computer will be easier, Mr. McCarron said, "if you're a very decisive person.," Of course, he added, "If you're indecisive or easily confused, it's going to be a living hell."
As the chips become more specialized, the computers that they power will be marketed for specific uses. So customers need not worry so much about which chip is inside and instead should focus on how well any given computer can perform the particular tasks they have in mind. It will be rather like car shopping, where most buyers concentrate on how safe, economical or spacious a car is, happily ignoring such esoterica as the compression ratio of the engine.
Executives who once went shopping for a "386" computer are now offered several different types of 386-based machines. They come in a variety of speeds, with a variety of special features, from a variety of different chip makers and computer suppliers.
Consider this. You need a new desktop personal computer and would like either a 386-class machine, currently the industry workhorse, or a 486-class machine, the current top end of the PC line. (This assumes you have ruled out the Apple Macintosh, which is based on the Motorola 68000 family of chips, any of the many RISC-based microprocessors used in scientific and engineering work stations, and older computers based on the outdated 8088, 8086 and 80286 chips.)
Intel, based in Santa Clara, Calif., now makes an i386DX, an i386SX, an i386SL, an i486DX, an i486SX, and, as of early March, an i486DX2. (Intel also continues to make the older 286 chip, but openly sneers at it.) Each chip has unique features. The 386 SL, for example, has intelligent power management features that make it well suited for use in battery-powered portables.
Moreover, each chip comes in several different speeds, measured in megahertz, or millions of cycles a second. The higher the megahertz, the faster the chip processes data (and the more it costs). Megahertz alone is not a reliable indication of performance, but in general a 33-megahertz chip will outperform a 25-megahertz chip.
Intel's i386DX chip comes in four versions: 16, 20, 25 and 33 megahertz. Its i386SX chip comes in three: 16, 20 and 25 megahertz. The relatively new i386 SL chip comes in 20 and 25-megahertz versions, and the 20-MHz version is further divided into cached and cacheless variations. The i486DX is available at 25, 33 and 50 megahertz. The i486SX comes in 16, 20 and 25MHz versions.
Customers have had some of these choices for years. But, as in the case of the 386 SL and its power management, Intel is starting to increase the differentiation.
Last week Intel introduced the i486DX2, a "clock doubling" chip that operates internally at 50 MHz, but which communicates with the computer's internal data bus at 25 MHz. The Tandy Corporation uses the 50-MHz i486 DX2 chip in its new Tandy 4850 EP personal computer (base price $2,699), which Tandy says operates about 70 percent faster than Tandy's regular 25-megahertz 486 machine. A 66-MHz i486DX2 is expected soon, and Intel has talked about a 100-MHz chip.
Intel also recently introduced a low-voltage i486SX, which operates on a power supply of just 3.3 volts, compared with the 5 volts of conventional chips. A series of low-power chips is expected, which, because they do not require big batteries, will enable portable computers to get smaller and lighter.
And if all that is not enough, Intel is expected to introduce sometime this summer an entirely new family of chips, code-named the P5. Many analysts suspect that the P5 will eventually be rechristened the i586, and there is no reason to believe that it will come in fewer varieties than its predecessors.
And as they say in those late-night television ads for the razor-sharp knife -- but wait, there's more. If you buy a 386-level PS/2 computer from the International Business Machines Corporation, you may be offered a 386 SLC chip. The 386 SLC is a proprietary chip based on the Intel design, but I.B.M. has souped it up to offer higher performance. I.B.M. initially used the SLC for its Ultimedia PC, but will soon use it as a "value added" feature on other PS/2 machines.
I.B.M. has also demonstrated a prototype of a chip very much like Intel's i486DX2. Intel and I.B.M. have an agreement to share chip technologies for the next 10 years, suggesting that we'll see many more I.B.M. computers with highly specialized chips.
If you buy a 386SX computer from some other company, there is a one-in-five chance that the chip is made by Advanced Micro Devices of Sunnyvale, Calif. Advanced Micro has the right to make and sell clones of Intel's 386 -- not exact copies, but functionally superior, the company claims. Intel responds that customers are moving to 486-based systems anyway.
Of course, Advanced Micro says it plans to clone the Intel 486 and 486SX chips as well. Soon it will not be the only company cloning Intel's chips. Chips and Technologies Inc. (recently sued by Intel for patent violations, and countersuing on the same charge), Texas Instruments, Cyrix, Nextgen and perhaps others have said they will offer 386-like chips.
But there is at least a possibility that the 386 chip may be obsolete by the time these companies reach the market. So much innovation is going on that a plain vanilla clone may not be able to generate any profits.
"You're not getting basically the same chip 20 different ways," Mr. McCarron noted. "Everybody is bringing something to the party. Everybody is going back to the fast and hard rule of the microprocessor industry -- innovate or die."

HEADLINE: Trade and the Environment

 BODY:
To the Editor:
The articles "In Poor Regions, Environmental Law . . . Should Be Appropriate" (Forum, March 1) do not fairly represent the environmental threats of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade and the North American Free Trade Agreement. 
 Regarding the first, we challenge the simple assumption of Gene Grossman and Alan Krueger that economic growth means environmental protection. Uncontrolled economic growth can be devastating. Increased agricultural exports from Brazil, for example, have accelerated deforestation and soil erosion, threatening the lives of rural Brazilians.
Arthur Dunkel, Director General of GATT, presents the most glaring example of narrow economic thinking by insisting that nations can no longer play a role as environmental leaders. And he has said agreements concerning ozone depletion, international waste trade and endangered species are seen as "possible sources of conflict with the GATT rules."
As for the second, Stanley M. Spracker and Gregory J. Mertz seem to be unaware of the environmental objections to NAFTA. United States industry is taking advantage of the loose environmental laws of Mexico by moving operations south of the border, encouraged by the Bush Administration's reliance on voluntary compliance by industry -- "compliance" that has resulted in ecological devastation along the border.
The Sierra Club is not opposed to expanded trade, but to policy that suggests that trade is free of costs to society. Trade agreements can and should become important tools for a more comprehensive form of development, not just narrow economic growth.

HEADLINE: Coins

BYLINE: By Jed Stevenson

 BODY:

Tokens In Lieu of Change
 Among a host of coins being auctioned later this month is a rare and interesting example of the "Hard Luck" tokens of the early-19th century. This particular one is called the "Am I Not a Man & a Brother" token, a title taken from the inscription on the obverse. 
 Hard Luck tokens were minted in 1837 and 1838, years when Americans found themselves in a recession, surrounded by bank failures. Those days, people hoarded coins in bad times and small change became hard to find. Merchants began buying tokens from private mints at less than face value and used them as one-cent pieces when tendering change. The 1838 "Am I Not a Man & a Brother" token, which catered to antislavery sentiments in the Northeast, was one of hundreds of these tokens.
The "Am I Not a Man & a Brother" token is actually the rarer sibling (only three are known to exist) of the "Am I Not a Woman & a Sister" token. The two are quite similar, differing mostly in the inscription. The figures of a slave on the tokens are nearly identical; however, the poses and the way the slaves are shackled are different.
The token is a strong reminder of abolition, one of the three central political themes of the 19th century: the other two were temperance and women's rights. Abolitionists, taking their cue from Britain, began agitating for an end to slavery at the close of the 18th century, and the battle continued until the Civil War. The phrase "Am I Not a Man and a Brother" appeared frequently in Britain on tokens and even china. The "and" was changed to an ampersand when the slogan crossed the ocean.
Why the female version of the token is more prevalent than the male is a numismatic mystery. Some believe that it may have been that the dies for the "Am I Not a Man & a Brother" token may have broken early in the run, while the others survived. Or the female token may just have been more popular, and the male tokens could not be sold. At any rate, some 500 to 1,000 "Am I Not a Woman & a Sister" tokens are thought to exist.
Both tokens can be seen in the New York Vista Hotel, 3 World Trade Center (between West and Liberty Streets), in Manhattan from March 24 to March 27. The auction, held by Bowers & Merena, is scheduled for the afternoon and evening of March 26 and the evening of March 27. For more information, call Bowers & Merena (800) 458-4646.
 
Missing $100,000 Dimes
 The Professional Numismatists Guild, a company in Van Nuys, Calif., that assesses and assigns grades to valuable coins, has organized a contest to find 1894-S dimes. Only 24 of the dimes were minted at the San Francisco mint in 1894, and of those only 12 are known to exist in collections.
The "S" denotes its San Francisco provenance. Anyone finding a genuine 1894-S dime will receive free authentication services and a free trip with two nights' accommodations in Orlando, Fla., to attend the American Numismatic Association convention in August. The finder also holds a coin worth well over $100,000.
Other 1894 dimes or coins are not selling for anywhere near that amount. For example, an 1894 dime minted in Philadelphia is worth less than $50 in all but the very best of grades. Lucky hunters should call Paul L. Koppenhaver, the company's executive director, at (818) 781-1764.
 
A Medal for Erudition
 Every year, the American Numismatic Society presents the Archer M. Huntington Medal to honor numismatic scholarship. This year's winner is Peter Robert Franke of Saarbrucken, Germany.
Mr. Franke will receive the award and will talk about his specialty, Greek imperial coinage, at 3 P.M. next Sunday at the society's headquarters, Broadway at 155th Street in Manhattan. The speech is entitled "The Memory of Alexander the Great in Roman Asia Minor." For information, call (212) 234-3130.

HEADLINE: Braniff Says It Exceeds Industry Standards

 BODY:
It is unfortunate that your reporter did not reach out to Braniff International executives to get the fair, honest and complete story on Long Island's airline to Florida ["Oh, the Quest for the Cheapest Air Fares," March 1]. Had she done so, many of the inaccuracies and omissions could at least have been corrected. One might even get the impression that Braniff International was in some way responsible for the foul weather that one day, which must certainly have played a part in her and everyone's mood that day. The facts, however, belie her conclusions.
It is true that our flight was overbooked on that particular Saturday, being the Saturday of Presidents' weekend, and one of the busiest travel days of the year. So were the flights of other major airlines at MacArthur Airport. Our problem was exacerbated by a computer-input error -- yes, we do have computers, including at MacArthur; it is the electronic ticket printers which have been ordered but have not yet arrived or been installed -- which permitted the normally authorized booking limit to be exceeded. 
 How did Braniff International handle this problem? After asking for volunteers in exchange for free tickets -- which is the Government-mandated course of action for the industry -- a number of people did so volunteer. For the rest of the people, we bought tickets on another airline and got them to South Florida that day, even though it cost us substantially more than they had paid for their tickets in the first place. It was the only fair thing to do. What did the other airlines do? I think the answer would surprise you.
Incidentally, the family of four referred to in the article, who supposedly got "bumped" on Friday, in fact volunteered to go on Saturday, and they went.
The simple fact is that all airlines overbook their flights, because they get a high percentage of no-shows. For February, Braniff International averaged 37 empty seats per flight to and from MacArthur Airport, hardly a figure consistent with the suggestion of rampant overbooking by Braniff International.
Your reporter is also mistaken in her statement that Braniff International does not generally serve meals on its flights; every flight to and from MacArthur serves meals, and when was the last time any airline passenger can remember having had meals served at the gate area by caring airline personnel when a flight was delayed?
As far as the lateness of one particular flight, your reporter could have found out that that particular flight was delayed in Florida when a contract fueler who doesn't work for Braniff International spilled fuel on the tarmac, preventing our flight, which was ready to go, from leaving. In fact, for the month of February, Braniff International ran an 83.8 percent on-time performance to and from MacArthur Airport, which is well above industry standards for the major carriers.
Braniff is made up of the finest, most dedicated, most hard-working employees I have ever had the pleasure of knowing. Our flight crews have more experience on the average than any airline in the industry, and our service on the airplane is second to none, with friendly staff and more legroom than most of the major airlines.
Unfortunately, there are many people who wish Braniff International would simply go away. The fact that our fares are extremely reasonable and that they cannot be purchased through travel agents makes us unpopular in some circles, but not with the flying public on Long Island, for whom our low fares, lack of restrictions and convenience make travel possible and easy for many people who simply would not nor could not have traveled, not to mention the business and economic stimulation our flights generate for Long Island. We would have expected more from a community-minded publication such as yours.

HEADLINE: TRADE WARRIORS;
Jobs and Protectionism Test Candidates' Creativity

BYLINE: By R. W. APPLE Jr.

DATELINE: CHICAGO

 BODY:
Richard M. Nixon to the contrary notwithstanding, there is one foreign-policy issue that has caught the attention of candidates and voters this winter. Not aid to Russia or the future of NATO or relations with China, though; the issue is foreign trade, and what it does to jobs at home.
It has made the agenda while the others have not because the nation is in a selfish mood (or at least the candidates think it is), and only on trade have the voters sensed how far-off events influence their own well-being. 
 The trade debate has reached a fever pitch in Michigan, which votes in a Presidential primary on Tuesday, because that state's premier industry, automobile manufacturing, has been dealt a one-two punch: first, Japanese and other foreign cars have captured a sizeable segment of the market, forcing General Motors to close a large number of plants, including the sprawling Willow Run facility west of Detroit; and second, free-trade negotiations with Mexico threaten to prompt American manufacturers to shift more of their operations there and buy more parts there because of lower labor costs.
Those economic realities, like the more generalized recession in New Hampshire earlier in the year, have helped shape the campaign. With much at stake for both the Republicans and the Democrats in Michigan and Illinois, which also votes on Tuesday, a stampede is on to demonstrate unswerving economic patriotism. No matter how facile the symbolism, no matter how much adjustment of reality, every one of the candidates is playing the game.
Turn on your television set here in the industrial heartland and you'll see a commercial for President Bush, the man who initiated fast-track negotiations with Mexico, looking toward a North American free-trade zone. He is also the candidate who has stood most resolutely against protectionism from the start. But does the ad extol the benefits of unfettered trade? It does not. It attacks his main rival for daring to drive a German car.
"While our American auto industry suffers, Pat Buchanan chose to buy a foreign car, a Mercedes-Benz," the announcer informs the electorate.
You'll also see a commercial for Pat Buchanan, the "America First" candidate, the "free trade hawk" who promises if elected to duke it out with the Japanese and others whom he describes as waging economic warfare against the United States. But does it even hint at how he would fight back? It does not. It shows mug shots of three Bush campaign officials who have worked as lobbyists for foreign interests and labels them, melodramatically if accurately, as "foreign agents."
"No wonder Michigan has lost 73,000 jobs," a voice says in the non sequitur of the week.
The two Democratic candidates who were most critical of free trade, Senators Tom Harkin of Iowa and Bob Kerrey of Nebraska, didn't last long enough to join the melee in the Midwest. Mr. Harkin said on several occasions, "I'm proud to be called a protectionist," and Mr. Kerrey ran commercials showing him in a hockey goal, preparing to fend off pucks fired by rapacious Japanese traders.
If nothing else, the early failure of their candidacies demonstrated that Japan-bashing and allied techniques are not enough by themselves to keep a candidacy afloat.
 
Playing the Trade Card
 But then that lesson had been taught earlier by John Connally, who thundered in 1980 that if the Japanese wouldn't play fair, he'd leave them "on the docks of Yokohoma in their Toyotas, watching their Sonys, because they aren't going to ship them here." He won exactly one convention delegate. The Japan-needler if not Japan-basher of 1988, Representative Richard A. Gephardt of Missouri, did better, but not nearly well enough.
That has not stopped the remaining three Democrats from playing the trade card for all it's worth in Michigan. Two of them galloped around the state last week in United Auto Workers warmup jackets, looking for all the world like neophyte bowlers -- former Senator Paul E. Tsongas of Massachusetts, who says he'll never pander to any special interests, and former Gov. Edmund G. Brown Jr. of California, who used to be known as a free trader in his home state, which does a lot of business with Asian nations.
Mr. Tsongas clearly hopes the jacket will make union members, a vital part of the vote in both states, forget his support of free trade with Mexico. His campaign has put out flyers saying that "he strongly supports buying American products," and he pays occasional obeisance to the idea that Japan must ease trade restrictions so as to create "a level playing field."
But as he said at lunchtime Friday at the Top Flight lunch counter on Chicago's southwest side, he doesn't consider that the main problem. What is really needed, he told a man who asked him about imports, is quite simple: "If you want to compete with Japan, you build better products."
Mr. Brown is railing against the free-trade talks with Mexico, using them as an example of how "the corrupt few" -- presumably meaning auto company executives and their political friends -- export American jobs "to countries where they can get cheap labor."
It is not Japan's fault that Japanese cars are better able to compete in the marketplace, he says at plant gates and in union halls, it's the fault of the bosses, who close down factories, design unmarketable cars and make "20 times as much as the worker on the line." The message has started a Brown boomlet in Michigan.
 
Concrete Issues
 But other things seem to loom larger in most Democrats' minds, especially beating Mr. Bush in November, and that has pushed Michigan and Illinois voters toward Mr. Clinton, whose sweep in the Southern primaries on Super Tuesday last week put him way in front of the Democratic pack with 728 of the 2,145 delegates needed to win the Presidential nomination. Mr. Tsongas emerged from the primaries with 343 delegates, Mr. Brown with 89. For most people whose jobs are not directly at stake, trade is an abstract issue, and most people here and in Michigan are not in the auto industry.
The Arkansas Governor has for the most part shied away from protectionism, declaring repeatedly that only 25 percent of the trade imbalance with Japan is Tokyo's fault, the rest the United States'. He has supported the fast-track negotiations with Mexico.
But he, too, tries to sound tough on trade without going too far, as when he told a high-school student in Wyoming, Mich., on Friday that a free-trade agreement in this hemisphere would require "the elevation of labor standards and environmental standards on the other side of the Rio Grande River," because otherwise $25-an-hour jobs here would become $1- or $1.50-an-hour jobs in Mexico.
But he said nothing to suggest how an American President could mandate pay levels in Mexico. And that's the nub of the problem for many voters as they prepare to cast their ballots: Trade problems are tough nuts to crack, and none of the candidates have been able to explain how, in a world as interdependent as that of today, they would bring back the good old days when Americans bought almost exclusively products made by other Americans.

HEADLINE: IDEAS & TRENDS;
A New Tune For Radio: Hard Times

BYLINE: By EDMUND L. ANDREWS

 BODY:
Though a dedicated optimist, Randall Harris looks out from his tiny AM radio station in Sarasota, Fla., and periodically wonders whether survival is possible. When his father bought WSPB two years ago to air classical music, the station was so unprofitable that its former owner had turned off the transmitter. Since then, at least two other stations in the city have "gone dark," in industry jargon, and two more broadcast on and off as their owners search for successful formats.
Mr. Harris says he doesn't expect to see his first annual profit until 1993, and he is working feverishly to persuade advertisers that classical music has an audience and that his station's ability to broadcast in stereo makes it possible to overcome the notorious inferiority of AM sound. But the competition is brutal: broadcast and cable television, daily and weekly newspapers, free shopping flyers and direct mail. "The future of radio is bright," Mr. Harris contended. "But that's 10 years from now. Right now, it's incredibly difficult." 
 WSPB's story is relatively positive in today's radio industry. Once the principal medium by which people received their news and entertainment, radio has become a sick industry where small stations are failing in droves, forced to slash newsgathering and original programming.
The problems are much deeper than the current recession. Over the last decade, the Federal Communications Commission has licensed 2,000 new stations, bringing the total to 10,800. Meanwhile, the growth of cable television, telephone marketing and other forms of advertising have spurred intense competition for ad dollars.
In financial terms, the result has been a bloodbath. The National Association of Broadcasters estimates that most stations are losing money. Like the population of a troubled third world country, the radio industry has become divided into two groups: the wealthy few and the impoverished many. According to N. A. B., the nation's 50 biggest stations generate about 11 percent of the industry's revenues and about 50 percent of its profits.
Once, broadcasters who had fallen on hard times would have been able to find an eager buyer for their licenses. No more. The F. C. C. reports that 287 stations have simply shut down operations, 153 in the last year alone, because their licenses had become worthless.
Hoping to stem the financial decline of commercial radio, the F. C. C. last week eased regulations limiting a single company from owning more than one AM and one FM station in one city and more than 12 of each nationwide. The new rules, a boon to big broadcasting companies, will enable a company to acquire as many as six stations in a single city and as many as 60 stations nationwide.
Most broadcasters argue that consolidation will help the industry become more efficient, allowing it to cut costs and invest in expensive programming that reaches a bigger audience, while critics say it will enable a few big corporations to dominate. But even those who say the old rules have become outdated admit that radio's ills will not be solved just by changing ownership rules.
Small stations that remain have cut back or dropped active newsgathering. "It is unassailable that stations have been cutting back dramatically on old-fashioned news gathering, enterprise reporting, where reporters go out and cover stories," said Richard Bartlett, president of the Radio-Television News Directors Association.
 
Robot Stations
 Many small stations have virtually stopped airing any original programming at all. In the last year, a growing number of stations have essentially been transformed into robot transmitters that broadcast material of more powerful stations elsewhere.
Broadcasters and the F. C. C. deserve part of the blame for their plight. AM stereo has been technically feasible for years, and many car radios are equipped to receive it. But the Government refused to order the industry to adopt a particular standard in the early 1980's, and broadcasters became split between two rival technical approaches. As a result, AM stereo was largely stillborn and failed to help stem the decline relative to FM radio.
Meanwhile, social changes have compounded the problem. The phenomenal rise of nationwide mass-merchandise stores like Wal-Mart has displaced small-town retailers that once advertised heavily on radio. Big mass merchandisers rely more on national advertising than local radio.
What may be the biggest challenge yet is still on the horizon: digital radio, which proponents say can offer the clarity of compact disks and may be broadcast from satellites within the next several years.
Yet, just as the advent of television failed to stop the growth of radio, and just as videocassette recorders hardly spelled the end of movie theaters, radio continues to have certain unique advantages. It is cheap, local and, at least for now, the only form of broadcasting most people can receive in their cars.

HEADLINE: THE WORLD;
Now That They Must, Former Soviets Hustle for Money

BYLINE: By LOUIS UCHITELLE

DATELINE: MOSCOW

 BODY:
Visit with the new Siberian oil barons. Listen to the ambitious managers at the Vaz Auto Works in Togliatti. Get to know the street merchants, consultants, real estate brokers and commodity traders in Moscow. Or watch seven men and women, hired by an entrepreneur in Kiev, assemble small electric water pumps at tables in a sooty rented factory room, using screwdrivers and wrenches.
A surprisingly vital if sometimes crude capitalism is emerging in the countries that made up the Soviet Union as people join the struggle to make money -- sometimes with enthusiasm for their new lives, in other cases simply to hang on to an old standard of living or to afford enough food. "The opportunities are so blatant -- the gap between what people have and what they want is so great -- that people are rushing to fill it," said Marshall Goldman, associate director of Harvard's Russian Research Center and a frequent traveler to Moscow. "Some are acting out of desperation and others are grabbing opportunity." 
 Whatever the reasons, after 70 years of socialism and job security, millions of people -- nobody knows exactly how many -- seem to have taken to capitalism, with all its uncertainties, as the unavoidable next step in their struggle for a better life. Many are doing so only in small ways, hustling for a few extra dollars. But the political import is still significant, since their actions are in effect supporting the free-market policies of Russia's President, Boris N. Yeltsin. "They believe he'll create new conditions for survival," said Andrei N. Kakoshin, deputy director of the Institute of the United States and Canada, a research organization in Moscow.
Officials of the International Monetary Fund, in fact, say that Mr. Yeltsin may already have acquired the political room necessary to proceed to the next painful stage of making the economy more competitive, a stage in which credit would be cut back and workers would be laid off.
The grass-roots vitality could, of course, turn to lethargy and revolt as this more difficult phase begins. Shrinking the work force at inefficient, costly industries is viewed as the necessary next step to profitability and competitiveness, not only by the I.M.F. and Western industrial nations, but also by many of Mr. Yeltsin's ministers. Inequities in income might also breed disillusionment and resistance, especially among the elderly, with their meager pensions, or among workers whose wages fail to keep up with inflation, which in recent months has been about 300 percent at an annual rate across the former Soviet lands.
Measuring the suffering is difficult, but specific problems offer a glimpse. For example, Boris Pinsker, a Russian economist, cites reports from gynecologists that pregnant women appear to be in poorer health than a year or two ago, and that malnutrition is more common.
"Forty percent of the people we have polled tell us that they don't know what to do and they will wait passively to see what happens," said Tatyana Zaslavskaya, a sociologist and director of the Soviet Center for Public Opinion and Market Research, which periodically polls 3,000 people across the Commonwealth. "They are the aged, the less educated and those who don't have good health, and as a rule they are paid less."
Such people are already losing ground to a growing corps of managers, entrepreneurs, merchants, consultants, traders and others nimble enough to make money in the new capitalism. They often succeed because they are more adept as traders, buying and reselling what already exists, than as manufacturers, who might increase the national wealth by making new products. Production, in fact, has fallen sharply over the last year, in factories and on farms, as Corporate Russia adjusts to a world in which enterprises scramble for supplies and customers while they shake off central authority. Some companies even elect to produce less rather than more, believing that shortages push up prices and profits.
But with all the drawbacks, these scenes are becoming more frequent, particularly in Russia and Ukraine, the two most populous republics:
* Seated at the conference table in his large office, Yuri Vershinin, general director of the Tyumen Oil and Gas Company, outlines expansion plans. Mr. Vershinin, a 49-year-old engineer, has become the commander of a company with 6,000 employees that pumps thousands of barrels of oil a day from wells in Siberia's Tyumen Province. "We want not only to pump oil, but to explore for it, refine it and own gasoline stations," he said. "We understand that we need the profit from all these operations to develop new fields."
* Rair Simonyan is a prestigious Russian economist, chief of research at the state-funded Institute of World Economy and International Relations. But his salary of less than 2,000 rubles a month, or $20, no longer covers his family's expenses. So he founded a consulting firm and runs it from his institute office, with institute employees on his staff and a list of foreign companies as clients. "We have commercialized our knowledge," Mr. Simonyan said. "We gave a lot of advisory service free, and now we charge for it." (Millions of others have similarly commercialized themselves, from the cardiologist at a state hospital who now sees patients privately to the elderly woman with a 342-ruble-a-month pension who waits two hours in line at a state store to purchase a shirt and then resells it on the street to a passerby who wants to avoid lines.)
* Nikolai A. Glushkov, vice general director of the Vaz Auto Works, which makes 700,000 of the 1.2 million cars manufactured annually in the former Soviet republics, hosts a dinner attended by several other top Vaz executives. They are working 12-hour days, taking control of a huge state company that is in the process of becoming a shareholder's corporation. Management -- 150 executives -- is to get 5 percent of the stock under Russia's privatization law. Mr. Glushkov, a 42-year-old physicist, says he has a personal dream: to leave to his children stock in an enterprise made so prosperous "they can live off what they inherit, even if they are lazy."
Second jobs, as well as extra hours, are becoming a common way to jack up income, Ms. Zaslavskaya says. But as workers advance into capitalism, they pay a price in uncertainty. That is particularly true in the construction industry, one of the first to spawn private companies. Today, 2 million of Russia's 8.5 million construction workers are privately employed, the Federation of Independent Trade Unions of Russia says. They earn 1,500 rubles a month on average, in contrast to the average 900 at state-owned construction companies. But they also work longer hours -- nine a day, without a paid lunch period, in contrast to eight hours a day, including a 45-minute lunch break, in the state sector.
And while state workers have rarely been laid off, their private sector colleagues live constantly with that problem, says Eugene Rechetnikov, a Federation official. So last December a union was founded to represent privately employed construction workers. "Salary is not a problem," Mr. Rechetnikov said. "Their main goal is protection from dismissal."

HEADLINE: THE NATION;
California Republicans Ready for Civil War

BYLINE: By ROBERT REINHOLD

DATELINE: SACRAMENTO, Calif.

 BODY:
Barring a political miracle, President Bush will have long since nailed down the Republican Presidential nomination by the time the big California primary rolls around on June 2. Nevertheless, the primary promises an emotional battle for the heart and soul of Republicanism in the largest state. It could also bring an early preview of the 1996 Republican Presidential sweepstakes.
The reason is that Patrick J. Buchanan, Mr. Bush's challenger on the political right, has vowed to turn the primary into purgatory for Gov. Pete Wilson, a middle-of-the-road Republican considered something of a traitor by the party's right wing. Mr. Buchanan, with bloody historical allegory, promised to stage the "Antietam of the Republican Party" on primary day, to bring retribution for the conservatives who "have had their noses rubbed in the dirt" by Mr. Wilson and Mr. Bush. He told a television interviewer in Michigan that California voters "have begged us virtually to come out and make the case against Pete Wilson Republicanism and George Bush Republicanism for the conservative cause." 
 Governor Wilson, who calls himself a "compassionate conservative," lost no time in firing back, using some of the strongest words used yet by a prominent Republican in denouncing Mr. Buchanan. "I think some of his comments have been downright racist, anti-Semitic," he said. "There's no place in our Republican Party for that."
Behind the testy exchange lurked some complex national and state politics. Though Mr. Wilson vows he is just trying to be a good governor for now, it is widely assumed that both Mr. Wilson and Mr. Buchanan will be Presidential contenders in 1996, and the primary could provide the first test of wills between the two men. It could also affect Mr. Wilson's efforts to gain a Republican majority in the state Legislature by encouraging Republican candidates of his own stripe.
In 1991, his first year as Governor, Mr. Wilson found his programs opposed most vigorously by a hard core of Republican conservatives in the state Assembly who are known cheerfully around the capital as the cavemen. When he called on the Legislature to raise taxes to help erase a staggering $14.3 billion budget gap, the cavemen howled.
Mr. Wilson has since been tending to his right flank because conservative Republican voters, while perhaps not a major factor in California general elections, can be a potent force in the Republican primaries. On the day Mr. Wilson blasted back at Mr. Buchanan, he was in Stockton campaigning for Dean Andal, an Assemblyman who won a special election last year by declaring himself more conservative than Mr. Wilson.
A combination of reapportionment and a voter-passed measure that sharply limits the terms of legislators appeared this year to have given Mr. Wilson an opportunity to reshape the Legislature more in his own image. But the Buchanan factor has given Republicans pause and Democrats glee. Should the challenger invigorate the angry right and bring crowds of them to the polls, some of Mr. Wilson's candidates could suffer.
Among them is Governor Wilson's hand-picked successor in the United States Senate seat he vacated last year, John Seymour, who, like the Governor, differs from the national Republican Party on certain salient issues -- he espouses "choice" on the abortion issue, for example. He faces a primary challenge from the conservative Orange County Congressman William E. Dannemeyer.
But the Wilson headaches are potentially migraine in the races for state Assembly, where the Governor must obtain a two-thirds majority for crucial budget votes. Twenty-three of the 80 seats are open and pitched battles for the Republican nomination are under way in the districts where Republicans have a chance. Even some Republican incumbents face stiff right-wing challengers. For example, here in the Sacramento area, Assemblyman B. T. Collins, a moderate Republican who won a narrow victory in a special election last year, faces a rematch against Barbara Alby, a conservative.
 
A Dubious Reward
 The danger is that Mr. Wilson's reward for besting the Democrats on reapportionment is a Legislature dominated by a combination of antagonized Democrats and resentful Republicans. The prospect delights the powerful Democratic Speaker of the Assembly, Willie L. Brown Jr. of San Francisco, who is struggling to retain Democratic control of the Assembly and nursing resentment that Governor Wilson backed a proposal to limit state officeholders' terms.
The entire episode is complicated by the fact that Mr. Buchanan's campaign manager, his sister Angela (Bay) Buchanan, is a Californian who ran and lost a race for state treasurer in 1990. She is reported to be interested in challenging Mr. Wilson for the gubernatorial nomination in 1994. She told reporters last week that her brother decided to attack Mr. Wilson because of the role he played in trying to get the state Republican Party to suspend its rules and endorse President Bush at its recent convention. The effort was called off.
For their part, Mr. Wilson and his staff dismiss the Buchanan challenge. The Governor called the Buchanan blast "more whistling past the graveyard." In an interview, Mr. Wilson said that Mr. Buchanan's appeal is mainly a vehicle for people wanting to protest the economy. One of his spokesmen, Dan Schnur, termed it a "distraction" from the Governor's political agenda of gaining a majority in the Assembly.
Either way, Mr. Buchanan's plans to camp out for two months in California this spring promise to enliven a Republican primary that might otherwise have passed without much notice.

HEADLINE: No Balance? No Problem!

BYLINE: By CARLYLE C. DOUGLAS

 BODY:
A voter could wind up in trouble with the law for treating a checking account the way some politicians treated theirs in a bank run by the House of Representatives for its members. After audits last year showed that most members sometimes overdrew their accounts and some members did so routinely, House Democrats began looking for a way to contain the damage. They hoped to get away with simply closing the bank and making public the names of the two dozen worst abusers of a system that allowed members to write insufficiently funded checks without penalty or interest.
But with the issue being forced by the Republicans -- who have less to lose simply because there are fewer of them -- the House Democrats agreed last week to the publication of the names of all 355 current and former members who wrote checks against insufficient funds over a 39-month period investigated by a House panel last fall. The names of the 24 worst abusers are to be released this week, with the rest following in 10 days. The abuses ranged from apparently inadvertent overdrawing of less than $100 in a few checks to habitual writing of dozens of uncovered checks a month for thousands of dollars. 
 The House bank was less a bank than a check-cashing convenience for members. Their paychecks were automatically deposited and they were allowed to write checks against future deposits. Theoretically, members were notified of their overdrafts and asked to cover them within a specified time. But some members said they were never notified, and others, who knew they were overdrawn, simply considered it a running salary advance.
With the economy out at recess, the time could not be much worse for reminding voters that until very recently their national legislators had a handy dollar-stretching perk. Release of the details is expected to cost some members their seats, though some of the lesser miscreants have confessed and asked forgiveness from their constituents.
Representative Gerry Sikorski, a Minnesota Democrat, owned up to writing 671 bad checks for a total of $119,966.97 and directed his contrition to the voters back home.
"We should not have been so casual and careless with our personal account," he said. "We are sorry and apologize."
The mess has already cost one job, that of Jack Russ, who resigned last week as the House's sergeant-at-arms, the office responsible for administering the bank. Mr. Russ, a Democratic appointee who had himself written 19 bad checks for a total of $56,100, was blamed by some members, who said he had run a rather loose ship.

HEADLINE: THE WORLD;
Genius for Hire: The Soviet's Best, At Bargain Rates

BYLINE: By WILLIAM J. BROAD

 BODY:
The millions of scientists and engineers of the former Soviet Union, once feared and respected throughout the world for their big rockets and thermonuclear bombs, for their mathematical rigor and breakthroughs in fields like nonlinear optics, are now desperate amid a crumbling economy. Many have been thrown out of work. The lucky ones who still do science often help support themselves and their families by moonlighting. Inevitably, a growing number who can afford to do so are leaving to work in the West. And those left behind can often be hired for a song.
That point was driven home last week as a top team of more than 100 fusion scientists at the Kurchatov Institute of Atomic Energy in Moscow signed a contract to go to work for Uncle Sam. The cost to American taxpayers for one year's effort was an amazingly low $90,000. So eager was the team to work for the United States that it fired up its world-class apparatus for exploring the feasibility of nuclear fusion even before the contract was signed. 
 How far will the trend go? What are the risks and benefits of saving Russian science? What is its ultimate fate? Western experts have many thoughts but few hard answers as they watch, in awe, as the world's largest scientific enterprise goes into free fall. "It's the end of a pattern established over a period of 60 years," said Dr. Murray Feshbach, an expert on Russian science at Georgetown University. "Funding has been cut back sharply. The pipeline for training is in total disarray. People are voting with their feet, going into cooperative and private activity."
On Friday, the National Academy of Sciences said the stakes for the West were so high that it should redouble its efforts to fund, hire and cooperate with Russian scientists, lest they be tempted by lucrative job offers from third-world despots. It called for a quick infusion of up to $150 million in scientific aid.
 
New Frontiers
 Dr. Loren R. Graham, an expert on Russian science and technology at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, said the risks and rewards for the West went beyond security to issues of culture, beauty and the wonder that comes with pushing the frontiers of knowledge.
"There are some areas of science where the old Soviet Union was a world leader," he said. "There were centers of excellence. If those dry up and disappear, it's a loss not just for Russia and former Soviet republics but for world civilization."
It was the Russian chemist Dmitri Mendeleev who came up with the periodic table of the elements in the 19th century. In the early 20th century, Ivan Pavlov probed the riddle of behavior. Soviet scientists put the first satellite and man into space. Pytor Kapitsa, Nikolai Basov and Lev Landau won Nobel prizes for physics.
But, overall, the seclusion and secrecy of the cold war took a toll. The Soviet Union lagged behind the West in breakthroughs in some high technologies and in the creation of computer chips. Ironically, their backward computer hardware forced Russian software designers to make their programs elegant and efficient, with the result that their skills are now much in demand in the West.
Today turmoil in Russian science is ubiquitous and links to the West are the foremost prize, not only because of the West's deep pockets but also because of its better working conditions, tools and equipment. The National Academy of Sciences says that hundreds if not thousands of Russian scientists have already flocked to the United States as visiting scholars at universities and institutes, providing an influx of new ideas as they shop for jobs that would allow them to stay permanently.
Dr. Mohamed S. El-Genk, a nuclear engineer at the University of New Mexico, recently brought experts from the Kurchatov Institute in Moscow for a semester in Albuquerque, even though he says it is better to fund them at home in Russia. "If you bring them over here, there's a chance they won't want to go back," he said. "You'll be draining the country of its talent."
Scientists left behind are signing Western contracts as fast as they can to supplement dwindling incomes. A Russian computer scientist, Boris A. Babayan, is setting up a laboratory in Moscow for Sun Microsystems Inc., based in Mountain View, Calif., that will employ his team of about 50 software and hardware designers. Mr. Babayan created the supercomputers used by the Soviets to design nuclear arms. Sun Microsystems will pay each of his team's members a few hundred dollars a year -- ample pay by Moscow standards.
 
Computer Experts
 "Mr. Babayan has a very clever computer architecture and a spectacularly smart research team," said David R. Ditzel, Sun Microsystems' director of advanced systems. Understandably, executives of the Microsoft Corporation, the nation's largest software company, and of Apple Computer Inc., say they too are in talks with Russian computer experts.
The drama at the Kurchatov Institute in Moscow, named after the father of the Soviet A-bomb, is similar to that of the computer wizards. The top nuclear-fusion team faced a bleak situation. It had excellent equipment -- a tokamak fusion reactor boasting the world's most powerful heater of fusion fuel -- but little money to run it or pay salaries. So starting in November the team courted the Federal Department of Energy, which pays for such research in the United States. The $90,000 deal was sealed last week.
 
Fusion Power
 "We hoped that Kurchatov would be doing this research themselves," said Dr. N. Anne Davies, director of the Energy Department's fusion research program. "When that wasn't possible, we were willing to fund it." How far might such arrangements go? "Our budget is very tight," Dr. Davis replied. "We'll take it on a case-by-case basis."
Such deals are starting to irk American scientists who face tight budgets themselves and growing competition from the tide of Russian scientific immigrants. "We can't afford to buy the whole Soviet scientific establishment," said Dr. Stephen O. Dean, president of Fusion Power Associates in Gaithersburg, Md., a nonprofit group that promotes fusion research. "We can't create a welfare program for them. We've already got lots of people in our own program who we would like to fund but can't."
Dr. Feshbach of Georgetown University said fears that America would spend lots of money buying up Soviet brainpower were unfounded. Hirings and attempted hirings, he said, would probably be limited to the cream of Russian science.
"Not everybody in this country or that country is a genius," he said. "Not everybody is a spectacular academician like Sakharov," the father of the Soviet H-bomb. Nevertheless, Dr. Feshbach estimated that anywhere from 1 percent to as much as 25 percent of the vast scientific workforce of the former Soviet Union might eventually forge links to the West to survive. "It's really rough on these people," he said. "Their lives are under enormous stress."

HEADLINE: THE NATION;
As the World Turns, U.S. Policy Stands Still

BYLINE: By THOMAS L. FRIEDMAN

DATELINE: WASHINGTON

 BODY:
It is hard to put an exact date on it but sometime over the summer, foreign policy just vanished from the American political debate, as though it were some fad that went out of style.
Robert S. Strauss, the American Ambassador to Russia and former Democratic national chairman, came home last week, read the newspapers, then told Congress that the absence of any serious debate on the question of aid to Russia was "just shocking." 
 "This ain't beanbag we're playing," he said. "These are big-time issues, this is life or death, this is the future of nations."
What happened to foreign policy as an issue? In part the debate died of fatigue, as the American public emerged from the cold war and the Persian Gulf war exhausted by the burdens of leadership and discouraged by one of the worst recessions since World War II. In part, the debate was murdered by a conspiracy of Republicans and Democrats, each certain that this would serve their political interests.
And in part, the absence of a foreign policy debate seems to be showing that the Bush Administration never had any larger vision in foreign policy than it did in domestic policy. What it had was a gulf war policy, and the right instincts to stand aside when great revolutions were unfolding in the Communist world. But now that it must shape a post-cold-war order to lock in the changes in the East, it finds itself groping. The Administration's apparent aspiration is to retain American hegemony on the cheap. In its dream world foreign policy would all be like the gulf war -- everyone else would pay and America would have its way. America would apportion the burdens of power, but not power itself. That approach will be a hard sell to the allies.
If one wanted to try to fix the date when foreign policy began to disappear from political debate it may well have been last July 28 in Manchester, N.H., when Senator Tom Harkin of Iowa, then a Democratic Presidential hopeful, held up a suitcase plastered with stickers bearing the names Moscow, Paris, Turkey, Kuwait and Greece. The suitcase, he said, belonged to President Bush, who was traveling abroad so much he had ignored domestic needs. "Unpack your bags and stay here in America," Mr. Harkin demanded of the President.
While the President dismissed the critique with a wave of his hand, it hit home. Within days Mr. Bush, worried about giving the Democrats an opening to attack him at his most vulnerable spot -- his shortcomings in domestic policy -- began to distance himself from the one area where his Administration had been hailed as a success, foreign policy. The Democrats also did not want to push foreign policy issues, for fear of playing to Mr. Bush's strength. Instead, they pushed a few small initiatives of their own vis-a-vis Russia, but generally adopted the position that if the President wanted any more foreign aid he would have to get out front and they would back him up.
After you. No, after you.
"Congress would be willing to do what is needed, with the right leadership," said Representative Stephen J. Solarz, the Brooklyn Democrat. "The reason you are not seeing much of a debate on these things is that given the manifest unpopularity of foreign aid, there are very few people who see much mileage in publicly calling for it -- in the absence of Presidential leadership. Because without the President's support it is not going to happen and so you are left with the worst of all worlds: getting flak for supporting an unpopular program without the satisfaction of seeing it implemented, or even being able to point to its accomplishments."
It would be bad enough if no one was saying anything. But everyone is saying "No" -- no to any new foreign aid initiatives. Last week, Secretary of State James A. Baker 3d appealed to Congress for $700 million to support United Nations peacekeeping troops to buttress the long-sought resolution of the conflict in Cambodia. He ran into a buzz saw of opposition from Democrats and Republicans alike.
Senator Ernest F. Hollings, the South Carolina Democrat who heads a key appropriations subcommittee, treated Mr. Baker as if he had landed from Mars, saying: "I know you've been on the road, but the home team's got to look at these budgets closer." The Administration's request for more funding for the International Monetary Fund, so it would have the resources to bolster the infant democracies in the former Soviet Union, got a similar thumbs-down.
These two cases are particularly poignant, because the lack of action deprives any Administration of tools it would need to shape the post-cold-war world -- a world likely to be characterized by multilateral efforts, led by institutions like the United Nations and the I.M.F., to settle regional disputes or provide economic aid where the superpowers might have once done so alone.
Mr. Bush has taken the position that he can go silent on foreign policy and just turn things over to his Secretary of State, but that does not work. Three months ago, Mr. Baker gave a speech at Princeton about the collapse of the Soviet Union. The speech articulated a lot of what needed to be done to support democracy in Russia. But there were two problems with it.
First, there was an enormous gap between what Mr. Baker said needed to be done and what he and the President were willing to push for at the time. Second, the speech was given by Mr. Baker, and therefore few noticed. Only the President can command such attention, but history will record that when America's enemy during 45 years of cold war collapsed, when a hostile standoff that had shaped the institutions and budgets of the American Government for four decades had finally ended, all Mr. Bush had to say was: We won.
Which raises another question -- the seeming paucity of foreign policy vision both in the Administration and among the leading Democratic candidates. Vision does not necessarily mean having a perfect road map for the future. The world is in too much flux for that now. Vision in the leadership sense can also mean simply acknowledging when historic changes have taken place, giving voice to their import and galvanizing the bureaucracy, Congress and the nation to debate and shape a long-term response that will serve America's interests. Vision isn't necessarily giving the right answers immediately; sometimes it is just asking the right questions.
 
Nixon's Critique
 That was the essence of former President Richard M. Nixon's critique of Mr. Bush last week: that what is happening in Russia today is comparable only to the defeat of Napoleon at Waterloo, the Versailles Peace Conference and the creation of NATO and the Marshall Plan. Get excited. Bring the nation's leadership together to define a moment that may only come along once a century.
When the Bush Administration came into office it ordered up a three-month-long strategic review, which produced a foot-high pile of documents and analyses on which policies of the Reagan Administration it wanted to continue, and which should be abandoned. Yet, when the cold war ended, the President never even gave a speech.
The only effort so far to put together a coherent blueprint for the post-cold-war era has come from the Pentagon, which is arguing that in a one-superpower world America should use its strength to deter aspiring tyrants like Iraq or North Korea as well as aspiring allies like Germany or Japan from overreaching, and thereby destabilizing the globe. While the arguments are debatable, the effort at least is being made. If Secretary Baker or Brent Scowcroft, the national security adviser, have done any such forward thinking of their own, they have not shared it with the public. Nor have the Democratic candidates. When Bill Clinton was asked for his reaction to Mr. Nixon's call for aiding Russia, he merely responded: "My view is that a constructive engagement there, with our allies, is good for Americans at home."
To be sure, after the primary campaign is over, the President and the candidates might feel more comfortable showing leadership on these issues. The question is: What will such a wait cost? Foreign policy cannot just be put on hold. The world does not stop for the American election campaign.

HEADLINE: IDEAS & TRENDS;
In the Worst of Times, America Keeps Giving

BYLINE: By FELICITY BARRINGER

 BODY:
Few nations rival the United States in its collective lust to get. But none rival it in its collective urge to give. Though the country is struggling to pull out of a recession, and some of its more charitable souls are shaking their heads over disclosures of free spending and high living by an official at the United Way of America, the unique American institution known as the nonprofit sector finds itself worried but well.
Whether they put dimes in the can on the store counter or write checks to their school or community hospital, or -- most of all -- put dollars in the collection plate, 75 percent of the households in the United States donate to charity, according to Independent Sector, a Washington-based group representing the nation's nonprofit institutions. Those households that gave in 1990 donated an average of $978 to such diverse causes as education, the environment, health care, homelessness, the arts and nuclear disarmament. 
 In 1990, giving totaled $122.6 billion and 9 in 10 dollars came from individuals, according to Giving USA, a New York-based magazine that monitors charities. Even adjusting for inflation, the 1990 total is nearly three times greater than in 1955. Though figures are still being compiled for 1991, experts say giving remains steady and is possibly increasing.
More than 96 cents of every dollar given, whether by foundations, corporations or factory workers, stays in the community it came from, according to Independent Sector. "The main reason people give is to provide help to the less fortunate," said Virginia Hodgkinson, the group's research director. "The second is to preserve institutions society uses. And the majority of giving is to institutions people know -- their church, synagogue, or their school."
The quintessential symbol of this generosity and its roots in the community has been United Way of America, the umbrella association representing 2,100 local chapters. After William F. Aramony resigned as president recently because of public outrage over his $463,000 salary-and-benefits package and other perquisites, some charity workers wondered whether donors would become less generous.
"Yes, members are nervous," said Brian O'Connell, president of Independent Sector. "The public's confidence is all we've got."
But other experts, while agreeing that the United Way itself may suffer setbacks in its fall campaigns, do not expect any long-term impact on charity in general.
"I'd be surprised if there were a major ripple effect," said Eleanor Brilliant, a professor of social work at Rutgers University. "People may be looking at charities somewhat suspiciously right now. But if you go to church and give there, what have Aramony's peccadilloes got to do with what you put in the collection plate?"
Giving USA found that more than 53 percent of all charitable gifts in 1990 went to religious organizations. After religion, education came in second, receiving 10 percent of all donations. Human services garnered about 9.6 percent, and health care about 8 percent.
Though the old guard charities like the Red Cross, the American Cancer Society, the United Jewish Appeal and Catholic Charities U.S.A. dominate, the charitable arena is far more crowded than ever before. Close to 500,000 organizations are registered as tax-exempt charities, and the number of tax-exempt foundations, which dropped dramatically in the early 1970's because of changes in the tax laws, has crept back up to more than 31,000.
 
Collecting Food
 One of the most successful new players is Second Harvest, a network of 182 food banks that grew out of a local project in Phoenix, Ariz. Its founder, John Van Hengel, asked supermarkets and food processers to donate healthy but unsalable products -- green beans cut too short to meet a canning company's standards, or canned and dry goods near their expiration dates. Last year Second Harvest ranked fourth on the list of leading national charities, with contributions, mostly of food, worth $394.8 million.
Community-based foundations formed to combat local problems have also proliferated. Less traditional charitable endeavors enjoy some success, from the hospice movement to environmental groups and organizations working on international problems like famine and community development.
About $2.3 billion was given to environmental causes in 1990, up 25 percent in constant dollars from 1989, according to Giving USA. Donations to international causes, $2.2 billion in 1990, have been much more inconsistent, spiking up in times of international crisis (the gulf war, the fall of Communism, the Ethiopian famine) and dropping sharply in between.
 
The New Wave
 Some of the new charities, particularly those associated with the women's movement or gay rights, have sometimes been viewed askance by traditional charities. Many of the newcomers have banded together into the 15-year-old Committee for Responsive Philanthropy, and some have become adept at marketing and direct-mail fund raising.
"Giving is a function of asking," said Robert Bothwell Jr., president of the committee. "With the cutback of government revenues in the early 1980's under President Reagan, some charities who didn't understand how to convert themselves and subsist on private revenues fell by the wayside. Others made the conversion and are stronger."
According to a recent study by Lester M. Salamon of Johns Hopkins University's public policy school and Alan J. Abramson of The Urban Institute, since 1982 private giving has generally not been able to make up for reductions in Federal spending. They found that increases in private giving have offset only 46 percent of the loss of Federal funds.
Corporate giving has remained fairly constant over the last few decades, even in recessionary times. But some charity watchers say the next surge in giving is likely to come from the third major group of donors -- foundations.
"We're just tailing off the most massive period of private wealth generation in history," said Waldemar A. Nielsen, author of "The Big Foundations." Generally, he said, the rich establish foundations as their monument, but they often put it off until they are in their 60's or 70's "because it is a premature death ritual." But he said there are 210,000 people in the country with fortunes of at least $10 million, and many are in their 50's and 60's.
"In the next 10 to 15 years," he said, "we could see a massive increase of resources in the nonprofit world."

HEADLINE: HURDLES INCREASE FOR MANY WOMEN SEEKING ABORTIONS

BYLINE: By TAMAR LEWIN

 BODY:
While lawyers and politicians focus on the legal battle over the right to abortion, millions of American women are finding that their access to abortion is growing more and more limited.
Despite the Supreme Court's 1973 ruling in Roe v. Wade that abortion is a constitutional right, a combination of economic forces, political pressures, and doctors' changing attitudes has put abortion out of reach for many women. 
 "About 20 percent of American women who want abortions cannot get them," said Janet Benshoof, director of the American Civil Liberties Union's Reproductive Freedom Project. "Because of money, geography and the shortage of doctors who will perform abortions, abortion is not an option for many poor women, rural women, teen-agers and women in the military."
 
Fewer Perform Abortions
 Other experts offer higher estimates, but all agree that the percentage of women who have no access to abortion is increasing steadily, as the pool of hospitals, clinics and doctors willing to perform the procedure continues to shrink.
For many poor women, abortion has been out of reach since 1977, when Congress barred the use of Federal money to pay for abortions. The recession has intensified the situation: several abortion clinics report performing more second-trimester abortions, as women take longer to gather the money to pay for the procedure.
And rural women increasingly must travel long distances, often crossing state lines, to get an abortion. Many cannot manage the hurdle of arranging transportation, lodging and a baby sitter to stay with their young children.
 
Less Training Is Offered
 Fewer and fewer doctors are trained to perform abortions; some are opposed to the practice, and others say they are unwilling to deal with the pickets, protests and bomb threats that come with doing abortions. There is also a growing sense among young gynecologists, now that most abortions are performed in outpatient clinics rather than hospitals, that abortion is not part of health care they need to provide, even though 1.4 million women underwent the procedure in 1988.
It is impossible to gauge exactly how much protests against abortion have limited women's access to the procedure, but it is clear that what abortion-rights advocates see as a problem, anti-abortion groups hail as a victory.
"From our point of view, abortion is an act of violence against the mother and the child, and any time that violence can be avoided, it's a step forward," said Olivia Gans, director of American Victims of Abortion, an offshoot of the National Right to Life Committee. "What we're slowly seeing is the American people collectively making changes to reflect mainstream American concerns about abortion."
Sandra Andersen, the executive director of Planned Parenthood of Southern Indiana, planned to start offering abortions at her Bloomington clinic to serve women from a 29-county area with no other abortion clinic. She has two procedure rooms set up and 10 nurses and counselors trained to assist.
But she can't find a doctor to do the abortions.
"I've been looking since last June, and I'm nowhere," she said. "We've called the medical schools, we've called every other abortion provider we can think of, and we haven't got anyone."
Many of the doctors who have been most committed to performing abortions, often because they remember the botched abortions of the era before Roe v. Wade, are retiring.
"I remember seeing vaginal lacerations from hangers, and wards full of women with infections from criminal abortions," said David McDowell, a 66-year-old Plattsburgh, N.Y., gynecologist who performed abortions until his retirement in 1984. "I remember a gal who had a piece of a wooden packing crate in her. If you don't have those memories, and you don't see the urgency of the need, you're not going to want the bother of doing abortions, and I guess that's what's happened in Plattsburgh, where no one does abortions now."
Those who run abortion clinics, even in large cities, say that recruiting doctors is now their most serious problem.
There are many measures of the difficulties women face in obtaining abortions. Some are statistical:
*Only 13 states pay for abortions for low-income women.
*Eighty-three percent of the nation's counties, home to 31 percent of women of child-bearing age, have no clinic or hospital providing abortions, although some of these have private doctors who quietly perform a few abortions for longtime patients.
*The number of hospitals offering abortions dropped from 1,654 in 1977 to 1,040 in 1988, the latest year for which data are available. And from 1980 to 1988, the nation's abortion rate dropped 7 percent, to 27 abortions per 1,000 women of child-bearing age from 29 per 1,000.
*In 1991, only 13 percent of the nation's obstetrics-gynecology residency programs required training in first-trimester abortions, and only 7 percent required second-trimester training; in contrast, nearly a quarter of all programs required both forms of training in 1985.
 
A Three-City Trek
 But the best indication probably comes from stories like that of 23-year old Mary Jiveden of New Haven, W.Va., a divorced, unemployed beautician with a 2-year-old daughter. Ms. Jiveden discovered she was pregnant during a checkup in late December.
"I had gone out with this guy one time, and it was kind of like date rape, and I had no idea I was pregnant until the doctor said I was," she said.
Ms. Jiveden did not know where to go for an abortion, and when she called the health department and hospitals, they told her they were not allowed to make referrals, presumably because of the regulations prohibiting federally financed family-planning programs from discussing abortion.
Many calls later, a receptionist in a gynecologist's office advised Ms. Jiveden to get a big-city newspaper and look for an abortion-clinic advertisement. The closest place she found was in Charleston, about four hours away. So Ms. Jiveden left her daughter with a friend and went.
But when Ms. Jiveden was examined at the Charleston clinic, she was told that she was 17 weeks pregnant, and the clinic did not do abortions after 16 weeks. She was referred to a Cincinnati clinic, where the cost would be $850, and the limit was 19 1/2 weeks. Ms. Jiveden went there a week and a half later, thinking she was 18 1/2 weeks pregnant.
"They said I was 21 weeks, and they couldn't do it, and they referred me to Dayton, where it would cost $1,675," she said. "I refinanced my car, sold the V.C.R., borrowed money from everyone I could, and went to Dayton. But there they said I was high-risk, because I'd had my daughter by Caesarean. They said it would be $2,500, and I'd have to fly to Wichita. I just didn't think I could manage that."
So Ms. Jiveden is waiting to have the baby, a prospect that fills her with hopeless dismay.
"Now that I know I have to have it, I'm trying to get used to the idea," she said. "I'm not thinking about adoption, because I've never understood people having a baby just to give it away. So I've been thinking a lot about trying to love this baby the way I love my daughter. I don't know how I'm going to make a life for myself and these kids."
 
Stories of Desperation
 Counselors at abortion clinics across the country say they hear stories of desperation every day, of rape victims unable to pay for an abortion, of poor mothers using food money to pay for the procedure, of teen-agers too young to have a driver's license who take the family car and drive to a clinic hundreds of miles away.
Others take so long making arrangements, or borrowing money, that they pass the first-trimester limit most clinics impose. Abortions in the first 13 weeks usually cost $200 to $300. At the few clinics that will perform them, abortions late in the second trimester, a riskier, more complicated procedure, usually cost $2,000 or more.
"We've extended our limit from 21 weeks to 26, and our second-trimester abortions have gone from 10 percent to 20 percent of the procedures we do," said Lynn Thogerson of the Feminist Women's Health Center in Atlanta. "Because of the recession, some women are taking a longer time to get the money together."
Only 13 states, including New York, New Jersey and Connecticut, use their own money to pay for abortions for women on Medicaid, and some of them have recently cut back the categories of women they will pay for.
The shortage of doctors willing to do abortions is also having effects nationwide. The Planned Parenthood affiliates in Waco and Odessa, Tex., like the Indiana affiliate, are unable to find doctors for the abortion services they want to start. In Vermont, physician's assistants are now performing abortions, a practice several other states may soon approve. Even prominent urban clinics have difficulties.
"When the doctor who does abortions for us in Brooklyn had to go away for two weeks because his brother died, we couldn't find anyone to fill in, and we had to cancel abortions for two weeks," said Alexander Sanger, the president of Planned Parenthood of New York City. "Getting doctors is the No. 1 problem everywhere."
Meanwhile, fewer young doctors are being trained to perform abortions. Since the late 1970's, many obstetrics-gynecology residency programs have made abortion an elective, or stopped offering any abortion training at all. Hospital abortions, which were a majority of all abortions in 1973, are now a rarity, making up about 10 percent of all abortions. So young doctors who want to learn the procedure often have to moonlight at a clinic.
Becoming known as an abortionist carries its own perils. Buck Williams, the only doctor in South Dakota who performs abortions, works in a cinder-block office with bullet-proof windows and burglar alarms. Abortions have been part of his Sioux Falls practice for 11 years, and for 11 years, he has had to walk through pickets to enter his office.
"There's ugly phone calls and death threats, and one of the reasons I can keep doing this is that my kids have grown up," he said. "It's a lot harder for someone with small children who knows how his family is going to be affected. And there's a perception among doctors that if you do abortions your practice will be ruined, because your other patients will leave."
Hospitals that perform abortions often come under intense pressure, too. In St. Paul, for example, the Pro-Life Action Ministries lobbied to stop the county from renewing the St. Paul-Ramsey Medical Center's 35-year lease -- and the group is campaigning for a county ballot initiative to force the hospital to stop doing abortions.
"The anti-choice movement has led a two-pronged attack on abortion," said Kate Michelman, president of the National Abortion Rights Action League. "One is ending the legal right, the issue going to the Supreme Court. The second prong has been limiting access, by cutting off Federal funding, harassing doctors and hospitals, requiring parental notification and other things. And it's been very successful."
Both doctors and women's advocates say abortion has become isolated from mainstream medical practice, a situation that is partly an unintended outgrowth of the trend to outpatient abortion clinics.
"Back in the early 70's, Planned Parenthood led the fight to get abortions done in outpatient clinics, and it seemed like a good idea at the time, a way of providing easy access to good, cheap care," said Mr. Sanger.

HEADLINE: THE HOUSE BANK;
G.O.P. Sees the Bank Affair As Big Campaigns Weapon

BYLINE: By ADAM CLYMER, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, March 14

 BODY:
Republicans are hoping to use the House Bank affair and the impasse over tax legislation to make substantial gains in the House and to hold on to the Presidency.
But Democrats argue that whatever the headlines in March, by November the economy will matter much more. 
 As representatives went home this weekend to explain the bank affair on their own terms before official lists of those who overdrew their accounts were released, Republicans were licking their chops over their prospects in the House, which Democrats have controlled since 1955.
In a report that underscored the political potency of the issue, The Associated Press said tonight that it had been given a list of 21 Democrats among the 24 lawmakers considered "abusers" of the House Bank under a formula devised by the House ethics committee.
Missing from the list were three Republicans who the news agency said were also among the "abusers," and The A.P. said only that it had "obtained" the list from "Congressional sources" and did not explain why those sources had not identified the Republicans.
The list included four New Yorkers: Representatives Robert J. Mrazek of Long Island, Stephen J. Solarz of Brooklyn, Edolphus Towns of Brooklyn and James H. Scheuer of Queens. An aide to Mr. Mrazek said the list reference to him was inaccurate. But Mr. Solarz said its reference to him was "fairly accurate." [Page 28.]
 
G.O.P. Sees Its Chance
 "We've never had a better chance to persuade voters that who runs the House makes a difference," said Representative Guy Vander Jagt of Michigan, chairman of the National Republican Congressional Committee.
In recent years only a handful of incumbents have actually been defeated for re-election, though dozens have retired. But Mr. Vander Jagt predicted that this year would bring "a landscape change," comparable to the elections of 1932, 1946, 1964 and 1974, when scores of lawmakers were turned out of office.
Advisers to President Bush's re-election campaign are finding both the bank and the tax package spicy topics for the President and his backers. Mr. Bush has spent weeks belaboring Congress for not passing his tax and economic growth program quickly, and the deadline for passage, which he proclaimed in January, will fall this Friday. Vice President Dan Quayle got to work on the issue this week, labeling the House Bank problem "a national disgrace."
Republicans see these issues as explosive electoral tools to prove to voters that Democrats can solve neither national problems like the recession nor personal ones like balancing their own checkbooks, and that votes for Congress, especially the House, should be cast on more than local concerns.
But it may not be that simple. Even if the bank issue remains in the public mind by Election Day, its impact seems sure to hurt Republicans as well as Democrats. And with four recent House alumni serving in Mr. Bush's Cabinet, the imminent disclosures could hit the Administration harder than Congress.
Representative Vic Fazio of California, chairman of the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee, said voters would look at individual situations and punish Democrats and Republicans alike. By November, he predicted, they will be ready to forgive House members who are "up front" about their mistakes.
Gary Jacobson, professor of political science at the University of California at San Diego, said he felt the disclosures would embolden talented challengers in both parties who "smell a little blood."
But Norman Ornstein, resident scholar at the American Enterprise Institute, disagreed, saying the publicity given the lawmakers' overdrawn accounts would only erode responsible interest in public service. "We'll get demagogues, some multimillionaires and some people who fancy themselves purer than Mother Teresa," he said.
Nor is there much sense that the attack Mr. Bush has promised to launch when Congress fails to pass the tax package he has proposed by Friday will have much effect. Democrats are seeking to get their own bill, with middle-class tax cuts and upper-bracket increases, to him by that day for a veto that no one expects to be overridden.
Linda Divall, a Republican poll taker, said she thought the public reaction to the impasse would be to see the President and the Democrats as guilty of "partisan posturing" and say "A pox on both your houses."
The risks are greater for Democrats, of course, both because there are more of them in the House to be challenged and because Republicans will campaign against their decades of control.
While the bank issue is "very troublesome for incumbents of both parties, said David R. Mayhew, a professor of political science at Yale University, "it gives enemies of the Democratic House a new way to beat up on it."
Such an attack may be especially effective because "not much successful legislating is taking place this winter," he said. "So the record is otherwise barren."
The context for these concerns was set in 1990, when the average winning margins for House candidates of both parties declined for the first time in more than a century.
One poll after another has found that respect for Congress as an institution is at record low levels. And the distinction that voters have made for decades -- thinking that Congress was worth little but their own representative was a valued public servant -- may be weakening.
Fred Steeper, a Republican poll taker from Michigan who works with the Bush campaign, said the bank issue "could be the final straw that really crystallizes people's dissatisfaction with Congress."
 
A Personalized Issue
 And Professor Jacobson, in San Diego, said the issue could "personalize and individualize" a normally abstract issue like the Federal budget deficit. "Attacks on Congress in general don't do much damage to individual members," he said. But with this issue, challengers could say: "Joe Smith cannot balance his own checkbook. How can we expect him to balance the Federal budget."
Thomas E. Mann, director of government studies at the Brookings Institution, warned that effects of the bank affair would be "limited by the unavailability of challengers in certain districts and by the resourcefulness of members in offering satisfactory explanations of their behavior to their constituents."
This may be easier than some people think, he said, because with the haphazard records kept by the bank, "the vast majority are not abusers in any fair sense."
Mr. van der Jagt, a 13-term Congressman, said Republicans were doing better at recruiting challengers than in any recent year. But he added that one limitation on the advantage Republicans might have from the bank issue was that their kind of suburban voters were more likely to take this issue seruiously than were Democratic voters in big cities.
"Republican voters hold their Congressmen to a higher standard, in general, than Democratic voters hold their Congressmen to," he said.
Mr. Fazio, who has served seven terms in Congress, acknowledged the difference. "Suburban constituencies can relate more to banking issues," he said. "It will not be a major problem in some urban constituencies."
That difference, and the fact that many candidates, including Republicans, will be running in changed districts because of redistricting, are major reasons that Republicans want to contest the bank issue on more than a district-by-district basis, but in terms that decades of power have left the Democrats unfit to rule.

HEADLINE: THE 1992 CAMPAIGN: Candidate's Record;
Unions Are Split on Backing Clinton

BYLINE: By B. DRUMMOND AYRES Jr., Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: LITTLE ROCK, Ark., March 13

 BODY:
Workers in Michigan and Illinois, two big-labor states whose primaries on Tuesday may well decide the Democratic Presidential nomination, will find no definitive reading on Gov. Bill Clinton's labor record if they look toward his home state of Arkansas.
Here, he is either effusively praised or sharply damned, with little neutrality in between. 
 There are as many contradictions here as verities. And there are people who say that is precisely the way Mr. Clinton has played things, working sometimes with big labor, sometimes with big business, scrambling to keep from being caught in a political squeeze in a severely depressed state with a right-to-work law.
The leaders of seven major unions in Arkansas have come out in strong support of the Governor's Presidential bid, saying that in his 12 years in office he has been a friend of big labor, pushing for more jobs and higher wages.
 
Mixed Reviews All Around
 But other labor leaders in the state say Mr. Clinton has done little for worker safety and benefits. Similarly, the Governor gets mixed reviews from many business leaders in his state.
The labor leaders on record in support of Mr. Clinton's candidacy represent the United Paperworkers International, the American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees, the United Food and Commercial Workers, the United Steelworkers, the United Rubber Workers, the Amalgamated Clothing and Textile Workers and the International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers.
"Organized labor in Arkansas is solidly behind Bill Clinton," those leaders declared in a recent statement released by Tommy McFalls, a paperworkers official and vice president of the state A.F.L.-C.I.O.
"He has stood with us in our fight to raise wages, protect jobs, enhance worker safety and expand opportunity for all people," the statement says. "Brothers fight. But when push comes to shove, Bill Clinton has always been in our corner."
 
A Major Detractor
 But the leading labor figure in the state, J. Bill Becker, president of the Arkansas A.F.L.-C.I.O. for the past 28 years, adamantly disagrees.
"Bill Clinton is mainly the friend of big business," Mr. Becker said in an interview. "Labor has backed him some in the past, true, but only because he's been the lesser of two evils in a right-to-work state in the Deep South."
While Mr. Clinton has been Governor, Mr. Becker argued, Arkansas has remained at the bottom in most statistical measures of economic progress and quality of life. He contended that Mr. Clinton has boasted about the state's right-to-work law and its bottom-ranked wages in an effort to lure business to the state, has ignored safety concerns and has done little to push for better benefits for working people.
"Every time he's claimed to be our friend, we've ended up with a knife in the back," Mr. Becker said.
 
Sued by U.A.W.
 Recently, Mr. Becker sent a lengthy confidential memorandum to the A.F.L.-C.I.O. headquarters in Washington in which he discussed Mr. Clinton's labor record.
"I concluded that, at best, the Governor had sided with labor on only one of every four issues," Mr. Becker said in the interview.
One major union in Arkansas, the United Auto Workers, has taken the Governor into court, charging in a pending suit that he and officials of the Arkansas Industrial Development Commission interfered with the collective bargaining process by guaranteeing a $300,000 loan for a plastics manufacturer that was facing tough labor negotiations. The negotiations ended in a strike.
Mr. Clinton and the other state officials have countered that the loan was not an anti-strike fund but was meant to help the company expand and regain its financial footing, saving jobs.
 
Right-to-Work Supporter
 U.A.W. officials in Arkansas declined to comment on the dispute, saying it is up to the courts to resolve. Nor will they say whether they have been in contact with auto workers officials in Illinois and Michigan, states where U.A.W. votes will be pivotal Tuesday.
The Governor's labor record is increasingly becoming an issue in the Michigan and Illinois primaries. Former Senator Paul E. Tsongas of Massachusetts tells his audiences that Mr. Clinton has tried to lure industry to Arkansas by boasting that it is a right-to-work state with the fifth lowest wages in the nation.
Mr. Clinton says he has helped Arkansas become one of the leaders in attracting and creating jobs, but he denies using the pitch described by Mr. Tsongas.
In fact, over the years some of the literature and advertisements produced by the state's industrial development commission have pointed out that the state has a right-to-work law and "competitive" wages that are among the lowest in the country.
Former Governor Edmund G. Brown of California contends -- and Mr. Clinton denies -- that the Governor presides over a state with one of the country's worst records of worker safety and one of the worst working climates.
One study, produced by the National Safe Workplace Institute, a non-profit study group based in Chicago, ranks Arkansas 50th in accident prevention, enforcement of safety regulations and worker's compensation.
Another not-for-profit study group, the Southern Regional Council of Atlanta, ranks Arkansas 49th in overall working climate, 48th in earnings, 47th in workplace conditions, 45th in quality of life and 35th in worker protection.
The other day while campaigning in Chicago, Mr. Clinton said he was "pro-worker, not anti-union."
"Most people in the work force work in non-union jobs," he added. "So I have to address union and non-union."

HEADLINE: THE 1992 CAMPAIGN: Political Memo;
Tsongas Being Haunted By Memory of Dukakis

BYLINE: By RICHARD L. BERKE, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: CHICAGO, March 14

 BODY:
Standing between Paul E. Tsongas and the White House is not just Gov. Bill Clinton or President Bush, but the ghost of Michael S. Dukakis.
Mr. Tsongas jokes about the inevitable comparisons to the other Greek-American Presidential candidate from Massachusetts, the one who infuriated many Democrats four years ago for letting the White House slip beyond his reach. But memories of Mr. Dukakis haunt Mr. Tsongas and his campaign. 
 Many Greek-Americans who put their hearts, and donations, into the Dukakis campaign stayed clear of Mr. Tsongas this year out of fear of getting burned again. Other voters wrote off Mr. Tsongas as an uninspired, plodding campaigner in the Dukakis mold who would not respond swiftly to opponents' attacks. Underlying these anxieties was a conventional wisdom that nominating another Greek-American from Massachusetts was the recipe for electoral disaster.
"All of 1991, that was question No. 1," said Mr. Tsongas, a former Senator. " 'Do you think the country's ready for another Greek from Massachusetts?' I just didn't see any worth in spending my time articulating why I'm different from Michael or somebody else."
Although Mr. Tsongas takes comfort in the fact that no one has asked him the "Greek from Massachusetts" question in a month, he has nonetheless set out to distinguish himself from the former Massachusetts Governor. Declaring, "I'm a Greek from Massachusetts who fights back," Mr. Tsongas now readily attacks the Arkansas Governor, his chief rival, in commercials and speeches.
In truth, Paul Tsongas and Michael Dukakis are both strikingly similar and strikingly different.
While they are both unabashedly liberal on social issues, Mr. Tsongas is far more conservative on economic matters. He bills himself as a pro-business candidate, while Mr. Dukakis was constantly at war with the business community in his state.
Both are sure of themselves often to the point of stubbornness, but Mr. Tsongas leavens that with a self-deprecating wit. Though he was usually deadly serious, Mr. Dukakis was a crisper speaker than Mr. Tsongas, who at times leaves audiences straining to make out what he is trying to say.
 
A 'Different Style'
 While Mr. Dukakis acknowledged that Mr. Tsongas has a "different style," he refused to concede that his 1988 campaign lacked humor. "I used self-deprecating humor from time to time," the former Governor insisted. He was very serious on that point.
Mr. Tsongas is more relaxed about running for President. When he is not curled up asleep on his chartered jet, he commandeers the loudspeaker to address the passengers as "Captain Tsongas." After the crew maneuvered through turbulent weather the other day, the candidate's Boston accent boomed from the speaker as he urged people to buckle up. "If you don't comply," he quipped, "we'll drop you off the plane. Probably over Atlantic City."
Mr. Tsongas's jokes may be flat, but Mr. Dukakis gave the phrase "stiff candidate" new meaning. On his campaign plane, he preferred sitting erect in his seat, balancing his family's check book or scrutinizing position papers. While Mr. Tsongas plunges into crowds in search of a baby he can hoist up, Mr. Dukakis and babies were a bad match; sometimes he would awkwardly hold one almost at arm's length.
"Tsongas has a better sense of the theater involved in running for President," said Andy Paven, a traveling aide to Mr. Tsongas who also worked for Mr. Dukakis in 1988. "I could never picture Michael getting photographed in a Speedo."
Of course there was the 1988 episode that will go down as one of the most embarrassing photo opportunities ever, when Mr. Dukakis donned a helmet and rode around in a tank.
It is a mistake Mr. Tsongas will not repeat. "Riding around in a tank has no relevance to my message," he said.
Perhaps from his brush with death as a cancer patient, Mr. Tsongas speaks more passionately about religious and spiritual issues than did Mr. Dukakis, who rarely strayed far from his mantra of "good jobs at good wages." Mr. Tsongas was near tears last week when he told reporters of a Palm Beach County deputy sheriff who was struck by a car and killed while clearing traffic for the campaign motorcade.
Even more than their Greek ancestry, both Mr. Tsongas and Mr. Dukakis are products of a white suburban reform culture in Massachusetts politics, which may account for similarities in how they approach running for President.
 
Met More Than 20 Years Ago
 They met more than 20 years ago, when Mr. Tsongas was on the Lowell, Mass., City Council and Mr. Dukakis was a State Representative. Both worked to revitalize Lowell.
Mr. Tsongas and Mr. Dukakis also operated in a heavily Democratic state where they had little experience battling Republicans and forging biracial coalitions to get elected. They each seem to have something of a moral righteousness, some say arrogance, in believing strongly that their answers were the best.
That got Mr. Dukakis in trouble. He did not believe that people would be swayed by the Bush campaign's pounding his record to portray him as a dangerous liberal.
Though he said that people forget that "we had a little bit of tough stuff" against Representative Richard A. Gephardt of Missouri in the heat of the 1988 primaries, Mr. Dukakis said he did not mind Mr. Tsongas alluding to him as a Greek who did not fight back, .
"Look," he said, "it's part of the business. I don't have a problem with that stuff."
Even as he attacks Mr. Clinton, Mr. Tsongas seems uncomfortable about it, often finding himself knocked off stride by volleys from Mr. Clinton. In an article last week in The Boston Globe, Martin F. Nolan, a columnist, noted that after Mr. Tsongas won the New Hampshire and Maryland primaries, he did not boast about it on news programs, thereby allowing Mr. Clinton to get the attention.
"That sort of decision," Mr. Nolan wrote, "where counterchic and anti-charisma intersect with hubris, makes Tsongas seem most Dukakis-like."
Will the anti-charisma candidate from 1988 help the anti-charisma candidate for 1992? Though Mr. Tsongas helped raise money for the Dukakis campaign, the former Governor knows that returning the favor could do more harm than good.
Praising both Mr. Tsongas and Mr. Clinton, the man who was on his way to the Democratic nomination four years ago said in his matter-of-fact manner: "I don't see any great value in endorsing. I like both of them."

HEADLINE: THE 1992 CAMPAIGN: Primaries;
Clinton's Rivals Seek Midwest Toehold

BYLINE: By ROBIN TONER, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: DETROIT, March 14

 BODY:
The Democratic Presidential campaign focused on the critical primaries of the industrial Midwest this weekend, with Gov. Bill Clinton of Arkansas running strongly in Illinois but with former Senator Paul E. Tsongas of Massachusetts and former Gov. Edmund G. Brown Jr. of California trying to trip him up in the more uncertain political terrain of Michigan.
The stakes on Tuesday are high. If Mr. Clinton wins both states, after his sweep of the South on Super Tuesday, many Democrats say he will be hard to stop in his drive for the nomination. 
 Mr. Tsongas badly needs a strong showing to steady his campaign and demonstrate that his message of economic sacrifice can play in a part of the country that is expected to be a battleground this fall. Mr. Brown, meanwhile, is trying to fill the void left by Senator Tom Harkin of Iowa as the outspoken defender of labor, and thus maintain his toehold in the race.
The oratory and the television advertising have turned very harsh, although the underlying debate remains what it has been throughout this campaign: Who can best ease the nation's economic woes? The Tsongas campaign is running television commercials that assail Mr. Clinton as an over-promising politician laden with special interests. "You've got a choice," the announcer declares, "Clinton's promises, or Tsongas's commitment to jobs and economic growth."
 
Brown Plays Trade Theme
 The Clinton campaign continues to portray Mr. Tsongas as just another disciple of "trickle-down" economics, who can find a place in his economic policy for a cut in the tax on capital gains but offers little for the middle class. And Mr. Brown is playing the trade issue, considered potent in this region, by attacking both Mr. Tsongas and Mr. Clinton for supporting "fast-track" authority for President Bush to negotiate a free-trade agreement with Mexico.
Mr. Brown is considered a wild card here, where he has been campaigning hard among auto workers, whose union is suddenly at loose ends after Mr. Harkin's departure. Mr. Brown spent today with members of the United Automobile Workers union in Dearborn and Flint, again arguing that a free-trade agreement with Mexico would cost American jobs.
On the Republican side, Patrick J. Buchanan continued to campaign through Michigan and Illinois today, well aware that the relevancy of his campaign could depend on his showing there. He implored people to vote for him to "keep this debate going over the future of the Republican Party."
President Bush, who campaigned in Michigan on Friday, was back at Camp David for the weekend.
 
Clinton Favored in Illinois
 Mr. Clinton holds a substantial lead in a new poll in Illinois, and his aides have a hard time containing their optimism these days. He campaigned in a shopping mall in southeast Illinois today, telling people that a vote for him would "get your country back."
"I offer you something that is bigger than the fight between Democrats and Republicans," Mr. Clinton said.
He also defended himself against the suggestion that he was anti-union, saying, "I'll give you fair enforcement of the labor laws, not the biased enforcement you have on the Federal level now."
Mr. Clinton, whose coalition in the South was a hardy combination of black voters and middle-income whites, keeps honing his populist attack on Mr. Tsongas. In a debate Friday night in Chicago, Mr. Tsongas accused Mr. Clinton of wanting to give "candy" to people with proposals like a middle-class tax cut, but refusing to provide the leadership needed for economic recovery. Mr. Clinton countered, "He wants to continue to pound the middle class and lower middle class into the dirt."
Mr. Tsongas tried to make common cause with a group of unemployed people in Flint today, comparing the layoffs in that city to what happened to his hometown of Lowell, Mass., during the decline of the textile industry in the Northeast. Again and again, he told his audience that the way to create jobs was to reinvest in the nation's manufacturing base. "Let me tell you, there are no magic bullets," he said.
The former Senator was asked in polite questioning about his refusal to endorse legislation that outlaws the hiring of permanent replacement workers for strikers. "I understand that my position on striker replacement hurts me, but it's better policy," he said at a news conference. "We're going to give the American people a choice. We're going to tell them the hard truth and make the hard choices. My responsibility is to grow this economy."
A poll published in Sunday's Chicago Sun-Times showed Mr. Clinton leading Mr. Tsongas, 48 percent to 21 percent, among Democrats in Illinois, with Mr. Brown at 7 percent. The survey, conducted March 11-12, had a margin of sampling error of plus or minus five percentage points. David Wilhelm, the campaign manager for Mr. Clinton, said he found the poll "hard to believe," but added, "I think we've had a good week."
Dennis Kanin, Mr. Tsongas's campaign manager, said today: "I think we've got to spend the next couple of days getting the message out and trying to close the gap as much as we can. I don't think the people in Illinois or Michigan know much about any of these candidates, and unfortunately for us, Clinton got a big bump from his Super Tuesday win."
Mr. Tsongas also played down the polls. "Obviously, the polls that you are seeing reflect the bump for Super Tuesday and the early ads that were used against us," he said today. "The polls set a baseline -- let's see what happens on Tuesday."
The situation in Michigan is considered far murkier than in Illinois. No one is sure how strong Mr. Brown's bid for union support will turn out to be. And whereas Mr. Brown often drew from Mr. Tsongas's support in other states, his bid for middle-income people could draw from Mr. Clinton here.

HEADLINE: THE 1992 CAMPAIGN: Issues;
The New, Volatile Politics of Welfare

BYLINE: By KEVIN SACK

 BODY:
Sixteen years after Ronald Reagan transformed the "welfare queen" into a weapon of class warfare in his first try at the Presidency, candidates of both parties have been emboldened by the recession to make welfare a seminal political issue.
Because of its delicate relationship to issues of class and race, welfare has long been a ticklish subject for political discourse. But elected officials and political strategists agree that any reluctance to exploit welfare as an issue has dissolved in the last year as politicians have searched for ways to tap the electorate's economic discontent. 
 The new politics of welfare has been on display in forums from the Southern Presidential primaries to the mayoral race in San Diego.
President Bush's advertisements pledge that he will "change welfare and make the able-bodied work." Commercials for Gov. Bill Clinton of Arkansas, the Democratic Presidential front-runner, have him "insisting that those on welfare move into the workplace."
 
'Welfare Scapegoating'
 In the San Diego race, a poll taker for County Supervisor Susan Golding, a Republican, advised her in a memorandum late last year to "create a storm of publicity" by proposing deep welfare cuts, even though he acknowledged that the cuts might be illegal.
Such political tactics have generated a counterassault, led largely by Gov. Mario M. Cuomo of New York, on what he calls "welfare scapegoating." Mr. Cuomo has criticized politicians of both parties for blaming the nation's economic problems on welfare spending and, by implication, on the poor.
"The poor people don't have any power," Mr. Cuomo said in a recent speech. "That's why welfare's such a terrific issue. Who's going to march against you, a 15-year-old girl with a baby? She doesn't even get to the polls."
In a year when there seem to be few differences between candidates, some political scientists believe that welfare could become the issue that most distinguishes Democrats from Republicans. In the Presidential race, the distinction has been reinforced by the White House's eagerness to rush to the right in trying to defuse Patrick J. Buchanan's campaign.
"The largest difference between the parties is not over economic policy but rather the view that one takes about poor people," said Lawrence M. Mead, a New York University professor whose book "The New Politics of Poverty" is to be published by Basic Books in April. "Are they victims entitled to protection, or people who could be self-reliant but are exploiting society?"
 
The Race Question
 In some cases, the political message on welfare has been communicated subliminally, seemingly aimed at evoking common stereotypes. Republicans call New York "the Cadillac of welfare states." President Bush, in his State of the Union Message, said welfare was never intended to become "a narcotic" or "a habit."
Their critics say part of the subliminal message is race. Forty percent of the families in the main Federal welfare program, Aid to Families With Dependent Children, are black; 38 percent are white, and 16 percent are of Hispanic descent.
But in what may be a legacy of David Duke's campaign for Governor of Louisiana last year, politicians have become much bolder in moving from subliminal messages to overt ones.
In Massachusetts last fall, State Senator Michael C. Creedon, a Democrat, said of the state's welfare program for able-bodied adults: "General Reliefgoes to people who are urinating on the floor in the bus station in Brockton and throwing up. They take that $338 and go to the nearest bar and spend it." He was not concerned how his comments would be received, he said, because welfare recipients do not vote.
Many politicians who have seized on the welfare issue have argued that economic recovery depends on righting what Gov. Pete Wilson of California, a Republican, has called the "imbalance between taxpayers and tax receivers." In the process, the concerns of middle-class people, who vote in large numbers, have inevitably been pitted against those of the poor, who do not.
In New York, for instance, two Republican state senators recently sent mailings to constituents saying that the welfare system was racked with abuse and threatened school financing and property tax stability.
One of the two, Dean G. Skelos of Nassau County, wrote that Democrats "want to leave welfare cheats and Medicaid thieves alone, at your expense, contributing to higher property taxes and a declining educational system."
The other, Joseph R. Holland of Rockland County, chairman of the Senate Social Services Committee, made the same case in a fund-raising appeal in January. "Every day you go to work," he wrote, "a portion of your hard-earned paycheck is taken away from you to pay for the most inefficient, fraudulent and bureaucratic welfare system in the country."
Such charges are the stuff of campaigns all over the nation, and it is often hard to assess their merits. In New York, the State Department of Social Services estimates fraud to be relatively small, amounting to perhaps $100 million of the nearly $17 billion spent on welfare and Medicaid last year. But the state's special prosecutor for Medicaid fraud control, Edward J. Kuriansky, called that estimate "Pollyannaish" and said the figure for Medicaid fraud alone could be several billion dollars.
Public opinion polls consistently show that Americans support assistance for the truly needy. But they are increasingly disdainful of welfare recipients who do not try hard to find work or go to school and who bear children without means of support.
On the surface, the polls suggest that the welfare issue would play better for Republicans than for Democrats. But political strategists from both parties say it presents opportunities for moderate Democrats and poses potential risks for President Bush.
John E. McLaughlin, a Republican consultant in Alexandria, Va., said the welfare issue provided a chance for a Democrat like Mr. Clinton to show independence by breaking with his party's traditional stance. Mr. Clinton has proposed a two-year limit on public assistance for able-bodied adults.
And Mr. McLaughlin said Mr. Bush's focus on welfare could backfire. "The Democrats are making the race a class battle," he said, "and if the President cuts welfare and is unwilling to decrease taxes for the middle class, it sends a very bad signal."
The political exploitation of the welfare issue has emerged as efforts to change the welfare system have gained popularity in the states with remarkable speed.
As the recession has strangled state budgets, many states have cut grant levels sharply and eliminated welfare programs for the able-bodied. Some also have either enacted or proposed measures to use the welfare grant as an incentive for finding work and regulating family size.
Critics say such plans are based on myths about welfare. They say there is little scientific evidence to show that lower grants will prompt recipients to find jobs, especially during a recession. They point to Federal statistics showing that the average number of children in welfare families has decreased from 3.0 in 1969 to 1.9 in 1989.
And they stress that the Aid to Families With Dependent Children program, whose costs are shared by the Federal and state governments, accounts for only 3.4 percent of state budgets.
What has really broken state budgets, in New York and elsewhere, is Medicaid. While state payments for cash assistance to welfare families grew by 15 percent from 1989 to 1991, Medicaid payments grew by 36 percent.
But much of the growth in Medicaid has been driven by the increasing cost of long-term care for the elderly. And because many elderly Medicaid recipients are from the middle class, the Medicaid program has been sparedpolitical attacks. Many welfare experts say their greatest fear is that elected officials, in their rush to score political points, will enact welfare changes that do far more harm than good.
That was the concern of Sabra Burdick when she resigned on Feb. 4 as Maine's director of income maintenance after Gov. John R. McKernan Jr., a Republican, proposed to deny benefits to welfare mothers who gave birth to more children.
Ms. Burdick, who was appointed by the Governor, said she had argued against the proposal by citing studies showing that the size of welfare families in Maine had decreased significantly in the last 20 years. But she said Mr. McKernan seemed determined to make "a philosophical statement."
"I'm afraid it does sell, but I don't quite understand why," she said. "My bottom-line issue, of course, is it's the kids who are going to be hurt."

HEADLINE: U.S. Sees Increasing Need for a Strike on Iraq

BYLINE: By MICHAEL WINES, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, March 14

 BODY:
A year after the end of the Persian Gulf war, senior United States officials are expressing a rising feeling that military force must be used soon to eradicate Iraq's remaining capacity to make weapons of mass destruction.
In interviews this week, the officials emphasized that military action would be taken only with United Nations approval and would not be aimed at reopening the gulf war or deposing the Iraqi President, Saddam Hussein. The Central Intelligence Agency is already mounting an undercover effort to separate Mr. Hussein from his power base in the military and the Baath Party, and speed his downfall. 
 Some flagging hopes remain that he will accede to diplomatic pressure and voluntarily dismantle Iraq's remaining Scud missiles and factories for making nuclear bomb parts and other arms, including chemical and biological weapons. Those actions were required by the United Nations cease-fire resolution that formally ended the war in March 1991.
 
The Endgame Begins
 But the officials made it clear that they believe that an endgame has begun in which Iraq will either bend quickly to that and other United Nations mandates or suffer the consequences. The Administration is confident, they said, that world opinion and United Nations voting will support the use of force if it becomes necessary.
This week's defiant visit to the United Nations by Iraq's Deputy Prime Minister, Tariq Aziz, has in a sense started the clock ticking, they said.
"Tariq Aziz has had his day in court, and he did not persuade," one official said on Friday. "So we'll send some more inspectors over there" to press for demolition of weapons complexes. "If Iraq's behavior still falls short, we'll have to make a decision."
Asked if the United States would wait a year or even six months to push for military action, the official said, "I don't think this will be strung out indefinitely."
A second Bush Administration official said that the United States and Iraq were locked in a duel of wits, in which Baghdad tests Washington's patience to its outer limits, then retreats when a confrontation seems likely.
The United States, that official said, "is philosophically inclined" to strike at Baghdad at the first opportunity at which the Administration feels it will have world backing. "But they know how to play the chess game too," the official said, and such an opportunity has yet to arise.
 
Four Formal Warnings
 Since the gulf war ended in late February last year, the United Nations has formally warned Iraq four times that it is violating the terms of the cease-fire, in which Baghdad pledged unconditional cooperation with efforts to catalogue and destroy its programs for nuclear, biological, chemical and missile warfare. The most recent warning came on Friday.
In his visit this week, Mr. Aziz promised limited cooperation with United Nations cease-fire resolutions and on other issues, including a longstanding and central demand that Baghdad fully disclose the scope of its nuclear, chemical and biological arms programs.
But Mr. Aziz also resisted plans for continued monitoring of Iraq's military industries, ruling out future inspections that might serve "either political or intelligence purposes."
Most important, he sidestepped demands that Iraq destroy missile manufacturing equipment and, most important, that it dismantle a nuclear weapons research complex at Al Atheer, south of Baghdad.
Iraq insists that Al Atheer and other military complexes can be converted to civilian uses, a premise the United States and others reject. While some United Nations envoys said they saw hints of flexibility in Mr. Aziz's statements, the American representative, Thomas R. Pickering, denounced his remarks as a deception.
 
Hints of Resistance
 Working with United Nations support, the International Atomic Energy Agency has agreed to send a team of inspectors to Al Atheer next month to inspect the nuclear complex and to plan its destruction. Iraq has dropped broad hints in recent weeks that it will resist such intrusive actions, suggesting that the safety of inspectors cannot be guaranteed.
Should Iraq continue to defy the cease-fire resolution, American and United Nations options are effectively limited to two choices: further warnings or force.
Trade sanctions imposed against Iraq shortly after its invasion of Kuwait 19 months ago remain in force. They have proven remarkably resilient, Administration officials asserted this week. One official said Friday that United States analysts had detected little change over the last year in the effectiveness of the trade embargo, which has grounded Baghdad's commercial air fleet, shut off its oil exports, severely limited imports of essential goods and depleted Iraq's reserves of foreign exchange.
The United States moved this week to close the largest remaining leak in the embargo by winning a commitment from Jordan's ruler, King Hussein, to try to reduce the flood of smuggling across his border into Iraq.
The Administration has been debating the need for undercover attempts to remove Mr. Hussein and military action against Iraqi weapons sites since at least last fall. But a number of outside experts argue that military force is, for now, unwarranted.
"There's no reason for us to do anything," said James E. Akins, a former American diplomat in Iraq. "Sanctions are certainly hurting Iraq, and ultimately, they're going to bring about the downfall of the Government." He added, "If we were to attack again, it's very likely that we wouldn't bring down Saddam, and equally likely that we'd only strengthen him" by rallying anti-Western sentiment to his side.
Mr. Akins and others also said that an American-led military strike against Iraqi weapons sites this summer or fall appeared increasingly unlikely because of the domestic political debate it would stir. In a presidential election year, Mr. Akins said, a military strike could be seen as a crass attempt to garner votes for an economically beleaguered Administration.
United States officials insisted this week that politics would play no role in any American decision to advocate force.

HEADLINE: Haitians Return to Deepening Misery

BYLINE: By HOWARD W. FRENCH, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: PORT-AU-PRINCE, Haiti, March 13

 BODY:
When the Coast Guard cutter Dependable berthed here this morning amid a collection of rusty freighters and listing wrecks, the marines aboard joined local photographers in crowding the gangway to snap pictures of the thin and threadbare Haitians who are expected to be among the last of the thousands forcibly returned to their country.
But if a strong sense of relief was felt by many of the Americans involved, from the coastguardsmen who have busily plucked Haitians from dangerous seas to the diplomats who have wrangled constantly with a Government the United States does not recognize, for most of those snared in the five-month operation, the future has become neither clearer nor brighter. 
 The charged debate in the United States over the Haitians' treatment has mainly focused on the risk of politically inspired violence that the returnees might face in the wake of a military coup that overthrew the country's first elected President on Sept. 30. But for most of the returnees, the most immediate concern remains what most now admit forced them to flee in the first place: poverty and hunger in a country whose modern economy, by many measures, has almost ceased to exist.
As the returnees filed off the ship and into the hands of the Haitian Red Cross and immigration officials, little hint remained of the stories many had told to the authorities at the United States refugee camp at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba. Often vague claims of political fears that many said justified their flight were displaced by vivid tales of hardship illustrated by their thin frames and gaunt, worried features.
 
Even More Miserable Now
 Almost to a person, each of these refugees complained that, unable to scratch out a living, they had been compelled by misery to leave their country. What they could not know, especially those who had been cut off for weeks from news of their country while they waited at the Guantanamo tent city for news of whether they would be admitted to the United States, was that the Haiti they were returning to, already the hemisphere's poorest country, had become a starkly more miserable place in their absence.
"We have two children, and we can't even send them to school," said Altes Paul, an unemployed 25-year-old who fled a month ago. "As long as there is no work, I can't tell you I won't leave again. We have a right to survive."
Some spoke with fear of repression, but most looked grimly toward a future that they said held little hope for them.
"Everyone you see here left because they had no money, nothing," said Pierre-Louis Jean-Francois, a 43-year-old from the drought-stricken north of the country, speaking in Creole as he crouched on the concrete amid a small pile of belongings. "Now we are back to nothing. When the Americans see us like this, don't they have any pity?"
 
Farmers Eating Seeds
 Back in his home region, which is denuded of trees and suffering an intense drought, the few hospitals and health clinics are now filling with severely malnourished children. International development experts say that to ward off starvation, many farmers have resorted to eating the seeds that would have produced the next crops.
United States immigration officials, and even some refugee advocates, now say it is becoming increasingly clear that only a fraction of the more than 15,000 Haitians who have been picked up at sea since the overthrow of President Jean-Bertrand Aristide had political motives for trying to reach the United States.
But Mr. Jean-Francois's plaintive question continues to reverberate troublingly, many say. Advocates for the refugees and Haitians themselves still bitterly ask how the United States can justify sending thousands of people back to a country where violence, much of it politically inspired, remains endemic, and the already stinging poverty has been worsened by an international embargo.
"Represssion is really severe in the countryside," said Guy Bauduy, a conservative Senator who has been a strong backer of the provisional Government that replaced Father Aristide. "Part of it is politically motivated, but most of it involves people taking advantage of the situation for a settling of accounts."
 
General Climate of Violence
 Stung by the alarming stories of violence and repression told by people who fled Haiti twice in the recent refugee crisis, United States officials say they have monitored more than 300 returnees in the capital and the countryside and "have found no evidence to substantiate and much that contradicts" allegations of politically motivated attacks, though they acknowledge a general climate of violence.
Arthur C. Helton, director of the Refugee Project of the Lawyers Committee for Human Rights, condemned the recent decision by the Justice Department to keep more than 200 Haitians who have met the standards required to seek asylum but who have tested positive for HIV, the virus that causes AIDS. They have been in effect quarantined at Guantanamo Bay, without legal representation, until their refugee applications have been adjudicated. Those who are rejected, officials say, will be returned to Haiti.
Immigration officials say that even those who pass the test for asylum will have to seek individual waivers from the Attorney General's office to lift strict restrictions on the entry of people "who have a communicable disease of public health significance."
 
'AIDS Is Not a Bar'
 Mr. Helton said, "Testing positive for AIDS is not a bar to refugee status, and these people should not be returned."
For the seemingly fortunate ones who have been cleared to pursue asylum claims, there is also the uncertainty of not knowing whether their applications will be quietly rejected once public attention to Haiti dies down.
Of the wave of more than 15,000 boat people who have passed through Guantanamo in recent months, 6,197 have been "screened in," which means cleared to pursue asylum claims in the United States. In the previous decade, 28 out of 23,000 Haitians picked up at sea were allowed to enter the country legally to seek asylum.
Despite the higher numbers, some refugee advocates worry that few of those allowed to enter the United States will be allowed to stay.

HEADLINE: Koreas Reach A-Pact; Effect Is in Doubt

BYLINE: By DAVID E. SANGER, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: TOKYO, March 14

 BODY:
North and South Korea today agreed to inspect suspected nuclear weapons sites on each other's soil by mid-June, but the accord appeared to fall far short of the kind of specific assurances that Washington and Seoul have sought in trying to stem the North's nuclear ambitions.
The agreement seems likely to intensify the argument over whether continuing talks between North and South are really making progress, or are being strung along by Pyongyang's Communist Government as an elaborate delaying tactic. 
 In recent weeks, several Administration officials, including Robert M. Gates, the Director of Central Intelligence, have said they believe that North Korea is racing to produce weapons-grade plutonium that could be hidden whenever inspectors finally enter the country.
Mr. Gates has said that Pyongyang could develop a nuclear weapon in months, but others, including experts at the Pentagon and the State Department, say a more realistic estimate is a year or two.
Today was the second time in a month that North Korea indicated that, in principle, it was willing to admit international inspectors.
 
International Inspection
 In a separate series of talks with the International Atomic Energy Agency in Vienna, the Government of President Kim Il Sung has indicated that it would finally approve an inspection regimen required under the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty, which it signed six years ago. Formal ratification by North Korea's Parliament is expected next month. It would likely be months before the first inspectors arrived.
The negotiations between North and South involve a separate set of inspections: visits across the heavily guarded Demilitarized Zone to affirm that the Korean peninsula is nuclear-free.
The United States, which kept nuclear weapons in South Korea for decades, is believed to have removed the last of them several months ago. Washington has said that under proper conditions, North Koreans would be permitted access to American bases in the South to confirm that no nuclear weapons exist.
But until now, Seoul insisted that Pyongyang must agree to a precise timetable for inspections. The first trial inspection, South Korean officials said as recently as last week, should take place next month.
Those conditions were abandoned in today's talks over the creation of a Joint Nuclear Control Commission composed of military experts from North and South. Establishment of the commission is the most important of a critical series of confidence-building measures that Seoul and Pyongyang agreed to when they reached a broad Agreement on Reconciliation and Nonaggression in December. That accord called for the commission to be set up by March 19.
Today's agreement specifies that the commission be established by the end of next week. Over the next two months, it says, the commission's members will make joint efforts to develop a specific inspection plan. In a statement today, the South Korean Government said it now hoped to carry out the first inspection by early June.
 
Some Loopholes
 "Our aim is to begin the mutual inspection within the first half of this year," Lim Dong Won, the chief South Korean negotiator, was quoted as saying by the semi-official Yonhap news agency.
But the agreement does not appear to hold the North to a strict schedule and it does not make specific mention of North Korean sites like Yongbyon, a secret complex where President Kim's Government is believed to be building a reprocessing plant to produce weapons-grade plutonium.
South Korea, Japan and the United States have made it clear that until full inspections are forthcoming, Pyongyang will remain cut off from economic aid and much-needed business alliances. But the United States has generally taken a harder line than Seoul has over how specific the timetables and locations should be. South Korean officials have said in recent months that their strategy is to keep the two sides talking.

HEADLINE: Senate's Tax Bill Wraps Up a Bouquet of Trial Balloons

BYLINE: By ADAM CLYMER, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, March 14

 BODY:
The tax bill the Senate passed Friday night is not just a $300 credit for children, a 36 percent rate for the affluent or a new set of rates for capital gains taxes. Nor is it merely legislation intended to make health insurance much more widely available, especially to workers in small businesses.
Those items, and a few more that deal with growth, make up a Democratic statement of what ought to be done to make American society fairer. And it will remain such a statement, an argument for voters, even after President Bush makes good on his promise to veto whatever emerges from a House-Senate conference on this bill and the companion House measure. 
 No one in either chamber thinks a veto can be overridden, so this bill will not become law.
 
 
Laden With Special Provisions
 But there is much more in the bill. Its 1,421 pages (before amendments) were laden with provisions that affect much narrower interests of special concern to one or more Senators. Only a few of these provisions offered much of an electoral statement.
Some, like a proposal by Senator John D. Rockefeller 4th, Democrat of West Virginia, to replenish the United Mine Workers Health Fund, have an obvious local appeal.
And some others were timed to get a little election-year attention. Senator Arlen Specter, Republican of Pennsylvania, got a provision adopted to allow penalty-free withdrawals from Individual Retirement Accounts for purchases of new cars.
 
 
Student Loan Proposal
 But most of the smaller provisions would have minimal political impact, even if Mr. Bush were willing to sign the bill into law.
A new student loan program, for example, intended to overcome the repayment problems of existing programs, might be an important change in national policy. But it would hardly be a great vote-getter for Senator Bill Bradley, Democrat of New Jersey, its sponsor on the Senate Finance Committee.
Senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan, Democrat of New York, won acceptance of a measure broadening the tax-deductibility of charitable contributions of items like stock. While museums and universities may consider this a wise development in tax policy, they cannot profit from a bill that will not become law.
 
 
A Foot in the Door
 The reason for these seemingly fruitless efforts is to pave the way for future action. Mr. Moynihan calls the practice a "footnote." If a provision has been passed once, even if fails to be enacted, it seems less controversial the next time around. So when another tax bill comes along, as one surely will, the measures that one house -- or, better yet, both houses -- previously agreed on are more likely to be agreed on again.
There is likely to be another tax bill this year. It almost certainly will have neither the middle-class tax cuts and upper-bracket increases that the Democrats want, nor the large reduction in the capital gains tax that Mr. Bush seeks.
But most senators expect to see another set of extensions for a few relatively inexpensive credits, like those fostering research and experimentation and low-income housing. And they think it likely that some relief from the "passive loss" rules for the real estate industry, and elimination of some of the luxury taxes on planes, yachts, furs and jewelry will be included.
And there might be room for a few of the seemingly obscure sections that may get to the President's desk as part of a bill he will veto.
 
 
A Rare Critic
 Senator Warren B. Rudman, Republican of New Hampshire, called it a process of "legitimizing" pet provisions. He said senators feel "if you get it in once, you can get it in again."
He is a rare critic of the practice, complaining that the Senate bill included not only the provisions that stimulated real political debate, but also a series of special-interest proposals -- from tax relief for oil and natural gas drillers to "a new credit for restaurant owners, a provision to allow universities to issue more tax-exempt bonds, and provisions for fishing fleets, the Federal Express pilots' pension planand the securities industry."
Many of those proposals might have merit, he said. But he asked what they had to do with either economic growth or tax fairness, and suggested that if they were worth doing, perhaps they were worth doing more openly, with hearings and debate.


GRAPHIC: Revenue estimates are for cost or gain over five years, calculated by the Joint Congressional Committee on Taxation.
 
TAX CUTS FOR INDIVIDUALS
 
SENATE: Create a permanent $300 tax credit for children under 16, available to families with Adjusted Gross Incomes under $47,500, and phase the credit out for families with A.G.I.'s between $47,500 and $60,000. After $60,000, the credit would not apply. Cost: $28.0 billion
 
HOUSE: Two-year tax credit for one-fifth of Social Security and Medicare taxes paid by workers, up to $200 a year for individuals and $400 for couples. Unlike the Senate measure the credit in the House bill would be paid even if it exceeded Federal taxes owed.
 
BUSH: Increase the personal exemption for children under 18 to $2,800 from $2,300.
 
SENATE: Simplify and expand the earned income tax credit for families with two or more children but repeal a supplemental credit for children under one year old. Cost: $1.0 billion.

Whatever Happened To Sports?

BYLINE: By DAVE ANDERSON

 BODY:
ONCE upon a time sports itself was everything. Who won? Who lost? Who hit the big home run? Who fumbled at the goal line? Who made the crucial free throw? Who missed the short putt? Which boxer deserved the decision?
But more than ever before, the erosion of sports is threatening its quality of life as entertainment and enjoyment. 
 Yesterday, the names of three Mets -- Dwight Gooden, Vince Coleman and Darryl Boston -- surfaced in the Port St. Lucie, Fla., Police Department's investigation of a March 3 rape complaint by a New York woman who contended that the incident occurred in Gooden's rented home there nearly a year ago.
Gooden, Coleman and Boston declined comment. But the investigation continues. So does the erosion. What's on the police blotter is more important than what's in the box score.
Spring training was always the best time in baseball, a time of hope when every team was in first place. Not this year.
Only a week ago, Pascual Perez, sitting in his limousine, insisted that his failed Yankee drug test was all a mistake. Since then, the Yankees' exiled principal owner, George Steinbrenner, acknowledged having talked to Paramount executives about that conglomerate's desire to purchase the franchise whose previous president, Leonard Kleinman, has yet to drop litigation against Commissioner Fay Vincent.
But it's not just baseball.
In a Southeastern Conference basketball tournament game between Louisiana State and Tennessee Friday night, 10 players, including all-America center Shaquille O'Neal, were ejected for a bench-clearing brawl. Under N.C.A.A. rules, O'Neal was ineligible for L.S.U.'s semifinal loss to Kentucky yesterday.
And Olympic basketball suddenly has a dangerous dispute. Michael Jordan, Patrick Ewing and John Stockton are objecting to the use of their images by USA Basketball in Olympic merchandising. The three National Basketball Association stars, who each have Nike sneaker contracts, might withdraw from the Olympic team that will play in Barcelona, Spain, this summer.
Mike Tyson, the former heavyweight champion, is awaiting sentencing on March 26 in Indianapolis after having been convicted of rape.
Darryl Strawberry of the Dodgers put his byline on a book manuscript that he acknowledged he didn't read before it was published.
Jerry Tarkanian has or has not resigned as coach of the University of Nevada-Las Vegas basketball team that lost its litigation demanding consideration for the N.C.A.A. tournament.
In the National Hockey League, the April 8 start of the Stanley Cup playoffs has been jeopardized by a lack of progress in the labor negotiations between the players and the owners.
Even in golf, usually the most serene sport, PGA Tour commissioner Deane Beman is disputing an incendiary "Can Beman Survive?" cover story in Golf Digest magazine.
Almost every day a professional or college athlete is on a police blotter somewhere for something. Or a college is under investigation for violating N.C.A.A. rules.
Not that sports never had some erosion. Eight members of the 1919 Chicago Black Sox were banned for conspiring to dump that year's World Series. In college basketball, Madison Square Garden had to be fumigated from the stench of the 1951 point-shaving scams. Drugs and criminal cases have involved other famous athletes. Labor disputes have disrupted major league baseball and pro football seasons. Tennis players turned tournaments into kindergarten classes.
Much of today's erosion can be linked to the money that sports attracts. Relatively much more money than ever before.
Despite the recession in the national economy, sports salaries and television contracts keep spiraling upward, separating the identity gap between performer and spectator as never before. With all that money, more temptations are more affordable. More athletes are vulnerable. More struggles develop between the club owners and the athletes. More colleges need more good athletes (not always good student athletes) to supply more good teams to pay more mortgages on more stadiums and arenas.
Once upon a time sports itself was everything. But now it's money that seems to be everything. If money is the root of all evil, it's also the root of this erosion. And as long as that philosophy endures, the erosion has only begun.

Lynn Looks for a New Conquest

BYLINE: BY TIMOTHY W. SMITH

 BODY:
Two weeks ago Mike Lynn ended his 18-year relationship with the Minnesota Vikings by selling his 10 percent share in the team to a group headed by the team's president, Roger Headrick.
Two options now open to Lynn include purchasing a controlling interest in the New England Patroits or trying to land an expansion franchise for Memphis, an effort that he helped spearhead in the early 1960's. Lynn still owns a home in Memphis. 
 Although Lynn, speaking by telephone from his home in Minneapolis, would not talk specifically about his plans, he indicated that he did not see himself as a minority owner. That's why he sold his share to Headrick, after Headrick and six others bought out Irvin Jacobs and Carl Pohlad for a reported $52 million.
 
Seeking Control
 "I have no interest in having what ultimately amounted to a 10 percent interest in a team that I wasn't the principal managing partner or had no control of," Lynn said. "I'm much more interested in having a controlling interest in a team and maybe being involved with one partner."
N.F.L. officials are still trying to attract a buyer for the Patriots but face a formidable obstacle on two fronts. The team is heavily in debt and plays in Foxboro Stadium, which is 45 miles from Boston. The league wants to maintain a presence in Boston and is seeking an owner who won't move the franchise to another city. The solution might be a new stadium tied to a convention center in Boston. But convincing city, county and state government officials and private interests that a new stadium for the Patriots will be a boon to an economically depressed state will be tough.
Lynn said he was instrumental in guiding the effort for the Hubert H. Humphrey Metrodome in Minneapolis, which was completed in 1982.
"The opportunity to work with the public and private sector to find a way to build a new facility is one that not many people have had," Lynn said. "I did it in Minneapolis. The stadium here is a success story. It's not supported by taxpayers, and it has $25 million in its coffers."
 
'I Gave Up Too Much'
 Even though the Vikings made the playoffs 12 of the 17 years when Lynn was general manager, his legacy with Minnesota will be marked by the trade with Dallas for running back Herschel Walker in 1989. The Cowboys wound up with eight draft picks, including the Vikings' first- , second- and third-round picks in this year's draft.
"Did I give up too much?" Lynn said. "I gave up too much. In retrospect, maybe I gave up three more picks than I should have. But Herschel is a good back. He ran for over 800 yards last year, and he was only on the field for 60 percent of the time. Just think if he had been on the field 100 percent of the time. He might have run for 1,200 yards."
Though he was roundly criticized by Vikings fans for the Walker trade, Lynn does not look back on his time with Minnesota with any regret.
"When you run a team, you have three constituencies that you have to satisfy," Lynn said. "You have the public, which we gave some competitive and enjoyable games. You have the team, and all they ask is that you give them necessary tools to win. We had more players in the Pro Bowl than any other team during my time there, so I'd have to say we had the talent.
"And finally you have the shareholders, who ask if you're profitable. We were one of the most profitable teams in the N.F.L. We were the only team to make a profit during the 1982 strike."
 
W.L.A.F., Year 2
 When ABC and USA Network began to get nervous about low ratings for World League of American Football games last year, and when 26 of 28 National Football League owners, shareholders in the World League, began to fret over significant financial losses during the first season, most people thought the fledgling spring football league was dead.
But the World League is back for its second season, this time as part of the N.F.L's international division. The 10-game regular-season schedule of the 10 teams, six in North America and four in Europe, will begin next weekend.
A major feature of this spring's refurbished package was the promised infusion of N.F.L. players into the World League's talent pool. Each N.F.L. team was supposed to make four players available for the spring league's draft, in hopes of making the World League teams more competitive and more attractive to fans. But for the most part, the allotments have been uneven and the talent relinquished by the N.F.L. clubs has been marginal at best. None of the young N.F.L. stars like Raiders quarterback Todd Marinovich, Lions quarterback Andre Ware or receiver Herman Moore were offered to the World League.
Joe Bailey, the chief operating officer of the World League, wouldn't criticize the N.F.L. for sticking with the letter of the agreement while ignoring the spirit of it. After all, Bailey pointed out, the 100-odd players the N.F.L. provided this year is much better than the 5 it sent last year.
The Washington Redskins, winners of the Super Bowl, made one player available, while the Raiders sent nine players. Of the 110 players from the N.F.L., some culled from practice squads, 80 remain on active World League rosters after a three-week training camp that ended this past week. But another cut is tomorrow, when each team has to get down to 36 players.
"There isn't any question that there is very little difference between a segment of players in the N.F.L and World League players," Bailey said. "Some of it is serendipity. Some of it is that a player might not fit into the coach's philosophy or plans."

HEADLINE: Sanitation Workers Approve a Contract

 BODY:
New York City's sanitation workers overwhelmingly approved their new contract with the Dinkins administration by a vote of 4,281 to 429. the union has announced.
The mail-in ballot followed the negotiating committee's 85-to-0 approval of the tentative agreement, worked out by the executive board of the Uniformed Sanitationmen's Association. 
 Under the new contract, which is modeled after the city police accord, sanitation workers will receive a 4.5 percent raise over 15 months, pushing top base pay to $36,876. The contract also provides an increase of $595 in longevity pay.
"Understanding the problems of the economy, our membership recognizes that this is an exceptionally good contract," said Edward Ostrowski, president of the union, noting the 91 percent approval vote.
He said agreement has also been reached on the recycling program and collection routes, although further negotiations will be required. City authorities have called this agreement a major step toward making the city's recycling program more cost-effective.

HEADLINE: Foreign, to the Democrats

 BODY:
When even Richard Nixon voices alarm at how little help America has offered Russia's bold reformers, how does President Bush respond? In terms that leave him sounding like Mad magazine's Alfred E. Neuman: "What, me worry?"
Well, Mr. Bush said last week, maybe the Administration will try to help stabilize the ruble. But otherwise, "There isn't a lot of money around . . . I don't have a blank check." As if anyone were asking for one. Given the chance of a lifetime to encourage democracy, the Leader of the Free World can only sigh. Are his Democratic rivals any more responsive? 
 The three remaining Democratic candidates barely deign to notice that, apart from trade, the U.S. has any interests abroad. On the pivotal issue of aid to Russia, they at least state responsible positions, best of all Bill Clinton. But even here their proposals are too little and too lame.
That's not just a sin of omission. Their reticence clanks jarringly against the central theme of their campaigns. The Democrats all want to shift billions from defense to domestic spending. But the critical precondition for that is Russia's transformation from foe to friend. Aid now can speed it.
All three Democrats favor a new internationalism, and they insist they want to promote economic growth. For now, aid to Russia can help advance both. Some of the aid will pay for food and consumer goods made in America. And in years to come, expanding markets could help propel U.S. growth.
Paul Tsongas would take $2 billion from defense and use it for humanitarian aid. And he wants to establish an "Executive Peace Corps" of retired business people to train entrepreneurs in Russia.
In December, he said: "We have to help the Soviet people through the winter. So if there's going to be mass starvation, deprivation, then we're going to be looking at some serious problems militarily. If you're going to starve them first then don't be surprised if . . . you're going to have a right-wing takeover." But he's had little to say since.
Jerry Brown's campaign staff says he favors aiding Russia, but he's managed to steer clear of the subject almost entirely.
Mr. Clinton has been more outspoken. In a March 5 debate, he urged that the U.S. "Help them dismantle their nuclear force, help them get through the cold months, help them [get] a convertible currency . . . . give a lot of incentives to our companies to do joint ventures." That's still short on specifics. But in contrast to Mr. Bush, it's at least arguing for aid, and in public.
Mr. Clinton did it better in a December speech at Georgetown University: "I know it may be bad politics to be for any aid program. But we owe it to the people who defeated Communism, the people who defeated the coup. And we owe it to ourselves. A small amount spent stabilizing the emerging democracies in the former Soviet empire today will reduce by much more the money we have to commit to our defense in the future. And it will lead to the creation of lucrative markets which mean new American jobs."
It's obviously easier to make a speech than to carry out a policy. But at least Mr. Clinton talks sense to Americans about the opportunity in Russia. President Bush seems unwilling even to say, let alone do, the right thing.

HEADLINE: Abroad at Home;
Who Fed This Caesar?

BYLINE: By ANTHONY LEWIS; Anna Quindlen is on vacation.

DATELINE: BOSTON

 BODY:
A year after the Persian Gulf war Saddam Hussein remains a menace, evading United Nations orders to destroy his nuclear and missile manufacturing plants. President Bush has hinted at renewed military action if the evasion goes on. There could be a June Surprise.
With all that was and still is at stake in Iraq, Congress has been surprisingly slow to look into past American policy. What was the United States doing while the Iraqi dictator was growing into such a menace? 
 In the absence of serious Congressional inquiry, the answer to that question has begun to emerge in the press. It is a shocking answer: The United States was feeding Saddam Hussein's war machine and his ambition.
That is the consistent theme of reports in The Washington Post, in The New York Times in a January piece by Seymour Hersh, and in a series by Murray Waas and Douglas Frantz in The Los Angeles Times over the last month. These were some of the important U.S. policy decisions they found:
In 1982 the Reagan Administration, wanting to prevent Saddam Hussein's defeat in the war with Iran, decided to provide him with secret intelligence. The intelligence helped Iraq learn the disposition of Iranian forces.
The Administration also allowed Iraq's regional allies, which at the time included Saudi Arabia, Kuwait and Jordan, to send Baghdad American-made arms. Among the weapons supplied were thousands of TOW anti-tank missiles, Huey helicopters, small arms and mortars.
In the same year the State Department removed Iraq from the official list of terrorist countries, thereby making it eligible for U.S. aid. In fact, Saddam Hussein continued to harbor terrorists, and we knew it.
The United States immediately began giving Iraq guarantees for credit to buy American farm products. Farm and other credits for Iraq eventually came to $3 billion -- no doubt freeing Saddam Hussein to spend money on arms.
The Los Angeles Times stories described George Bush as playing a leading part in pressing U.S. support for Iraq over the next years, acting first as Vice President.
In June 1984 Vice President Bush telephoned the president of the Export-Import Bank to urge approval of a $500 million loan guarantee for Iraq to build an oil pipeline. Ex-Im, which had been reluctant, approved.
In February 1987 Vice President Bush telephoned the Ex-Im president to press for $200 million in loan guarantees. Economists warned the bank that Iraq could not repay the loans, but the bank approved the guarantees.
In March 1987 the Commerce Department approved export licenses for shipment to Iraq of dual-use technology, useful for scientific or military purposes. Over the next few years exports of this kind totaled $600 million, and much of the equipment may have gone into aerial spying and other military uses.
In August 1988 a cease-fire ended the Iran-Iraq war. But the American tilt toward Iraq continued. Some intelligence was being provided as late as May 1990.
In 1989 Mr. Bush, now President, signed a national security order directing Government agencies to improve ties with Iraq.
In October 1989 Secretary of State James Baker telephoned Clayton Yeutter, then Secretary of Agriculture, and urged him to approve $1 billion in new loan guarantees to Iraq despite fears that the credits were being misused. In November Mr. Yeutter approved the guarantees.
In January 1990 President Bush signed an executive order finding that it would not be "in the national interest" for the Ex-Im Bank to stop loan guarantees to Iraq.
In April and again in June 1990 the Commerce Department proposed restrictions on high-technology exports to Iraq. An inter-agency group chaired by Robert M. Gates, then deputy national security adviser to President Bush, rejected the proposals.
In July 1990 the Senate voted overwhelmingly to cut off loan guarantees to Iraq because of Saddam Hussein's human rights violations, including the gassing of a Kurdish village. The Administration condemned the vote.
On July 31, 1990, with 100,000 Iraqi troops massed at the Kuwait border, Assistant Secretary of State John Kelly went to Capitol Hill and testified against ending loan guarantees to Iraq.
On Aug. 2, 1990, Iraq invaded Kuwait.

HEADLINE: FOCUS;
Troubled Housing Developers Shed Golf Courses

BYLINE: By LYN RIDDLE

DATELINE: GREENVILLE, S.C.

 BODY:
Slower home sales have driven residential developers to sell the amenities they once counted on to hasten land sales and raise prices -- their golf courses.
At least 10 percent of 2,600 residential developments centered on golf courses are in some sort of financial distress because of a lack of sales, according to real estate and golf industry analysts. 
 And perhaps hundreds have sold -- or are quietly trying to sell -- their courses, either to free up cash or to get out of a business they never should have been in in the first place.
"They're sick of it and want to get rid of them," said Craig Price, the executive vice president of the American Golf Corporation, of Santa Monica, Calif., which manages and owns 150 golf courses around the nation and often buys courses from developers.
"We're talking with one developer in Chicago who thinks golf is the dumbest thing he's ever seen," Mr. Price said, "but he's got all these experts telling him to put in a course. Now the project is 100 percent over budget and he's not selling anything and he's wondering why he's got this golf course."
Many of the distressed golf-course developments are in the South, particularly in Florida and in the Carolinas, where nearly three-fourths of all golf courses built in the last few years were conceived as fixtures for housing developments.
It is difficult to ascertain precisely how many courses in South Carolina are for sale, since developers or their lenders are reluctant to advertise their problems, said Rick Bell, a golf course-real estate analyst in Winston-Salem, N.C.
"This is a very quiet network," he said.
Developments in South Carolina were concentrated on the coast and in the foothills area of the Blue Ridge Mountains near this city in the state's northwestern corner. Perhaps surprisingly, Myrtle Beach, which has become a golf mecca in the last decade with the construction of more than 60 golf courses, has few courses with housing developments.
"Myrtle Beach is the Disney World of golf," Mr. Bell said. "Myrtle Beach as a real estate investment is awful. People who go to Myrtle Beach just don't buy real estate and developers have been concerned about Myrtle Beach's image as a moderate-priced market."
But some 100 miles down the coast, at Hilton Head Island, and to a lesser degree Kiawah Island, the opposite has been true. There, all but three of the 35 courses are tied to residential developments. To developers there and around the country, the golf course-residential development idea seemed as sure and as solid as a Jack Nicklaus tee shot.
The huge influx of new golfers, estimated by the National Golf Foundation at a million a year, was straining courses, and developers speculated that if golfers wanted more courses, they would want to live beside one, too. They hired designers to create championship courses, much as a builder hires an architect, and then subdivided the surrounding acreage for sale at prices 20 to 50 percent above course-less developments. House prices in the developments typically range from $200,000 to beyond $1 million.
Mr. Craig said two types of developers were attracted to such projects -- golfers whose desire to own a course obscured good business judgment and builders who saw the boom in golf and wanted to cash in. The National Golf Foundation predicted in 1988 that the country needed 350 new courses a year for a decade to meet the growing demand for places to play.
Soon, hundreds of new courses were being planned or built. In 1989, 54 percent of the courses opened were tied to housing developments.
The most-noticed courses are designed by renowned golfers -- Arnold Palmer, Gary Player and Mr. Nicklaus, who commands a fee of at least $1 million for his designs -- and top-ranked designers, such as Pete Dye, Joe Lee and Tom Fazio.
The designers have no financial stake in the course, but in the mid-80's financing for golf courses was easy to come by, especially through savings and loan associations. To a lesser degree, banks provided money, as did insurance companies, which typically worked out joint ventures with developers.
Many developments did quite well. In South Carolina, Dataw Island, an Alcoa Properties development east of Beaufort, was particularly successful, Mr. Bell said. Lots range in price from $75,000 to $90,000 and homes from $300,000 to $1 million. The complex covers all the island's 800 acres.
But soon the market became flooded with high-cost properties just as the real estate market in general slumped. Financing dried up and some residential developments featuring golf courses, such as the unfinished Timberlake Plantation on Lake Murray near Columbia, S.C., went into bankruptcy. Late last year, the golf course was sold at auction for about $2 million and now operates as a separate enterprise.
"We went on a binge," said Lewis Goodkin, a Florida real estate analyst. "There are too many of the wrong kind of courses. We didn't segment the market enough and inadequately responded to daily fee and public and semi- private courses."
Sagging sales made developers fall behind on their loans because the upfront cost to build a golf course is huge -- between $3 million and $10 million, depending on the design. Analysts say that such high development costs simply cannot be repaid with membership fees and sales in the pro shop and restaurants.
To be sure, golf is a rapidly growing sport, but the newcomers are less affluent and less fanatic. They cannot afford or are not willing to pay hundreds of thousands of dollars for a course-side lot.
"It's much like the situation in Fort Lauderdale, where you'd find the vast majority of people who have docks don't have a boat," Mr. Goodkin said. "Most people who live around a golf course don't play golf. They buy there for the greenbelt and the privacy."
Because of the situation, many entrepreneurs are finding good buys.
Clarence Edwards, a businessman here, was able to buy the Links O'Tryon golf course and development about 30 miles north of Greenville in Gowensville in 1988 from a company in bankruptcy. In January, he sold the course to another company. He would not disclose the price, but said the deal left the residential development debt-free.
Mr. Edwards said he reduced prices and since Jan. 1 got five contracts to sell lots, compared with none in the last five months of 1991. All the lots will be used for primary residences, not second homes, as has been the norm at most link-side developments.
"You have to be flexible," he said of golf-course developments. "You can't always do what you set out to do."

HEADLINE: Boy's Dream Becomes Man's Pain

BYLINE: By ANDI RIERDEN

 BODY:
FOR five months Sylvester Williams has lived with four other inmates in a dormitory room at the Connecticut Correctional Center on Whalley Avenue in New Haven. As the oldest in the room, he said, he often counsels the others, telling them that selling or using drugs is not the answer. A good, solid education, he reminds them, is the only thing that matters. "But then," he said, "they look at me as if to say: 'Hey, look at what you had, and look at you now. So who are you to be talking anyway?' "
 Mr. Williams, 34 years old, a former all-American basketball player and starting forward with the New York Knicks, is now serving three and a half years for second-degree assault on his girlfriend. He has spent the past two years in and out of jail and in a drug rehabilitation program. He was stabbed during an argument with his girlfriend in November and is confined temporarily to a wheelchair as a result of surgical complications following the incident.
 
'Baby in a Man's Body'
 In a recent interview at the prison Mr. Williams described his life as a kaleidoscope of triumphs and shattered dreams. The man known to his fans as Sly Williams grew up in New Haven poised to play basketball, he said, with little interest in his education or in confronting his personal problems. He attributed his descent to his inability to escape self-inflicted burdens and a lack of childhood role models. 
"By the time I walked away from the N.B.A.," he said, "I had realized that though I was 29 years old, I was, in fact, a baby in a man's body."
For decades the world of professional basketball has served as an attractive inducement for young men in city neighborhoods who see scholarships and national television exposure as an opportunity to overcome economic and social limitations. But the successes of professional players like Charles Smith and John Bagley, who grew up in Bridgeport, often overshadow the tragedies like that of Mr. Williams, who forfeited his future by investing too much of his talents into becoming a big-time ballplayer.
Though there are no precise statistics and few methods to track athletes once they leave college or the professional leagues, a significant number return home undereducated and with no alternative career goals. Richard Lapchick, director of the Center for Sports and Society at Northwestern University in Boston and an expert on the status of minority athletes, said the former ballplayers often end up in jail or in trouble with drugs because they cannot adjust to mainstream society.
Despite efforts in recent years by the National Collegiate Athletic Association to upgrade academic standards for players and by high school and college athletic officials to stress the importance of finishing college and formulating career goals, he said, "there remains this prevailing belief in black communities that you can make it to the pros when, in fact, the odds of that happening, depending upon what sport you're talking about, are about 1 in 10,000."
A study released last year by the N.C.A.A., which focused on 85 institutions with large sports programs, found that 26.6 percent of black athletes graduated from those colleges, compared with 52.2 percent of white players and 45.7 percent for all athletes. The dropout rate for white athletes decreased as they progressed through school, while 38.3 percent of black student athletes left school in their fourth or fifth years without graduating, and nearly as many dropped out during their first two years.
Mr. Williams, who was raised in a four-room apartment in the Hill section of New Haven with his mother and 11 brothers and sisters, said his family was supported by a monthly welfare check. As a youngster, he said, he learned how to play basketball in an empty lot, using discarded metal barrels as hoops. When he made the varsity basketball team in his freshman year at Lee High School, he thought his future was sealed.
 
'The Right Path'
 "I had it in my mind that one day I would play for the New York Knicks," said Mr. Williams, who is 6 foot 7. "I knew that they earned a lot of money, and that would allow me to take care of my family. I was determined to follow the right path and meet the right people, so I could attain that goal."
Though he maintained a C-plus average in high school, Mr. Williams said that his obsession with basketball overshadowed everything else in his life. He recalled that the seduction of the crowds that attended his games and the attention he received from the local media were overpowering. "I always wanted to be wanted," he said. "And here I had this gift, where I could walk out on a court, shoot baskets and put smiles on everybody's faces. It was hypnotic."
By the end of his senior year in 1976, Mr. Williams had become New Haven's hometown hero. He had become an all-American and was largely responsible for Lee High School's state's championship. Recruiters from more than 300 colleges were knocking at his door, he said.
His troubles began, he said, while he was attending the University of Rhode Island, where he had received a four-year athletic scholarship. Not only was he not prepared for college-level academics, Mr. Williams said, he also felt obligated to the university's athletic officials, who had given him a major role in shaping the team and raising its standards.
 
Academic Probation
 "In their eyes I came for the athletic program, not academics," he said. "And they did everything in their power to make certain I'd be able to play."
But after playing three seasons with Rhode Island, Mr. Williams was placed on academic probation at the end of his junior year. Soon after, he said, he received notice from the National Basketball Association that he had been drafted by the Knicks. At the age of 20 he had reached his goal in life.
"It was all happening so fast," he recalled. "Here, I'd never had a job before and was now making over $100,000. I had no self-discipline and had stopped growing emotionally. I had thrown my education out the window and had gotten used to thinking that as long as I played basketball, all my problems would go away."
He was plagued with psychological problems and a faltering marriage, Mr. Williams said, and his career with the Knicks was rocked by a series of suspensions, fines and disputes with the team's management. Despite his problems he continued to excel on the court. In four seasons with the Knicks he recorded a total of 2,788 points and 1,054 rebounds.
In 1983 the Knicks traded Mr. Williams to the Atlanta Hawks; he signed a contract with the team for $450,000 a year. But by then, he said, basketball, too, had become a source of stress. Lacking negotiation or business skills, he said, he could not adjust to the pressures of his career. He said the teams reneged on their promises to let him play a minimum length of time in each game. In addition, he said, he continued to fuel his reputation as a renegade by missing practices and games.
 
Return to New Haven
 "Everybody knew that I had this attitude," he said. "Why I acted like I did I just can't explain."
At the end of his second season with the Hawks, Mr. Williams signed a contract with the Boston Celtics. But when he was allowed to play only four minutes a game, he said, he left the Celtics after one season, feeling bitter and frustrated. In 1987 he left the N.B.A. to play for a professional team in Spain.
While he was there, Mr. Williams said, he received word that his brother had committed suicide after shooting his son. He said the family tragedy, along with a pending divorce, psychological problems and disillusionment over the business aspects of professional sports prompted him to leave professional basketball and return to New Haven in 1988.
But once he came home, those who once rallied around him now avoided him or expressed disappointment over his decision, he said. Although he felt he had eliminated a great burden from his life and could now make up for lost time, he said, "everybody still saw me as Sly Williams the great basketball player, not this lost man who was destroying himself slowly but surely."
Because he lacked business skills, Mr. Williams said, he spent freely much of what he earned, yet he remains uncertain about what happened to the money he invested through financial advisers in the mid-1980's.
Within two years of leaving the N.B.A., Mr. Williams said, his money ran out, and he could not find a job. "Most employers told me that because I'd once made a half a million dollars a year, they didn't feel I'd be satisfied making $6 an hour," he said.
Except for his children and his girlfriend, Shirley Massey, he said, he isolated himself and often had suicidal thoughts. Financial difficulties and substance abuse led to arguments between Mr. Williams and Ms. Massey, he said, and the couple's arguments sometimes became violent.
 
Helping College Athletes
 In addition to his current prison term of three and a half years, Mr. Williams was convicted on a prior assault charge involving Ms. Massey and sentenced to three months in prison and to a drug treatment program. Ms. Massey is caring for his two children from his former marriage, he said, adding, that they are his only visitors.
In 1985 the Center for Sports in Society founded the National Consortium for Academics and Sports in an effort to prevent young athletes from dropping out of college and to urge those who leave before graduating to return after playing professionally to complete their education. Seventy institutions now participate in the consortium, including the University of Hartford and the University of Connecticut.
"We've come a long way since Sly Williams's time," said Mr. Lapchick. "But we still have a long road ahead of us. At least now many kids say they are playing sports to avoid drugs and alcohol and as an opportunity to better their lives. Those are the positive things we hoped would happen."
At Warren Harding High School in Bridgeport, Aaron Harris, Lonnie Jones and Allen Henry are among the current basketball stars. The school is No. 1 in the state in basketball this year and has produced the second-largest number of professional athletes among all high schools in the country.
The three players, now seniors, said athletics have kept them from succumbing to drugs and helped them to develop self-esteem and academic self-discipline. They gave credit to their parents and to their coach, Charles Bentley, for their determination to complete their education and return to Bridgeport to pursue business careers.
Mr. Bentley, who grew up in public housing in Bridgeport, said he has always tried "to knock the glamour out of professional sports" by emphasizing academics before athletics. He said he also advocates the upgrading of curriculum standards in urban schools beginning at the elementary level.
One of Mr. Bentley's former basketball players, Charles Smith, who graduated from the University of Pittsburgh and now plays for the Los Angeles Clippers, has created a foundation in Bridgeport that provides tutoring and educational support to children in the city.
Mr. Williams, meanwhile, said he hopes to be released from prison within four to five months. At that time, he said, he would like to find a job as a coach or work with urban youngsters, helping them to develop concrete goals in their lives. He added that he and Ms. Massey would also like to seek counseling to resolve their problems.
"All I'm asking for is a chance to do something positive with my life," he said. "I want to give something back by preventing someone from making some of the mistakes that I did. I want to prove to myself that there is indeed life after basketball."

Hearing the Wake-Up Call

BYLINE: By GLENN RIFKIN

DATELINE: BOSTON

 BODY:
The economic downturn in Massachusetts definitely has a silver lining, says State Treasurer Joseph D. Malone: "It will serve as a wake-up call for all state governments that they must become efficient, effective and agile."
For his part, Mr. Malone, who has been in office a little more than a year, has answered the call with a couple of innovative projects backed by money from the state teachers' and employees' pension fund. 
 The first program, unveiled in January, provides $125 million in mortgage money for middle- and low-income families. The program makes it easier to borrow by accepting down payments of as little as 5 percent and offering lower closing costs.
A second program, announced last month, uses $50 million in pension money to bail out small businesses whose loans have been called in following bank failures.
Both programs appear to be the first of their kind in the nation and have attracted the interest of several other state governments.
The treasurer's job is the first elected position for the 37-year-old Mr. Malone, who has worked as an official of the state Republican Party and as a principal in a health club business owned by his family. He served as the party's sacrificial lamb in the 1988 senatorial race against Edward Kennedy. But he rode into the treasurer's office in 1990 on the wave of local discontent with the Dukakis Democrats. He moved quickly after being sworn in, articulating a "corporate mission" to give better value to the state's taxpayers.
In keeping with that mission, Mr. Malone insisted that the investments in the small business and mortgage programs bring a fair-market return to the pension funds.
"I was very much impressed with Joe's quick grasp that these programs must make sense from an investment standpoint," said Jack R. Meyer, who serves on a nine-member advisory commission to Mr. Malone and is also chief executive of the Harvard Management Company, which oversees Harvard's endowment. "Many states embark on programs without considering that point of view and end up with hidden subsidies that amount to another form of taxation."

HEADLINE: BACKTALK;
Canada Braces for a Spring Without Zing

BYLINE: By BOB McKENZIE; Bob McKenzie is the hockey columnist for The Toronto Star and hockey analyst for The Sports Network.

 BODY:
It has been 52 years since the New York Rangers last won the Stanley Cup and they can easily dredge up at least that many excuses. Now, much to their everlasting chagrin, they could end up with one more.
And what a beauty. The National Hockey League may be on the verge of its first full-scale players' strike. The N.H.L. Players' Association has been without a contract and in a legal strike position since last Sept. 15. The players say they won't finish this year -- the 1991-92 regular season ends three weeks from today -- without a new collective bargaining agreement. Since the players and owners are far apart on the major issues and both are taking the hard line, there is legitimate fear that a strike could end the 1992 Stanley Cup playoffs before they begin. 
 Aside from diehard Ranger fans who believe Mark Messier is their messiah, and the principals of the conflict itself, who in America really cares if this will be a spring sans hockey? Probably just the scattered fans in a few traditional United States hockey hotbeds and the beloved warm-weather oddballs. Not enough to cause a national stir certainly. Especially with this potential walkout coinciding almost perfectly with the opening of the major league baseball season.
 
One Frenzied Reaction
 It is a slightly different story in Canada.
"I'll die; I'll just die if there's no hockey in April," Montreal Canadiens Coach Pat Burns said earlier this season. "I just might kill myself. I know the players have problems and they need to have them solved, but if they walk out right before the playoffs, I'll go out of my mind. I'll die."
Burns's frenzied reaction is fairly typical of the average Canadian, whose idea of a good time is watching a potential 42 consecutive nights of hockey leading up to the cup final in late May. In defense of the nation, it is not necessarily a bastion of hosers, cooking up a mess of back bacon on the Coleman stove, Molson's in hand, displaying gap-toothed grins. (Even if some of us do have the right name, eh?) To put it in terms of sporting sophistication you Americans might understand (and appreciate), more than four million fans flocked to watch the Toronto Blue Jays last year as they set a major league single-season attendance record.
Still, hockey is simply a part of us. An N.H.L. strike is a matter of utmost fear and loathing. If you're still having difficulty identifying with this national crisis, consider a fall without the World Series.
The news only gets worse. The angst of the fans -- and this, my American cousin, is a universal truth -- counts for nothing. The duration of a strike in sports is determined by the players' and owners' ability to cope with the financial consequences. Every fan vows during a strike never to watch another game, but a quick look into the stands of the National Football League or major league baseball discounts the tough talk considerably.
If the majority of Americans have no deep concerns for a hockey strike, it seems a bit much to expect them to be worked up about the issues. Suffice to say the players are looking for each of the N.H.L.'s 24 clubs (Ottawa and Tampa Bay arrive next fall) to shell out about an additional $900,000 per year in tangible benefits (increased share of playoff revenue and pension-plan improvements), as well as the intangible benefits of one-time-only unrestricted free agency for any player with 10 years service.
 
Deficit Is Projected
 The owners, meanwhile, contend that more than half the teams in the league will lose money this season, many of them a million or more dollars. The league is projecting an overall deficit, which is truly amazing since it just recently collected a $50 million franchise fee from each of the two new expansion entries.
As for the N.H.L.-N.H.L.P.A. conflict itself, it's always interesting to size up the heroes and villains. Since the average player's salary has escalated from $276,000 last year to $379,000 this season, a 37.3 per cent increase, and there is this recession thing everyone keeps talking about, it would be easy to pin this one on the players. But the short-term financial woes of the N.H.L. belie the fact that a good number of owners have made considerable profits for many years and never much thought about giving the players their due.
Many years after their union brothers in baseball, football and basketball realized the score, hockey players have finally woken up. In Bob Goodenow, they have a new union leader, an American lawyer with an icy stare that sees a sport run by some of the most conservative sports entrepreneurs on earth.
If the players are excessive in their demands -- a possibility given the tough economic times -- it's only because the pendulum is naturally going to swing back hard after being firmly lodged so high on the other side for so long.
But need there be a strike? We'll soon find out if the party is truly over in this, the N.H.L.'s 75th anniversary season. As for those Ranger fans, a strike may not be such a bad thing after all. Sure, the Blueshirts won't win the Stanley Cup this year. But then no one else will either.

HEADLINE: Commercial Property: The Port Authority and Starrett Lehigh Buildings;
For 2 Huge Relics, Different Futures

BYLINE: By JERRY CHESLOW

 BODY:
TWO 1930's red-brick structures -- relics of Manhattan's industrial past, when giant warehouses were in great demand -- dominate their localities.
But though their pasts are similar, they have developed very differently, one catering to what is left of the island's light industry, the other focusing on high-tech and office tenants. 
 Both the 15-story Port of New York Authority Building, at 111 Eighth Avenue, between 15th and 16th Streets, and the 19-story Starrett Lehigh Building, at 601 West 26th Street, between 11th and 12th Avenues, were built to accommodate railroad freight.
Each occupies a full city block and each has about two million square feet of rental space, giant loading docks for tractor-trailers on the ground floor and elevators to bring 29-foot trucks to the upper floors.
There the similarity stops.
The Port Authority building originally housed the agency's offices and the Union Inland Freight Station #1, a truck terminal operated jointly by eight railroads for the distribution of freight. In 1973, after the authority -- by then the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey -- began moving its offices to larger, more modern quarters in the World Trade Center, the structure was sold to the Sylvan Lawrence Company, real estate investors, for $24 million.
The building has since been updated, with new elevators, lobbies, windows and a fire-safety system. The modernized structure, in the heart of Chelsea, with its many shops and restaurants, has a subway station in the basement, making it easily accessible.
Although space is still rented for warehousing, the railroads moved out in 1963. Much of the building is now rented for back-office computer operations, said Charles L. Goldenberger, president of Sylvan Lawrence. It is nearly 80 percent full and commands rates of $8 to 18 a square foot, according to Cushman & Wakefield, a real estate brokerage firm. Among the tenants are The New York Law Journal and Citibank.
"We are emphasizing computer data processing space," said Mr. Goldenberger. "And if companies want large floor space for computer operations, they have few options in Manhattan. So we've been pretty much insulated from the recession."
Built by the Lehigh Valley Railroad with railroad tracks on its ground floor, the Starrett Lehigh Building is handicapped by what was once its most important feature -- location. It is a block from the Hudson River.
"The Lehigh Valley Railroad had its terminus in New Jersey," explained Alvin Schwartz, a senior vice president of Helmsley-Spear, the landmarked building's current owner.
"So they would put railroad cars on barges and float them across the river. Diesels would pull them into the building for loading and unloading."
BUT the tracks have been removed and the ground floor has been converted to retail space, most of which is empty. The building itself, with sweeping loft-type windows and rounded corners that make it look a bit like a cruise ship, is showing its age. The red brick is sooty, the elevators are still manually operated and the original windows, built for light industry, are outdated and single-pane. Neighboring buildings are in sore need of paint and modernization, making the setting unattractive for office occupancy.
Mr. Schwartz maintains that the building is mainly handicapped by the lack of public transportation. There are no subway stops nearby and the closest Manhattan Transit Authority bus stop is at the corner of 23d Street and 11th Avenue. Mr. Schwartz said that he has been trying for years to get the Transit Authority to bring bus service closer but "they turned a deaf ear."
"We considered a jitney service," said Edward J. Stein, manager of the Starrett Lehigh Building, "but with insurance the numbers are astronomical. Our tenants are paying $6 a square foot, which is down to bare basics, and it just won't support it."
He said that 10 years ago, when he became manager, the building was nearly full. However, the recession bankrupted many tenants, including Zayre Stores, which had rented a quarter of a million square feet of warehouse space. Many other former tenants were in printing-related fields, which Mr. Stein says were hurt by computerization, the development of photocopy machines and the high cost of New York City labor.
Today, most tenants use Starrett Lehigh for warehousing. Many, such as Liz Roberts, a women's clothing firm, are in the garment industry. Other large tenants include Baby Watson Cheesecake and Motorola, which has a repair facility on the ground floor.
Space in the building is advertised at $6 a square foot, one third of what the more prime space in the Port Authority building goes for. Even at those rates, the building is 40 percent vacant.
Mr. Stein is convinced that when the recession ends, his building will "turn around." He says that many tenants need large, open spaces at inexpensive rentals and that Starrett Lehigh's 130,000-square-foot floors will fill that niche.
"It's a perfect building for light manufacturing," Mr. Stein said. "We can take trucks up to all of the different floors. It cuts down on stealing and time. The rent is low and, because all of our elevators are manual, our people see everyone who enters or leaves the building. So the building is one of the most secure in Manhattan."
MR. STEIN maintains that during tough economic times, high taxes drive industry out of Manhattan. However, when the economy picks up, he says, many will realize that the convenience of the city "is worth more than a fancier, less expensive showroom in Secaucus," N.J.
"They'll see that it's worth a lot to be able to deliver their merchandise to anywhere in Manhattan in 10 minutes, rather than being stuck in the tunnel for an hour on the way," Mr. Stein predicted.
Josh N. Kuriloff, a director at Cushman & Wakefield, agrees that there is a market for older office, warehouse and light-manufacturing space in Manhattan, even in a recession.
However, he says, the owners must continuously update their buildings during good times, as Sylvan Lawrence has, to remain competitive in hard times.
Katey Marshall, a spokeswoman for the New York City Economic Development Corporation, said in an interview that the city is considering offering tax incentives to owners of older commercial buildings who upgrade their structures. She maintained that while traditional industries, such as the garment industry, are having difficulty, Manhattan was beginning to attract high-tech companies, which would require updated premises.
"The key," Mr. Kuriloff said, "is proper positioning, which is hard for landlords to do after the highs of the 80's. They have to lower their rents, sometimes below break-even rates. They also have to be prepared to compete on concession packages, free rent and construction dollars. It's a matter of facing reality in difficult times."
He sees New Jersey and Brooklyn as Manhattan's main competitors for light manufacturing and warehouse tenants. For white-collar tenants, Mr. Kuriloff said, Wall Street is a major attraction.
"When the market is spiraling upwards as it was in the 80's, the occupancy costs of prime real estate, such as in the Wall Street area are very high," he said. "So there is great pressure to move back-office space out of buildings that go for $20 to $30 a square foot to secondary space. That's when older buildings do best. But in a downward market, these buildings must offer better deals because prime space has come down in price."

LIFE ITSELF
Abortion in the American Mind.
By Roger Rosenblatt.
194 pp. New York: Random House. $20. 
 IN "Life Itself: Abortion in the American Mind," a well-intentioned but debatable book, Roger Rosen blatt examines the ambivalence about the subject specifically reflected in recent polls of Americans, with the intention of stimulating the kind of national discussion that would make for greater tolerance on both sides of the issue. In 1990, Mr. Rosenblatt, a journalist and commentator for "The MacNeil/Lehrer Newshour," talked to a number of people in Iowa about abortion, a major issue in the state's election campaigns for Governor and United States Senator that year. He was surprised by what he learned. Whether for or against the right to abortion, individual Iowans were divided in their private thoughts about the moral and legal aspects of the issue.
Mr. Rosenblatt suggests that the conflicts he found in the Iowan hearts are national in scope and that most Americans are profoundly ambivalent about abortion. Even the polling data are contradictory: a 1990 survey by Louis Harris and Associates showed 73 percent of Americans favoring abortion rights, while a February 1991 Gallup poll found that 49 percent agreed that abortion was "an act of murder" and 28 percent who would not go that far called it "the taking of a human life."
Describing himself as "conventionally pro-choice," in a useful historical survey Mr. Rosenblatt points out that hardly any societies -- the only one he mentions is the native Formosans -- have ever given abortion unqualified approval, especially on the demand of the mother. He contends that questions central to the current abortion debate -- when a fetus becomes a person, what circumstances justify an abortion, and whether the power of decision over abortion should reside in the individual or the state -- have nowhere been fully resolved. In recent decades, abortion has been legalized, albeit with varying degrees of restrictions, in many nations, yet in most of them anti-abortionists have not, by and large, embarked on a crusade against abortion rights. In contrast, Mr. Rosenblatt believes the United States is currently in a state of civil belligerency over the issue.
Mr. Rosenblatt seeks to account for this American exception by ascribing attitudes in the abortion controversy to features of American culture. Some of his interpretations appear stretched -- for example, he concludes that our propensity to endow every person's life with optimistic expectations prompts anti-abortionists to save the fetus for its future and their opponents to protect the options of the pregnant woman. Other interpretations carry punch. He argues, for example, that our evangelical tradition leads many Americans to project their private moral convictions onto the public arena, "to see America as themselves."
Our deep middle-class discomfort with sexuality and our ambivalence about the social role of women are perhaps most important, Mr. Rosenblatt feels. To many people in the American middle class, he says, abortion is a sign of careless and illicit sex, a symptom of an unruly licentiousness. It is also a threat to the bourgeois dream because it enlarges the freedom and independence of women who might otherwise remain subordinate in their social and sexual habits to traditional wifely and motherly roles.
The voices from Iowa, heard here from both sides of the abortion divide without the usual shouting-match anger, reveal common anxieties about the disintegration of the family and the fate of unwanted children. Both sides also express a common respect for the rights of privacy, and support for measures that would reduce abortion by preventing unwanted conceptions. The degree of shared concern stimulates Mr. Rosen blatt to argue, in what is the central theme of "Life Itself," that a consensus might well be formed in support of a suitable modus vivendi on abortion. He has one to advocate: Permit abortion, in recognition of the rights of privacy and individual self-determination, but discourage it, in acknowledgment of the broad moral objections it provokes.
NEVER mind for the moment that Mr. Rosen blatt offers little practically to discourage abortion besides sex education. His case for discouragement seems unfair to innumerable women who already face social and economic obstacles and personal anguish in terminating pregnancy. It is also unpersuasive, wishfully at odds with some of his own observations, including the evidence from Iowa. Anti-abortionists there may endorse sex education, but it is possible that unlike abortion rights advocates, they mean education for abstinence rather than for contraception.
Building on a point made by a chaplain at the University of Iowa, Mr. Rosenblatt holds that opponents of abortion might "tolerate a pro-choice law" just as people in the United States tolerate religious differences. The analogy is inappropriate, however, since differences in belief are more easily tolerated than morally charged differences in behavior.
Even more puzzling than why the right to abortion is so hotly contested in the United States is the question of why an apparent minority of the population -- the faction who oppose the right -- exercise so much political clout. As Mr. Rosenblatt reports, the right to abortion is in increasing jeopardy -- from the courts and from bills to restrict or prohibit abortion that have been introduced into the legislatures of some 45 states, as well as from a chilling intimidation of physicians that, for example, has driven out of South Dakota all but one doctor willing to perform the procedure. For all the stated overlaps and consensus, there is an emotional energy behind the anti-abortion drive that would seem to prohibit agreement on the "permit" part of Mr. Ros enblatt's formula. Wishful thinking does not end political conflict.

HEADLINE: The Pentagon's Superpower Fantasy

BYLINE: By James Chace; James Chace, who teaches international relations at Bard College, is author of "The Consequences of the Peace," a forthcoming book.

 BODY:
The United States is not a superpower. There are no more superpowers, despite a new Pentagon document outlining a $1.2 trillion strategy to prevent any other nation from challenging this country's primacy.
If the Persian Gulf war proved anything, it proved that one nation can't dominate the world. The war was paid for by our allies, mostly by Germany and Japan. Superpowers can afford to pay for their own wars; we cannot. We are in hock to foreigners for more than half a trillion dollars, mostly because of foreign holdings of U.S. real estate, Government paper, commercial bonds and notes and other assets. 
 Without the $54 billion in aid that the Bush Administration received for the gulf operation, the U.S., with a budget deficit projected for 1992 of about $400 billion, could not have afforded to mount such a campaign. It is highly unlikely that we will receive support for similar foreign policy adventures, certainly not to police the world as the Pentagon intends us to.
And we will not find it easy to lead a campaign against world disorder when we depend on those allies who now read a Pentagon document stating that our aim is "to discourage them from challenging our leadership or seeking to overturn the established political and economic order." See if the Japanese and Germans are ready to pony up billions of dollars to support that kind of policy.
The Pentagon's America-firsters ignore the economic dimension of U.S. foreign policy. They don't understand it is more important for the U.S. to cooperate with the other great powers to insure a healthy functioning of the world economy than to spend its energies and funds by unilaterally assuming the task of enforcing global peace and stability.
In the Pentagon's analysis, there is a striking absence of any concern with ends and means. For a country that, in a decade, has gone from being a creditor nation to being the largest debtor nation, we should be especially wary about pursuing high-flown notions calculated to make the world safe for democracy. If we try to do so, we will end up betraying the concept of collective security that Franklin D. Roosevelt and Harry S. Truman saw as the cornerstone of the U.S. security -- the concept that was the foundation of a successful Western alliance.
The Administration is subordinating policy to politics in an election year. In Mr. Bush's effort to inflate his image as a tough commander in-chief, his Defense Department is seeking new enemies that require little or no change in Pentagon budgeting. These "enemies" happen to be our allies -- the same allies who paid for the gulf war.
But what will be the price of the Pentagon's fantasy to insure that "the world order is ultimately backed by the U.S.?" As Marion Donoff, the publisher of Die Zeit, the German weekly, wrote prophetically in 1982, "One must fear that in 10 years the United States will indeed be militarily invulnerable, but that in the civil realm, she will have become, to a catastrophic degree, a backward nation."
The collapse of the Soviet empire, the end of the struggle for ideological supremacy between Moscow and Washington, the absolute necessity to rethink our military commitments and force structures -- all this presents a signal occasion for embracing a new internationalism.
It would rest on the proposition that a global balance of powers is coming into being. Above all, it would require the U.S. to abandon the false idea of "the superpower," which had its origins in a cold war that is now history. Yet it would preclude a withdrawal into ourselves.
Ultimately, the success of the U.S. will lie in the quality of its society, not in a quixotic pursuit of superpower invulnerability. But, in his re-election bid, George Bush bid seems to be making a different calculation.

HEADLINE: THE 1992 CAMPAIGN: Primaries;
CLINTON, BUILDING STRONG COALITION, LEADS IN MICHIGAN

BYLINE: By R. W. APPLE Jr., Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: DETROIT, March 15

 BODY:
Gov. Bill Clinton of Arkansas has built an imposing lead in Michigan's Presidential primary race by assembling a powerful coalition spanning the state's strongest Democratic constituencies -- trade unions, blacks and conservative whites, including ethnic voters who backed Republicans in the 1980's.
The main threat to Mr. Clinton in Tuesday's voting here may turn out to be not former Senator Paul E. Tsongas of Massachusetts, whose campaign has failed to generate a spark in this chronically depressed industrial state, but former Gov. Edmund G. Brown Jr. of California, who has transformed himself in recent days into the scourge of free trade and champion of the fearful. 
 A poll published in this morning's Detroit News showed Mr. Clinton with 49 percent to 18 percent for Mr. Tsongas, 17 percent for Mr. Brown and 15 percent undecided. The survey of 506 likely Democratic voters was conducted on Thursday and Friday, just as Mr. Brown began to win the endorsement of big local unions and catch the eye of television news shows.
 
Large Gap in Illinois
 Robert H. Giles, the News's editor, said that the longer polling continued, the stronger Mr. Brown got, which suggests a late surge that could push him past Mr. Tsongas.
A Clinton victory in Illinois, which also votes on Tuesday, has seemed likely for several days, partly because of months of effective organizational work. Mr. Tsongas is running a weak second there, too, although Mr. Brown is less of a threat and Mr. Tsongas may be stronger in the Chicago suburbs. If Mr. Clinton were to win both states by large margins, he would quickly become the prohibitive favorite at the party's national convention this summer.
On the Republican side, President Bush is leading his chief challenger, Patrick J. Buchanan, by a better than 3 to 1 in polls in this state and better than 5 to 1 in Illinois, despite Mr. Buchanan's intensive effort in Michigan, where he had hoped economic despair would help him revive his campaign.
"The most likely outcome of the voting in Michigan," said David Rohde, a professor of political science at Michigan State University, "is that we'll see the end of the nomination fight in both of the parties."
Many prominent Michigan Democrats hope that isn't so, at least in their party, and are urging voters to mark their ballots "uncommitted" in an effort to bring about a deadlocked convention and the entry of some other candidate. Among them are Frank Garrison, the head of the state labor federation; Representative John D. Dingell, the chairman of the House Energy and Commerce Committee, and Senator Carl Levin.
But most politicians here consider those men wishful thinkers at best.
The greater threat to Mr. Clinton is the pattern of erratic turnouts in Michigan, which makes upsets common. The Clinton campaign needs a strong black vote, and an endorsement from Mayor Coleman A. Young of Detroit last Friday could help the Arkansas Governor avoid embarrassment. In the 1988 primary, blacks turned out in large numbers and gave the Rev. Jesse Jackson an upset victory; in the 1990 governor's race, they did not, and the heavily favored incumbent, James Blanchard, a Democrat, was ousted by John M. Engler, a Republican.
Not many politicians have managed in recent years to bring together black voters and white ethnic voters in this polarized state. But last week Mr. Clinton appealed for tolerance as a key to progress in speeches in black neighborhoods of Detroit and in Macomb County, north of here, to which many whites moved in the 1960's and 1970's as Detroit grew more and more black.
"It has been, 'We're the party of the blacks at the expense of the white middle class,' " said Leo Lalonde, the Macomb Democratic chairman. "Clinton is maybe going to change that. For sure, he's going to take this part of the state by a ton."
Putting together a broad coalition has been easier because there is no traditional liberal in the race, which is an astonishing phenomenon in the state where Walter Reuther of the United Automobile Workers built a powerful labor and minority partnership that dominated Democratic politics for years. Many had hoped that Senator Tom Harkin of Iowa could knit that partnership back together, but he pulled out of the race a week ago.
 
Tsongas Takes Stand
 "You can't be everything to everybody," Mr. Tsongas said today on the NBC News program "Meet the Press," in a renewed effort to suggest that Mr. Clinton lacked strong convictions and to attract those who had backed Mr. Harkin. "You have to stand for some things."
Mr. Tsongas probably has less of a natural following here than he has in any other major state, in the view of a ranking Democratic official in Lansing, who spoke on condition of anonymity. "Tsongas says our economic problems are more our own fault than Japan's, and that may be true, but Michigan doesn't want to hear it and won't buy it," the official said.
The former Senator has been hurt here not only by his support of a fast-track free-trade negotiations with Mexico, which the unions fear would mean the export of thousands of jobs, but also by his opposition to a law that would ban the hiring of permanent replacements for striking workers.
Mr. Brown has taken the opposite stand on both issues, and that has won him plaudits and apparently a lot of new supporters. At a Jefferson-Jackson dinner in Detroit on Saturday, his comments drew the loudest applause, and he attracted more attention by re-enacting with several hundred supporters the mythic 1932 Detroit-to-Dearborn hunger march, which ended with five people being killed by the Ford-dominated Dearborn police.
"These people died, and now they're coming at you, not with bullets, not with gas and water hoses," he said at the Ford Motor Company's River Rouge plant, where the clashes occurred 60 years ago. "They're coming at you with a fast track, and they're going to take your livelihoods and put them down in Mexico."
Although the Californian is backed by workers in Ypsilanti, where the mammoth Willow Run plan is to close soon, and by the leadership of the 70,000-odd Teamsters in the state, he still trails Mr. Clinton among union members in The Detroit News poll, 50 percent to 17 percent, with Mr. Tsongas also at 17 percent. The poll had a margin of sampling error of plus or minus 5 percentage points.
"I don't think he can win," Mayor Young said, "but Jerry Brown certainly represents the alienation and resentment many of the people in Michigan feel. They're afraid they're next, afraid their jobs are going. They're angry. They feel betrayed by this society and by their government."
In Michigan, Mr. Brown has begun to pick up significant black support for the first time, including two Wayne County commissioners, state legislators and, this morning, Representative John Conyers Jr., one of the best known black politicians in the Midwest.
Tonight, in a television debate in Chicago that was also broadcast here, Mr. Brown assailed Mr. Clinton and Mr. Tsongas for supporting the fast-track negotiations and said Mr. Clinton had unfairly taxed the poor in Arkansas. He also accused the Arkansan of funneling state legal business to his wife's law firm.
"He reinvents himself every two weeks," Mr. Clinton shot back, jabbing his finger at Mr. Brown.
 
Difficulty for Buchanan
 Mr. Buchanan, whose Michigan backers had high hopes two weeks ago, appears to have run into difficulty in raising money. Television station executives say he had made only limited purchases of advertising time through Friday. A new, more stringent election law may well discourage the Democrats who voted for Ronald Reagan, a Buchanan target, from crossing over to vote in the Republican primary.
"Buchanan's running on empty as far as money is concerned and as far as momentum is concerned," said William Ballenger, editor of a newsletter called Inside Michigan Politics.
Mr. Buchanan took only 21 percent in The Detroit News poll, with Mr. Bush at 71 percent. David Duke, the former Ku Klux Klan official from Louisiana, had 2 percent, with 5 percent undecided.
Mr. Bush campaigned here last week in a less fevered style than he had displayed earlier in the political season, and Robert M. Teeter, his campaign chairman, who comes from Michigan, said he was "pretty comfortable" with the President's situation.

HEADLINE: A Top G.M. Official Is Reported Chosen To Succeed Iacocca

BYLINE: By DORON P. LEVIN, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: DETROIT, March 15

 BODY:
Yielding to the wishes of Lee A. Iacocca, the directors of the Chrysler Corporation have agreed to name a General Motors executive to succeed him as chief executive, several people with knowledge of the board's deliberations said tonight.
After two days of meetings in New York, the board's 10 outside directors settled on Mr. Iacocca's candidate, Robert J. Eaton, who currently heads G.M.'s highly profitable European operations. 
 Chrysler spokesmen and executives declined to comment today on what was decided, and the company scheduled a news conference for Monday morning at its headquarters in Highland Park, Mich.
Chrysler, for many years one of the 10 largest American companies, has slipped a few notches in the last two years. The most troubled company in a desperately troubled American industry, it remains at the center of many debates about the American economy: how to insure fair-trade rules in other nations, how to meet the huge cost of retirees' benefits, when corporate debts become too heavy, and whether extremely well-paid executives exercise adequate judgment in adapting to changing economic conditions.
Mr. Iacocca, who joined Chrysler in 1978 as president and chief operating officer after he was forced out of the Ford Motor Company by Henry Ford 2d, is scheduled to retire as chief executive at the end of this year. He may retain his position as chairman, and it is not clear just how much power he would like or will be able to keep.
During his tenure at Chrysler, Mr. Iacocca, who is 67 years old, became America's most visible business leader, a prominent spokesman in the company's advertisements, and a voice for the American auto industry in its struggle with Japan.
He wrote the best-selling business autobiography of all time, "Iacocca," and led fund-raising to refurbish the Statue of Liberty and Ellis Island.
Mr. Eaton, the president of General Motors Europe, is an experienced engineering executive who previously supervised G.M.'s technical staffs. Chrysler's succession plan should remove some of the uncertainty that has hung over the auto maker after the resignation or retirement of nine corporate officers in the last two and a half years.
Among those were Gerald Greenwald, Mr. Iacocca's heir apparent, who resigned two years ago to lead an unsuccessful attempt to buy the UAL Corporation, parent of United Airlines. He then joined Dillon, Read & Company in New York.
Last month, Robert S. Miller Jr., the vice chairman, left Chrysler to become an investment banker at James D. Wolfensohn, a Wall Street investment firm. Mr. Miller and Robert A. Lutz, Chrysler's president, had been widely viewed as the team that would lead Chrysler once Mr. Iacocca departed.
 
End of the Line for No. 2?

 Monday's announcement could signal the start of a new power struggle at Chrysler involving several top executives, and perhaps Mr. Iacocca himself. In turning to Mr. Eaton of G.M., Mr. Iacocca seems to have slammed the door on the advancement of Mr. Lutz, who coordinates the company's development of vehicles and is highly popular among Chrysler employees. The wooing of Mr. Eaton apparently signals that Mr. Lutz, who is 60 years old, was weighed by Mr. Iacocca and found wanting.
It is not clear when or why Mr. Iacocca turned against Mr. Lutz. The two men have similar outspoken personalities, and in the past Mr. Lutz has disagreed with Mr. Iacocca in front of subordinates.
Because of Mr. Lutz's popularity within the company, the recruitment of Mr. Eaton, who is 52, could foster resentment.
The biggest question may be the future role of Mr. Iacocca himself. He had announced he would retire as chief executive at the end of the year, but he has also hinted that he wants to wield influence and power as a director of the company. Some people have suggested that he might want to head the the powerful finance committee.
It is not uncommon in American corporate history for a retired chief executive to have difficulty surrendering control. Many of them have continued to hold at least one rein as directors of their companies.
In 1990, the last year for which data are available, Mr. Iacocca was paid $4.65 million by Chrysler and received stock valued at $718,000. In Japan, where Mr. Iacocca is bitterly resented for his criticism of Japan's trade policies, such compensation has been sharply criticized. Critics note that Mr. Iacocca and other American auto executives, whose companies are in deep trouble, earn far more than their successful Japanese counterparts.
Mr. Eaton's pay at General Motors has not been disclosed on the company's financial statements. The compensation he will receive at Chrysler is likely to be disclosed in proxy statements that Chrysler will issue in the next few weeks in advance of its May 14 meeting of shareholders.
 
Executive Suite Politics
 Mr. Iacocca's decision to retain some power, the frustration and disappointment of Mr. Lutz, and Mr. Eaton's impact as an outsider could once again be setting the stage for what has been a recurring drama of executive suite politics in the automobile industry. Indeed, Mr. Iacocca was at the center of an epic struggle to rule Ford during the 1970's, in spite of the wishes of Henry Ford 2d.
The issue of succession at Chrysler comes at a crucial moment for the nation's No. 3 auto maker, which, despite some gains in recent months, remains in precarious financial condition. And to some extent, many auto industry experts say, Chrysler's fate may depend more on how strongly the nation's economy recovers than on who is at the helm.
In its precarious position, encumbered by debt, beset by unrelenting competition from larger domestic and foreign companies, Chrysler can ill afford a divisive struggle over who will succeed Mr. Iacocca. Yet Mr. Iacocca may have introduced just that divisiveness in reaching outside for Mr. Eaton.
A lot depends on Mr. Lutz. If he acquiesces to Mr. Eaton's recruitment and can transfer the loyalty of his subordinates to Mr. Eaton, the chances for harmony will improve.
 
Danger to Morale
 Mr. Lutz, a veteran of corporate infighting at Ford, where he once ran European operations, may need to be convinced that his talents are still highly valued. Unless that happens, morale could plummet among the engineers and product planners who have rallied behind Mr. Lutz and his close ally, Francois Castaing, vice president of engineering.
Indeed, it is Mr. Lutz who has received much of the credit for the new vehicles Chrysler is planning, which have received good reviews in the automotive press and are being counted on to drive the company's recovery.
These vehicles include the Grand Cherokee model Jeep and the L/H midsize models that are scheduled for the fall. It has been many years since Chrysler introduced completely new midsize models.
 
Infighting at Ford
 Because Mr. Iacocca was at the center of the struggle to rule Ford during the 1970's, it should be easy for him to identify with Mr. Lutz's frustration. Mr. Ford, in 1968, recruited a senior G.M. executive, Semon E. (Bunky) Knudsen as president of Ford. That made Mr. Iacocca so angry that he almost quit. Mr. Knudsen's tenure was marked by infighting, and he left after 17 months, leaving Mr. Iacocca once more as Mr. Ford's heir apparent.
But the infighting grew so ferocious in 1977 that Mr. Ford delivered an ultimatum about Mr. Iacocca to Ford's directors: "Him or me."
Mr. Iacocca's most enduring achievement at Chrysler may be his role in the Federal Government's bail-out of the company from 1979 to 1984. While others may have imparted more technical expertise, no one was more articulate or persuasive in persuading the Government to guarantee more than $1 billion in loans, suppliers to grant discounts or organized labor to give wage and benefit concessions.
By promoting the bailout, Mr. Iacocca advanced the theory that Government should act to help corporations survive, even when their woes might have stemmed from management mistakes or market forces.
No one can forecast precisely whether buyers will respond to Chrysler's new vehicles or whether they will be in the mood for buying vehicles at all. In either case, the auto maker might find itself with its back to the wall. Its finance subsidiary must refinance billions of dollars of debt at a time when its borrowing power is severely constricted.
 
Appeal for Stockholders
 Major stockholders of Chrysler in recent weeks had urged the company to appoint Mr. Lutz as chief executive-designate, and they are likely to be concerned about the hiring of Mr. Eaton. If the shareholders were concerned mainly about the lack of a succession plan, the hiring of Mr. Eaton may set their minds at ease.
But if they see an outsider as a divisive element, Chrysler's share price may suffer.
In the last few months, partly on the strength of the positive reviews of the new vehicles, Chrysler's stock has risen from about $10 a share to as high as $17.87; it finished on Friday at $16.75, up 25 cents on the New York Stock Exchange.

HEADLINE: Israelis Step Up Skirmish With U.S.

BYLINE: By CLYDE HABERMAN, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: JERUSALEM, March 15

 BODY:
Israeli officials stepped up their attacks on the United States today over allegations that Israel had illegally resold American weapons technology to China, South Africa and other countries.
At the same time, military experts here said the arms-sale charges suggest that the longstanding strategic relationship between the United States and Israel might be at an important turning point. 
 If so, the Middle East peace conference could be undermined, some of them warned, arguing that an Israel that doubts Washington's steadfastness would be much less likely to offer the Arabs concessions that might involve security risks.
Relations between the United States and Israel have been slipping for months, and there were no signs after the Israeli Cabinet's weekly meeting today that matters would soon improve.
Although the Cabinet chose not to discuss the technology dispute, several officials normally charged with conveying the Government's public messages emerged from the meeting to denounce what one of them called a "deliberate campaign of slander against Israel."
Health Minister Ehud Olmert, who is close to Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir, linked the weapons issue to the visit to the White House last week by King Hussein of Jordan, and said the developments showed that "something much deeper here is wrong in the basic attitude" of the Bush Administration toward Israel.
"We're living in a different world, and we have to get used to new game rules," Mr. Olmert said.
Once again, the Israelis denied unswervingly that they had broken agreements with the United States and had re-exported American weapons and arms technologies to third countries without Washington's permission.
The charges, the focus of a draft report prepared by the State Department's Inspector General, came to public attention with a report in The Washington Times that Israel had given China technology from the American-made Patriot missiles sent here last year to help defend Israel against Iraqi Scud missile attacks during the Persian Gulf war. This was followed by other accounts, including a detailed article in The Wall Street Journal about a pattern of Israeli violations involving sales of missiles to South Africa and China and cluster bombs to Ethiopia and Chile.
In all cases, Israeli officials insisted, the charges are baseless -- a theme echoed by military specialists here. They argued that some suspected sales had never happened. In others, they said, transfers involved technology that did not reveal American secrets or require American permission.
"I think Israel is very careful in this area," said Dore Gold, a military expert at the Jaffee Center for Strategic Studies at Tel Aviv University, who has served on occasion as a government consultant. Referring to charges that Israeli companies had installed American components in their weapons, or had copied them with modifications before reselling them, Mr. Gold said:
"It is an area like patent law, where someone will say, 'Hey, that was my idea.' There is a strict school of American thought that says that if there is an American bolt and nut in an Israeli system, then it's American technology in the whole system."
Zeev Schiff, military specialist for the newspaper Haaretz, wrote in a commentary today that "because of the crisis of confidence existing between President Bush and Mr. Shamir and a few of his ministers, there is a tendency these days to believe almost anything that Israel is accused of."
 
Cheney and Arens to Meet
 The dispute is expected to be discussed on Monday by Defense Secretary Dick Cheney and Israel's Defense Minister, Moshe Arens, who is visiting the United States and who has denied the accusations repeatedly.
A leading concern among Israeli officials is that they may risk losing future American technology transfers that this country depends on to maintain an advantage against its Arab neighbors. There are also worries that the United States might scale back its support for the Arrow anti-missile system, a pet project of Mr. Arens that has already suffered technological troubles.
Perhaps even more than the American allegations themselves, which reportedly were made known to Israel weeks ago, the recent spate of related news articles have also upset Israeli officials, who see them as the product of orchestrated leaks.
"This deliberate campaign of slander against Israel is intended to undermine Israel's position in the American public and in the American Congress," said Benjamin Netanyahu, a senior Shamir aide. He did not say who in Washington might be behind the effort.
Beyond the immediate question of who may have sold what to whom, some experts here say the dispute may signal a fundamental change in American-Israeli relations. It affects, they argue, security arrangements that until now have been kept distinct from political disagreements like the one over Israel's request for $10 billion in American loan guarantees to help resettle Jewish emigres from the former Soviet Union.
"This could be a major turning point in the strategic relationship," said Gerald M. Steinberg, a strategic-studies specialists at Bar Ilan University near Tel Aviv.
"Agreements going back 25 years were that each side would not look too closely at the other's technology improvements. Now we're seeing this issue being reopened. Where Israel thought it was in the position of sharing information with an ally, the State Department report is putting Israel back in the position of being a client."
Mr. Gold of the Jaffee Center cautioned that "this can't help the peace process" because the dispute would inevitably shake Israel's confidence that "if it is willing to take risks, American security will be there."
Some opposition figures restated often-expressed accusations that the Shamir Government had mismanaged relations with Israel's chief ally and benefactor, which supplies $1.8 billion a year in military aid and $1.2 billion in economic assistance.
But Mr. Netanyahu said that within a few years Israel would no longer be able to count on this aid, and he suggested that a cutoff might not be so bad. "We are discovering that the economic dependence is also creating political dependence," he said, "and that you cannot reach political independence without economic independence."

HEADLINE: Bush Is Urged to Speak Up for Russia

BYLINE: By STEVEN GREENHOUSE, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, March 15

 BODY:
Worried that economic desperation could transform the former Soviet republics into hostile dictatorships, many Republicans in Congress have joined Democrats and former President Richard M. Nixon in urging the Bush Administration to take the lead in backing billions of dollars more in aid to the republics.
After Mr. Nixon described the American aid granted so far as "pathetically inadequate" last week, several prominent Republican legislators began to echo remarks by some Democrats that strong Presidential leadership is needed on the issue. Mr. Bush's backing is necessary both to assure support in Congress and to reduce the political heat that lawmakers face in an election year over backing more foreign aid, those legislators have said. 
 To help preserve Russia's experiment in democracy and the free market, many legislators want Washington to back a new $12 billion contribution to the International Monetary Fund as well as several billion dollars for other programs, including a fund to support the ruble.
 
On the Brink of a Pit
 "They're at a point in history where either the stabilization occurs or you really go into a deep pit in which there appears to be no bottom whatsoever," said Senator Richard G. Lugar, an Indiana Republican and influential member of the Foreign Relations Committee who recently visited Russia and other republics. "This is why we're hopeful that our Government will move."
The United States Ambassador to Russia, Robert S. Strauss, told a Senate committee last week that two leading conservative Republicans, Senator Jesse Helms of North Carolina and Senator Strom Thurmond of South Carolina, had urged him to take the lead on assistance to the Commonwealth of Independent States because no one else has done so.
"I think you're going to see bipartisan support for a number of things increased," Ambassador Strauss said.
Mr. Helms is the ranking Republican member of the Foreign Relations Committee, and Senator Thurmond is the ranking Republican on the Armed Services Subcommittee on Strategic Forces and Nuclear Deterrence.
Many members of Congress say that President Bush is apprehensive about pushing for more aid to the former Soviet republics because of criticism that he has paid too much attention to foreign policy and because of campaign pressures from his Republican opponent in the presidential primaries, Patrick Buchanan.
"This is going to require very aggressive leadership on the part of the President," said Representative David R. Obey, Democrat of Wisconsin, who heads the House Subcommittee on Foreign Operations. "I think the White House has been so rattled by Buchanan that they're bobbing and weaving on many issues, including this."
 
Averting a Coup
 Some Republican and Democratic leaders in Congress say the collapse of the East bloc and President Bush's foreign policy successes could be largely nullified if economic suffering brought an anti-Western Government to power in the former Soviet Union. Generous Western aid could go far in preventing a coup, they argue, and a coup could lead to an expensive rearming of the United States.
"If the President doesn't take a lead in this area, a vigorous lead in energizing his own executive branch and advocating these kinds of measures to Congress, he may end up winning the election but losing his place in history," Senator Sam Nunn, Democrat of Georgia, said in an interview. "The amount of money we're talking about is very small potatoes compared to what we will have to pay if democracy fails."
Senator Nunn, who is chairman of the Armed Services Committee, recently returned from Moscow with Senator Lugar, Senator Jeff Bingaman, Democrat of New Mexico, and Senator John W. Warner, Republican of Virginia. Mr. Bingaman is chairman of the Armed Services Subcommittee on Defense Industry and Technology and Mr. Warner is the ranking Republican member of the full committee.
The four lawmakers sent the President a report urging him to "do more, on a priority basis" in aid for Russia and the other republics.
Administration officials say that President Bush recently proposed $645 million more in aid to the former Soviet Union. This comes on top of $1.5 billion in assistance announced in November.
The Administration officials say that Treasury Secretary Nicholas F. Brady has repeatedly called on Congress to vote $12 billion to replenish the I.M.F. and that President Bush wrote to several members of Congress last year to seek support for such financing.
"Right now the Administration is looking at the whole aid picture toward Russia and the C.I.S. -- an in-depth look," said an Administration official who has followed the aid debate closely. "It's not being spurred by any criticism or suggestion. It's something that's been done off and on since the late fall of '91."
At a conference last week on foreign affairs sponsored by the Nixon Library, Mr. Bush agreed with the former President that Russia needed more aid, but he did not make the strong public appeal for billions in new aid that Mr. Nixon said was vital.
President Bush said Washington was considering a contribution to a fund to stabilize the ruble, but added that "we're living in a time of constrained resources" and "I don't have a blank check" for foreign aid.
Many liberals and conservatives had hoped that Mr. Bush would be more forthcoming after Mr. Nixon's remarks. "President Bush's remarks were a very weak response to a well-orchestrated effort by President Nixon," said Judy Shelton, an expert on the Soviet economy at the Hoover Institution. "It's urgent that Western nations help Russia have a sound currency."
 
Russia's Application
 A senior Treasury official said the United States was talking with other industrialized nations about setting up a fund to stabilize the ruble, but that Russia must first join the I.M.F. and gain its approval for an economic reform program. He said Russia and several other republics would probably join the fund around April 27, when the fund's spring meeting takes place.
I.M.F. officials suggest that $6 billion might be needed for a ruble stabilization fund. They estimate that Russia needs $12 billion in food aid and other assistance to meet its import requirements this year.
The Treasury official said the Administration wants to be sure that conditions are right before a ruble stabilization fund is set up.
He said that Russia has made substantial progress in reducing its budget deficit and reining in its money supply to meet the conditions for a ruble fund since January. But if the fund fails to stabilize the ruble, the official added, Western nations will lose billions of dollars trying to shore up the currency.
He said such a failure would be a harsh blow to the Russian economy and to future efforts to set up stabilization funds.
Administration officials say the $12 billion contribution to the I.M.F. should be approved soon because the delay is holding up an overall $60 billion funding increase for the organization.
A senior Treasury official said it was Congress that was dragging its feet on the I.M.F. aid. But Democrats, who remember being attacked by conservative Republicans in the 1980's for backing more I.M.F. aid, say they want Mr. Bush to take a visible role.
 
No Solace for Lip Readers
 "We have never heard the phrase 'I.M.F. replenishment' come off the President's lips," said a member of one Democratic Senator's staff.
Senator Alan K. Simpson, Republican of Wyoming, said: "It's an election year and when we go home, we're facing questions that we're giving too much to foreign aid. We have to go forward regardless of the criticisms and do what can be done to assist the commonwealth."
But not all Republicans supported Mr. Nixon's position. "There is only so many dollars we have and I think we have to take care of our commitments at home before we start sending more billions overseas," said Representative Toby Roth, Republican of Wisconsin.

HEADLINE: Coffee Growers Seek Limits

BYLINE: Reuters

DATELINE: MANAGUA, Nicaragua, March 15

 BODY:
Central American coffee producers will meet with a trade official of the United States on Monday to push for Washington's support for new international coffee quotas.
The Central Americans will meet in Washington with Myles Frechette, the assistant trade representative for Latin America, the Caribbean and Africa, to discuss negotiating positions in anticipation of the International Coffee Organization meeting in London on April 6. 
 "What we want is for there to be no doubt about what the United States is going to say in London," the president of Nicaragua's coffee commission, David Robleto, said.
The United States, the world's biggest coffee market, has always opposed renewal of export limits, saying the free market should set prices.
The Central Americans, by contrast, want to make it clear that they are unified in their support for new export limits, which would replace the previous pact that collapsed in July 1989. Coffee is a major source of export income throughout the region.
"There should be no doubt that Central American countries and Latin American countries have come out in favor of market regulation," Mr. Robleto said. Brazil last week dropped its opposition to an international coffee accord, removing a big roadblock to a price agreement.
Central American countries have seen their fragile economies battered by falling coffee prices, which dropped to 17-year lows last month for the region's mild Arabica coffee.

HEADLINE: Dismal Section of Brighton Beach Resists Revival Efforts

BYLINE: By MARY B. W. TABOR

 BODY:
Pat Singer marched down the Brighton Beach side street, her white spangled cowboy boots clicking, her voice tight with frustration as she performing triage on the row of Archie Bunker-style houses.
"There are still drugs over there," she said, throwing a hand toward a cluster of run-down homes. "That one looks much better, but you never know," she said at another. Ms. Singer then stopped at a house at 3053 Brighton Fifth Street. "It's going to go back the way it was," she said. "Just look at it." 
 For the last 15 years, Ms. Singer, director of the Brighton Neighborhood Association, and her tiny band of workers have waged hundreds of housing battles in this ocean side community, fighting crime and inattentive landlords by organizing tenant groups in the tall brick apartment buildings that stand between Brighton Beach Avenue and the Boardwalk.
Crusading on the other side of Brighton Beach Avenue has not been so easy.
There, rows of modest, wood-frame houses -- once homes to well-to-do families -- have been converted into single-room occupancy dwellings as a kind of housing of last resort for unemployed, elderly or mentally handicapped people, most of whom subsist on welfare payments.
 
A Struggle for the Streets
 A few of the estimated 200 to 300 S.R.O.'s here are neatly kept. Many, especially those along Brighton Fourth, Fifth and Sixth Streets, are not. Absentee landlords have let the houses fall apart, leaving them as magnets for crack dealers and prostitutes who slip in and out of the most battered-looking buildings at night.
Ms. Singer and her group have tried repeatedly to reclaim this area, one of the last trouble spots in an otherwise reviving neighborhood. But the defeats keep coming.
"It's like spitting into the wind," she says.
Sitting in her office, surrounded by signs reading "Wonder Woman Works Here" and "Redheads are sexier," Ms. Singer kicks her boots up on her desk and tells of her struggle for those streets.
Almost a decade ago, with the help of $150,000 in loans and grants from private and public agencies, the association began a program to renovate and convert the most dilapidated S.R.O.'s into owner-occupied one-, two- and three-family homes. Promoting ownership would help stabilize the neighborhood, Ms. Singer reasoned. With a portion of the borrowed money, the group bought three crumbling S.R.O.'s.
 
'Through the Back Door'
 The members began with some success: One house was completed in 1985 and sold for $108,000 to Edward Lee, a local restaurant owner. But later that year, during work on the next house, the house went up in flames; a result, Ms. Singer says, of illegal drug activity there.
Mr. Lee weathered five years in the neighborhood, during which he was robbed and barraged by the sound of gunfire in the streets, until he could take no more. He sold the house and moved to Sheepshead Bay. "The house was pretty good," he said, "but there were a lot of problems in the neighborhood."
Meanwhile, discouraged about the prospects of getting more loans, the neighborhood association began trying another tack. This time, Ms. Singer sought to have one of her employees appointed by the city to be the administrator of a house where the landlord had failed to pay utility bills and had let the house fall into shambles.
That was 3053 Brighton Fifth; it was 1989.
"I thought if we can't get in the front door, we'll go in the back door," says Ms. Singer.
 
Tackling Basic Needs
 For months, said Sara Jones, the association's housing worker, the 16 people living in the house, most of them immigrants from Mexico and Puerto Rico, had dipped into their welfare money to pay the house's oil and electric bills. Crack dealers, who had taken over the basement, prompted regular raids by the police.
After more than a year of legal proceedings, Ms. Jones was given control of the house and the rent roll. Using that money, about $1,500 a month, she joined the tenants and began tackling basic needs. First heat and hot water. Then new gas lines for the stove. With the crack dealers run out, progress was being made.
Last September, however, the association's efforts were foiled again. The house's owner had failed to pay property taxes for the third year in a row, so 3053 Brighton Fifth Street was turned over to the city's Department of Housing, Preservation and Development.
Now, the house's tenants said, while they have heat and electricity, their progress has been severely stunted.
Since the city took over six months ago, no repairs have been made, said Monseratte Santiago, a tenant who greets visitors at the bullet-battered door. Using her plastic yellow flashlight to make her way through the halls, she points out the sources of what she says are almost daily complaints to the city.
 
Beyond Essential Services
 In most of the house, where tenants share one- and two-room apartments and hallway bathrooms, paint is falling from the ceiling in large chunks. In the upstairs bathroom, sections of the wall have become waterlogged. When it rains, broken gutters leave water to stream down the inside wall of the house.
"I called them about these things and they said they would be here the next day," Ms. Santiago said. "That was 15 days ago."
Downstairs, Ms. Santiago's sister, Migdalia Alequin, and her 5-year-old nephew live in a tiny two-room apartment where pink toilet tissue is crammed into gaps in the wall to keep cold air out. "Twice a day I have to clean the apartment because of the dust and paint that falls from the ceiling," Ms. Alequin said.
Roz Post, a spokeswoman for the housing department, said the house had 243 pending violations, a quarter of them marked "serious." About $24,000 had been spent on emergency repairs, she said. But she said the city's responsibility was to insure that the house had "essential services" like heat and hot water. As for other problems, "the building has just been in the system too short a time to have been assessed," she said.
But in what could be seen as a small victory for the association, Ms. Santiago and the other tenants have continued renovations on their own, with money from their welfare checks.
In the meantime, the association has picked itself up, brushed itself off and found another house to try to whip into shape: one block over on Brighton Fourth Street.

HEADLINE: THE 1992 CAMPAIGN: Policy;
Debate on Taxes and Trade Grows Intense in Rust Belt

BYLINE: By DAVID E. ROSENBAUM, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: DETROIT, March 15

 BODY:
In their television commercials, debates and stump speeches in Michigan and Illinois, the Democratic Presidential candidates degrade each others' economic platforms as the basis for disaster.
Former Senator Paul E. Tsongas says Gov. Bill Clinton has no interest in expanding the economic pie, only in distributing increasingly smaller slices more evenly. Mr. Clinton says that Mr. Tsongas is a patsy for Wall Street and that former Gov. Edmund G. Brown Jr. favors higher taxes for the middle class and deep tax cuts for the rich. 
 Mr. Brown, a free-trader during his days as Governor of California, now espouses the protectionist line and says Mr. Clinton and Mr. Tsongas will do nothing about American jobs being shipped overseas.
 
Agreements Are Buried
 No matter that the three Democrats agree on fundamental economic precepts much more than they disagree. On the most critical political-economic principle, whether the Government should aggressively try to guide the nation's economy or take a hands-off approach and rely on the marketplace as President Bush and most other Republicans prefer, the Democrats all support an active Government role.
But in the primary season, the Democratic candidates seem to feel obliged to bury their agreements, especially on the economy and most especially here in the Rust Belt, where the state of the economy is the overarching issue of this year's campaign.
The unemployment rate last month was 9 percent in Michigan and 8.5 percent in Illinois, well above the 7.3 percent national average, and no relief is in sight.
In Michigan, the General Motors Corporation is closing several big automobile plants. The shutdown of the Chevrolet Caprice factory at Willow Run, southwest of Detroit, will alone cost the state nearly 15,000 jobs within three years, according to a study at Eastern Michigan University.
 
'Real Sense of Hopelessness'
 The picture in Illinois is little better. In the last three months of 1991, the state lost 20,000 jobs, including more than 3,000 at Midway Airlines, which folded in December. On a frigid day in January, 9,000 people stood in line for hours to apply for 500 jobs, some paying as little as $5 an hour, being offered at a new Sheraton Hotel in Chicago.
Robert Kahle, a poll taker at Wayne State University here, said he had never before found such pervasive despair. "You get a real sense of hopelessness, of anger," Professor Kahle said. "People are divided. They're unsure. They're disaffected."
What this means for politics generally and for Tuesday's Democratic primaries in particular is uncertain. William Ballenger, the editor of Inside Michigan Politics, a newsletter in Lansing, said many voters might be so disaffected that they simply would not go to the polls.
But the bitterness over the flagging economy could lead people not only to vote but also to do so in unexpected ways. For example, Dave Hannis, a Detroit bus driver, said that he normally voted Republican but that he had switched his registration this year so he could vote for Mr. Brown. He decided to do that, Mr. Hannis said, after a relative's job as a truck driver was jeopardized by the movement of manufacturing companies to Mexico.
"Brown's the only one who says he will stand up to that," Mr. Hannis said.
Until recently, Mr. Brown had said little about trade policy. But then Senator Tom Harkin of Iowa, the favorite of the United Automobile Workers and most other labor unions here, dropped out of the race, as did Senator Bob Kerrey of Nebraska, the other Democrat who was pushing hard for trade restrictions.
Mr. Brown seized the opportunity and for the first time in the campaign, he began pressing a specific issue and not just relying on his general theme that the whole political system is corrupt. His motto became, "Keep Michigan jobs in Michigan."
Mr. Clinton and Mr. Tsongas, the former Massachusetts Senator, are advocates of free trade. Like almost all mainstream economists, they say trade restrictions would damage the country's economy.
But whatever its advantages for the country as a whole, particular places, like Michigan, are hurt by free trade. The poor economic condition of the state and its main industry, automobiles, is due in large part to Japanese imports. And while no one outside the company knows for sure why G.M. decided to close the Willow Run plant and leave a similar one open in Arlington, Tex., the prevailing view, said Mordechai Kreinin, an economist at Michigan State University, is that the company wants the assembly work done nearer Mexico, where G.M. hopes to take advantage of a cheaper work force.
 
Differences With Labor
 So Mr. Brown became an outspoken opponent of the fast-track authority under which Congress is allowing President Bush to negotiate a free-trade agreement with Mexico. Congress will be able only to vote the final trade pact up or down, not to object to particular items. Otherwise, negotiation of a trade agreement would probably be impossible.
In a state where Democratic politics is dominated by labor unions, Mr. Tsongas has come under fire for opposing legislation that would prohibit companies from hiring permanent replacements for striking workers. Mr. Clinton has been criticized because as Governor of Arkansas he has never really tried to rid his state of its "right-to-work" law, which outlaws labor contracts that require workers to belong to a union.
The emphasis this week on trade and other issues of special interest to organized labor has overshadowed what until now had been the main point of economic dispute: tax policy.
 
New Taxes or Tax Cuts
 Mr. Clinton and Mr. Tsongas both favor raising taxes on the rich, usually described as those with incomes above about $200,000 a year. But while Mr. Clinton would use the additional revenue to give a 10 percent tax cut to the middle class, Mr. Tsongas would reduce the tax on capital gains and give several tax breaks to businesses to spur manufacturing.
Mr. Tsongas argues that economic growth is more important than fairness in the tax code and that a favorable climate for business is essential to such growth. Mr. Clinton maintains that the best way to get the economy growing is for the Government to promote better education and training for workers.
Mr. Brown advocates scrapping the current tax system and replacing it with a 13 percent flat tax on the income of all individuals and businesses and a 13 percent value-added tax, a kind of national sales tax prominent in Europe. When questioners observe that such a system would force poor people to pay much more in taxes than they do now, Mr. Brown talks vaguely about credits and other devices to make his plan more equitable.

HEADLINE: The House Bank;
House Bank Overdrafts Add to Voters' Outrage

BYLINE: By JEFFREY SCHMALZ, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: CHICAGO, March 15

 BODY:
Drowning in a sea of overdrawn checks, exhausted members of Congress returned to their home districts this weekend only to be met at the door by a public shouting a giant collective "Gotcha!"
To be sure, not everyone joined the chorus, arguing that the outcry over the checks was much ado about nothing or that it took away from the real issues. But overwhelmingly -- in more than 100 interviews around the nation, in editorials and call-in shows and jokes -- the voices spoke of scorn and outrage. Many took the overdrafts as a personal insult, as a sign that Washington politicians thought they could put one over on the rubes back home. 
 "How could they think they could get away with this?" asked Flo Burkholder, 54, a Republican in Wauconda, about 35 miles west of here. "They think it's just a bunch of little people out in the country who will never know."
 
Smoking Gun
 In Texas, Eunice Alleman, who lives near Houston, said: "It galls people. It just really galls them."
Through the outrage and anger ran a thread of mischievous satisfaction: for Americans who suspected all along that those incumbents in Washington were up to no good, now there was a smoking gun.
"This is more of the same," said Allen Jason, a 42-year-old lawyer in Chicago. "It fits the pattern of voting themselves pay raises in the middle of the night. All they care about is themselves. Now at least they got called on this one. All right!"
Michael Leonard, an art critic and writer in San Francisco, said, "There's a lot of abuse and arrogance and misuse of power and this is just one of the issues."
Labeled as laughingstocks and as disgraces, some members of Congress confronted the issue head on, some said that they had been misunderstood, that they had always been in favor of disclosing the names of the overdraft writers. Really.
 
'Out of Touch'
 Others chose simply to lie low. And there was plenty from which to lie low as a new word took hold in the American political lexicon: "Rubbergate."
A Boston Globe editorial dismissed the affair as "a pocket embarrassment, not really a scandal at all," saying the public leaped on it because it could understand it.
An editorial in The Seattle Times said that the actions of Thomas S. Foley, the Speaker of the House, "are disturbingly like those of politicians out of touch with the everyday life of the people they represent."
That was a theme picked up throughout the country, including in a Miami Herald editorial that cited "justified public outrage."
An editorial in The Los Angeles Times said, "Americans are tired of politicians being out of touch with common-sense principles."
On radio call-in shows, the tone was irate. "This issue is really going to open the floodgates on the term limitations thing," said one male caller to KGO radio in San Francisco. A Cincinnati woman who called the Larry King show said, "There should be a special prosecutor."
 
Voter Reaction
 That weather vane of American public opinion, Johnny Carson, could barely contain himself Friday night on "The Tonight Show." "Folks, you've got to hand it to our House of Representatives," he said, just for starters. "They finally passed something: 5,000 bad checks."
A poll for Newsweek magazine, conducted Friday, found that 78 percent of 513 adults interviewed would be unlikely to re-elect their member of Congress if they were among the worst of the overdraft writers. The poll had a margin of sampling error of plus or minus five percentage points.
With such an outcry, it's no wonder that even members of Congress who say they had no overdrafts -- the full list won't be released until the first week of April -- took to the campaign trail to defend themselves.
A local Republican gathering in the American Legion Hall in Wauconda amounted to a virtual celebration, with Republicans patting themselves on the backs because their party was responsible for few of the overdrafts. "It sure cuts well for the Republicans," said James Eschenbauch, 44, a carpenter.
 
'Here's My Checkbook'
 But the local congressman, Philip M. Crane, knows that the issue could work against all incumbents, including those like him who say they had no overdrafts and who pressed early for disclosure of the full list. At the meeting, Mr. Crane, who faces a challenger in the Republican primary on Tuesday, gives out literature proclaiming, "I am NOT among the congressmen who wrote bad checks."
That hasn't stopped his opponent, Gary Skoien, from milking the issue anyway. At campaign stops, he reaches into his pocket. "Here's my checkbook," he says. "I just brought it along to show you I haven't bounced any checks."
In Lowell, Mass., Michael Conway goes Mr. Skoien one better. Running for the seat of Chester G. Atkins, a Democrat who has admitted to overdrawing his House Bank account, he took to restaurants this weekend, passing out rubber checks.
"Rubbergate isn't only about bouncing checks," Mr. Conway told voters. "It's about greed and abuse of power."
 
'Part of the Coverup'
 In Chicago, Representative Dan Rostenkowski, a Democrat, is facing a primary fight on Tuesday after reapportionment moved an enclave of reform-minded yuppies into his blue-collar district. His opponent, Dick Simpson, campaigned vigorously over the weekend, attacking Mr. Rostenkowski, the chairman of the Ways and Means Committee, as part of a House leadership that sought to block revealing the names of all members of Congress who overdrew their House Bank accounts.
"Rostenkowski is part of the coverup," he said at a rally. "We need a whole new group of congressmen who won't put up with this."
Mr. Rostenkowski has released a letter from Jack Russ, who oversaw the House Bank, saying there was no problem with the Representative's checks. But Mr. Simpson isn't convinced. Indeed, several members of Congress who received such letters and thought they were clear have found out they are not.
In Texas, Representative Jack Fields said he had received such a letter, but realized on Tuesday, when the coding on checks was explained to him, that some of his checks had exceeded the amount of money in his account. He had planned to bring it up at a town meeting he had scheduled for today. But virtually no one turned up. And when Mr. Fields did bring it up, Milton Lusk, a Jacinto City Councilman, said, "I don't want to hear about that," preferring instead to talk about the safety program of a local company.
 
The Bank's Fault
 Other members of Congress were not so lucky. WPLG, the Miami ABC affiliate, led its 6 P.M. newscast Friday with its chief political reporter chasing Representative Lawrence J. Smith, a Democrat from Hollywood, Fla., through an airport concourse. Mr. Smith said last week that he had not overdrawn his account. By Wednesday night he had changed his answer to "no comment." And by Friday he was suggesting that he had overdrawn his account but that it was the bank's fault.
It was not clear how the voter anger will translate at the polls. Voters have a history of complaining in general about Congress yet loyally re-electing their own Representative. For many, angry as they were, the decision seemed to rest on how big the abuse, on how contrite the lawmaker. Sensing that, many politicians issued apologies.
Representative Barbara Boxer, a California Democrat who listed 87 overdrafts and is running for the United States Senate, issued a statement that "in painful retrospect, I clearly should have paid more attention to my account."
She said she had written a check to the Deficit Reduction Fund of the United States Treasury representing the $15 that a regular bank would have charged for each overdraft.
"I'd be willing to accept one or two bounced checks," said Milton Rosen, an architect in Detroit. "And they'd better be pretty sorry about it."
Whether individual members of Congress survive or not, the damage is already done. For many Americans, the check disclosures seemed to be just another step in the decline of faith in government, just another symbol of a government that can't keep its own house in order, let alone the whole nation's.
"They're holding those big offices up there," said Lou Blackshear, who works as a maid in the Houston area. "They should be able to keep their books straight."
Allen Shaffer, a bookstore owner in Birmingham, Ala., said: "It's their playhouse. They're going to run it anyway they want."
George Fenning, a high-school teacher in Cleveland, Ohio, said: "You wonder why we can't get the economy on line, why the country is in debt. Just look at who's running things."

HEADLINE: METRO MATTERS;
Thinking About De Facto Apartheid

BYLINE: By Sam Roberts

 BODY:
MAYOR DAVID N. DINKINS rarely reads for enjoyment, but while recovering from diverticulitis last week he graciously selected an Ed McBain novel about legal injustice that was proffered from New York Hospital's library cart. For his next literary indulgence, the Mayor should choose another book about injustice: "Two Nations," Andrew Hacker's unsanitized study of racial division. Unfortunately, it's nonfiction.
Not that Mr. Dinkins, after living in New York, New Jersey and Washington, will learn much more about what it means to be black in America. What he might absorb from this analysis, though, are the emotional and intellectual underpinnings of white prejudice, presented non-judgmentally by a white who shows he can share a black perspective without being patronizing. Most disturbing about Mr. Hacker's book, as demonstrated by the quotations below, is how profoundly black and white perspectives can differ, even when race may be less valid as a characteristic than many people think. 
 America's version of apartheid, while lacking overt legal sanction, comes closest to the system even now being reformed in the land of its invention.
In "Two Nations -- Black and White, Separate, Hostile, Unequal" (Charles Scribner's Sons, 1992), Mr. Hacker, a professor at Queens College of the City University of New York and formerly at Cornell, avoid political convention. He suggests that while black racists abound, too, "no white person can claim to have suffered in such ways because of ideas that may be held about them by some black citizens." He writes that "if more black felons end up in prison cells, not the least reason is that they lacked office-based opportunities" to commit white-collar crimes, but adds, "Through crime, blacks are paying whites back, in the most ominous way they can."
What every black American knows, and whites should try to imagine, is how it feels to have an unfavorable -- and unfair -- identity imposed on you every waking day.
If Mr. Dinkins rarely suggests that he is being treated differently by the media, who doubts that he generally believes it? He would define differently as worse. Few gut responses demonstrate the rift between the races more than that so many whites agree he has been treated differently, but often better than he deserved.
Warring in the minds of Jeffersonians, both in his time and ours, is the hope that blacks are equal -- accompanied by the suspicion that they are not.
Few New Yorkers feel they control their own destiny; whites, shrinking proportionately, are becoming more edgy. White economic and social power is largely unchallenged; political control is up for grabs. That makes next year's mayoral campaign more vulnerable to a divisive racial overlay. Can reasonable people oppose Mr. Dinkins without being branded racists? In 1989, he ran on hope. If he runs in 1993, voters may measure his record against hopes raised by his rivals.
You realize that your presence makes whites uncomfortable; most of them probably wish you were not there at all. But since you are, they want to see you smile, so they can believe that you are being treated well. Not only is an upbeat air expected, but you must never show exasperation or anger, let alone anything that could look like a chip on your shoulder.
Mr. Hacker distills computer-generated statistics to deflate several misconceptions about welfare. He explains that the ratio of black single-parent families to white ones has remained fairly steady. (Half of all black and Hispanic single mothers collect public assistance; so do about a third of white single mothers.)
He mischievously wonders whether anti-abortion groups "wish a steep rise in the black birth rate, which could very well happen were abortions to be made illegal." Also, why "people who criticize middle-class career women because they see little of their children, have no compunctions about insisting that poorer women should leave their youngsters for the day and go off to work."
No white American, including those who insist that opportunities exist for persons of every race, would change places with even the most successful black American. . . . Even when black men reach the same academic level as white men, their incomes stay several steps behind. . . . Perhaps most revealing of all is the small number of black dental hygienists. While white patients seem willing to be cared for by black nurses, they apparently draw the line at having black fingers in their mouths.
A recent New York Times/WCBS-TV News survey found that blacks and whites in the region differed on whether whites would be welcome in black neighborhoods after dark and vice versa. Their assessment of government services also diverged: blacks even rated drinking water worse than whites did.
A politics purposively permeated by race has consolidated enough white Americans as a self-conscious racial majority. This is not to say that they are bigots or reactionaries. It is rather that they feel threatened, not always in ways they understand.
Mr. Dinkins's challenge is to understand himself. Then to help all his constituents overcome.

HEADLINE: Rural New York County Has Unlikely Manufacturing Revival

BYLINE: By THOMAS J. LUECK, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: HORSEHEADS, N.Y., March 13

 BODY:
Something strange has happened in the lushly forested hills here, 30 miles southwest of Ithaca, where one of the highest concentrations of shuttered factories in the Northeast had come to resemble a rust-laden museum of heavy industry. The museum has come to life.
Inspired first in the mid-1980's by a huge investment from Toshiba Inc., the Japanese conglomerate, plants have reopened, assembly lines have been automated, and machine shops are suddenly abuzz in a manufacturing revival. 
 "It's come through a combination of good luck and hard work, and things have snowballed," said Frank M. Surdey, regional economist for the New York State Department of Labor, who said manufacturing employment in Horseheads, Elmira and elsewhere in Chemung County has increased by more than 20 percent since 1985.
The upturn is perhaps no more than a blip on the rural landscape, while factories in New York, New Jersey, Connecticut and the nation continue to fall prey to the recession and foreign competition. And Chemung County is not immune. After robust expansion for four years, many of its factories and machine shops began laying off workers last year, and the downturn has accelerated since January. The showcase Toshiba plant is still operating at a deep loss.
But despite the setbacks, a sense of optimism seems to pervade plant floors and family gatherings, and stems from long historical roots.
 
Incubator of Industrial Muscle
 It was here, beginning early in the century, that American industry established an incubator of manufacturing muscle. Fed by rail lines and waves of skilled immigrant labor, the United States Steel Corporation, the General Electric Company and more than a dozen other industrial concerns built plants.
Almost all were abandoned in cascades of layoffs, financial misery and broken families that culminated in the mid-1980's.
"It was a desperate time," said Donald Loomis, 40 years old, who spent eight months without a job in 1987, nearly losing his house. His employer, a foundry, had followed the valve fabricators, fire hydrant makers and other Chemung County companies it supplied into extinction.
Now Mr. Loomis and his wife, Ronda, both work at Chemung County's largest company, Toshiba Display Devices, Inc. In a plant that had been long abandoned, the Japanese company has invested more than $200 million and now employs 1,300 people. The plant's main product is oversized picture tubes for expensive televisions, a market that is itself being battered by the recession and global competition.
Economists and industry analysts say the mini-revival of Chemung County, fueled in part by business incentives from New York State, may offer a case study for those trying to reinvigorate industry elsewhere.
It also demonstrates how a Japanese conglomerate can become central to the welfare of small American communities, even as complaints about predatory Japanese business practices are a recurrent political theme across the country.
"This recession, like all those that have occurred before it, will pass," said Yoshio Aono, president of Toshiba Display Devices, and one of five executives from Tokyo who run the Horseheads plant with five American managers.
 
Accepts Union Proposal
 The company said its sales were far below its own projections, and last month announced production cuts. But it shocked many people here by accepting a union proposal in which workers are encouraged to take one day each week off without pay, but are not forced to do so. At the same time, no one is being laid off.
"They have always treated us well in times of economic hardship," said Roxanne Barnstead, a jocular mechanic in the Toshiba plant known here as Rocky, who is president of Local 1632 of the International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers.
When Toshiba made its first investment here in 1985, reopening the Horseheads plant in a joint venture with the Westinghouse Electric Corporation, union officials said they feared that the newly arrived Japanese executives would fight any form of union. But the plant was quickly organized without management objections.
Elsewhere in Chemung County, workers have found new options at other manufacturers.
One is ABB Traction Inc., a subsidiary of a Swiss conglomerate that makes railroad cars and equipment. It bought a long-abandoned United States Steel plant last year in Elmira Heights. It has hired 600 workers to fill contracts from New Jersey Transit, the city of Baltimore and other large customers.
 
'Picking Themselves Up'
 Makers of helicopters, athletic equipment and novelty merchandise have also opened or expanded over the last five years.
"I don't think there is any place in the country where people have done such a remarkable job picking themselves up by their own bootstraps," said Robert Bivens, president of Southern Tier Economic Growth, a group of Chemung County boosters.
State business incentives have been distributed generously here. The state provided low-rate loans and job-training grants worth $7 million to Toshiba and Westinghouse for its partnership in 1985, and since then, 44 smaller manufacturers in the county have received incentives worth $9.6 million, according to the state's Urban Development Corporation.
The upturn in Chemung "has enhanced the entire state's ability to attract foreign and domestic manufacturing jobs," Gov. Mario M. Cuomo said in October when he went to Tokyo. He made it a point to visit senior executives of Toshiba there.
Executives say the resilience of this area as a manufacturing center rests mainly on resources that have been here for more than 50 years, through good times and bad. Abandoned plants still litter the landscape and can be bought cheap, and generations of experienced laborers are still looking for opportunities.
"We found the right production site, a skilled labor force and a high work ethic," said Joyce Baginski, a spokesperson for ABB Traction.
Still, the shadow of the recession is not far away. At the Toshiba plant and other companies, posters at the entrances say no new job applications are being accepted.
And despite their warm relations, the courtship between this rural outpost and the Japanese could sour.
"The Japanese have their limits, and Toshiba is not going to keep that plant open just to employ 1,300 workers," said Schon Beechler, a professor of international management at Columbia Business School. "I would not be all that comfortable if their market does not pick up soon."
The company's biggest investment has been to retool its plant for production of television screens 27 inches to 35 inches in diameter, most of them assembled into finished sets at another of its plants, in Tennessee. Priced at $700 to over $2,000, the televisions have captured a tiny share of the United States market, even though Toshiba is meeting new competition from American plants run by Matsushita Electric and other Japanese concerns.
But analysts said the Toshiba workers here were more secure than they might be under traditional United States corporate practices, because of the long-term planning used by Japanese companies, including Toshiba. They have been willing to invest vast amounts in advanced electronic products for years to serve their strategic purpose of establishing large new markets.
"In a recession, I'd put my chips on a Japanese company," Ms. Beechler said.
Toshiba's venture in Horseheads has never been smooth. After false starts and differences over strategy, Toshiba bought out Westinghouse's interest in the plant in 1987, retooled with automated machinery designed in Japan, and hired 400 more workers. The company is offering no assurances to Chemung County that it can avert layoffs.
But workers here say that, at least for now, life has returned to normal after a brush with economic ruin.
"You can go to work, pay your bills, and live an ordinary life," said Mr. Loomis. "That in itself is big improvement for this area."

HEADLINE: Press Notes;
U.P.I. Seems to Be Nearing A Moment of Truth Again

BYLINE: By ALEX S. JONES

 BODY:
Beleaguered United Press International seems once again to be approaching a moment of truth.
Earlier this month, Judge Francis G. Conrad of the Federal Bankruptcy Court in Manhattan said that U.P.I. seemed to have enough cash to continue operating only through April, and he threw open the legal gates to allow anyone to make a bid to save the news agency. 
 "At a certain price, we believe someone will acquire U.P.I.," said Dennis M. O'Dea, counsel for the creditors committee, who added that if any prospective buyers had been hesitating, the moment to make an offer was at hand. He said U.P.I. needed to find a buyer within 60 days.
U.P.I., once one of the largest and most competitive news-gathering agencies in the world, declared bankruptcy in August for the second time, and since then its management has been frantically trying to find a buyer or investor.
The Bankruptcy Court allowed the management one extension on its allotted 120 days of exclusive right to come up with a reorganization plan, but earlier this month, the court refused a second extension.
Now, anyone is free to file a reorganization plan that would rescue U.P.I., which a decade ago competed around the globe with its archrival, The Associated Press.
While the withering of U.P.I. has diminished what had been one of the principal streams of information flowing to the nation's news organizations, its role has been filled by The Associated Press and a host of supplemental news services that have grown rapidly in the last decade. Among these are the news services of Knight-Ridder, The New York Times, Gannett, and a joint venture of The Los Angeles Times and The Washington Post. In addition, Reuters, the British news service, has expanded its coverage of the United States.
"We're not trying to compete with The Associated Press anymore, except on certain stories," said Al Rossiter Jr., who has been with U.P.I. for 32 years and has led the news service's news operation since 1987.
Mr. Rossiter said that U.P.I. was losing about $100,000 a month and that the company must find a bridge loan or an investor or face extinction.
In any event, Friday was Mr. Rossiter's last day.
Like many other "Unipressers," as U.P.I. news staff call themselves, he elected to take another job and will become director of the Duke University news service.
Mr. Rossiter said U.P.I.'s news staff now has about half the 850 full-time employees it had in 1987.
But Mr. Rossiter said that the agency was still providing a service and that its network of 80 foreign and domestic bureaus was a franchise too valuable to go under.
"We've been in as precarious a position, if not more so, in the past," Mr. Rossiter said. "And we've survived one way or another."
But Mr. Rossiter, who is 56 years old and had his pension frozen three years ago because of U.P.I.'s desperate financial straits, said he felt he had no choice but to leave.
 
Guild Effort in Los Angeles
 For the first time, the Newspaper Guild has begun a full-scale effort to organize The Los Angeles Times, the nation's largest nonunion newspaper.
Jim Smith, administrative officer of the Los Angeles Newspaper Guild, said that for decades The Times's wages and benefits had been so superior to other area newspapers that the Guild had not made the effort.
Mr. Smith said that last November The Times laid off some part-time employees in the mailroom and that there were complaints about pay cuts and arbitrary transfers.
Citing declines in advertising from a depressed economy in the last 18 months, the paper has reduced its full-time work force by about 1,000, to 7,600, through attrition, a hiring freeze and a voluntary early-retirement program.
The result has been "a surge of interest," Mr. Smith said.
The effort thus far is to get signatures requesting a union election from one-third of the employees in the job categories the Guild is seeking to represent, as required by labor law.
Mr. Smith said that conceivably the Guild could represent roughly 5,500 Times employees in news, advertising, circulation, transportation and the mailroom but could hold an election that involved only one or a combination of them.
Mr. Smith declined to say how many employees had signed cards, but he predicted a vote before the end of the year.
To help make the Guild's case, the union arranged for a visit from Juan Gonzalez, a columnist at The Daily News in New York, who was a prominent leader during the strike that ended a year ago.
In February, the International Brotherhood of Teamsters lost an election to represent mailroom employees by about 4 to 1. Laura Morgan, a Times spokeswoman, said that the paper was making every effort to maintain its nonunion status.
For instance, in January the paper approved a 4 percent wage increase, which is considered quite generous in such tight economic times.
 
A Nonunion Project
 On the flip side of the union record, a longtime adviser and confidant of New York City's newspaper unions has become a newspaper publisher -- of a nonunion daily.
Theodore W. Kheel, who has helped mediate newspaper union strikes and other crises since 1963, is publisher of The Earth Summit Times, which appears five days each week and has a circulation of about 7,000.
But this particular daily, which is provided without charge, is scheduled to cease publication April 3 after 30 issues.
Mr. Kheel said The Earth Summit Times had been created to draw attention to the planning meeting at the United Nations for the United Nations Conference on the Environment, a major environmental summit scheduled for Rio de Janiero in June.
The staff ranges from Don DeMaio, the executive editor, who worked at The National, the defunct sports daily, to Gerard Piel, long associated with Scientific American, who is editor of the opinion pages.
"It's nonunion, but we're willing to be organized," Mr. Kheel said.
 
Alphabet Soup Mix
 The newspaper industry's effort to streamline eight support organizations into one grand association has been a messy job, with false starts, confusion and infighting.
The objective of such a consolidation is to eliminate duplicated work done by the various organizations and also to reduce the costs of papers now paying membership dues for up to eight organizations.
There is little doubt that the merger will take place and that on April 24 the N.A.A. (Newspaper Association of America) will be voted into existence.
But it has not been pretty.
Last year, the N.A.B. (Newspaper Advertising Bureau) announced plans to merge this July 1 with six related marketing associations known within the industry as the alphabet soups: A.N.C.A.M. (Association of Newspaper Classified Advertising Managers), I.C.M.A. (International Circulation Managers Association) and -- similarly -- the I.N.A.M.E., I.N.M.A., N.A.C.N., and N.R.C., all related to marketing and advertising.
This merged creature was to be called N.M.I. (Newspaper Marketing Inc.)
But in January, plans for N.M.I. were scrapped in favor of an even bigger merger that would include the A.N.P.A. (American Newspaper Publishers Association).
The new product of this mega-merger was to have been called the A.N.A. (American Newspaper Association).
But it turned out that there was another A.N.A., so to avoid confusion a new name had to be found. The A.A.N. (Association of American Newspapers) was considered, but rejected.
Finally, N.A.A. (Newspaper Association of America) was settled upon.
Meanwhile, there was another problem.
One reason for the merger was the feeling by many of the major newspaper groups that some chains, mostly of small papers, were not bearing their fair share of the cost of supporting the industry organizations.
For instance, while the Gannett Company, the Times-Mirror Company and other major chains paid membership for each of their papers, some chains might have only one or two papers as paying members but still have all their top executives taking part in conventions and deriving other benefits of membership, like libel insurance.
Many of those planning the new organization wanted to include a rule that membership in the N.A.A. would be an all-or-nothing proposition; either all a chain's papers were members, or the chain would be excluded.
But the small chains made it clear that in an all-or-nothing situation they would choose nothing or maybe the N.N.A. (National Newspaper Association), which mostly has non-dailies as members but includes some dailies.
The planners decided they could not make the all-or-nothing rule stick, and the final plan allows a chain to join on whatever basis it chooses. Peer pressure will be applied to encourage them to make all their papers members.
 
A Buy Recommendation
 Lee Dirks, one of the nation's major newspaper brokers, has provided one more sign that the newspaper business may be improving.
Last week, he sent a letter to clients and prospective clients urging them to buy a newspaper.
Last year, only 18 newspapers were sold, making 1991 the worst year for newspaper sales since Mr. Dirks began keeping records 20 years ago. And 1990 was third worst, with 25 sales.
But Mr. Dirks said he was encouraged by lower interest rates, relaxed lending and tax regulations, a faint improvement in advertising and a lot of pent-up demand from both buyers and sellers.
"We don't foresee a return to the extremely strong prices of the late 1980's anytime soon," Mr. Dirks said, "but we think prices have reached the bottom of the trough and will begin firming very soon. To us, that means one thing: now is the time to buy."

HEADLINE: Second-in-Command at Tenneco

BYLINE: By THOMAS C. HAYES, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: DALLAS, March 15

 BODY:
Struggling to recover from a huge loss last year, Tenneco Inc. has again turned to a senior executive from another big manufacturing company to bolster its top management.
The diversified industrial company said today that Dana G. Mead, an executive vice president of the International Paper Company and a retired Army colonel who wrote several sections of the Pentagon Papers in the late 1960's, would become the chief operating officer and a director at Tenneco on April 1. Mr. Mead, 56 years old, will add the president's title in May. 
 Since September, Tenneco has been led by Michael H. Walsh, a tough-minded chief executive who came to the company after five years as the head of the Union Pacific Railroad.
 
Two Late Starters
 In Mr. Walsh and Mr. Mead, Tenneco, the nation's 38th-largest industrial corporation, has a pair of leaders who got a comparatively late start in their corporate careers.
A Yale-educated lawyer, Mr. Walsh was the United States Attorney for the Southern District of California in San Diego when, at age 38, he was lured into a management post with the Cummins Engine Company. In 1978, Mr. Mead, then 42, resigned from a tenured professorship at the United States Military Academy to join International Paper as a project director.
Mr. Walsh, 49, has pledged a quick turnaround for Tenneco, which lost $732 million last year mainly from restructuring charges at its J. I. Case unit, a maker of farm and construction machinery. He will add the chairman's title when James L. Ketelsen, 60, who has led Tenneco since 1978, steps down at the company's annual meeting on May 12.
In an interview today from his home in Houston, where Tenneco is based, Mr. Walsh said Mr. Mead's main assignment would be to push Tenneco's six operating companies to meet goals for higher productivity, efficiency, quality and profits.
In addition to the troubled Case unit, Tenneco operates a big natural gas pipeline; the world's largest shipyard in Newport News, Va., and three other companies each with more than $1 billion in sales in packaging, chemicals and auto parts.
Explaining why he had switched to the business world, Mr. Mead said in an interview today from Tenneco's headquarters: "The West Point professor's position was appointed by the President and confirmed by the Senate, but after a few years, I found that my adrenaline was pumping faster than being a professor. I left it reluctantly, but I just wasn't able to do what I wanted with the cadets."
In his 14 years at International Paper, Mr. Mead contributed to a substantial improvement in the company's performance, analysts said. Costs of fiber used in making paper fell 30 percent and the energy costs dropped 40 percent, while output for each employee rose by a minimum of 3 percent a year.
Mr. Mead negotiated separate deals in which International Paper acquired Zanders, a major producer in Europe of coated papers, and Aussedat-Rey, France's largest maker of copy papers. He also was a frequent spokesman for the domestic paper industry in its frustrated campaign to sell more products in Japan.
International Paper, based in Purchase, N.Y., improved its profit as a percentage of shareholders' equity in the 1980's, reaching a peak of 17.6 percent in 1989. Its stock price, which closed up $1, to $74.375, on the Big Board on Friday, rebounded from a low of $16.50 in the recession in 1982.
"My leaving I.P. had nothing to do with that company," he said. "I had a great job. But Tenneco represents a challenge, with basic businesses that are excellent. Mike Walsh is one of the top C.E.O.'s in the country, and I subscribe to the kind of things that he's trying to do."
 
A Distinguished Officer
 Mr. Mead spent 21 years in the Army. After graduating from West Point with an engineering degree, he earned a doctorate in political science and economics from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
After a year as a White House fellow, he rose to deputy director of the Nixon Administration's domestic policy council, under Paul H. O'Neill, now chief executive of Alcoa. He returned to West Point for four years in 1974 as one of two tenured professors at the military academy, teaching government, international relations and economics.
In 1968, he wrote the final four volumes of the Pentagon Papers, covering the history of American ground forces in Vietnam. He also drafted the plans the Marines followed in their withdrawal from Vietnam's demilitarized zone late in 1969. He then headed Army combat operations in the zone for the first half of 1970.
Mr. Mead joined International Paper as a program director in 1978, headed the human resources department for two years and was senior vice president until being named one of two executive vice presidents in 1988.
"When you put it all together, he's got a combination of leadership skills and consistent pattern of success," Mr. Walsh said. "He's a real get-it-done guy."

HEADLINE: CREDIT MARKETS;
Prices Indicate Traders Expect Higher Growth

BYLINE: By KENNETH N. GILPIN

 BODY:
With the latest statistics showing surprising economic strength, credit market participants are challenging the view held by most economists that any recovery will be mild at most.
The reports, particularly the spurt in retail sales reported for January and February, have caused many economists to ratchet up their growth forecasts for the first half of the year. It now appears, they say, that the economy is likely to expand slightly in the first quarter instead of contracting. And the boost to consumption provided by the retail sales numbers suggests that second-quarter growth should be around 2 percent or perhaps a bit higher. 
 But if the rise in interest rates this winter is indicative of market expectations, traders see those forecasts as overly pessimistic.
 
Higher Pricing of Debt
 Instead of 1 percent to 2 percent growth, market participants have priced debt securities at levels consistent with an economy expanding at a 3 percent to 4 percent rate, analysts said.
While that higher level would be about half the rate of expansion at the end of earlier post-World War II recessions, most economists say even that sort of pace will not be reached this year, particularly on a sustained basis.
"There is the potential for stronger-than-expected growth," said Gary Schlossberg, a vice president and senior economist at Wells Fargo & Company in San Francisco. "But I think it will be more modest than the bond market currently expects and that interest rates will move back down."
 
Consumers Still Stymied
 Even though the rise in spending pushed retail sales to their highest level in nearly two years on an inflation-adjusted basis in January and February, a now-familiar litany of constraints made it hard to see how much extra push to the recovery consumers can provide.
Outstanding consumer debt and debt service have fallen noticeably from the peaks reached in 1989, but economists note that both measures remain well above historic norms.
Meanwhile, growth in personal income remains sluggish, though analysts said that mortgage refinancings and larger tax refunds might have improved cash flows in January and February and could help explain why spending picked up in those months.
 
Need for More Jobs
 Consumer confidence is showing some improvement as well, but weekly initial unemployment claims continue to run at recession-like levels. And with factories operating at well under peak capacity, employers are more likely to have their existing work force put in longer hours to meet any increase in output for some months before they start hiring again.
"Without an increase in jobs, the recent growth in cash flows will not be sustained," Paul D. Mastroddi, an economist at Morgan Guaranty Trust Company, wrote in the bank's weekly letter to clients.
Thomas Synnott, chief economist and senior vice president at the United States Trust Company, said, "With initial unemployment claims still running at 450,000 a week, we are not poised for a big turn" in the economy.
"Low inflation, the prospects for a mild recovery and the weakness of private demand for credit all argue for lower interest rates than we have today," Mr. Synnott added, "with the possible exception of the overnight Federal funds rate."
The credit markets usually warm to indications of a weak economy and mild inflation pressures because lower inflation tends to increase the value of fixed-income securities.
 
Little Has Changed of Late
 Little has changed over the last few months to stir expectations of much stimulus from other sectors of the economy, analysts argue.
Prospects that the President and Congress will agree to a substantive fiscal package are dwindling, Susan Hering, an economist at Salomon Brothers, said.
If no economic growth package is produced, stimulus from the Government will be limited to the increase in unemployment benefits and the reduction in payroll withholding taxes announced in January.
In addition, the financial condition of most state and local governments is still shaky. And the recent rise in the dollar as well as growing weakness in crucial markets in Europe and Asia make it difficult to see American export growth accelerating from current levels.
"Although recovery is taking on a more durable cast, growth is unlikely to exceed 2 percent in the spring quarter and likely will remain muted at 2.5 percent to 3 percent in the second half of 1992," Ms. Hering wrote in Salomon's weekly Comments on Credit.
 
Higher Rates Expected
 While analysts remain convinced that recent sharp gains in areas like retail sales will become much more moderate in months ahead, they said they were almost equally certain that given the gloom currently hanging over the credit markets, interest rates are more likely to move higher in the next few weeks than they are to decline.
The few remaining important reports to be released this month on how the economy fared in February will not do much to shake the market's current conviction that recovery is coming at a much faster pace than forecast, the analysts said.
"There are still some strong economic numbers coming down the pike," said Donald J. Fine, chief market analyst at the Chase Manhattan Corporation. "The rise in interest rates has gone too far, but over the near term it can get worse."

HEADLINE: Savings Rate Falls in Japan

BYLINE: Reuters

DATELINE: TOKYO, March 15

 BODY:
Japan's savings rate fell to a record low 6.5 percent in 1991, the Government has reported, fueling anxiety that the foundation of the nation's postwar economic boom is eroding.
The Bank of Japan said on Friday that it was the second consecutive year for a record low savings rate -- personal savings as a percentage of disposable income. In 1990, savings grew by 7.7 percent. 
 "Japan's high savings rate has been one of the most important aspects of Japan's postwar economy," said Chiharu Shima, economist at UBS Phillips & Drew International Ltd.
Fears are now mounting that lower savings will constrain investment needed for economic growth. "There is increasing concern about the falling savings rate," Mr. Shima said.
Japan, which saved about 20 percent of disposable income in the mid-1970's, has traditionally had a much higher savings rate than the United States, giving Japanese the capital to build what has become the second most powerful economy in the world.
Economists for years have said that the United States, with a savings rate of 5.3 percent, needs to increase that level if it hopes to have money for future investments in a more competitive world.

HEADLINE: Critic's Notebook;
Farm Aid: Music Omits Message

BYLINE: By KAREN SCHOEMER, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: AUSTIN, Tex., March 15

 BODY:
At the Farm Aid V benefit concert at Texas Stadium in Irving on Saturday, the music often spoke louder than the message. Flanking the stage were two enormous banners bearing the Farm Aid logo of a tractor flying an American flag. On the stage itself were enlarged black-and-white photographs of farmland scenes: Richard Avedon-style portraits of wan children's faces, landscapes of silos, homesteads and waves of grain. With these few token references in place, many of the big names from the roster of more than 50 country, rock and folk performers scheduled throughout the 12-hour event took the opportunity to perform some of their big hits.
Paul Simon stood with an acoustic guitar and played Simon and Garfunkel favorites like "The Boxer" and "Homeward Bound." Neil Young gathered together a loose country-rock band for "Heart of Gold" and "Old Man." The Funky Farmer All-Stars, featuring members of Lynyrd Skynyrd, stomped through the Southern rock classic "Sweet Home Alabama." The audience had plenty of anthems to punch its fists to, even if the cause behind the event -- the plight of American family farmers -- was somewhat steamrolled in the process. 
 The Farm Aid benefit, now in its fifth year, with past concerts taking place in 1985, 1986, 1987 and 1990, has become a forum for top entertainers to provide some great music and simultaneously raise consciousness about the situation in the farm industry, with farmers' being forced off the land because of economic restraints that make profitable independent farming difficult. Money raised from pledges and ticket sales goes to Farm Aid Inc., a nonprofit organization that offers relief to farmers in various forms, from crisis hot lines to job training to legal support. Since 1985, Willie Nelson, John Mellencamp and Mr. Young, the three driving forces behind the event, have shown a stalwart long-term commitment to the cause that is unusual among celebrity charity endorsements.
On Saturday, a few artists made explicit reference in their music to the issues at hand. The country-rock singer Steve Earle performed a solo acoustic version of his song "The Rain Came Down," which he wrote after appearing at Farm Aid II in 1986; James McMurtry's dusty tales of the heartland spoke directly to the rural condition. Mr. Nelson invoked traditional values with songs like "This Land Is Your Land" and "Amazing Grace."
Other bands roused the crowd on a purely musical level. Little Village, a roots-rock supergroup featuring Nick Lowe, Ry Cooder and John Hiatt, succeeded in "reducing this home of the Dallas Cowboys to a smoky little night club" with its nuevo-rockabilly rave-ups. Also performing were the Texas Tornadoes, Michelle Shocked, Mary Chapin-Carpenter and Tracy Chapman, who sang somber if soulful adult-rock ballads.
Mr. Mellencamp was the one performer who gracefully integrated music and message. His three-song set combined the muscled bravura of rock-and-roll with concerns that lie deep at the heart of Americana: "Rain on the Scarecrow" looked specifically at the social and economic disintegration in the Midwest, while "The Authority Song" reaffirmed the need to fight the Establishment continually, no matter how many times the Establishment wins. When he performed his hit "Pink Houses," the myth of American freedom seemed to grow as big as the stadium itself.
But a bad omen occurred mid-afternoon, when the Rev. Jesse Jackson came out onstage to address the crowd about family farmers' issues. He was greeted by a display of Southern inhospitality when the predominantly white crowd booed him. The reaction underscores a persistent problem with the Farm Aid concerts: whether the message itself is actually reaching a wide enough audience, both inside and outside the walls of the stadium.
Since the first concert in 1985, Farm Aid has been plagued by both financial and organizational problems. Mr. Nelson organized the initial Farm Aid concert in the wake of Live Aid, the high-profile American and European shows to raise money for Ethiopian famine relief. "When Bob Dylan was on Live Aid," Mr. Nelson said in an interview last week, "he said, 'Wouldn't it be nice if some of this money we're sending overseas stayed here for our farmers?' " At the time, Farm Aid officials said they hoped to raise around $40 million for the cause, but the actual pledges after the show came to only $7 million.
Subsequent events fell further from the original goals. Farm Aid II raised $1.5 million; Farm Aid III $1.6 million; and Farm Aid IV $1.2 million. An estimate of pledges from Saturday's show was not yet available. The stadium, which as modified for the concert held about 40,000, did not sell out.
"The same people that we're asking today are the people we asked back in 1985," said Mr. Nelson. "It's like, 'We gave already.' We're trying to find another audience that didn't give."
Last week Mr. Mellencamp expressed concern over whether the current economic recession would further hinder the audience's ability to donate. "I could tell you something that might make everything seem rosy, but I find that a lot of people are having a hard enough time paying their own bills," he said. "They're questioning: I can't even make my own payments anymore, you really expect me to donate money? It's tough out there."
Other problems may have to do with the way the show is organized.
Lloyd Werner, the senior vice president for marketing and sales at the Nashville Network, the cable channel that has broadcast every Farm Aid but the second (the music-video cable channel VH-1 carried that), said the organizers don't plan the show far enough in advance. "One of the problems is when Willie decides to do the concert," he said. "One day he gets up and says it would be a good idea to hold a concert. He calls up all his friends and all his friends say sure, we'll be there. Then he seeks a television outlet."
Mr. Nelson announced Saturday's benefit in January. Mr. Werner said that TNN signed the contracts to broadcast the event only three weeks ago. By then, he said, "we had already planned programming.
"We had to take that programming off the air, and all the advertising that's in it. Without preplanning you can't market it, you can't sell it, you can't get the advertisers involved and your ratings tend to be lower."
Farm Aid has also never been based in a particular city or at a particular time of the year. The first concert was held in Champaign, Ill., on Sept. 4, 1985; the second in Austin on July 4, 1986; the third in Lincoln, Neb., on Sept. 19, 1987; the fourth in Indianapolis on April 7, 1990. No Farm Aid was scheduled for 1991, although Carolyn Mugar, the executive director of Farm Aid, said "we were trying to get one together for the fall but it didn't work out." Last year, Mr. Nelson was involved in raising $15 million that he owed to the Internal Revenue Service.
Mr. Nelson's personal commitment to the cause of Farm Aid, however, is unquestionable. "I got into it because I'm an ex-farm worker," he said. "I'm stubborn by birth. I can't believe that people don't care; I believe they don't know yet. So that's the purpose of all these other Farm Aids: to try and get the word out."

HEADLINE: The New Faces of Wall Street '92

BYLINE: By SETH FAISON Jr.

 BODY:
A fresh crop of recruits has arrived on Wall Street, one of the few areas in the New York region that is hiring after years of retrenchment. The new faces are older and more experienced than those hired in the past, and, if David Nelson is any example, they bring a more lucrative list of potential clients with them.
Mr. Nelson, 43 years old, was once lead guitarist for the Turtles, one of the mop-top rock groups that characterized the rebellious flavor of the late 1960's. Last year, he became a broker at Merrill Lynch & Company, and by tapping his acquaintances in the music business, he is likely to develop a fuller book of clients than most first-year brokers.
 
Opportunity Knocking Again
 "I've already been able to make inroads with record companies that need business and financial advice," said Mr. Nelson, who talks about cash-flow, pension and insurance issues with the assurance of a knowledgeable insider. "I don't want to limit myself to the music business, but that is obviously my area of expertise. 
 "I wanted to make this move back in 1987," added Mr. Nelson, who worked most recently as a record producer. "But the opportunity wasn't there," he said, after the stock market crashed in October of that year.
It is now. Several brokerage firms are hiring more entry-level brokers than they did a year ago. While limited, this expansion is one of the few economic bright spots in the New York region, where 40,000 jobs are expected to evaporate in the next few years.
If a silver lining to a recession is that the quality and size of job-applicant pools swell, Wall Street firms are in the enviable position of being able to take advantage of the talent fleeing hard times in other businesses. It is not so much that the rash of new applicants are unemployed, recruiting executives say, but rather that many are finding their careers stalled in depressed areas like banking and financial consulting.
Richard A. Ferdinand also joined Merrill recently, 12 years after he left the securities industry. Mr. Ferdinand enjoyed the independence of working alone at the investment banking firm he set up in New Jersey, he said, but found that the recession and growing service requirements eventually limited what he could do.
"As the business cycle changes, here I am back on the Street," Mr. Ferdinand, 48, said.
Working as a broker at a larger firm, he explained, allows him the resources to provide financial planning for a wider scope of companies, while his experience running his own business gives him a quick rapport with clients, whose concerns he can readily understand.
"I have enough breadth to go to someone and say, 'Here's what I would do,' " he said.
 
A Growing Pool
 Paradoxically, Wall Street's recent success -- reflected in record profits at brokerage houses and in new stock market highs -- is drawing so many job seekers that despite the hiring, some firms are turning away many more applicants than they did a year ago. For Wall Street's big firms, the result is a richer choice of applicants for each available position.
"We've seen a dramatic change in the people coming in," said Robert J. Dwyer, who oversees recruitment at Dean Witter Reynolds Inc. In 1991, Mr. Dwyer said, the average broker recruited by Dean Witter was 36 years old, with six years of related experience. Only a year earlier, Dean Witter's average new broker was 26 years old, with a year of experience.
Dean Witter expects to hire 1,000 account executives this year, compared with 600 in 1991. Shearson Lehman Brothers expects to hire between 600 and 1,000 brokers, compared with 400 last year. Prudential Securities' training program has accepted more than 400 brokers this year, compared with just 97 last year.
 
Concentrated in Retail Area
 This expansion, while limited mostly to the retail side of the business, is giving the securities industry its first boost in employment in three years. According to the Securities Industry Association, employment in the industry totaled about 214,000 at the end of 1991, compared with 210,000 a year before. Figures for early 1992 are not yet available.
From its peak just before the stock market crash in 1987, employment on Wall Street is still down by 50,000, and in the narrow streets of lower Manhattan, lunchtime crowds are still palpably smaller than they were a few years ago.
Part of the focus at firms in this slimmer, sleeker environment is to accumulate assets under management from individuals as a financial ballast to the unpredictable, volatile nature of trading securities.
Several brokerage firms are both expanding the training of their own retail brokers and stressing the value of building a long-term relationship with each client instead of relying on quick trading commissions.
"It's no longer 'get a hunch and sell a bunch,' " said Linda Marcelli, branch manager of Merrill Lynch's main New York office. She supervises more than 160 financial advisers, including Mr. Nelson. "It's long-term planning that we're looking for."
Prudential Securities recently hired a new executive vice president, A. Laurence Norton, to oversee recruitment, training and retention of the firm's financial advisers.
One of the advantages of the older, more seasoned crop of new brokers coming into Prudential, Mr. Norton said, is that they generally are people with some financial experience, people who have some understanding of the securities business.
"These are the kind of people who can make an impact a little quicker," Mr. Norton said. Some customers are more comfortable entrusting their investments to an older broker, he added, although more sophisticated customers tend to judge a financial consultant by rate of success and not by age.
For brokerage houses, another bonus of the higher caliber of fresh recruits is that instead of starting from scratch, new brokers often come to their jobs with a list of potential clients from their previous work.
With the ability of Mr. Nelson to tap his contacts in the music and film businesses, which are traditionally not known for their sophisticated money management, he can parlay them into a promising list of clients.
"The amounts of money coming in were astonishing," said Mr. Nelson of what he saw in his years in the music industry. "And there was no money management at all."
Sam Masucci, a colleague of Mr. Nelson, arrived at Merrill after three years at Metropolitan Life, where he sold insurance but felt constricted by his limited ability there to provide clients with comprehensive financial planning.
On his first day at Merrill, he said, he landed 18 clients that he had known from Metropolitan Life.
"Not bad for a first day," joked Ms. Marcelli, his boss at Merrill.
"Let's see if he can keep it up."

HEADLINE: Caller, Identify Yourself

 BODY:
The same technology that lets telephone users identify their callers also exposes callers to identification they may not want. An obvious case is the rape victim who wishes to call a counseling service without first divulging her name. This technology now advances from state to state, raising privacy problems that cut in all directions.
New York, the latest state to approve a service named Caller ID, has adopted some wise safeguards for privacy that might serve as a guide to others. 
 Nearly half the states let phone companies give customers the means to trace or deal with an objectionable call. Some systems can instantly switch heavy-breathers to a police operator, or let a person who receives an obscene call press a few buttons and make it impossible for the caller to phone again.
By far the best-known and most controversial system is "caller identification." An attachment costing $60 to $120 lets the customer see the caller's number on a small screen. Some of the gadgets maintain a record of calling numbers and others can even summon the caller's name along with other personal information. The main worries about privacy involve people who don't want to divulge their numbers merely by calling out.
In New York, the state Public Service Commission has just approved the New York Telephone Company's version of Caller ID, which soon will start operating in Poughkeepsie and other mid-Hudson areas. It's a system that meets evolving Federal standards for interstate phoning and seems to offer high privacy protection.
Customers will receive at no extra charge a service called per-call blocking: press a couple of digits before dialing the number and the party called receives no identification -- only a symbol "P" for private. Or the customer may elect free per-line blocking, a system that allows the caller to remain anonymous on every call unless he or she elects to remove the block by hitting another few digits.
This should give the dialer maximum power to choose whether to be identified. A counselor can feel more at ease calling the home of a battered spouse, for example, or a rape victim can feel freer to phone a counseling service.
Will so many customers choose total identification blocking that Caller ID won't work economically? That hasn't happened yet, but more experience is needed. Meanwhile, New York has made a promising start on coping with a new and, to some, scary technology.

HEADLINE: Trading Trade for Votes, Fearfully

 BODY:
"Yeah, they'll create jobs. In Mexico." That sarcastic remark from a Detroit auto worker captured the anger directed last week at candidates Bill Clinton and Paul Tsongas for supporting the North American Free Trade Agreement. The anger is undeserved.
The proposed agreement would eliminate most trade barriers between the U.S. and its neighbors. The U.S. would benefit because the treaty would create more jobs than it would destroy, and lower consumer prices for everyone. 
 Not everyone will come out ahead. Indeed, auto workers in the Midwest would be threatened, notably in Michigan and Illinois, which hold primary elections tomorrow. That explains why candidates willing to pander to protectionism -- Democrat Jerry Brown and Republican Patrick Buchanan -- are suddenly finding friends.
Neither is likely to win nomination. Yet in the battle for votes, they might pressure their opponents to back away from supporting the trade agreement. The danger is not merely hypothetical. In a recent debate, Mr. Clinton soft-pedaled his support. And Mr. Tsongas, after repeating his allegiance to free trade, quickly added a list of difficult conditions.
Mr. Buchanan's protectionist calls pose graver problems. President Bush has already shown he is quick to cave in when Mr. Buchanan spouts off with right-wing broadsides. These capitulations invite fear that he will backtrack on trade, too. Getting lost in the debate is the value of freer trade. According to estimates by the respected Institute for International Economics, the agreement would create on balance about 130,000 U.S. jobs, and raise net exports by about $10 billion annually. Those aren't whopping numbers, but they are in the right direction.
The pact is more important to Mexico. Its Government has embarked on radical market reforms, overturning decades of stifling bureaucracy. By guaranteeing access to the huge U.S. market, the trade pact is the best signal the U.S. can send that it stands behind the Mexican reforms.
Freer trade with Mexico can't hurt the U.S., whose economy is 20 times larger. But not everyone wins. About 100,000 U.S. workers, mainly in autos and apparel, are expected to lose their jobs. The compassionate remedy would be generous dislocation assistance. Washington can also reassure environmental and labor organizations that the agreement will protect the environment and U.S. workplace safety.
What would be truly costly is for Government to cave in to election-year expediency. To maintain trade barriers would penalize hundreds of thousands of workers in industries, notably computers, pharmaceuticals and agriculture, that could pick up export sales and millions of consumers -- in other words, a greater bad for a much greater number.

HEADLINE: Foreign Affairs;
Sleeper Issue in '92

BYLINE: By LESLIE H. GELB

 BODY:
Inexorably, virtually unnoticed and contrary to Washington wisdom, Democrat and Republican standard-bearers are inching toward a direction-setting confrontation on foreign policy.
After the smoke of the primaries clears, an unusually united Democratic Party will stress domestic over foreign priorities and offer a "new agenda" of human rights and economic issues. And an unusually fractured Republican Party will cling to the present domestic/foreign balance and press familiar considerations of power politics. 
 The conflicting themes are not really new. They echo much of the head-butting between President Ford and Jimmy Carter in 1976.
But the post-cold-war context is radically new. And the demise of the Soviet monster ends three decades of Republican political advantage over Democrats on foreign affairs.
Without the Soviet menace, Republicans lose their powerful club against Democratic doves. President Bush will still try to beat up Democrats over their hesitancy to fight Iraq. But that will not be nearly as devastating as charging them with being soft on Communism. And without the unifying Soviet threat, the Robert Taft isolationist and Nelson Rockefeller internationalist wings of the party have renewed old battles.
Patrick Buchanan and Republican conservatives are already tearing the party and Mr. Bush apart with their theme of "America First." Mr. Buchanan deliberately chose that deeply isolationist tune with all its nasty historical overtones. It is racist, protectionist to the point of bashing, and says to hell with the rest of the world. It is also a direct affront to the President's internationalism.
Mr. Bush's moderate views will prevail within the party. But he is now boxed in by the unhappiness of his own conservatives and the new-found unity of Democrats. He advances responsible causes like foreign aid and NATO, then fails to fight for them for fear of voter backlash, and ends up looking timid to boot.
By contrast, the passing of the Soviet threat allows Democrats to end decades of liberal-conservative fratricide.
Foreign affairs has been a blood sport among Democrats since President Truman fired a dovish Henry Wallace from the Cabinet in 1946. The issues have always been how tough to to be with Moscow and whether to stop the spread of Communism with force.
A hard-headed President Kennedy succeeded in uniting the party in 1961, though clashes occurred with Adlai Stevenson. All hell broke loose in the late 1960's over Vietnam. And the party divided bitterly between the camps of dovish George McGovern and hawkish Henry (Scoop) Jackson.
From all this, Americans had good reason to conclude that the Democrats were too deeply divided and wimpy to conduct a coherent foreign policy.
But as Moscow collapsed, the feuding fell away almost too suddenly to be fully appreciated. The emerging unity was further camouflaged last year by the party's split vote on whether to use force against Iraq. Similar votes over the years had always been followed by intra-party bloodletting. This time, however, Democratic hawks and doves forgave one another. Their mutual forbearance permitted quick party healing.
It also allowed Democratic Presidential hopefuls to rally around an agenda of "new ideas." These included: restoring American economic strength at home to maintain strength abroad; cutting defense spending by about one-third over five years; understanding that the lines had largely broken down between domestic and foreign affairs, particularly on matters like the environment, energy and economics; and focusing on human rights.
Besides, Democrats now sense Mr. Bush might be vulnerable on the help he gave to Saddam Hussein before the war started, and his failure to help the Kurds afterward.
For all these reasons, voters in November will have a clear and momentous choice of foreign policy futures. They may still feel more comfortable with a leader who stands for cautious change. But the Democrats, if they do not come across as fearful of force, have the more forward-looking foreign pitch. And it dovetails powerfully with the growing public mood to try something new. So don't be surprised when Democrats soon challenge Mr. Bush in his foreign policy citadel.

The Major Indicator

BYLINE: By WILLIAM SAFIRE

DATELINE: WASHINGTON

 BODY:
If you were facing an election with unemployment high and not getting better; with opponents on the left moving centerward in hopes of at last winning a national election; and with former supporters accusing you of "dithering" and longing for the clarity of purpose of your strong-willed predecessor -- who would you be?
You would be either the post-Reagan President of the United States or the post-Thatcher Prime Minister of Britain. Never before has the "special relationship" between our countries been more striking: the leaders of the Atlantic alliance are in the same political boat. 
 Today the Queen dissolves Parliament; elections will be held in the mother country on April 9, while the more ponderous colonials in America meander toward their choice six months later.
Next month's British election means more to America than usual. It provides a deadline for a key foreign-policy decision in the Oval Office as well as a major indicator of likely November results.
The indicator is John Major, who stepped into the leadership after Conservatives deposed Maggie Thatcher in a party coup. Like George Bush, he is more of a centrist than his predecessor; unlike George Bush facing Bill Clinton, Mr. Major is more popular than his opponent.
That opponent is Neil Kinnock, the Welshman who has transformed the Labor Party from a pack of socialist peaceniks into a sensible-seeming assortment of virtual Tsongasarians -- talking free enterprise and no income-tax cuts.
If these two run as closely as the polls now suggest, a center party -- the Liberal Democrats -- may provide the coalition for a majority. But it would demand a Faustian bargain for its support: proportional representation, with all the splintering instability that now afflicts the Israeli Knesset.
(The third-party leader, Paddy Ashdown, confessed to an affair with his secretary; in an anti-media backlash, he wound up better known and more popular than before. The Puritans, lest we forget, left there and came here.)
What does all this have to do with decision-making in the White House?
If John Major wins, the core of the coalition against Saddam Hussein remains firm; the Brits have been our staunchest ally, and Mr. Major was ahead of Mr. Bush in recognizing the urgency of supplying and protecting the Kurds in Iraq.
But if Neil Kinnock of Labor is the new Prime Minister, or if a minority government limps in for a few months, the word from Whitehall will be "Not so fast, Mr. Bush" when the White House tries to assemble a force to clean Iraq's atomic clock.
In other words, if there is going to be an April Surprise, the attack on Saddam Hussein's potential for mass destruction will have to take place before April 9 -- or there will be at least a 50-50 chance that President Bush will not be able to organize a strike at all.
The White House already has the clear message from the Major Government that it is ready to support "punitive measures" voted by the U.N. Our new Ambassador in London has no such assurance from Mr. Kinnock, whose head is more in the European market than in the Atlantic alliance.
Certainly military action to "finish the job," as Churchill might say, would help the Conservatives at the polls -- as the Falklands campaign helped Maggie Thatcher survive a bad patch -- but the Major motive could not be dismissed as primarily political. Zapping Saddam would be consistent with the policy expressed by Foreign Minister Douglas Hurd right from the start.
If Mr. Bush dithers and Mr. Major goes down, an emboldened leader in Baghdad will be thumbing his nose at Mr. Bush throughout the U.S. campaign. On the other hand, if Mr. Bush dithers and Mr. Major wins anyway, the U.S. President will have the option to dither for years.
My hunch is contrary to my hope. I think Gen. Colin Powell will persuade the President to wait, playing for a break; Britons may well have a hung Parliament; and the Americans -- just as bored with the soft right -- will turn to the lite left.
There is such a thing as "the spirit of the age." This dozen years has been enspirited by freedom and capitalism, but the zip is gone. Unless English-speaking voters are given an ideological choice, they will vote for a face change -- just for the hell of it.

HEADLINE: THE 1992 CAMPAIGN: Staying Alive;
How a Battered Clinton Has Stayed Alive

BYLINE: By MAUREEN DOWD, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, March 15

 BODY:
They call him the Terminator. The robo-candidate. A torpedoed battleship that is still afloat. A Civil War soldier leaning against a tree, bleeding from a stomach wound.
Of all the issues raised in this scalding political season, one of the most interesting is this: How did Bill Clinton take so many shots and keep on coming? 
 In 1988, two Democratic candidates, Gary Hart and Joseph R. Biden Jr., quit the race after getting enmeshed in character questions. And while the political cognoscenti believe that Mr. Clinton has been hurt by dust-ups about marital infidelity, the Vietnam draft and financial dealings -- issues that seem certain to reappear if Mr. Clinton is the Democratic nominee -- they also express admiration for his steadiness and self-confidence under fire.
 
Surviving the Crash
 "I've never seen anybody come back from being attacked in that fashion," said Ian Weinschel, a media consultant for Patrick J. Buchanan, the conservative Republican candidate who knows something about negative attacks. "It's like going through a car crash with no seat belts and then going through the window and hitting a wall and walking away. It's absolutely astounding."
But Mr. Weinschel argues that the accusations will eventually doom Mr. Clinton, as does Edward Rollins, a Republican consultant. Mr. Rollins said Mr. Clinton had done better than many could have predicted because "he's obviously planned a campaign without any naivete."
"He's been able to bluff everyone else out. It's a very strategic, calculated campaign in which the guy doesn't flinch," Mr. Rollins said.
 
'Jittery' Democrats
 Nonetheless, the revelations about Mr. Clinton "have left people jittery," said Karen Marchioro, the Democratic Party chairman in Washington State. "We're just living it day by day, waiting to see what happens."
Even Mr. Clinton's mild-mannered rival, Paul E. Tsongas, has gotten nasty on the character issue. The other day in Michigan, talking about his position on abortion rights, Mr. Tsongas began a sentence, "I want women -- " and then stopped to slide in a quick stiletto: "No, that's the other guy."
But whatever his fate, whatever the truth of rumors of new bombshells, Mr. Clinton has so far beaten the odds and kept the money rolling in for these reasons: He is prepared, charming and facile; in a weak field, he is, as Claibourne Darden Jr., a poll taker in Atlanta, put it, "the tallest pine in the desert," and, as the Arkansas Governor himself likes to point out, being in 17 primaries and general elections in 17 years in the barbed-wire politics of the South has taught him how to take and give a punch.
"I don't know how many lives he has," said Charles Graves, the Democratic Party chairman in Wyoming. "But it's great to have a candidate who can land on his feet."
 
Calming Backers
 Mr. Clinton has kept a troubled candidacy alive by force of will, organization and the ability to act as if things are fine when they are decidedly not. His talent for striding over a rickety bridge while seeming to ignore the ravine below has quelled panic among contributors and important backers, and even won converts among the politically cynical.
After watching Mr. Clinton in New Hampshire as he fought off accusations of an extramarital affair, Joseph Grandmaison decided to help Mr. Clinton because he appreciated his seeming serenity under incredible pressure.
"I went to see him at a rally in Portsmouth on the Sunday afternoon after he taped the interview with '60 Minutes,' and he laid out the single most thoughtful, comprehensive economic policy that anybody could and tied it directly into the needs of the New Hampshire seacoast," recalled Mr. Grandmaison, the former Democratic party chairman. "I was in awe that, when the pressure becomes absolutely fierce and intense, he gets stronger."
Gov. Zell Miller of Georgia, who has been friends with the candidate for years and helped deliver a saving victory in Georgia, said: "This is a person who has thought more about campaigning and being President than anybody I have ever seen. He and his adviser, Jim Carville, are people who don't go dark easy. By that, I mean, they don't get easily discouraged."
Like George Bush, Mr. Clinton is a man of enormous ambition who spent decades creating a political network based on friendships, gestures, phone calls and letters, sedulously wooing the Democratic establishment and journalists.
Like Lyndon B. Johnson and the Rev. Jesse Jackson, Mr. Clinton loves to press the flesh and work the phone. "Oh, Lord, the phone calls come at midnight or in the middle of the night," said George Jernigan, the Arkansas Democratic chairman.
Like John F. Kennedy, Mr. Clinton knows how to court the press. His early anointment as the winner of the invisible primary of reporters and Democratic insiders -- proclaimed last winter in magazines like The New Republic, New York and Time -- was crucial in giving him ballast when the negative stories began in January.
 
Reporters at the Altar
 And much of the press corps is still smitten and worshipful, according to Hendrik Hertzberg's informal poll in a recent issue of The New Republic. "The real reason members of The Press like Clinton is simple, and surprisingly uncynical; they think he would make a very good, perhaps a great, President.
"Above all, they are awed by his fortitude (and his wife's, too)."
Charles Peters, the editor of The Washington Monthly who worked for the Kennedy campaign in 1960, said he had not seen anything like it in 30 years: "The appeal of Clinton is similar to what went on with Kennedy, who was tremendously seductive. And the effect that had on the reporting and the suppression of criticism, helped us a lot in the Kennedy campaign."
Bill Kovach, the head of the Nieman Foundation at Harvard University, agreed that the Clinton campaign had played the press masterfully. "Bill Clinton has worked Washington as though it were a precinct in his home town," Mr. Kovach said. "And a lot of these journalists who think that maybe this will be their Camelot gave him a head of steam before any vote was cast."
Call a Clinton supporter, and you'll hear a story about the candidate's power of political seduction.
Take James Anderson, a 37-year-old lawyer in Montgomery, Ala., who is on the Clinton campaign state steering committee. In 1979, when he was a senior at Cumberland Law School in Birmingham, Mr. Anderson wrote the young Governor of Arkansas and asked if he would be a speaker at the school's law day banquet.
After hanging out with the students for hours, Mr. Clinton gave his speech and then went to the airport to catch a plane back to Little Rock. When the pilot came out to ask who the Governor was, Mr. Clinton pointed to Mr. Anderson and the group went along with the gag for a few moments.
"Bill Clinton probably wouldn't know me from Adam's house cat now," the lawyer said. "But ever since that day he pulled the practical joke, I felt he was one of us, our kind of people."
When the tabloid stories first hit, Mr. Clinton battled desperately to turn the problem into an opportunity, and he began presenting himself as an outsider who was being unfairly attacked by the press and the Republican Party.
As Mr. Carville, the jagged-edge Clinton strategist, began blasting reporters traveling on the Clinton plane about how horrible they were, many of them nodded, reflecting the tender feelings left by criticism of the press role in bringing down two Democratic candidates in 1988.
When Mr. Tsongas began to benefit from Mr. Clinton's problems, the Arkansas Governor, a leader of the conservative Democratic Leadership Conference, slid to the left. Mr. Clinton took the role of another candidate, Senator Tom Harkin of Iowa, as friend of the working man, painting Mr. Tsongas as a proponent of Reaganomics.
"He's returned to the old Democratic formula in primaries of pandering to special interest groups," said Roger Stone, a Republican consultant who got his start working for Richard M. Nixon.
Those who criticize Mr. Clinton as being too glib often compare him to the classic traveling salesman -- out there on a smile and a shoeshine.
One of the steps the campaign took to keep their supporters on board during the worst moments of the tabloid scandal was to have the candidate make his own sales pitches to supporters. Clinton advisers credited a conference call in which Bill and and his equally confident wife, Hillary, spoke to a group of New York contributors with halting any erosion of support.
In the undertow of doubt, Mr. Clinton takes care to give an appearance of openness -- even when he is declining to to illuminate aspects of his personal life or finances, such as what happened to the records of Whitewater Development, a real estate corporation in which he was a partner.
Even when he is slipping away from direct answers, the candidate conveys an air of calmness and directness, standing for long periods to take questions, never stalking away from cameras or ducking into cars with his arms raised to fend off inquiries.
But Republicans like to point out that, after enough blasts, crashes, zaps and shocks, even Arnold Schwarzenegger in "Terminator" was finally compacted into 21st-century slag.
"A Clinton-Bush battle would be one of the all-time great negative campaigns," Mr. Rollins said. "In the final analysis, there will be enough significant doubts about him that President Bush would beat him."
As he closes on the nomination, Mr. Clinton's Democratic detractors have become equally blunt.
Former Gov. Edmund G. Brown Jr., campaigning in Michigan last week, said that Mr. Clinton's seeming durability may be an optical illusion. "He looks like he's going forward," he said, "but a good strong wind out of the press, or Bush, or the Democrats, may blow him right over."

HEADLINE: THE 1992 CAMPAIGN: Voters;
Here Come the Little Guys, and, Boy, Are They Fed Up With the Big Guys

BYLINE: By ISABEL WILKERSON, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: ROCKFORD, Ill., March 14

 BODY:
Forget the middle class. Forget the working class. There is a newly discovered and much-sought-after species of voter that spans class and party lines: the little guy.
Beaten up by the recession, this voter switches parties at will -- and this rough-around-the-edges industrial city 75 miles west of Chicago is full of them. 
 Unemployment is at 10 percent, good-paying factory jobs are leaving town and most everyone here in Illinois's second-largest city is feeling vulnerable these days.
In the forest of aluminum-sided ranch houses on Oak Grove Lane, where people tend their perennials and station wagons and spew venom about out-of-touch politicians, many of these self-proclaimed little guys are Reagan Democrats who stuck with George Bush in 1988. This year they are trying to read between the sound bites, looking for themselves in the candidates.
 
Kicked by the System
 These voters define themselves not by class or income but by how many times they have been kicked in the teeth by taxes, Medicare, Social Security, the economy and the rest of a political system run by people who they say do not care about them. They are the people who see their representatives in Congress only at election time, whose taxes seem to be the first to go up and who feel that whatever politicians do they somehow end up the losers.
Now in the final days before the Illinois primary, many of them have not yet decided which Presidential candidate is really in their corner.
"You don't know what to believe,' said Gordon Wenziker, a Rockford postal worker. "In an election year, everybody identifies with you."
Many of these people are using a measure to compare candidates that goes beyond position papers on the economy and experience in foreign affairs. Even personality and charisma do not quite capture it. They want a benevolent uncle, an outsider, a meat-and-potatoes kind of guy who will put their needs above those of the rich and powerful.
"We need somebody that's down-to-earth," said Loretta Westott, a retired factory worker on Oak Grove Lane, who thinks Gov. Bill Clinton of Arkansas most fits the description. "They have to understand what it's like to worry about things like regular people do. I can tell by the way they talk and if they look like an average person."
Then she repeated the little-guy mantra heard in interviews with nearly three dozen Rockford voters: "The little guys are the ones who are hurting. These politicians let the rich get away with everything."
The way people on Oak Grove Lane tell it, President Bush is too patrician and has betrayed them. Mr. Clinton has what they say is a John F. Kennedy kind of charisma, but they worry about what other skeletons from his past may emerge in a Republican attack in the fall. They see former Gov. Edmund G. Brown Jr. of California as a born-again little guy, and they like what he stands for, but they figure he doesn't have a chance at the Democratic nomination.
Former Senator Paul E. Tsongas, who has done well with educated, affluent voters elsewhere, has barely made an impression here.
"Is he running for President, too?" Ms. Westott asked.
Places like Rockford are ripe for anti-elitism oratory. People here are more pragmatic than partisan. Voters are just about evenly divided among Republicans, Democrats and independents and tend to be typical of the voters in the country as a whole.
"Rockford is the middle of the middle of the middle," said Frank Witt, a Democratic ward committeeman who lives on Oak Grove Lane.
For most of the last century, Rockford was a thriving factory town, where hard-working people could make a good living in machine tool factories. Many of those factories are out of business now and those that are left are cutting back. Last week, the Chrysler Corporation, one of the area's largest employers, said it was laying off 750 workers at its assembly plant just outside the city.
"It makes you sick," said Elmer Jones, president of the Local 792 of the Carpenters Union. "Rockford was once the town for the skilled craftsman and skilled trades. Now all the jobs in our area are fast foods. It's just service industry. You can't make it on $4.25 an hour."
It is that attitude that has got people assessing candidates by their "caring" quotient.
David Burelli, an Oak Grove Lane resident who is a fund-raising consultant for public schools, says he is wary of the Republicans and is looking for a candidate with compassion. "I voted for Bush in '88," he said. "Now I just don't know if we can afford another four years of him. The country is fed up with the things going on in Washington.
"I don't know a lot about Tsongas, but he seems to care," he added.
Indeed, Mr. Tsongas, the only candidate to visit Rockford this week, played to that sentiment at a rally at a local union hall. "Somebody has to care," he said. "I care. You're looking at a boy from Lowell, Mass. The city I grew up in knows what economic decline is about. This is not theory. I lived this."
Those words hit home for Jerry Dunn, a trucking sales representative looking for someone he can relate to. "He's a plain guy," Mr. Dunn said, "a guy you could go down and have a beer with at the local tavern."
Mr. Dunn also voted for Mr. Bush last time, but after a wage freeze at work and fear that any day his boss might come in and say he is no longer needed, he said he is judging the candidates this year by how they relate to regular people.
He said he liked Mr. Tsongas best and has ruled out Mr. Clinton because "he seems aloof -- he seems to be talking to us, not with us."
But just because the common touch has become a common criterion does not mean common people all see things the same way.
Millie Johnson, a hairdresser on Oak Grove Lane, has been a Republican all her life, casting her first Presidential vote for President Dwight D. Eisenhower. But this year, she said, she believes that a Democrat, Mr. Clinton with his energy and youthfulness, is the best hope for the little guy.
"We need some fresh blood in there," she said, "young fresh blood."
Mrs. Johnson said she is angry enough at the President for paying little attention to regular people like herself that, for the first time, she will vote for a Democrat.
"I've been let down or I wouldn't be switching parties," she said. "You lose faith in mankind. They promise you the world and you don't get it."

HEADLINE: Despite Aid, a Queens Bakery Is Shutting Down and Moving

BYLINE: By SARAH BARTLETT

 BODY:
Since the early 1960's, a constant feature of life in Flushing, Queens, has been the smell of freshly baked bread wafting out of an eight-acre Taystee Bakery plant. On its roof sat a sign that flashed weather reports and other messages to residents and drivers on the nearby Van Wyck Expressway.
But these days the sign is turned off and Taystee, once the largest bakery in the nation, is operating at 20 percent of capacity. It will soon be shut down altogether, despite considerable financial assistance from the city. 
 At least 500 people, many with little in the way of skills or formal education, are expected to lose their jobs and will probably have a hard time replacing their $11- to $13-an-hour wages.
Although some of the workers will find new jobs, others will not or may find new employment at lower wages.
 
A Ripple Effect
 Thus, some economists, examining Taystee's decision to move to Pennsylvania and its ripple effect on other businesses, have estimated that the net result could cost the city $10 million in unemployment and welfare benefits and $32 million in lost income tax.
The loss of the bakery poses a classic problem for the administration of Mayor David N. Dinkins. How far should the city go to subsidize manufacturers so that there are reasonable-paying jobs for unskilled, uneducated workers, many of whom are immigrants or minorities? Should the city try to help keep the plant open by assisting an employee buyout, or wage economic warfare by ending city contracts for Taystee products?
Or would those actions be futile attempts to forestall the inevitable? Are the costs of doing business in New York simply too high for a small-scale manufacturer, making it unrealistic to try to keep a Taystee bakery here? And, if that is the case, what is going to happen to the people who depended on such jobs to climb out of poverty?
To Edouard Archange, a Haitian immigrant who arrived in New York in 1977, Taystee offered an entry point into America's middle class. As a dough mixer at the plant, he was making nearly $30,000 a year, enough to provide for his wife, who worked until she was laid off last year, their five children, ages 15, 10, 5, 3 and 3 months, and to pay the $650-a-month rent on their three-bedroom apartment in Corona, Queens.
"This is a big problem for my family," said Mr. Archange, who is 48 years old. "If I don't have no job, how am I going to feed my family? If I earn $5 to $6 an hour, I can't pay my rent."
Taystee joins a continuing exodus of manufacturers from New York City. From 1977 to 1989, the city lost one-third of its manufacturing jobs and the baking industry was one of the many industries affected. A recent study by the Deputy Mayor's Office of Finance and Economic Development found that the number of bread and bakery jobs in the city fell 26 percent from 1975 to 1989, when it hit 5,500.
Thanks to modern production techniques and improved transportation evolving since the 70's, it made increasingly poor economic sense for local bakeries to be dotted all over the region. The industry began consolidating to eliminate excessive production capacity, and New York City, with its high costs, was a prime target for shrinkage. More and more baking was shifted to central plants outside the city.
 
Good Old Days
 Taystee mirrors the industry pattern. In the 60's, when the Flushing bakery belonged to A.& P., there were 19 bakery lines running up and down the building, operating 24 hours a day with employees making pies, cakes, doughnuts and bread. Today, so many types of bread and other products have been shifted elsewhere that the plant has just three baking lines and there is no longer any need for round-the-clock operations.
City officials said they did what they could to help Taystee. When Stroehmann Bakeries, the company that owns Taystee, acquired the plant in 1988, the city's economic development unit saw to it that the company received a $5.2 million triple-tax-exempt bond issue to help pay for the acquisition. And it gave the company $780,000 in breaks on property, sales and mortgage-recording taxes. The company also received a discount on utility rates.
But that was still not enough to keep Taystee here, or to insure that when it decided to leave, it did so in a way that earned it a reputation as a good corporate citizen. Stroehmann has antagonized city and state officials by announcing its decision to close without warning or showing a willingness to consider alternatives.
It has angered many employees by offering little to ease their transition to unemployment. Its severance pay is what the union contract calls for and not a penny more: 30 hours of pay for every year of service over three. About 100 of the 510 workers being laid off are not eligible to receive even that because, technically, they are temporary employees.
Stroehmann has also refused to offer its Flushing employees jobs in its Pennsylvania plants, on the ground that that approach has not worked well in the past. Few people want to move and those that do don't stay, said David H. Allshouse, vice president of human resources and law at Stroehmann.
The company did agree to offer $1,000 per employee to employers who hire Taystee workers, with the aim of making them more attractive job candidates. Alternatively, it also agreed to contribute $1,000 per employee for job training, which would be paid only after employees complete courses and receive credentials, forcing workers to pay for their training first, a hardship for many. The total fund the company agreed on for these programs is $300,000.
Mr. Allshouse said the issue is simply one of economics. The Flushing plant lost $22 million during the last three years, he said. Indeed, he said, it has never been profitable since Stroehmann acquired it. Mr. Alls house attributed the losses to a host of factors: high wages, high real-estate and utility costs and a three-story building that was too big to work well as a modern bakery.
By moving production to Pennsylvania, Mr. Allshouse said, the company will be able to enjoy significant savings. In Flushing, where production workers are unionized, the company has been paying an average of $13.87 an hour to dough mixers, who are at the high end of the wage scale, and an average of $13.33 to a general helper. But in Hazleton, Pa., in a nonunion plant where Stroehmann will shift much of its Flushing production, it will pay $11.64 an hour to a mixer and $11.19 to a general helper.
The Flushing plant's benefits increase that differential. In Hazleton, medical, pension and other benefits equal 41 percent of an employee's salary, compared to 57 percent of a salary in Flushing.
The wage comparison has led Lynn Bell, shop chairwoman of Local 50 of the Bakery, Confectionery and Tobacco Workers Union, which represents Taystee production workers, to accuse the company of anti-union activity.
Mr. Allshouse denies the charge vehemently. Although he acknowledged that most of Flushing's production would be placed in a nonunion plant, some of it was being parceled out to union plants as well, he said. With about half of Stroehmann's work force unionized, he said, it would be foolhardy to treat unions as anything other than a fact of life.
Ms. Bell and her supporters insist that the plant could be run profitably. Taystee's problem, they say, is that it made some important errors: spending money on investments that were ill advised and never completed, and cutting back production.
"Of course the plant is losing money, because they're running it at very low capacity," said Sean Gervasi, an economic consultant working with the Taystee employees to explore alternatives to the plant's closing.
Mr. Gervasi, Ms. Bell and their supporters are discussing a boycott of Taystee and Stroehmann products, which the company plans to truck into the city from Pennsylvania once the Flushing plant has closed.
"Yes, they have a prerogative to move where they want to, but the people have a prerogative not to buy their bread," said the Rev. Timothy Mitchell, of the Ebenezer Baptist Church in Flushing.
 
City on the Spot
 Such calls to action have put the city and state on the spot. Mr. Mitchell argues that if public officials do not show support for keeping Taystee open, they will be conveying the impression that they are racist. For instance, public officials have recently given $10 million in financial incentives to Bertelsmann, a German publishing company that was threatening to move 500 jobs out of the city.
New York State's Urban Development Corporation has agreed to spend $35,000 on a study to see if it would be economically feasible to keep the Taystee plant open by increasing production or to build a new plant somewhere else in the city.
For city officials, the issues are trickier. The city currently spends almost $900,000 a year buying bread from Taystee for some of its prisons and shelters. It could explore its legal options to end those contracts. But, as Mr. Allshouse is quick to point out, though the company is ending its production in the city, it intends to leave about 600 distribution and sales-force employees in the metropolitan area. "If sales dropped significantly," he warned, "we wouldn't be able to employ the number of people we're planning to employ."
Stroehmann has also left dangling the question of whether a new distribution center it intends to open would be situated in the city or northern New Jersey. Mr. Allshouse said the company hoped the city would offer some financial incentives to persuade them to choose New York City.
But the Dinkins administration is anxious not to appear to be a patsy to Stroehmann, or any company, for that matter. Carl Weisbrod, president of the city's Economic Development Corporation, said with pride that the city had a clause in its previous agreement with Taystee that insured that it would be repaid the full $780,000 of its tax waivers upon Taystee's sale of the building.
Whether the city decides to offer other financial inducements will depend on the tone negotiations take. As to whether, if talks break down, the city would take a more aggressive stance on its Taystee contracts, Mr. Weisbrod would only say, "Certainly, we would explore not only our legal rights but our ability to use other vehicles and other approaches."

HEADLINE: North-South Divide Is Marring Environment Talks

BYLINE: By MARLISE SIMONS, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: GENEVA

 BODY:
As the nations of the world map a plan of action to preserve Earth's environment, their meetings have been bogged down by the old battles between the wealthy, industrial countries of the north and the poor, underdeveloped countries of the south.
The disputes are mirrored in thick stacks of papers, 20,000 pages sent in by 121 governments, that are now being examined in an elegant villa on the outskirts of Geneva. They are lists of the world's green worries, each country's view of its most pressing environmental concerns. 
 The papers form the substance of discussions here and at the United Nations headquarters in New York in preparation for the United Nations Conference on Environment and Development, scheduled for June in Rio de Janeiro, exactly 20 years after an environmental conference in Stockholm.
United Nations officials sorting through the reports here say that since the Stockholm meeting, governments have come a long way in thinking, arguing and absorbing the notion that the planet cannot cope with indefinite abuse.
 
'Give Us Money'
 But United Nations organizers here have expressed anguish because the meetings to prepare for Rio have revived the old clashes between rich and poor, this time in an environmental context.
A United Nations official who has attended most planning sessions said much of the debate was confrontational, characterizing the message from developing countries as "Give us money; you are rich; we are poor." The official, a European, said there was no debate about what developing countries should do at home.
"The language emphasizes more and more the need for a new international economic order," she said.
At the Paris-based Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, an organization of the 24 industrialized nations that are deeply involved in environmental planning, senior officials seem as gloomy.
"People are despairing that the Rio meeting will be dominated by a North-South confrontation," said Bill Long, director of environment affairs at the organization. "We hoped we could forget about placing blame and work on problems together."
 
Negotiating Tactics
 Representatives from developing countries make light of such accusations, saying their confrontational postures and language are only negotiating tactics to get much needed funds.
"For the first time in more than a decade, the developing countries have an issue where they have some real leverage," said an official from a Caribbean nation. "They had none during the debt negotiations. But they are part of the environment, so they have leverage now. And they are using it. It's their negotiating strategy."
Poorer nations, he said, see leverage because the north, the main polluter, wants them to cut emissions, stop deforesting and make other changes. But to adapt to those changes, they argue, they need funding and technology.
The reports here are being used to draft an "Earth Charter" for the Rio summit meeting on making development more compatible with the environment. Organizers also hope for a binding treaty to cut emissions that can cause climate change and a similar treaty on the preservation of species.
 
A Rising Awareness
 Since most of the reports have been prepared with the help of private organizations, they reflect how concern for the environment has over the last two decades galvanized thousands of citizens' groups and mobilized scientists, lawyers, economists and politicians who are pressing for change.
Confrontation has been part of preparations for the summit meeting since the United Nations resolution in 1989 calling for it attributed the planet's environmental problems to "unsustainable production patterns" of the industrial countries.
At first, planners wanted to hold the meeting in Stockholm, as in 1972. But Brazil, stung by intense international criticism over the large-scale destruction of its Amazon rainforest, lobbied to serve as host for the meeting and won enough backing.
Brazil's purpose, officials said at the time, was to improve its image. Brazil and other developing nations also said that holding the conference in the third world was symbolically important and would help them put the blame for most environmental destruction and pollution back where it belonged, in the industrial world. The strategy has put rich countries on the defensive on a host of issues.
A planned treaty to protect and manage the world's tropical forests, which are vital regulators of the global climate and which harbor most of the planet's species, has already been shelved. Brazil and other countries demanded that such a treaty be extended to all forests and had the word "tropical" removed.
"By extending the debate to all forests, there was not enough time for a binding treaty," a United Nations official said. "The best we can hope for is a declaration to save the rainforests."
Another planned high point of the summit meeting, a treaty to protect the world's animal and plant species, is being fundamentally changed. In the past, nature has always been considered part of the common heritage. But now developing countries want the convention to state that biological resources "are under a country's sovereignty" and are no longer "to be considered as a common heritage of humankind."
Poor countries say this is part of their quest for equity. They have long complained that their contributions such as natural genes, or strains bred by farmers in the fields, have been reaped by foreign researchers or pharmaceutical companies for free while poor nations have to pay for seeds or other organisms protected by patents and licences elsewhere. There is still basic disagreement over how a country can profit from its biological resources.
 
Rivalry for Western Funds
 The emerging rivalry for Western funds that many Africans and Latin Americans show toward Eastern Europe was one topic of debate here this week. Westerners said that every time a meeting document mentioned the need to give special attention to eastern Europe, the large bloc of developing nations wanted it crossed out.
"The south sees eastern Europe as a drain on Western resources," an American official said. "They look at them as competitors for Western funds. But we see eastern Europe as a test case, a special opportunity to demonstrate quickly that you can have cleaner economic growth. If you can't do it there, where can you?"
One way to dissolve the acrimony, Marjan van Giezen of the Netherlands said, is a pledge from the West to keep separate budgets and not to send eastern Europe any aid funds earmarked for the developing world.
United Nations officials have been disappointed with the low profile of oil-rich Arab states. Several have not yet provided their reports, which were due in November. In December, when the United Nations tried to raise funds for a program to rehabilitate environmental damage in the Middle East that was not related to the Persian Gulf war, "not a single Arab state offered one penny," a senior official said. Some Arab delegates have said the environment is a task for the international community.
 
Cooperation Is Cited
 As the summit meeting nears, delegates say the spirit of cooperation is improving somewhat in small work groups. "But in every plenary session, the north-south smokescreen is still up," Mrs. van Giezen said.
Rich countries still feel strongly that population control deserves a more prominent place and more commitment. They see population problems as an issue inextricable from the environment. By the year 2000, when a billion more people will have been added to the planet, they argue, almost every environmental problem will be magnified.
But many poor countries see demands to curb population growth as an infringement on their sovereignty. At first they kept population off the agenda and many remain reluctant to make population growth a key issue. "Population finally came in through the back door," a French delegate said. It was finally put on the agenda, she said, "but it's still very sensitive."
The big question remains what to do about an ambitious agenda of some 800 pages, ranging from human settlements to the chemistry of the upper atmosphere. Organizers say it has been virtually impossible to draw the line in a summit meeting called Conference on Environment and Development.
"The environment runs through everything, the interlinkage has given us gray hairs," said Lars Hyttinen, a Finnish economist and biologist who coordinates the country reports in Geneva.
Maurice Strong, a Canadian who is Secretary General of the Rio summit meeting, has said that although unwieldy, the agenda serves to project the magnitude of the problems. Most proposals for action demand enormous transfers of money and technology from the industrial world to the developing world that would put almost all responsibility on the rich countries.
They agree that there is a need for more funds but argue that their poorer partners must also commit themselves to a number of steps, like less wasteful use of resources, cut in military spending and slowing population growth. Mr. Strong has put the environment-related aid bill at $125 billion per year.
 
Benefits of Gathering
 Cautious United Nations officials say that even if the summit meeting falls short of its goals, the gathering will have been worthwhile as a consciousness-raising effort, pushing environmental questions to the forefront among the public, into the press and into every government ministry.
Even the preparation of the national reports, Mr. Hyttinen of Finland said, has already prompted intense discussion inside and outside governments. He said several Asian countries, including the Philippines and Sri Lanka had asked the public to send in suggestions, a move that set off regional and national debates.
New Zealand's also called on citizens' and activist groups to participate. "It was a most interesting exercise," said a New Zealand official. "We never knew all those people existed."

HEADLINE: Dow Up 0.45 in Light Day; Japan's Drop Spurs Caution

BYLINE: By ROBERT HURTADO

 BODY:
Stocks ended mixed in lethargic trading yesterday, as investors moved cautiously after a sharp drop on the Tokyo stock market. After trading lower much of the day, the Dow Jones industrial average barely budged, gaining 0.45 point, to 3,236.36.
Blue-chip issues rallied at the close, as some investors who had sold stock short scurried in the face of market uncertainty to buy shares to cover those they had borrowed. The market may also have been held back as traders awaited economic data due out today, including reports on February consumer prices, housing starts, industrial production and capacity utilization. 
 Also, the expiration of options on several products on Thursday and Friday could add volatility.
 
Most Broader Indexes Down
 The Standard & Poor's index of 500 stocks, another blue-chip barometer, rose 0.55 point at the close, to 406.39, while the American Stock Exchange composite index fell 1.18 points, to 402.88. Trading on the Nasdaq pulled the composite index down 0.68, to 617.94, while the Russell 2,000 index of smaller company issues fell 0.67, to 206.09.
Volume on the New York Stock Exchange was its lowest this year at 156 million, down from 177.9 million on Friday. The lowest volume this year had been 160.8 million on March 9. Losing issues were ahead of gaining ones yesterday, 922 to 782.
Under pressure early from a sharp decline in the Tokyo stock market that saw the Nikkei average fall 3 percent, to below 20,000 for the first time since 1987, United States stocks opened weaker, as some investors grew concerned over the flight of Japanese money from the American markets to cover losses at home.
 
No Panic Selling
 But analysts at MMS International, an economic analysis and research firm, noted that the Tokyo decline came in modest volume, about 200 million shares, with no hint of panic selling. At the close of trading today, the Nikkei was up 80.47 points.
Harry W. Laubscher, the senior vice president at Tucker Anthony Inc., said that jittery day traders moved to the sidelines awaiting further developments from the overseas markets, especially Tokyo.
"In the absence of any help from bonds, prices drifted and selling pressures were light," Mr. Laubscher said. "While a short-term news instigated rally can occur, the evidence suggests lower prices over the weeks."
Gene J. Seagle, the director of technical research at Gruntal & Company, said many investors feared that a liquidation in Japan could lead the Japanese to sell off United States stocks and bonds, but it had not happened. "In fact," he said, "our market has managed to move a lot in the face of the Tokyo market's decline. And I don't believe it will happen."
"However, for it to happen, they would have to have a major break in their banking system, and history shows that the Japanese banks are very competent in handling money," Mr. Seagle added.
 
Synergen Rating Cut
 In other activity, Larry Bloom, an analyst at the Soundview Financial Group Inc. said he had lowered his rating on Synergen to a "short-term sell" from a "short-term hold" based on a negative article in this month's issue of The Journal of Immunology about a molecule the company is researching to treat septic shock. The stock declined 1 1/8, to 49.
Shares of Weyerhaeuser rose 2 3/8, to 36 1/8, as George Adler, an analyst with Smith Barney, Harris Upham & Company, raised his earnings estimates for the first quarter and the year and said his target price for the paper company was 40 a share.
A third-quarter earnings report of $1.08 a share at Nike sent the stock down 3 5/8, to 70 1/2. The earnings estimate was lower than Wall Street consensus estimates, but within the range of analysts' estimates. On Friday, the stock surged 2 3/4, to 74 1/8, after the athletic footwear maker said it was comfortable with estimates of $1.05 to $1.15 for the quarter.
Recent signs of activity in the housing sector, leading to a strong gain in building-materials sales nationally, as well as higher lumber prices, prompted Christopher Vroom, an analyst with Alex. Brown & Sons Inc., to adjust his rating for Home Depot's stock to a "strong buy" from "buy."
The analyst said he felt Home Depot, the home-improvement store chain, would benefit from putting new stores in the Northeast this year. The stock rose 2 1/4, to 64 7/8.

HEADLINE: THE 1992 CAMPAIGN: White House;
Bush Works Party's 2 Sides: The Blue and White Collars

BYLINE: By MICHAEL WINES, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: CHICAGO, March 16

 BODY:
President Bush worked both sides of the Republican political coalition today with elan, acting like a man who believes he has put his political rivals and his campaign's problems behind him.
By and large, both sides seemed to believe so, too. 
 To urban steelworkers in Milwaukee and Polish-Americans in Chicago, the President was the caring and concerned candidate who first surfaced last December, at the depths of the White House's concern that the economy could be the President's undoing.
Before well-dressed and almost exclusively white Republican contributors in hotel ballrooms in both cities, Mr. Bush was his partisan, anti-Democratic self. He lambasted Congress and exhorted the cheering crowds to embrace cuts in the capital gains tax, track down alimony cheats and shun the isolationism and protectionism of his rivals in both parties.
 
$1.3 Million Day
 Today's speeches were all organized and paid for by Mr. Bush's re-election committee.
For his labors, the President today collected $400,000 in Milwaukee and an additional $900,000 in Chicago, all from donors who paid $1,000 a plate to see and hear him.
That raises to almost $18 million the amount that Mr. Bush has collected for his primary campaign in the last five months. The overwhelming majority has come from fund raisers and handshake sessions at hotels like Chicago's downtown Hyatt and Milwaukee's Pfister, where today's events were held.
Today's fund raisers presented an arresting contrast to the scene in Milwaukee, where Mr. Bush delivered a speech on industrial policy to blue jeans- and T-shirt-clad steelworkers at the huge Steeltech Manufacturing Inc. factory outside of town.
"I want the media here to carry your message into every living room in this nation," Mr. Bush said, "because we're waging a battle here in America, a battle for jobs and for our economic future. And Steeltech is the kind of success story that points the way to victory."
The factory, owned by the Super Steel Products Corporation, leases space to Steeltech, which hires and trains inner-city minority workers to weld and assemble steel products like truck flatbeds.
Steeltech, a minority-controlled business, has prospered with millions of dollars in financial aid from the city, state and Federal governments and help from local banks.
The crowd, which included a mix of community leaders as well as steelworkers, responded diffidently to Mr. Bush's remarks. But many of the $7-to-$12-an-hour welders at the scene indicated that they liked what Mr. Bush offered, and would vote for him in November.
"Bush is trying to get some jobs going. The Democrats want to help the people, but it looks like they want to tax us, too," said Alex Ruiz, who has worked there for four years.

 	 	 		--------------------	 	
 
Buchanan Vows to Continue
 DETROIT, March 15 (Special to The New York Times) -- On his last day in Michigan before the state's primary, Patrick J. Buchanan implored voters today to vote for him to keep the debate going with President Bush and vowed once again to stay in the race through the California primary on June 2.
"This is not simply about piling up delegates," he said at a news conference at Central Michigan University. "I told those people in New Hampshire I was going all the way."
Michigan presents Mr. Buchanan with perhaps his last chance to have his insurgent Republican campaign taken seriously. Though the conservative commentator indicated today that he would make his next major effort in North Carolina, he needs a convincing showing in Michigan to become more than a minor annoyance to Mr. Bush.

HEADLINE: Zimbabwe Moves to Take Over Whites' Farmland

BYLINE: By JANE PERLEZ, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: HARARE, Zimbabwe, March 16

 BODY:
Driven by its growing unpopularity among black voters, the Government of this southern African nation is forging ahead with plans to forcibly acquire large chunks of agricultural land held by white farmers.
President Robert G. Mugabe appears intent on pushing aside the protests of the white farmers and ignoring pressure from Western aid donors to modify sweeping land legislation, which is set for final debate in Parliament on Tuesday. 
 Both the farmers and the donors have argued that the compulsory purchase could depress the country's excellent record of food production.
 
A 10-Year Promise Expires
 The ownership of the best land by about 4,000 white farmers has been the most contentious political issue since 1980, when Zimbabwe (formerly Rhodesia) finally won official independence from Britain.
Despite promises made in the 1970's by Mr. Mugabe's guerrilla movement that land would be distributed to peasants at independence, most of the 10 million people live on small plots of semi-arid land without ownership rights.
For his first decade in power, Mr. Mugabe was prevented from nationalizing white-held land under the terms of independence that were drawn up to prevent the flight of white farmers. But a year ago, at a time when ordinary people suddenly became burdened by inflation, especially higher school and medical costs, Mr. Mugabe was freed from these restrictions.
Both white farmers and Western donors, including the World Bank, have told Mr. Mugabe that they agree with the principle of redressing the inequities of land holdings.
But they oppose the Government's plan to designate land for acquisition arbitrarily and pay less than market rates for it. The legislation also forbids recourse to the courts. The Government says it plans to acquire 20 million of the approximately 50 million acres of mostly white-controlled commercial farmland.
 
Warning From Aid Donors
 In a statement at a World Bank meeting in Paris last month, Zimbabwe's major donors, principally Britain and the United States, cautioned that the land acquisitions would deter foreign investment and severely depress the economy.
Mr. Mugabe's determination to press ahead comes during the worst drought in this century, and when the usually self-sufficient nation will have to import huge quantities of grain.
But at a news conference this month, Mr. Mugabe described the acquisition as a "do-or-die issue."
"You cannot run a society of haves and have-nots," he said, "and hope that that society will continue to accept the situation. We have to do justice and give the communal people and other people who want to go into agriculture land to do so."
 
Whites Still Well Off
 Mr. Mugabe has often been praised for his reconciliation between blacks and whites after his bitter bush war against the whites, but he suggested last week that there were limits.
Of the approximately 100,000 whites in Zimbabwe, he said: "Even after independence they have remained to be in greater comfort, greater wealth than the blacks, and we have not seized their property. We have not become vindictive in any way."
The most powerful commercial farm lobby, the tobacco growers, who brought in a record $500 million in export earnings last year, have been protesting vigorously with full-page newspaper advertisements and at meetings and in speeches.
The president of the Zimbabwe Tobacco Association, Michael M. Taggart, argues that there is plenty of underutilized fertile land that could be distributed to black farmers without resorting to compulsory acquisition.
"I'd say there's about 12 million acres of underutilized land in the country," he said Sunday at his tobacco farm at Enterprise, 35 miles north of Harare, the capital. "We should take the skilled farmers and put them on these areas.
"By designating large blocks of land, you perpetuate this idea of them against us, white against black."

HEADLINE: Most U.S. Youths in Survey View Race Relations as Poor

BYLINE: Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, March 16

 BODY:
Young Americans are deeply pessimistic about the state of race relations and divided along racial lines over what to do about the problem, a new survey shows.
The survey, conducted for People for the American Way, a liberal civil rights group based here, found that 50 percent of American young people interviewed said the state of race relations in the United States was "generally bad." It also found that youths of different races disagreed greatly on issues like affirmative action. 
 The survey, which is to be released Tuesday, was conducted by Peter D. Hart Research Associates among a nationwide sampling of 15- to 24-year-olds between Oct. 8 and 21. Of the 1,170 youths questioned, 143 blacks, 709 whites, 122 Hispanic youths and 44 "others," including Asians, were surveyed. In addition, 152 black youths from mostly black neighborhoods were surveyed to improve accuracy. The survey had a margin of error of plus or minus four percentage points.
Most of the youths surveyed shared a pessimistic view of the country's future: 54 percent said they felt America's best years had passed, while only 37 percent said they thought the best lay ahead. Other than this bleak outlook, the survey found little agreement, especially on economic matters.
 
Swing on Affirmative Action
 The survey found that different perceptions of racial issues among white, black and Hispanic youths were most visible on affirmative action. When asked if colleges should give "special consideration to minority students" for enrollment, 51 percent of the young whites surveyed said they were opposed. When asked if employers should give "special consideration to minority job applicants," 65 percent of the whites said they were opposed. The opposition shot up further, to 64 percent for college applications and 78 percent for jobs, when the term "special preference" replaced "special consideration."
When asked the same questions, 74 percent of black and 57 percent of Hispanic respondents endorsed "special consideration to minority students" by colleges. Likewise, 60 percent of young blacks said they supported special consideration for minorities in hiring; Hispanic youths were equally divided on the issue.

Nikkei's Fall Tests Stock Managers

BYLINE: By Jonathan Fuerbringer

 BODY:
THE plunge of Tokyo's blue-chip stock index below 20,000 yesterday made one issue clear: Japan has become the make-or-break bet this year for many global money managers and investors.
If the market now rallies, the Tokyo bears who have pared their holdings in Japan will have a lot of trouble catching up. With only a small share of their portfolios in Japan, they would get only a little lift from a rally, especially if they could not change their position quickly. But the international indexes by which managers are ranked would rise much more because they include a full weighting of the Japanese market. 
 By the same measure, if the market continues to dive, those managers who have been building their stakes recently in anticipation of the bottom will fare poorly.
Unfortunately for all of these managers, the drop below 20,000 for the Nikkei index of 225 issues does not give any real clue about the short-term outlook or whether the "bottom" of the market has been reached, so their decisions have not been made any easier.
Many managers, however, feel the Nikkei will fall further because the broader market gauge, the Topix index of 1,222 stocks, has already dropped to a level that would imply a Nikkei of around 18,000. The only reason the Nikkei has not broken this level, analysts said, was that brokers had bought speculative stocks in the index to try to hold it above 20,000.
"For the average international manager, this is absolutely the make-or-break decision of the year," said Barton Biggs, the global strategist for Morgan Stanley & Company in New York, who recently returned from an Asian trip. "If for any reason the market turns around, they can get killed," he said of the managers who have bailed out. "There is nothing else you can do. You cannot come back."
He said Morgan had "decided that the market is not coming back and had cut its stake in Japan to 10 percent of its international portfolio outside the United States and Canada. The Nikkei should fall through 18,000, and a Bank of Japan interest-rate cut, unless it is real big, won't slow the decline.
"They have to be careful what they do here, because they could be close to a panic situation," he said.
Goldman, Sachs & Company has made the opposite bet. The firm's global portfolio, including the United States, has 31.5 percent in Japan. Charles Elliott, the Japan strategist in London, is a little uncomfortable right now. Two months ago, he recommended building up the position, and he said yesterday's decline had not yet changed his outlook.
"The market just has to end the year 15 percent higher than it is now, and that gain has to be in line with or slightly better than other markets" for the strategy to go O.K., he said. "And that seems reasonable. But it may be a very bumpy ride."
In the Morgan Stanley index of stock markets in Europe, Australia and the Far East, the Tokyo market accounts for 45 percent of the total. So Mr. Biggs's 10 percent weighting is a real bear position.
In The Financial Times index of all world markets, including the United States, Japan's share is 30.7 percent. The Goldman share is now 31.5 percent, which shows a bullish bet. And it is even more optimistic than it seems, because generally money managers do not take on the full Japanese weighting in their portfolios because of that market's volatility and the difficulty of valuing it.
Mr. Elliott said one of the reasons the Nikkei had held above 20,000 until now was the Governmental pressure on brokers to support the stock market by buying. He said this led to the purchase of speculative stocks included in the Nikkei, like the Daito Woolen Spinning and Weaving Company and the Maruzen Department Store Company.
But yesterday, the support for these stocks disappeared. Daito fell 12.5 percent and Maruzen 8.7 percent.
The managers that are staying in the market must have a long-term view. But this is difficult when the Government has not moved to support the economy with a large interest-rate cut or a spending program.
Richard H. King, the manager of the Counsellors International Equity Fund in New York, has been betting on Tokyo since last fall, and it has not yet panned out. He said he is now looking only for stocks that he expects to double or triple over three to five years.
"It certainly is a very good risk reward looking over three to five years," he said. But reflecting the uncertainity of the short term, he added, "Perhaps I should have a few more guts and build up a bit, but I can't in these circumstances."
Mr. Elliott's confidence also requires a lot of patience. He said based on current estimates, Goldman did not expect Japanese business to show a full year of solid earnings growth for two years -- to the end of the Japanese fiscal year in March 1994.
"I find it really hard to know what is going to happen from here," he said. "In the long term, the Japanese market is a really good investment. But we are very cautious about the short term, because the downward momentum is very strong."

HEADLINE: FOOD AID FROM U.S. ARRIVES IN BEIRUT

BYLINE: Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: BEIRUT, Lebanon, March 16

 BODY:
A ship carrying food assistance from the United States docked today at Beirut harbor after Prime Minister Omar Karami warned the country of "economic hard times ahead."
The freighter brought 7,500 tons of rice, wheat, navy beans, lentils and vegetable oil to help 135,000 needy Lebanese families. The consignment will be distributed by charitable institutions in all parts of the country. 
 The supplies arrived at a time of growing need, as the cost of essential commodities here rose sharply in the last four weeks. Heads of many families complained that their income had been eaten up by the inflation and that they were unable to feed their children properly. A recession has pushed thousands of families into poverty.
The American Ambassador, Ryan Crocker, just back from Washington, said additional aid would be given to stricken areas in southern Lebanon. He did not elaborate.
Prime Minister Karami said in a speech on Sunday that Lebanon was going through difficult economic times. Today, he told reporters: "The whole country is threatened. We are striving to save Lebanon."
 
Economic Committee Formed
 He spoke after presiding over a meeting by a newly appointed committee that is supposed to recommend remedies for the ailing economy. The committee consists of eight specialists from the American University of Beirut and other private institutions.
The Prime Minister attributed the crisis to 16-year civil war, but his 30-man Cabinet of national unity formed 16 months ago has come in for sharp criticism from the press and politicians for its handling of the economy.
Mr. Karami said Government efforts would concentrate next on purging the graft-riddled administration and applying a more effective system for collection of taxes. Very few Lebanese paid income taxes during the civil war years. The authorities have quadrupled customs duties on imported cars, alcoholic drinks and cigarettes.
However timely the American food assistance may be, officials here have expressed disappointment over the level of the aid, which they say is too low. The officials, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said the State Department had yet to disburse $30 million in aid approved by Congress for Lebanon for the 1992 fiscal year.

HEADLINE: Past the 'Comfort Zone' at Chrysler

BYLINE: By ADAM BRYANT

 BODY:
By giving up a career at General Motors after 29 years to succeed Lee A. Iacocca as Chrysler's chairman, Robert J. Eaton is taking the biggest risk yet in a career marked by calculated chances.
Most recently, the chief of G.M. Europe delivered sizable profits to bolster G.M.'s ailing domestic operations and quickly pushed the auto maker into new manufacturing and sales operations in Poland and Hungary, where G.M. introduced its first car last week. 
 In the early 1980's, Mr. Eaton was vice president for advanced engineering at G.M. and prodded G.M. to take a chance on new engine-making technology for the fledgling Saturn division. Jay Wetzel, vice president for engineering at Saturn, recalled Mr. Eaton's words from an important strategy meeting: "We need to operate outside our comfort zone to make this thing work."
 
Significant Hurdles
 At the Chrysler Corporation, long Detroit's weakest player, Mr. Eaton will work almost entirely outside his comfort zone.
In announcing yesterday that Mr. Eaton would succeed him at the end of the year, Mr. Iacocca praised Robert A. Lutz, the president of Chrysler, who had wanted the top job. [Page D5.]
Mr. Lutz said he was a team player and would remain at Chrysler, but some analysts questioned whether the new arrangement on the executive floor would last.
From the start, Mr. Eaton faces a fleet of important executives who were the allies of Mr. Lutz. Even Mr. Iacocca said yesterday that Mr. Lutz, who was stripped of the title of chief operating officer, should be credited with bringing to market Chrysler's promising new models like the Dodge Viper and the Jeep Grand Cherokee and a series of midsize cars that will roll into showrooms later this year.
If that kind of politics is not enough for Mr. Eaton, Chrysler also faces large debts in the next few years and an uncertain economy that may continue to dampen auto sales.
But to Mr. Eaton, the risks were worth the chance to run one of America's Big Three auto makers, industry experts said. As one of 35 G.M. vice presidents, the 52-year-old Mr. Eaton probably saw little possibility of ever running the General Motors Corporation.
"It's a numbers game; there are a lot of good people ahead of him at G.M.," said Jack V. Kirnan, an auto analyst at Kidder, Peabody & Company.
In Detroit, Mr. Eaton is considered first and foremost a "product guy," an engineer who thoroughly knows and loves cars. Shortly after settling into his position as head of G.M. Europe in Zurich in 1988, Mr. Eaton told Ward's Auto World magazine: "It's a frustration here that I'm not driving cars," referring to the fact that he was not regularly testing cars as he did as an engineering executive.
 
'A Very Strong Impact'
 Although the considerable progress G.M. Europe made in the last decade in lowering its manufacturing costs and improving its productivity did not begin under Mr. Eaton, he had maintained the momentum.
"The bottom line is Bob did have a very strong impact on the success of G.M. Europe and left a lasting impression; nobody could deny that," said Thomas R. Mason, vice president for sales, service and parts for G.M. Europe.
Some G.M. executives described Mr. Eaton as a friendly, open-minded and thoughtful manager. Charles M. Jordan, G.M.'s vice president for design, said that official visits to his boss's office always made him nervous because a thorough questioning inevitably awaited him. He added that Mr. Eaton typically consulted many people before he made an important decision.
As head of G.M.'s technical staffs in the mid-1980's, Mr. Eaton had to pick the company's head of design. Mr. Eaton spoke to many people throughout the design staff, including Mr. Jordan's secretary, before selecting Mr. Jordan. "You feel like you've been treated fairly," Mr. Jordan said.
In a memo to Chrysler managers yesterday, Mr. Eaton said, "I believe in participatory management, not consensus management." He described participatory management as a leadership style that consults a wide array of views and data and then makes a decision. Consensus management, he said, is not acceptable. It results in decisions "of the lowest common denominator," he added.
Not everyone applauded Mr. Eaton's style. One executive of G.M. Europe, who insisted on anonymity, said Mr. Eaton was occasionally impatient and autocratic. He added that Mr. Eaton had sometimes demonstrated impatience with the teamwork approach in making decisions.
But quick decisions are often required by top executives, as one analyst noted. "Anybody who achieved that kind of success has to be a bit autocratic and a decision maker, but he also seems to be more of a listener than many people at that level," said Jean-Claude Gruet, an analyst at UBS Securities.
 
A Unusual Style
 Indeed, many people who know him said Mr. Eaton was an unusual auto executive because of his low-key style. "He's the least flamboyant guy you'd meet at that level," said David E. Davis, editor of Automobile magazine and a former G.M. executive.
Analysts note that much of the groundwork for G.M.'s revival in Europe was set before Mr. Eaton arrived. The European arm is the most profitable among its competitors there, contributing $1.96 billion in earnings last year that offset record losses by G.M. in North America.
They said Mr. Eaton's mark on European products would only begin to be apparent with new models that will be introduced starting next year.
Mr. Eaton's career is not entirely bright. He headed G.M.'s much ballyhooed but ill-fated X-car program, which involved G.M. in a lawsuit by the Federal Government in 1984. It contended that a brake defect caused the rear wheels to lock in the models, the Pontiac Phoenix, Chevrolet Citation, Oldsmobile Omega and Buick Skylark. After a lengthy trial, G.M. won the case, but sales withered and the cars were redeisgned.
