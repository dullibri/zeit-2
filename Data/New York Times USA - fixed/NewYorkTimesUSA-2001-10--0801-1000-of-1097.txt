HEADLINE: Microsoft's New Operating System Is the First Part of Expanded Internet Services 

BYLINE:  By STEVE LOHR 

 BODY:
Microsoft's Windows XP operating system is set for a big coming-out party in New York on Thursday, where Bill Gates and other leaders of the personal computer industry will gather for a celebration toned down only slightly in the aftermath of Sept. 11.
 The personal computer industry, struggling through a severe slump, is eager for a blockbuster new product that might stir interest and revive sales. And Windows XP is the most significant improvement in Microsoft's industry-dominant operating system since 1995. 
 But Microsoft has a larger agenda. The new operating system is one part of a broader strategy that leans on the company's mainstay -- the personal computer business -- but reaches for the technology to build and deliver a range of new Internet services for consumers and corporations that Microsoft sees as the future of computing. 
The Microsoft view, shared by much of the computer industry, is that most daily logistics -- whether it is a person scheduling dentist appointments or a company ordering supplies -- will increasingly be handled over the Internet. And according to this view, most of those dealings will be done automatically, thanks to fancy software that will leta person's or a company's information interact over the Internet with the dentist's schedule, the supplier's inventory, the airline's reservation system and so on.
The promise of these so-called Web services is a big increase in personal convenience and economic productivity. Their development will come gradually over years, requiring not only new technology and investment, but also rules and systems to assure the privacy and security that might make individuals and companies willing to share information.
Web services will be delivered not only to PC's, but also to cellphones, digital televisions, hand-held computers and video-game consoles. Microsoft is trying to get its software used on all these devices. But these are new markets where, in contrast to the PC industry, Microsoft is not the leader.
"Web services represent a move into a distributed world where no one device and no one piece of software is at the center," said Kevin Werbach, editor of Release 1.0, an industry journal. "Microsoft is betting on a future that doesn't have the PC and Windows at the center of everything."
Yet Microsoft's strategy for Web services borrows heavily from its tried-and-true PC formula. In the PC world, the company built the Windows operating system into a technology "platform" -- the foundation on which millions of software developers, mostly inside companies, have built applications.
To solidify the PC platform, Microsoft supplied developers with the technology building blocks and programming tools to make writing Windows applications easier and faster. Significantly, the company also wrote its own applications for Windows, led by the Word text editing, Excel spreadsheet and Powerpoint presentation programs. Microsoft bundled them in the Office suite, and its office productivity software came to rule that market as well.
The Windows-Office combination became what economists call a "positive feedback loop" -- Windows sales spurred Office sales and vice versa. And that, in turn, prompted outside software developers to write programs that ran on Windows and worked with Office. This outcome, according to Microsoft, is a "thriving ecosystem" that has enormously benefited the PC industry and the economy. To the company's critics, though, the approach amounts to a technological "lock-in" that mainly benefits Microsoft and hobbles competition.
Microsoft has begun developing a software platform, called .Net, for building Web services. And the company hopes that the broad outlines of its success in the PC industry can be repeated. ".Net is really the next operating system to deliver that feedback loop," said Chris Jones, a Microsoft vice president who led the team that developed Windows XP.
Many companies besides Microsoft, including I.B.M., AOL Time Warner, Sun Microsystems and Oracle, are working on the technology needed to develop Web services. But Microsoft has the broadest reach. It has strong positions both in the brand-name technology people see, like the Windows operating system and its popular MSN Web sites, and in the data-serving software that runs network "server" computers, the technology users do not see.
By contrast, AOL has the software for its online service on millions of PC's -- or "client" software, in industry terms. And I.B.M., Sun and Oracle are "server" technology companies. Microsoft is a powerhouse in both the client and server markets, giving it greater influence. 
"We can create that two-way, chicken-and-egg dynamic to build a platform in a way others cannot," said Charles Fitzgerald, director of business development for Microsoft's .Net. 
Windows XP and MSN are delivery vehicles for technology that is crucial to the company's .Net Web services. Windows XP is engineered to work well with two of the essential software technologies for Web services: XML, for Extensible Markup Language, and SOAP, for Simple Object Access Protocol. 
The new operating system also carries and promotes Microsoft's online identification system, called Passport. Online identification and authentication is necessary for the data exchange envisioned in Web services, but Passport has brought criticism from privacy advocates concerned about one company's handling the personal data of millions of people.
The MSN online service on Thursday is going to begin offering some basic Web services called .Net Alerts. Already, MSN, AOL and Yahoo have been able to deliver simple text messages to users PC's, cell phones or pagers like scores for a favorite sports team or selected stock prices. The .Net Alerts are a more elaborate version of such updates, based on Microsoft's .Net technology. For example, a person might type in the addresses of his or her daily commute and typical time on the road. If there is a traffic-snarling crash on the route, the person could receive a cell phone message as a warning to avoid it.
"We will write applications that popularize the .Net platform," said Yusuf Mehdi, vice president of MSN. "And we're just starting to do some of that now."
Next year is to see the big introduction of Microsoft's personalized Web services, which the company now refers to as .Net MyServices, having dropped the previous, ominous label Hailstorm. .Net MyServices is supposed to offer a full range of notification, calendar, contacts and wallet features. "It's a whole new space and pure innovation on Microsoft's part," said Bob Muglia, group vice president for personal services. 
But success is not guaranteed for the overall .Net initiative. The Web services vision, broadly, is to transform the Web from a medium mainly for viewing and downloading into a genuine computing platform. That is, a "programmable" medium, in which more data that can be manipulated and programmed is transported across the Internet to do all kinds of useful things.
The problem for Microsoft is that making the Web programmable is precisely why Java, the Internet programming language created by Sun Microsystems, was developed in 1995. Today most of the software developers writing Web applications that run on networks use Java. The Java camp includes I.B.M., Sun, Oracle, BEA and others in the race to develop Web services technology.
".Net is essentially trying to displace the incumbent model," said Greg Papadopoulos, Sun's chief technology officer. "Most developers on the Web are using the industry-standard Java model."
Microsoft's answer to Java is a new programming language of its own, C# -- as in the musical notation for C-sharp. The company says that C#, combined with other tools, should make it easier for the mainstream of programmers, including Windows developers, to create Web services. Turning over a new leaf for a new environment, Microsoft insists its new development platform is based on open, industry standards -- not Windows or other proprietary Microsoft technology.
Many developers are skeptical. And the long-running antitrust case against Microsoft certainly did not help the company's image with developers, because it showed, and the courts ruled, that Microsoft did not deal fairly with Netscape, a smaller software developer.
"Microsoft's pitch to developers is greatly weakened because of that," said Dave Winer, co-author of SOAP and chief executive of UserLand, a developer of Web tools. "Microsoft's only vision is lock-in."

Attacks and War Come to Comics
The events of the last six weeks have challenged creators of comic strips. Some have responded by avoiding references to terrorism and patriotic fervor. Others, like Aaron McGruder, the creator of "The Boondocks," have tackled those topics head on. Some newspapers temporarily pulled "The Boondocks" or moved it away from the other comics because of its content. Although many strips are avoiding any allusion to the attacks or the war in Afghanistan, others are sharing Mr. McGruder's impulse to comment on the news. C9.

As it has in the past, CNN has struck a deal for pictures and interviews that its domestic competitors cannot obtain. These rivals have tried to use such agreements against it, implying that CNN is willing to cozy up to anti-United States regimes. Rivals have made no specific accusations this time, but they are quietly raising CNN's past once again in the hope that the network will refrain from such deals. C2.

Registration for .Biz Is Delayed
Open registration for Internet addresses ending in .biz, scheduled to begin tomorrow, has been postponed to Nov. 7, according to the company that manages the .biz database, NeuLevel. The company said .biz had been delayed to allow more time to test the registration system. But the rollout has also been hindered by a lawsuit contending that a preliminary process for distributing the names constituted an illegal lottery. C3.

An Easy Means of Prevention: A Flu Shot

BYLINE:  By JANE E. BRODY

 BODY:
While millions of Americans fret over the threat of anthrax spread by terrorists, they may ignore another infectious disease that will soon descend on the country and probably claim tens of thousands of lives. That disease is influenza. And while an anthrax vaccine is not available to the general public, a flu vaccine is, and it can prevent a vast majority of cases of influenza and the death and disability they can cause.
 In a typical year, 10 percent to 20 percent of Americans come down with influenza, 200,000 people are hospitalized and more than 20,000 die from flu-related complications. Most of this can be prevented by a shot that costs $10 to $15. 
 So whether or not you are anxious about anthrax, you would be wise to follow the most current flu prevention guidelines. These guidelines are issued each year by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to assure that those most at risk of suffering severe and potentially fatal consequences of the flu are protected first, before the rest of the population depletes supplies of vaccine. 
Vaccine availability varies from year to year because it must be made anew each summer and fall to protect against the viral strains likely to cause the greatest problems in the coming winter. For example, this season's vaccine will protect against three viral strains: A/Moscow, A/New Caledonia and B/Sichuan; the Moscow and Sichuan strains were not in last year's vaccine. And while there was an extended delay in vaccine production last fall, a delay is not expected this year. Still, there is a limit to how much vaccine can be available at any one time.
Now is the time for those at highest risk to get their flu shots. If past years are any indication, at best only 60 percent of Americans most likely to become hospitalized or to die as a result of the flu will get the shot.
And with so much attention now focused on anthrax, chances are flu vaccine percentages will take a big hit this season, resulting in a greater toll than usual on the health of Americans and the economic well-being of a nation already under financial stress.

Whom to Immunize and When
The newest guidelines from the disease control centers establish an immunization timetable that calls for people with the greatest risk of serious complications from the flu to be protected first -- now, in October. Those who should get the vaccine without delay include the following: 
*Everyone over 65. As people age, their ability to fight off infections wanes and they become more susceptible to complications like pneumonia, which can be life-threatening. Even if an older person's immune system fails to respond strongly enough to the vaccine to prevent the flu, the vaccine can reduce the severity of the illness and lower the risk of serious complications.
*Anyone with a chronic medical condition: heart or lung disease, including asthma; diabetes; kidney disease; liver disease; chronic anemia; or chronic malignant conditions like leukemia and lymphoma, as well as people with AIDS and those who are H.I.V. positive.
*People receiving treatments that suppress the body's ability to ward off infections: those taking high levels of corticosteroids for conditions like rheumatoid arthritis and ulcerative colitis; those undergoing treatments like chemotherapy or radiation treatments for cancer; and organ transplant recipients who take drugs to prevent rejection.
*Children and teenagers who must take aspirin for long periods, since they may develop a serious illness called Reye's syndrome if they come down with a viral illness like influenza.
*All women who will be in the second or third trimester of pregnancy (months four through nine) during the flu season, which in North America starts in November and usually lasts through March. 
*All health care personnel who minister to high-risk people, whether in a hospital, nursing home, outpatient clinic or home, since if caretakers contract the flu they could readily transmit it to someone likely to become seriously ill.
Next in line for flu shots, to be administered in November, are those at lesser risk of complications or of causing illness in others at higher risk.
*Healthy people between 50 and 65. Last year, the C.D.C. added middle-aged healthy people to the list of those at higher than usual risk of flu complications after studies showed that hospitalizations and deaths associated with the flu start rising considerably at age 50. 
*Household members who live with people 65 and older or with anyone with a chronic medical condition (see the list above), since they could increase the risk to those more vulnerable to flu complications. 
*Anyone else, including children, who would like to avoid getting the flu.
Many people were long under the impression that flu vaccine was only suitable for older people, when it has always been true that anyone of any age can benefit from it. In fact, the younger you are, the more effective the vaccine is likely to be.
Further, a study over several years in Japan showed that immunizing children against the flu protected older people because children were the primary vectors of the disease. Lacking immunity to flu viruses, children are most likely to acquire the virus, spread it among themselves and transmit it to others.

Vaccine Concerns
Some people should not get the flu vaccine. Anyone with an allergy to eggs (the vaccine virus is grown in chick embryos, and traces of egg may remain in the finished vaccine) and anyone who has had an allergic reaction or who developed Guillain-Barre syndrome (a condition causing paralysis of involuntary muscles) after a previous flu shot should not get the vaccine. Also, people who are sick and have fevers should wait until they recover before getting the vaccine. On the other hand, having a minor illness like a cold or a seasonal allergy is not a reason to delay a flu shot.
Typical side effects of a flu shot are soreness at the injection site and sometimes a low fever and achiness. There are people who avoid the vaccine because they say that previous immunizations gave them the flu. This is not possible, since the vaccine is prepared with killed virus that cannot multiply in the body.
But people totally lacking immunity to one or more of the viral strains in the vaccine may experience a reaction lasting two or three days that resembles a mild case of the flu. Unlike an actual case of influenza, this vaccine reaction, though it may be temporarily debilitating, is not dangerous, and infectious disease specialists say it should not deter someone at high risk of flu complications from being immunized.
Others hesitate to get the vaccine because they don't like shots. Unfortunately, although tests of a nasal spray vaccine called FluMist have shown it to be highly effective, the company that makes it, Aviron of Mountain View, Calif., is not yet ready to market it because the Food and Drug Administration is not yet convinced of its safety.
For people who cannot or will not get the flu vaccine, there are several prescription drugs available that can either help to prevent the flu or reduce the severity of an attack.
Two preventives that can also reduce symptoms of Type A influenza are amantadine (Symmetrel and generic versions) and rimantadine (Flumadine). Two drugs that can reduce symptoms of both Type A and Type B influenza are zanamivir (Relenza) and oseltamivir (Tamiflu).

HEADLINE: Anthrax Offers Lessons in How to Handle Bad News 

BYLINE:  By ERICA GOODE 

 BODY:
In recent decades, social scientists have learned much about how government authorities can best inform and reassure an anxious public faced with a new and unfamiliar threat.
 But in their initial handling of the anthrax crisis, government leaders did almost everything wrong, according to psychologists and other researchers. 
 The experts offered four guidelines for minimizing panic and helping people adapt to changed circumstances:
*Adopt a policy of full disclosure about what is and is not known and deliver information in a nonpatronizing manner.
*Avoid speculation and never mix facts with reassurance. 
*Give a detailed accounting of what is being done to counter the threat.
*Recommend specific steps that people may take to protect themselves.
In the days after the first anthrax case was discovered in Florida, government officials often violated all of these precepts, the experts said.
Health and law enforcement authorities made confident statements that later proved false, tried simultaneously to inform and reasssure, and limited the flow of information to the public. Agencies issued conflicting statements. Officials speculated about what had happened or what might happen. And they simultaneously warned Americans about vague dangers while urging them to go about their lives.
"I must say the Bush administration has not done a good job of reassuring the public," said Dr. Jonathan B. Tucker, a bioterrorism expert in the Washington office of the Monterey Institute for International Studies. "There is a real need for a communication strategy."
The news media, acting both as the vehicle of official communications and as their interpreter, did not help matters either, some experts said. Hype and worst-case theorizing were common. Many news outlets labeled as "cases" people who had been exposed to anthrax, inflating the scope of the crisis. And reporting about hundreds of anthrax scares across the country did not always make clear that most were a result of hoaxes or misplaced fears.
These early failures, the experts said, in some cases undermined the credibility of officials and might have increased the public's fear. 
In recent days, the federal government has taken some corrective measures, trying to offer a more unified communications front and specifically addressing the anxiety induced by the anthrax attacks. On Thursday, Tom Ridge, the Bush administration's new domestic security chief, flanked by representatives of health and law enforcement agencies, faced journalists' questions.
Dr. David Satcher, the surgeon general, began to offer specific advice on what people could do to minimize their risk. And the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention for the first time gave physicians the detailed information they needed to identify and treat people infected.
Michael A. Wermuth, a policy analyst at the RAND Corporation and executive director of the Gilmore Commission, which advises Congress on the nation's ability to respond to terrorism, said that in a December 2000 report, the commission had recommended that government officials draft a coherent plan for communicating with the public after a terrorist attack.
"Nothing obvious was done," Mr. Wermuth said. "The government just hasn't recognized before recent events how important it is to lay the groundwork ahead of time."
The government's response immediately after anthrax appeared gave little hint of any planning.
Among the most egregious lapses, many experts noted, were erroneous statements by Tommy G. Thompson, the nation's secretary of health and human services, and various lawmakers. Mr. Thompson said the first anthrax victim, Robert Stevens, might have contracted inhalation anthrax in the woods on a visit to North Carolina, an assertion quickly dismissed as improbable by many health experts.
Senator Tom Daschle, the majority leader, incorrectly described members of his staff as "infected." And J. Dennis Hastert, the speaker of the House, told reporters that the ventilation system in the Capitol complex had been contaminated with anthrax spores, though specialists in biological warfare and building design called that "extremely unlikely."
In contrast, several experts cited New York City's mayor, Rudolph W. Giuliani, who held daily press conferences about the city's anthrax exposures, as providing a model for how a crisis might be most effectively handled. They said the mayor had consistently done the right thing: appeal to people's most rational selves.
"People have these two sides," said Dr. George Loewenstein, a professor of economics and psychology at Carnegie Mellon. One, he said, "is the rational side which says only one person has died so far."
The irrational side views anthrax as a terrifying and unpredictable microbe likely to kill large numbers of people without warning.
Officials can help people hold onto a rational assessment of the threat by constantly putting numbers in context. For example, in giving the number of people exposed to the bacteria, they may underline how many hundreds of millions of Americans have not been exposed.
Admitting what is not known is far better than succumbing to the temptation to make firm but unfounded declarations in an attempt to reassure, Dr. Loewenstein and other experts said.
"People can absorb a lot more uncertainty than officials give them credit for being able to absorb," said Dr. Sheila Jasanoff, a professor of science and public policy at Harvard, and a pattern of false reassurances undermines public trust.
"Shooting from the hip with a definite answer is not a clever way to go," she said. "It's more credible to say, 'We can't yet make predictions about this or statements about that.' "
Officials in countries where terrorism is a fact of life have already learned that lesson.
In Israel, for example, officials are careful to separate information about what has occurred from statements aimed at reassuring the populace, according to Dr. Arieh Shalev, a psychiatrist at Hadassah University Hospital in Jerusalem.
"Information always has to be seen as accurate and reliable and not contaminated by efforts to encourage people," Dr. Shalev said.
He added that even in Israel, after each escalation in the level of terrorist threat, it had taken several months for people's fears to abate.
After terrorists began attacking buses, for example, "no one took a public bus," Dr. Shalev said, "and then progressively people started taking buses again."
Yet in the long run, he added, Israelis have proved extraordinarily resilient.
"We all need a degree of denial to survive," Dr. Shalev said. "You would think Jerusalem would be deserted but it's not. You can terrorize a people for some time but you cannot terrorize a whole nation for a long time."
Dr. Jasanoff said that American officials might also benefit from the experience of the British government in dealing with mad cow disease, a crisis that shared certain parallels with the current anthrax threat.
Dr. Jasanoff, who made a case study of the British experience, said government officials early offered categorical reassurances about the disease that turned out to be without basis. 
In one case, a cabinet minister publicly fed a hamburger to his child, in an effort to demonstrate that there was no danger. The incident later became a favorite of cartoonists, who used it as a metaphor for the force-feeding of information to the public.
Ultimately, Dr. Jasanoff said, it was a nongovernment British group, the Consumers' Association, that provided people with specific precautions they could take depending on their tolerance for risk. Those who wanted to avoid risk altogether, for example, might stop eating beef. People who wished to be cautious but were less fearful might stay away from ground beef, the form most likely to contain infectious particles.
"They understood the psychology of where the consumers were coming from a lot better than the public health officials," Dr. Jasanoff said.
The next weeks will offer the authorities in the United States the chance to recover their bearings.
"We are in a new situation," said Dr. Baruch Fischhoff, a professor of social and decision sciences at Carnegie Mellon. "People are trying to figure out what's going on and they need to be able to build up a coherent mental model of how big the risks are, so that they can decide what to do."
The events of the last weeks, said Dr. Arthur Kleinman, a professor of anthropology and psychiatry at Harvard, have posed "a fundamental emotional, intellectual and moral challenge" to a country unused to vulnerability.
No one yet knows, Dr. Kleinman said, exactly how the anthrax attacks fit with any larger terrorist scheme. Nor is it clear if they are prelude or final act.
"It would be foolhardy to hide this uncertainty from people," he said. "It's very early to be able to come to any conclusions."

To the Editor:
Re "Pataki Pledges 'Bold Steps' and Job Cuts" (news article, Oct. 17): 
 Gov. George E. Pataki should take an additional bold step to keep New York's economy secure: he should propose to restore higher education cuts found in the bare-bones state budget. Mr. 
Pataki proposed, and state lawmakers approved, cuts to higher education assistance intended for students who rely on child care in order to attend classes and for students who need additional financial and mentoring help to succeed in college. 
 New York's economy is based on offering employers a highly trained and diverse work force. Cuts to higher education not only deny a college education to students most in need, they can also harm the state's economy.

HEADLINE: Ripple Effect From Attack: Suppliers Have No Demand 

BYLINE:  By CATHY HORYN

 BODY:
In the 40 years that Bik Ka Ng has been manufacturing clothes, he has never heard sewing machines come more swiftly to a halt than they did after Sept. 11. The owner of a factory at 148 Lafayette Street, which produces trousers for stores like Ann Taylor and Brooks Brothers, Mr. Ng has had to lay off 60 sewers, and there is not enough work for his remaining 100 employees.
 "If I have to lay off more people, then I will have to lay off myself," Mr. Ng, the father of three children, two of whom are in college, said last Thursday as workers guided khaki trouser legs through machines and spoke softly in Chinese. "We'll close." 
 When people don't buy clothes, stores react by canceling or postponing orders, as Ann Taylor did shortly after the Sept. 11 attacks for a delivery of 25,000 pairs of pants from Mr. Ng's factory, Antares Sportswear. And when manufacturers and designers have fewer garments to produce, they react by cutting orders to suppliers of fabrics and trims. This has been the chain reaction running through the garment industry since the attacks, with one sector after another reeling from the same seismic jolt. 
"We got calls from clients immediately after the trade center disaster," said Stuart Meyer, an owner of Stanley Pleating, which produces needlework for fashion houses and Broadway costume shops. "First, it was 'Stuart, instead of the 50 garments we ordered, reduce it to 30.' Then it was 'Stuart, cancel the order.' " Mr. Meyer has laid off two of his 15 employees. Another supplier of trims, who asked not to be identified, said he has let go half of his staff. His business is down by nearly 40 percent.
Apparel is the largest manufacturing industry in New York, with annual revenues of $9 billion, employing more than 78,000 people in garment and textile factories from Midtown to Brooklyn, according to the Federal Labor Department. Already hurt by a steady loss of jobs to foreign manufacturers -- a 20 percent decline since 1991 -- garment makers and suppliers have seen a large downturn since mid-September. 
"Every single factory that we've had contact with has laid off workers or reduced their hours," said Steven Weingarten, industry development director at the Union of Needle Trades, or Unite, in New York. There's no exact figure yet for layoffs from the city or the union, but the union said that in Chinatown, where there are 12,000 garment workers, factories are operating at less than 50 percent capacity. Because of the weakening economy, part of that slump was under way before Sept. 11. 
A survey by one trade group gives a more close-up view of the grim picture. "Just among my members, which includes 150 contractors with a total of 11,000 employees, about half of their workers are either on part-time or have been laid off," said Teddy Lai, director of the Greater Blouse, Skirt and Undergarment Association. "In the two weeks after the trade center tragedy, we lost $3 million in business. And for the next three months, we're projecting a loss of $22 million." 
At 148 Lafayette, which is the address for several factories as well as the name of a fashion brand, manufacturing orders have fallen by 50 percent, said Deirdre Quinn, who is part of a consortium of owners in the building that make clothes for clients like Talbot's and Neiman Marcus. Of 450 employees on three floors, 155 have been laid off, Ms. Quinn said. 
This is the story one hears -- from Chinatown lofts that make humble khakis to Seventh Avenue showrooms that sell fancy French lace. "Instead of ordering 500 yards per color, clients are asking for 60 yards," said Francois Damide, whose firm, Solstiss Bucol, sells lace and silk to designers like Donna Karan and Prada. "Or they're not placing any orders." Like other suppliers, Mr. Damide is being asked for discounts.
"In places where we have tourist traffic, nobody is shopping," said Bud Konheim, president of Nicole Miller, estimating that sales in his SoHo boutique are down as much as 80 percent. "Miami? It's a disaster. But in Boca, it's not bad." He added: "The business will come out of this in a new direction -- I don't know what yet -- but there are going to be design changes for sure. Tastes are changing. The appetite for high prices is waning. Extravagance is not what people are in the mood for."
With fewer events to dress up for, New York socialites aren't buying elaborate gowns. "We're having a very hard time with evening," said Robert Burke, the fashion director of Bergdorf Goodman. 
The evening-wear designers Mark Badgely and James Mischka, who make popular red-carpet gowns under the label Badgely Mischka, were able to deliver fall clothes before stores canceled orders -- but since then they have seen shoppers retreat.
"It's true that there's always going to be customers who will not be affected by the economy, but right under them is a huge tier of people who are cautious about spending," Mr. Badgely said. "And when they're holding back, you really feel it." Not surprisingly they are seeing more demand for less-embellished cocktail suits and simple evening separates. 
For all the attention that fashion conglomerates receive, the reality, at least in New York, is that much of the business is conducted by small companies. About 80 percent of the wholesale trade in New York is made up of firms with fewer than 20 employees, according to the Fashion Center Business Improvement District. And with inventories adding bulges to bottom lines and stores trimming spring orders, even as they demand on-time deliveries, this only intensifies the pressure on small suppliers and struggling young designers.
"I was so excited this season because I had finally made good retail connections," said the designer Alice Roi, who had buyers from stores like Harrods and Colette, the Paris boutique, at her Sept. 9 show. "But they're not coming back. 'Send us a package,' they said." Which Ms. Roi did, at a cost of $2,000 to numerous out-of-town buyers who left New York after Sept. 11 without placing orders. A swatch card in the mail, however, doesn't compare to a buying appointment. And now Ms. Roi has the extra worry that stores will cancel her orders if she doesn't meet delivery deadlines. 
"Nobody is sitting around," said Michael Pellegrino, the president of Anna Sui, where business is down 20 percent from a year ago. "The challenge is to react in a way that doesn't give us excess inventory. We're taking stock and samples and turning them into money and not a liability." He's taken the bold step (for a small company) of committing to fabrics before he has firm orders, but at least he'll be assured, he said, of having goods on hand to meet delivery deadlines. And he is looking with new fondness at regional trade shows, like those in Dallas and Atlanta. "Even if we only get three orders, it's worth the plane trip," he said. 
These are precarious times for fashion, but in the long run, retailers and designers say, they may actually be good for business. "There's been too much of the same thing, and it just doesn't work," said Linda Dresner, who owns stores in New York and Birmingham, Mich. "It's not a free-for-all anymore. We really need to be more sensible about what the fashion business means."
To Hamish Morrow, a British designer who flew in as Bendel's guest for the opening last week of the "London Fashion" exhibition at the Fashion Institute of Technology, a weaker economy may be an impetus for creative young designers, who, after all, have little to risk. "There's nothing to downsize," he said. "And bigger companies need to penetrate the psyche of a lot of people to sell clothes." 
Shelly Steffee is hoping for such a break. A former Anne Klein assistant, she opened a boutique selling her own designs on Gansevoort Street in the meatpacking district last month. She reasoned that if department stores are going to become more selective about what they order and are unwilling to take chances on unproved talent in a contracting market, she might as well take the plunge and open her boutique. 
Besides, she said, "There's never a good time to start a business."

HEADLINE: 30% Drop in Profit Leads SBC To Job and Web Project Cuts 

BYLINE:  Bloomberg News 

DATELINE: SAN ANTONIO, Oct. 22 

 BODY:
SBC Communications said here today that its third-quarter profit fell 30 percent and that it would eliminate several thousand jobs and reduce spending on an Internet project.
 Profit totaled $2.1 billion, or 61 cents a share, compared with $3 billion, or 88 cents a share, in the quarter a year earlier. Revenue rose less than 1 percent, to $13.5 billion, including SBC's 60 percent share of Cingular Wireless. SBC did not specify how many of its 216,000 workers would be let go. 
 In the quarter, SBC had a $73 million pension-settlement gain. The period a year earlier included a $1.1 billion gain mainly from selling investments in Europe, a spokesman, Larry Solomon, said. Without special items, profit in the recent quarter would have been $2 billion, or 59 cents a share. On that basis, analysts surveyed by Thomson Financial/ First Call had forecast a profit of 60 cents a share. 
SBC and other phone companies are cutting costs as the pace of sales slows. Companies in SBC's 13-state region have laid off more than 160,000 workers, the SBC chief executive, Edward E. Whitacre Jr., said during a conference call. Fewer customers are ordering services like fast Web access and caller ID, the company said.
Shares of SBC -- whose service area includes the Southwest, Midwest and California -- fell $2.24 today, or 5.1 percent, to $41.40.
SBC is the latest telecommunications company to reduce spending and cut back projects started when its stock price was rising. Last week, BellSouth and Sprint said they would lay off workers. Sprint lowered its spending forecasts and will eliminate 6,000 jobs and a phone-and-data project. BellSouth is cutting 3,000 jobs.
Cingular Wireless, the mobile phone company, is a venture of SBC and BellSouth. Excluding Cingular, SBC's revenue fell 16 percent, to $11.3 billion.
Phone lines declined by more than 300,000 from the second quarter, to 60.2 million, SBC said.
The company forecasts profit per share before one-time items this year at the bottom of its previous estimate of $2.35 to $2.40. SBC had lowered forecasts three times this year.
"We don't see anything that would indicate a quick turnaround in the economy," Mr. Whitacre said. "It's going to be difficult to get any meaningful momentum" in sales. He declined to forecast next year's results.
SBC will cut back a project that was to make fast Web access available to 77 million people by the end of next year. In October 1999, Mr. Whitacre said SBC would spend $6 billion building the project, known as Pronto. It may offer the service to 10 percent fewer people, officials said during the conference call.

HEADLINE: State Restores Scholarship Aid For 295 in the National Guard 

BYLINE:  By RICHARD PEREZ-PENA

DATELINE: ALBANY, Oct. 22 

 BODY:
Legislative leaders and Gov. George E. Pataki agreed today to pay for college scholarships for National Guard members who were denied the aid because the program had run out of money. 
 On learning last week that 295 guard members had not received the scholarships they expected, Senator Joseph L. Bruno, the majority leader, and the Assembly speaker, Sheldon Silver, said they wanted the state to pay for them. 
 But the governor's office wavered, noting that between the recession and the destruction of the World Trade Center, the state faced a multibillion-dollar budget shortfall and that hundreds of programs were vying for the state's limited resources.
Today, Mr. Pataki said, "Maybe there wasn't an absolute legal guarantee that anyone who signed up for the National Guard would be able to get the free tuition, but I believe that we made a moral guarantee."
The state budget allocated $3 million for the program, which promises up to $3,400 a year -- full tuition at a State University of New York campus -- to anyone who signs up for the National Guard or Naval Militia, or who extends an enlistment in those services. But this semester, for the first time, more people qualified for the assistance than the program could afford.
The state, which gave the scholarships to 1,648 students, notified 295 others in early September that they would not receive money. Days later, after the trade center attack, many guard units, including some of those who had members who were denied scholarships, were called to active duty.
Legislators said they expected to pass a bill this week allocating more than $300,000 to cover the remaining students.

HEADLINE: Rubin Will Be an Adviser, if Green Wins 

BYLINE:  By LESLIE EATON

 BODY:
Mark Green, the Democratic candidate for mayor, will announce today that Robert E. Rubin, the Citigroup executive and former treasury secretary, will serve as a senior adviser to his administration.
 Should Mr. Green be elected mayor, Mr. Rubin will lead a business advisory council that will help shape Mr. Green's economic and financial policies. He will also help out in Washington, where he has recently re-emerged as a powerful force in Congressional deliberations on how to stimulate the weakening economy. Mr. Rubin was traveling in Korea and could not be reached for comment yesterday. 
 Mr. Green's announcement comes as political and business leaders have begun expressing concern about what they fear is a weakening commitment from the federal government to help New York City recover from the World Trade Center Disaster. 
Gov. George E. Pataki's $54 billion aid request, which included a grab-bag of items like a high-speed rail link to Schenectady, has been increasingly rejected by Congressional and administration officials.
Michael R. Bloomberg, the Republican candidate for mayor, has not named an official advisory council, a spokesman said.
Mr. Rubin has extensive Washington experience -- he served as Treasury secretary in the Clinton administration and before that was the first chairman of the National Economic Council, which coordinates federal economic policy. But he is also a leading figure on Wall Street, where he was co-chairman of Goldman Sachs until 1993, and since 1999 has been a senior executive of Citigroup.
Mr. Green said he would name other members to his advisory council, but announced only one yesterday: Peter J. Solomon, the investment banker who was deputy mayor for economic development in the Koch administration.
Mr. Solomon said that in many ways the situation the new mayor will face "is very similar to the issues we faced in the mid-70's in terms of finance and economic development."
How much of a role the council will play in a new administration remained unclear. "Everybody who's ever served on an advisory group is skeptical about what its role is," Mr. Solomon said, adding that he and Mr. Rubin "were at least born three days ago. We'll see. We'll be willing to help."

HEADLINE: Terror in the Mail 

 BODY:
The war keeps expanding. Some 800,000 postal employees entrusted with 680 million pieces of mail daily now find themselves on the front lines in the struggle against terror. Two of their colleagues who worked in Washington's central processing facility have died of what is believed to have been anthrax inhalation. Two other workers at the facility, where the contaminated letter sent to Senator Tom Daschle's office was processed, have been hospitalized with anthrax in their lungs. 
 These new developments raise disturbing questions about the potency and transmissibility of the anthrax being sent through the mail. It should also trigger a comprehensive and determined response on the part of the Postal Service and Congress to ensure the safety of employees and the continued reliability of America's 226-year-old mail service. 
 Terrorists have taken aim at the vitality of our famously restless nation. First they commandeered commercial aviation to serve as an instrument of terror. Now someone is attempting to do the same with the nation's mail system. These crucial economic lifelines are as much targets as weapons. Paralyzing America's travel and communication networks would amount to a terrorist triumph.
This need not happen. Air traffic has picked up considerably since the immediate aftermath of Sept. 11, under a new set of stringent security measures. Likewise, public resources must also be marshaled to safeguard the nation's stream of mail, and Americans' trust in it. 
The Postal Service is sending cards this week to 147 million addresses advising people on how to recognize and deal with suspicious mail. It is now clear that it must go further and assume primary responsibility for guarding against harmful parcels and letters. It must also investigate a range of measures to protect its own employees.
At their afternoon press conference yesterday, Tom Ridge and John Potter, the postmaster general, said they would seek to deploy systems capable of sanitizing the mail with sufficient doses of radiation to disable anthrax spores. The best choice would be a system that can disable anthrax not just on the surface of envelopes but contained within the envelopes as well. Some potential technologies that will be explored are widely used to protect the nation's food supplies and to sterilize medical equipment, but it may take years to design, produce and install systems at major mail-sorting facilities. Postal authorities might also consider flooding the workplace with enough ultraviolet radiation to disable any anthrax floating in the air without harming workers. That would protect the workers, but not affect anthrax within an envelope. 
Current anxieties may increase people's use of electronic communications, but the country will still have to pay more for a reliable physical mail system, however shrunken. Even before the need for heightened security became apparent, the postmaster general had proposed a three-cent increase in the price of a first class stamp and had projected an alarming $1.6 billion operating deficit for 2001. Few people noticed; the announcement was made early on Sept. 11. The Postal Service will now have to set aside cost-cutting programs and Congress must provide the resources for a new long-term security overhaul, as it must also do in the aviation arena. 
In the immediate future, postal employees can be protected by masks already on the market that are capable of screening out particles less than a micron in size. That makes them able to screen out any anthrax spores in the range deemed most dangerous for causing inhalational anthrax.
The Postal Service must also carry out spot tests of facilities and employees across the country, to boost both security and confidence. If necessary, the mail system may have to shut down for a few days to take a security inventory, much as the nation's commercial aviation system did. This would not be a surrender to terror but an opportunity to shore up the nation's defenses for the long struggle that lies ahead.

HEADLINE: In Tougher Times, It's a Life of Affluence Minus Trimmings; 
For Retailers Of Luxury Goods, Business Has Dried Up

BYLINE:  By CONSTANCE L. HAYS 

 BODY:
Stylish sales people spend their days in idleness. Consumers get mailers promising them money back if they will just come in and buy something. Stores that once were havens for the elite and those who felt they belonged in their company are ghost towns, their products on display but hardly in demand.
 The world has ceased to be a happy place for retailers who specialize in $1,000 leather jackets, $50,000 diamond earrings and handbags that declare their owners have reached a certain financial pinnacle. Across the country, traffic at stores that sell luxury goods has slowed to a trickle. 
 From the canyons of Midtown Manhattan to the sleek malls of Beverly Hills, sales of luxury products, after years of spectacular growth, are in decline for the first time in a decade. What once seemed a badge of status craved by many -- the latest Prada pants, the newest Gucci carryall -- now seems, to affluent shoppers across the country, oddly out of place. 
The wealthy continue to spend, but they are shying away from ostentatious purchases. They are buying less for themselves and more for their homes and families. "They can live more abstemiously, if you will," said Timothy Brock, a professor of consumer psychology at Ohio State University, "and in that way express solidarity with people who have actually suffered quite a lot."
Indeed, instead of obsessing about trends and fashion, said Michael Cunningham, a psychology professor at the University of Louisville in Kentucky, consumers are more preoccupied with basic concerns.
Owning a Gucci bag was once marketed as "what all the best people do," he said. "So you become one of the best people by buying into the club." But since the terrorist attacks, priorities have changed.
"People have a hierarchy of motives, with the lowest being air, water and food, followed by safety and security," he said. "Above that is belongingness and self-esteem. People have been knocked out of thinking about self-esteem and are now thinking about safety and security."
Unlike other retailers, who can move to a fairly straightforward strategy of publicly cutting prices in response to lagging sales, luxury stores have their business and identity tied up in the notion that their brands are worth a premium price. They cannot suddenly decide to offer 50 percent discounts without cheapening their image over the long run.
"In some ways, the best thing to do is just wait, and hope they can survive until the economy turns around," said Lynn Kahle, a marketing expert at the University of Oregon. "If you cut prices too much, then people think, well, it wasn't worth that much after all."
A recent late-afternoon tour of several luxury stores in Manhattan turned up plenty of new merchandise, but few people eager to buy it. The third floor of Tiffany's flagship store on Fifth Avenue was so devoid of customers that the security guards felt comfortable openly discussing Derek Jeter and the Yankees' World Series prospects.
Along East 57th Street, home to stores like Coach, Dior and Chanel, the sales help outnumbered customers and, in some cases, were the only people visible in the stores, peering out into the street at the pedestrians. Four were on hand at Bottega Veneta, a luxury leather-goods shop on Madison Avenue; two were reading magazines. The Gucci store on Fifth Avenue had five customers. On the sixth floor at Barneys, where items like a $498 hooded sweater abound, perhaps four shoppers were strolling around. 
Luxury retailers who have staked claims in suburban malls as well as metropolitan shopping areas were already feeling pinched before the attacks. As early as the spring, sales began to falter as the dot-com bubble burst. And when the stock market kept sagging, and once-proud industries like telecommunications, technology and investment banking began laying off workers, demand for luxury goods withered even more.
Most of the growth that companies like Tiffany, Gucci and Prada feasted on in the 1990's came from people whose net worth rose with the stock market rather than from those with established wealth. This year, as the market plunged, those customers felt less able to afford a new Kelly bag or another pair of fine calfskin loafers.
"A psychology of caution emerges, so that people become cautious about spending even if their own position is secure," Professor Kahle said. "It's kind of a self-fulfilling prophesy."
Those nouveau luxury shoppers were the ones that many companies counted on for growth.
"In the 90's, these companies really expanded their customer base beyond rich people, who are less affected by business cycles than other people," said Carl Steidtmann, chief economist for Deloitte Research. "The new segment was made up of status seekers, the wealthy wannabes. And they are the ones pulling back. The more successful a company was in the 90's, the larger that volatile segment was as a share of their business."
About 12 percent of Tiffany's total sales come from its flagship store on Fifth Avenue, which was hit hard by the pullback from luxury goods. The company's sales fell 10 percent worldwide in the third quarter of this year, dropping 19 percent in the United States.
"I can't remember when it was ever this bad," said Richard Baum, a senior retail analyst for Credit Suisse First Boston.
Tiffany executives began the year expecting a slowdown and trimmed costs where they could. The Sept. 11 attacks added "another level of weakness" to already diminished expectations, said Michael Kowalski, the chief executive.
But the outlook continues to be positive, he insisted. "We really intend to maintain our course," he said. "We will continue to open stores. Our new-product introduction plans will continue as formulated. Our advertising plans are unchanged. And certainly, we are not going to have a sale."
At Gucci, a unit of Pinault-Printemps-Redoute that includes Yves Saint Laurent, Bottega Veneta and Gucci, sales are expected to be flat this year. The company had forecast growth of 10 percent worldwide. In the United States, business was down 3 percent before Sept. 11, the company said, in stores that are owned and operated by Gucci. Other sales take place in department stores, which are suffering as consumers, in search of bargains, flock to discounters.
Since the attacks, Gucci's business has slowed even more. And its YSL Beaute division, which sells perfumes and cosmetics, business has all but stopped in airport duty-free stores, which had been an important outlet. "I've heard of 45 to 50 percent declines, depending on the store," said Michael Payne, executive director of the International Association of Airport Duty-Free Stores. 
LVMH Moet Hennessy Louis Vuitton, which owns the Louis Vuitton, Fendi, Givenchy and Thomas Pink brands, among others, reported last Tuesday that it achieved a 10 percent sales increase for the first nine months of the year, compared with the period last year. But sales worldwide fell 8 percent last month, the company said, because of the attacks on the United States. 
Wendy Liebmann, president of WSL Strategic Retail, a consulting group, told of a recent visit to the Short Hills Mall in New Jersey where she saw sales clerks standing outside the doorways of shops like Gucci and Versace. "It's like they are so desperate for company," she said. "There is just nothing going on, and how many times can you fold the sweaters?" 
Ms. Liebmann doubts that customers will be flocking back to purveyors of luxury goods soon. "What we spend," she said, "certainly for this next period of time, will be about family and comfort and showing people we appreciate them, rather than acquiring stuff for ourselves."

HEADLINE: Coloradans Fear the Spread Of a Kind of Mad Elk Disease 

BYLINE:  By MINDY SINK 

DATELINE: DENVER, Oct. 22 

 BODY:
State officials here fear that some elk that may be infected with a fatal illness were sold to private ranches in as many as 15 states and could spread the disease to the wild elk and deer throughout the nation.
 The state has confirmed six cases of chronic wasting disease, the elk and deer equivalent of mad cow disease. Five cases have been traced to one ranch in northeastern Colorado, where the elk were raised, sold and transported for breeding. State officials also said that over the last five years there appeared to have been 245 sales of infected elk to ranches in states as far east as Pennsylvania. 
 "We're trying to get our arms around it and figure out the extent of the exposure," said Wayne Cunningham, state veterinarian with the Colorado Department of Agriculture.
The state has quarantined 1,300 elk. On Friday, 9 were killed to be tested. There is no live test.
"This is a very, very important native species, and that's why we're so concerned," said Todd Malmsbury, spokesman for the Colorado Division of Wildlife. 
The Division of Wildlife has killed more than 50 wild deer and elk in areas near the ranches where two elk were known to have the disease. A small ranch in New Mexico that bought an elk from the ranch where the infected elk came from plans to destroy its own herd of 14 as a preventive measure. 
Chronic wasting disease is similar to mad cow disease in beef cattle and Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease in people. It is not known if chronic wasting disease can be transmitted to people who eat deer or elk meat or come in contact with animal fluids. Nor is it known how animals become infected with, though it is believed that soil can be contaminated by the remains of an infected animal for decades. 
"We don't know how it's transmitted," said David Ditloff, media relations manager for the Rocky Mountain Elk Foundation in Missoula, Mont. "The only thing we do know is that it's always fatal to deer and elk and it will contain itself if left isolated in the wild populations."
The creatures draw spectators and hunters to the state -- about a $1 billion infusion to the economy. There are more than 250,000 wild elk and 550,000 deer in Colorado.
Elk are raised on private ranches for breeding, private hunting, meat and velvet antlers, which can be used for human nutritional supplements or medicines. There are about 14,000 captive elk in Colorado.
"Shipping animals across states, maybe to a game farm 1,000 miles away, could lead to widespread distribution of chronic wasting disease," Mr. Ditloff said. "A wild animal is not going to travel that far to migrate."
The federal Department of Agriculture has set aside more than $2 million to reimburse elk ranchers who lose their herds.
Craig McConnell owns the Elk Echo and All American Antler Ranches near Stoneham, Colo., where he has 650 elk, all of which will be killed. At this point, elk from his ranches appear to be the origination point of the outbreak. 
Mr. McConnell, 46, whose pickup truck bounces across the prairie with license plates that read "Mr. Elk," said he stood to lose a $4 million investment. "In a good market, my very best bull could be worth $4,000," he said. "Now they'll toast him for $3,000. It's devastating."

 BODY:
Insurer Is Seeking to Limit World Trade Center Claims
Swiss Re, the biggest insurer of the World Trade Center, frustrated by unsuccessful negotiations, went to court to try to limit how much it will pay to half of what the buildings' managers and owners are asking.
 The real estate executive whose companies hold a lease on the property has said he will seek $7 billion from insurers. He argues that each of the airliners that crashed into the towers constituted a separate attack covered by $3.5 billion in insurance. But Swiss Re asked the Federal District Court in Manhattan to determine that it and the other insurers be liable for only $3.5 billion because both crashes amounted to a single incident. Page B5. 

Insurers and regulators debated the prospect that some companies might not be able to pay all their claims in the tragedy. C2.

Earnings Decline 30% at SBC
SBC Communications said that its third-quarter profit fell 30 percent and that it would eliminate several thousand jobs and reduce spending on an Internet project.

HEADLINE: A NATION CHALLENGED: THE DONATIONS; 
Aid Program Set Up to Help Small Stores

BYLINE:  By JOSEPH P. FRIED 

 BODY:
Samuel's Hats, two blocks from the World Trade Center, was among the many small shops dealt a severe blow by the center's destruction. 
 The store, at 74 Nassau Street, was closed for two weeks after the terrorist attack Sept. 11. While the damage at Samuel's was small compared with other losses, it was large for this business: up to $25,000 in merchandise was ruined. 
 There was no phone service for the first two weeks that the shop was reopened, making it impossible to take credit cards and aggravating the losses from reduced customer traffic, said the owner, Samuel Castro. And even with phones, business is still off by about 30 percent, he said.
So it is not surprising that Mr. Castro expected to be among the first to apply today for a new program that will provide more than $6 million in grants, loans and wage subsidies to small retailers south of Canal Street that were financially hurt by the trade center attack, and that find that other aid programs do not meet their needs.
The program will be managed by Seedco, a Manhattan community development organization that will work with various community groups. It will distribute grants up to $30,000, make loans up to $100,000 at interest rates of 1 to 3 percent, and provide wage subsidies to help retailers retain workers making less than $12 an hour.
The $6 million is to come from Seedco itself ($2.5 million), the Ford Foundation ($1 million), The New York Times 9/11 Neediest Fund ($500,000) and more expected grants, said Carl Weisbrod, president of the Alliance for Downtown New York, the business improvement district for most of the area south of Chambers Street. His group will help carry out the program, along with civic groups in TriBeCa, Chinatown and the Lower East Side.
The State Labor Department will provide an unspecified amount for the wage subsidies, he said.
The new program is "the first significant opportunity to provide actual sizable grants, in addition to loans, to retailers who have been directly affected by the World Trade Center attack," Mr. Weisbrod said. He said there had been some programs providing small grants to retailers, well below the $30,000 maximum under the new program.
In addition, he said, the loans will be available more quickly and on more favorable terms than loans available from the Federal Small Business Administration.
William J. Grinker, Seedco's president, said that to receive aid, a business has to show "that it's a viable business that can get back on its feet with those resources." His group said those interested in applying should call Seedco at (212) 473-0255.
Mr. Castro, the hat merchant, said he planned to ask up to $25,000 in a grant or a loan.

HEADLINE: Rash of No-Shows at Conventions 

BYLINE:  By DAVID BARBOZA 

DATELINE: CHICAGO, Oct. 22 

 BODY:
A dwindling number of people are going to conventions these days, but those who plyed the cavernous floor of the McCormick Place Convention Center this weekend sounded a lot like Randy Scholtz, a 49-year-old food service manager who insisted he was getting on with life.
 Mr. Scholtz said he was ignoring the television news and not listening to rumors about the possibility of more terrorist attacks. Instead, he was making strawberry soft-serve ice cream swirls for the handful of visitors to his company's booth at the Worldwide Food Expo, the giant meat and dairy equipment convention that wrapped up here on Sunday. 
 "The people who are afraid to come are the ones who listen to rumors," said Mr. Scholtz, who flew in from DeLand, Fla., for the show. "Some say, 'Don't go to the malls on Halloween.' That's another silly rumor on the Internet."
By and large, the exhibitors were here; the problem was that the conventioneers -- the people whose job it is to buy the food-processing equipment displayed on the exhibition floor -- were not. Convention officials estimated that about 20 percent, or close to 6,500, of the 32,000 people expected at the four-day meeting failed to show.
Across the country, the struggle for normalcy is still being lost on the convention front. New Orleans, Orlando, Fla., and Las Vegas have all been hit by a rash of convention cancellations and no-shows. Between the slowing economy and the aftermath of the terrorist attacks, the convention industry expects revenue to drop to about $76 billion this year from $96 billion last year, according to the Convention Industry Council, which is in McLean, Va.
New York had cancellations after Sept. 11 -- partly because the Jacob K. Javits Convention Center was used as a medical site -- but it is now starting to recover. Indeed, some large groups have decided to move their conventions to New York as a show of support.
Here in Chicago, attendance is weak in what is typically the best month of the year for conventions, and there is a sense that people are putting a happy face on what, for this city, is a big, big business gone bad.
"None of the big conventions has canceled," said James Reilly, the chief executive at the Chicago Convention and Tourism Bureau. "But our expectations are much lower."
On Thursday, when the Food Expo opened, there were gaps in the expected sea of conventioneers who typically clog the aisles of the 1.4- million-square-foot exhibition hall. Exhibitors resorted to mingling among themselves.
"I hope things get better," said George Reiser, a vice president at Reiser & Company, a distributor of meat processing machines that spent about $1 million to set up its oversized stainless steel equipment on the convention floor. "This is the show for the industry."
Things did not improve much. Still, Chicago, a city that boasted about 32 million visitors and $9.7 billion in convention and tourism revenue last year, is hoping this is temporary. The weakening of the travel and convention businesses is already dealing a serious blow to Chicago and the Midwest.
Traffic at O'Hare International Airport, still one of the busiest airports in the world, is down more than 25 percent in the last month, according to several airlines. Parking and concession revenues are down 30 percent to 40 percent, according to the Chicago Department of Aviation. Hotel occupancy, which dipped as low as 20 percent in the days after Sept. 11, is still below 70 percent at many hotels at a time when occupancy is usually in the low 90's.
All this may be why President Bush chose to come here last month to encourage Americans to get back in the air; it is definitely why Chicago's mayor, Richard M. Daley, has campaigned to lure people from the suburbs to downtown attractions like Navy Pier and the Shedd Aquarium. 
Among those who made it to the Food Expo, it was hard to find people who said they were still afraid to fly. Many said they wanted to get back to work and not let terrorism destroy their everyday lives.
"I don't think you can let other people decide how you live," said Raymond Platter, 60, who works for Borden Dairy Milk Products in Conroe, Tex. His wife, Sandra, who joined him for the convention, added, "If it's your time to go, it's your time to go."
Some came against the wishes of family members.
"My wife was nervous," said Steve Valdez, who works for a food packaging company in California. "My youngest son was nervous, too. He's 14. He said, 'Dad, why do you have to go?' Then he called me on my cellphone last night, and that's not normally like him."
Others arrived in Chicago with a heightened sense of how dangerous the new world could be. John Hinners, a trade group official from Denver, said a flight attendant on his plane to Chicago called him to the front and showed him how to detach the coffee dispenser to get scalding hot water, just in case. And Julie Buffenbarger, an exhibitor from Cleveland, said she looked around her plane for suspicious passengers and prepared to use her car key as a weapon.
Many here said the convention business was suffering because of excessive media coverage of the Sept. 11 attacks. "They showed that plane flying into the tower so many times that it's embedded in everyone's mind," said Mr. Scholtz, whose company, Archibald Brothers, designs frozen dessert dispensing systems. "I have to admit, when we flew over the Sears Tower the other day, I kept seeing that image."
People who came here to the last Food Expo two years ago with a large group of colleagues wandered the halls on the opening day a little lonelier this time. "Four or five of us were supposed to come, but I'm the only one here," said Les Oesterreich, 57, of Davis, Calif., who was ordering room service instead of going out on the town.
Chicago discourages that kind of behavior. In normal times, the convention bureau estimates that the typical conventiongoer spends about $300 a day on things like taxis, parking fees, hotels, restaurants, museums and shopping sprees along the Magnificent Mile.
But these are not normal times, and people here said that the 2001 Worldwide Food Expo seemed a lot less cosmopolitan than in years past. Not only were many foreigners absent, in part because of problems obtaining visas, so were many Americans from outside the Midwest.
"When we look at the name tags, we see Iowa, Illinois, Indiana, Wisconsin and Minnesota," said James Sargent, who was working at the booth of the Copesan pest control company. "A lot of these people drove."

HEADLINE: Indicators Fell In September; Biggest Drop In Five Years 

BYLINE:  Bloomberg News 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Oct. 22 

 BODY:
The index of leading economic indicators for September showed the biggest drop in more than five years, a sign the slowdown may last through the first quarter of 2002, a private industry group said today.
 The Conference Board's gauge of economic activity over the next three to six months dropped 0.5 percent after falling a revised 0.1 percent in August. The last time the index fell more was in January 1996, when it dropped 0.7 percent. 
 Falling stock prices and increases in jobless claims did the most to push down the index. Reduced sales after the terrorist attacks Sept. 11 led many companies to lower estimates for next year.
"The two-month decline in the index suggests that the already weak economy is likely to remain weak into next year," said Ken Goldstein, an economist at the Conference Board. Factory orders and building permits are likely to decline, he said, adding, "The service economy is also weakening, with little reason to expect any quick turnaround."
Analysts expected a 0.5 percent decrease after the previously reported 0.3 percent August drop.
The Conference Board compiles its leading indicators index from eight previously reported economic statistics and estimates on new orders for consumer and capital goods. Six of the 10 indicators were down in September.
Contributing to the decline, besides stocks and jobless claims, were lower consumer confidence, reduced manufacturing hours, a decline in building permits and a drop in new orders for nonmilitary capital goods. 
An increase in the money supply and a wider spread between short-term and longer-term interest rates were positive indicators.
The index of coincident indicators, a measure of current economic activity, fell 0.1 percent in September after showing no change in August. The index of lagging indicators fell 0.2 percent in September after falling 0.3 percent the prior month.

HEADLINE: A NATION CHALLENGED: THE POSTAL SYSTEM; 
Post Offices Handle Less Mail, With More Caution

BYLINE:  By PAM BELLUCK 

DATELINE: WALTHAM, Mass., Oct. 22 

 BODY:
Sorting and stamping and sifting through mail is not what it used to be at the postal processing center in this western suburb of Boston. There is far less mail. There are far more signs of anthrax-related anxiety.
 A television monitor flickers with anthrax safety messages. A poster about suspicious mail lists warning signs: oily stains, excessive postage, misspelled words, strange odor. 
 Outside the processing floor are bulletins about the false anthrax scares this center has had in the last eight days. For Oct. 18, for example, it mentions a "white substance found in bottom of empty tub."
Sorting has slowed because workers are more careful. But there is also less mail to sort, said Robert Cannon, a spokesman for the United States Postal Service in eastern and central Massachusetts.
Mr. Cannon said the Waltham plant was handling 30 percent less mail than it did this time last year, a trend he said was being echoed nationally. "We're seeing a drastic drop in volume," Mr. Cannon said. "There should be a lot more mail than there is right now."
The national decline in mail volume was precipitated by the weak economy but worsened by the terrorist attacks. Volume was down 5 percent in September from the same month last year, said Gerry Kreienkamp, a spokesman for the Postal Service in Washington. Revenue last month was down $4 million to $5 million from its September 2000 level, he said.
Across the country, postal workers are in an altered landscape. Four of the 10 people known to have contracted anthrax were postal workers, two in New Jersey and two in the District of Columbia. The news today that two Washington postal workers died from what the authorities suspect was anthrax only heightened the sense that the Postal Service had been catapulted to the front lines of the war with terrorists.
"We're all dealing with new situations," John Potter, the postmaster general, said today at a White House news conference. "We're working as a team to try to deal with this ever-evolving, changing-by-the-minute environment."
Mr. Cannon said that since Oct. 15, the day that an anthrax-tainted letter was opened in the office of Senator Tom Daschle of South Dakota, police or hazardous-materials teams had responded to reports by postal workers of about 600 to 700 suspicious packages and letters a day. 
In Glendale Heights, Ill., 39 postal employees were evacuated for eight hours on Saturday after a machine operator saw a substance resembling brown sugar on a letter. The scare, which turned out to be a false alarm, meant that 19 of the post office's 27 routes went undelivered that day, said Donald Sommers, the postmaster. Postal workers came in at 6 this morning, 90 minutes earlier than usual, to deal with the backlog. 
In the central New Jersey postal district, where two of the stricken workers came from, a spokesman, Carl Walton, said mail delivery had fallen behind, with workers delivering "about 60 percent of first-class mail, Express Mail, Priority Mail and the parcels."
In the Seattle area, two false anthrax alarms last week closed a post office in Port Townsend and a carrier center in Tacoma. 
Marty Barron, an arbitration advocate for the greater Seattle postal workers union, said, "There has been a certain degree of paranoia." 
And in Cambridge, Mass., last week, when a mail carrier who discovered white powder on the front of his Postal Service sweater called to tell his supervisor, the carrier quickly found himself surrounded by a hazardous materials team in "moon suits," Mr. Cannon said. 
"They hosed him down in the middle of the busy street while he was wearing only Bermuda shorts and a T-shirt," Mr. Cannon said.
Tension levels are highest, understandably, in places like New Jersey and New York, where anthrax cases have been found.
In the Morgan mail center on the West Side of Manhattan, which probably processed the anthrax-tainted letters sent to NBC News and The New York Post, some workers said they were upset that not all 5,000 employees were to be tested for anthrax exposure and that environmental cleanup had not been done.
William Smith, president of the Metropolitan Postal Workers Union, said the union was considering suing to force the shutdown of the Morgan center.
Pat McGovern, a spokeswoman for the Postal Service in New York City, said that employees who would have worked along the route of the NBC letter were tested starting on Friday, and that on Sunday, testing began for bar code sorters, manual sorting cases and vacuum cleaners at the Morgan center. She said environmental cleanup had not been done because the testing was not completed.
But while postal workers across the country are concerned, there seems to be little, if any, panic. Few employees are staying home and many are handling their new environment with stoicism and calm. 
"Every postal worker that has anything to with the mail is on the front lines," said David Galvin, a 14-year Postal Service veteran here in Waltham whose job is to cancel the stamps on large flat envelopes. "You get very nervous, but you have a job to do and you got to do it."
When Mr. Galvin and the 600 other employees enter the building, they are now subject to more frequent random searches of handbags and mail tubs, said Gordon Spencer, acting manager of district operations. Two postal inspectors are now stationed around the clock in the plant to respond to reports of suspicious packages, Mr. Spencer said. As a result of the six reports so far, the plant has been evacuated once, and other times, employees in the area of the package were quarantined until the substance was found to be safe. 
Many post offices have made surgical masks and gloves available to employees. But in many places, few people have been wearing them.
In Waltham, some employees say the gloves and masks are uncomfortable. And Frank J. Manganaro, the plant manager, said he had told employees that they should weigh the protection of gloves and masks against the risks that, for example, gloves could get caught in machinery and cause injury.
In recent days, Mr. Manganaro has made a point of talking with employees to see how they are feeling. 
"They understood that we are an organization that binds the country and we have an obligation to citizens of this country," Mr. Manganaro said. "I was actually taken with their sense of what their role is."

HEADLINE: M.T.A. Hopes to Avoid Higher Fares, Service Cuts 

BYLINE:  By BARBARA STEWART

 BODY:
Despite the huge, unforeseen cost of having to repair and secure the New York transit system, officials said yesterday they do not not have any immediate plans to increase fares or reduce services.
 Peter S. Kalikow, chairman of the Metropolitan Transit Authority, said at a meeting yesterday that the agency is hoping to solve its financial problems with insurance money, federal grants and cost-cutting measures. 
 The transit authority estimates it will need $4.1 billion over three years to cover the costs of the damage, extra security and lost revenue from the terrorist attacks. Transit officials are hopeful for a large amount of federal aid and full payment on its $1.5 billion insurance policy to come close to meeting those expenses.
Currently, said Mr. Kalikow, the agency is "aggressively dealing" with insurance and federal officials. In particular, it is lobbying for a very substantial slice of New York's $54 billion request for federal aid, he said. "This is a national affair," he said. "Hawaii was not expected to pay for Pearl Harbor by itself and we shouldn't be expected to pay for the terrorist attacks." 
Gene Russianoff of the Straphangers Campaign, a rider advocacy group, called the authority's plan to avoid fare increases and service reductions "sincere" and "plausible."
Even before Sept. 11, the authority was hurt by the weakened economy. Now it needs an extra $1.7 billion to clean transit systems and repair damaged subway lines. It must increase security, improve ventilation systems and find ways to speed up evacuations.

HEADLINE: Political Memo; 
Schundler Is Counting On Tax Issue To Turn Tide

BYLINE:  By DAVID M. HERSZENHORN

DATELINE: TRENTON, Oct. 22 

 BODY:
With two weeks until Election Day, Bret D. Schundler and the State Republican Party have stepped up their efforts to portray James E. McGreevey as a threat to New Jersey's taxpayers.
 In campaign advertisements, daily press releases and news conferences, the Republicans are harping on the tax issue with a singular persistence that suggests a focused strategy going into the final days of the campaign for governor. 
 Every day, the state G.O.P. issues a new press release seeking to equate Mr. McGreevey with his fellow Democrat, former Gov. Jim Florio, who pushed through a $2.8 billion tax increase during his first year in office. Today's release featured Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani calling any sentiment to raise taxes "dumb, stupid, idiotic and moronic." Jack Collins, the State Assembly speaker, has scheduled a news conference for Tuesday to say much the same. 
The decision by Mr. Schundler and his supporters to tailor their message in many ways reflects a do-or-die determination to turn the race around in a state where the tax issue has long been paramount. Mr. McGreevey continues to lead by double digits in the polls, and with state politics still overshadowed by the conflict in Afghanistan and by fears about anthrax, the tax attack may be Mr. Schundler's only hope of generating enough attention and momentum to shift the electoral tide. 
"The top issue of concern to voters right now is the economy, and in particular what the next governor is going to do in regard to state tax policy," said Bill Guhl, a spokesman for the Schundler campaign. "I think that is going to be the basis on which many undecided voters out there are going to cast their vote on Election Day." 
Richard McGrath, a spokesman for the McGreevey campaign, said the Republicans had turned to the tax issue as a last, desperate measure. "It has become a kind of a one-note symphony," he said. "And it's an act of political desperation. It's a naked scare tactic that is the byproduct of a desperate candidate whose proposals have been stripped away and shown to be irresponsible and ironically costly to taxpayers from a number of angles."
In pounding on the tax issue in recent days, the Republicans point out that Mr. McGreevey has repeatedly refused to promise that he would not raise taxes if he is elected governor, saying instead that he is committed to a state government that will "live within its means."
Mr. Schundler, by contrast, has eagerly embraced every opportunity to promise that he will not raise taxes even if New Jersey ends up facing a $1 billion deficit next year. 
Mr. Schundler's campaign also recently noted that Mr. McGreevey used the same phrase about living within one's means in 1997 to defend Mr. Florio's tax increases.
The Republicans are betting that voters will reject any possibility of a tax increase. "It is certainly the issue that we want to drive home," said Jeanette Hoffman, a spokeswoman for the New Jersey Republican Committee. "Under Republican leadership, we won't raise your taxes, and the Democrats will. I think we have been seeing that people care about their bottom line. People are worried about keeping their jobs. They are worried about their own pocketbooks."
Mr. McGreevey is betting that voters feel so betrayed by politicians that they will not believe Mr. Schundler's promise.
"Voters in New Jersey aren't concerned about tax pledges," said Joel Benenson, Mr. McGreevey's pollster. "They have heard these pledges from politicians for years, and they have watched politicians take the pledge and break it."
Mr. McGrath said Mr. McGreevey "sees no need to raise taxes, but he believes it would be irresponsible to make a permanent pledge that would handcuff New Jersey for any future catastrophic need."
On the campaign trail, Mr. Schundler repeatedly points to his tax-cutting record as mayor of Jersey City. And he points at Mr. McGreevey's record as mayor of Woodbridge as evidence that his opponent has never made tax-cutting a priority. Mr. McGreevey's response is that Mr. Schundler's promises cannot be trusted: not about taxes, not about getting rid of tolls, not about education or anything else.
The different strategies were clearly on display Thursday night during the most recent debate between the two candidates. While asking a question, one man in the debate audience told the candidates: "I see one of you as a fool who doesn't know that he has to raise taxes and the other as a liar who won't tell us that he knows he'll have to raise taxes. Can either of you prove me wrong?"
A moderator of the debate quickly followed up with yet another demand that the candidates take what is now known in American politics simply as the pledge. Mr. Scott said: "Let me put it to you again: if elected governor, will you raise taxes?" 
Mr. Schundler answered first. "Absolutely not," he said. "I am going to be cutting taxes. And if we have a very deep recession, which causes a very significant reduction of state revenues, that's especially when we have to get taxes down to put people back to work." 
Mr. McGreevey said: "I've said publicly where I would cut. I talked about capping the New Jersey Saver program for families earning above $200,000. Clearly, they've enjoyed the benefit of the federal tax cut.
"I've talked about merging government. We're going to have to make some tough decisions, but I'm committed to having our state government live within its means."

HEADLINE: A NATION CHALLENGED: THE EARLY CASUALTIES; 
2 Soldiers Remembered for Their Focus and Patriotism

BYLINE:  By MICHAEL JANOFSKY 

DATELINE: CHEYENNE, Wyo., Oct. 22 

 BODY:
Wayne Korhonen, a psychology teacher at East High School here, came to work today as many Americans do during a time of war, wearing bold symbols of patriotism. A ribbon of red, white and blue was pinned to his lapel. His tie bore a likeness of the Stars and Stripes.
 But as a striking reminder that pain often comes with patriotism, he also wore a black armband, in memory of Specialist Jonn J. Edmunds, a 1999 honors graduate and one of his former students. 
 Last Friday, Specialist Edmunds and another soldier, Pfc. Kristofer T. Stonesifer of Missoula, Mont., became the first American combat casualties in the war against the Taliban when they were passengers in a Black Hawk helicopter that crashed in Pakistan. Both men served with the 75th Ranger Regiment, based at Fort Benning, Ga.
A Defense Department official said the crash occurred as the helicopter was landing at Dalbandin air base. The wash of the rotor blades kicked up a huge cloud of dust, the official said, which apparently disoriented the pilot or interfered with the equipment.
On Sunday, the bodies of the two soldiers were flown to Ramstein Air Base in Germany, where they received military honors. Today, their families waited to learn from the Army when they could schedule funerals and memorial services. Specialist Edmunds, 20, was married less than a year. Private Stonesifer, 28, was single.
Outside their modest home on the wind-swept prairie outside Cheyenne, Specialist Edmunds's parents, Donn and Mary, held back tears as Donn Edmunds read a statement in which he described his son as "a tough, determined, competitive young man who only accepted the best of himself and wanted to give his best for his country."
That his son became an Army Ranger was hardly a surprise to anyone who knew him. 
"When everyone was planning on college, I asked him what college he wanted to go to," Mr. Korhonen said, recalling Specialist Edmunds's unwavering sense of purpose. "He told me he didn't want to go to college; he was joining the Army to be a Ranger.
"Kids say things like that all the time here, depending on what movie is popular at the time. But with Jonn, I knew there was no doubt."
The military has a big presence in Cheyenne, the capital of Wyoming. The area's largest employer is the F. E. Warren Air Force Base, which manages the nation's nuclear arsenal. Sam Mirich, the East High principal, said that many of students were children of military families, and that every year some graduates chose a military career over college or civilian work.
In Specialist Edmunds's case, he was following family tradition. His father served in the Army in Vietnam. "Jonn wanted to prove he was as tough physically as he was mentally," said Kosta Tsandes, who taught him economics. "He always tried awfully hard. He didn't have the speed or fluidity as someone with God-given gifts. But he would die out there. He wanted to succeed so bad to prove he was good."
Private Stonesifer, who grew up in Doylestown, Pa., and moved to Montana several years ago to attend the University of Montana, was remembered much the same way. A philosophy major with a 3.51 grade point average, he quit the university's R.O.T.C. program last year because he felt it was not strenuous enough. Then he joined the Army.
"All I really knew was, he wanted to be the best soldier in the U.S. Army, and the best soldiers in the Army are in the Ranger battalion," Lt. Col. Jim Clegg, professor of military science and head of the R.O.T.C. program at Montana, told The Associated Press. "He was a very mature and focused young man." 
A classmate of Private Stonesifer in the R.O.T.C. program, Simon Walbruch, 26, was one of the last students from the University of Montana to see him when Mr. Walbruch spent three weeks last summer at the airborne school in Fort Benning, Ga.
"He seemed really happy," Mr. Walbruch said. "He was really glad he made the decision that he did. I'm sure he was happy to be over there and help defend our country."

HEADLINE: Still Dealing, Leaders Study An Expansion Of Gambling 

BYLINE:  By JAMES C. McKINLEY Jr.

DATELINE: ALBANY, Oct. 22 

 BODY:
Negotiations over a final state budget that would authorize several new American Indian-run casinos and video gambling machines at horse tracks intensified today, but Gov. George E. Pataki and legislative leaders still had not resolved several pivotal details late yesterday evening.
 "I think it's fair to say we are closer," the governor said this afternoon. "But as everyone in Albany knows, it's a question of actually getting the i's dotted and the t's crossed and having an actual agreement, and we're not there." 
 As the day wore on, it became clear one major sticking point in the talks was a disagreement over which racetracks should have video gambling machines. Mr. Pataki and his Republican allies who control the Senate had first proposed putting the machines only in Yonkers Raceway, Aqueduct and one upstate track.
The Democrats who control the Assembly were deeply divided on the question. Several black and Hispanic members complained the machines would further impoverish already poor people in the Bronx and Queens. Upstate Democrats who represent districts with failing harness tracks, meanwhile, are in favor of a proposal to allow local governments to opt for the machines.
The Assembly speaker, Sheldon Silver of Manhattan, and the Senate majority leader, Joseph L. Bruno, have tied the fate of the video machines to a bill that would let the governor negotiate compacts with Indian tribes for six casinos, three in Western New York and three in the Catskills. Legislative leaders and the governor have already agreed to authorize New York to join the Powerball lottery.
Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani, meanwhile, argued today New York City should also be given a casino, or the Catskills gaming parlors would sap the city's economy. "If you were going to have casino gambling in the Catskills, it would be unfair to New York City to not allow Rockaway, or maybe one or two other places in New York City to have that same option," he said.
But legislative leaders have long been opposed to casinos in the city. 
Along with the gambling proposals, state leaders are trying to hammer out a plan that would add approximately $500 million in spending to the stripped-down $80 billion budget passed in August.
In broad terms, one version of the deal under discussion would appropriate about $200 million to finance nonprofits that every year provide everything from social services and legal representation to the poor, lawmakers and staff members on both sides of the aisle said. An additional $100 million would be earmarked for economic development, and the final $200 million would go for school aid. Those numbers, however, were not etched in stone.
Leaders are discussing how to pay for additions when revenues are expected to drop dramatically because of the shaky economy and the attack on the World Trade Centers
The governor and Senate Republicans have proposed stretching out payments to local school districts for new buildings as one way to save money. But that proposal is opposed by lawmakers in the Assembly from districts where voters have already approved borrowing with the expectation the state would reimburse them faster.
The final major issue on the bargaining table is how much of the state's annual $1.5 billion windfall from the federal government for welfare payments should be spent this year. The state collects the extra money because its grant is based on the number of people who were on the rolls in 1995, and those numbers have fallen.
Governor Pataki wants to keep some of the surplus in a reserve fund to hedge against lost revenues, while the Assembly Democrats are urging the money be spent on social programs this year, people familiar with the talks said. The governor has proposed using about half of the surplus for tax credits, foster care and daycare programs for the poor. The Democrats would like to see the state spend more of the surplus to salvage other social programs.
The disagreement over video-lottery terminals, however, may be the hardest problem to solve, and some lawmakers said it may be the key to an overall deal. Minority lawmakers fear the machines, which some psychologists say are addictive, will beggar some poor families downstate.
"There is some leeriness about the prospect this will create problems among poor and working poor families, where the only breadwinner might become a gambler," said Assemblyman Roger Green, the leader of the black and Hispanic caucus.
After meeting for three hours last night, legislative leaders said they had made progress, although Senator Bruno said, "The hang-up is on everything."

HEADLINE: Chairman of Lincoln Center Redevelopment Resigns 

BYLINE:  By ROBIN POGREBIN 

 BODY:
The real estate executive in charge of Lincoln Center's fractious billion-dollar redevelopment project resigned yesterday, months before he had planned to leave.
 The executive, Marshall Rose, who has served as the unpaid chairman of the center's redevelopment corporation, said he was stepping down because he had completed his work on a master plan. But it was widely known within Lincoln Center that he was intensely frustrated with the internecine battles that were hindering the project's advancement. 
 The departure, coming only three and a half weeks after the exit of the center's president, Gordon J. Davis, throws new uncertainty over the plan, even though Mr. Rose, a successful real estate developer, maintains that a great majority of the issues that were dividing the center's prestigious constituents had been resolved and that the project had been scaled back to account for post-Sept. 11 economic uncertainty. 
The redevelopment corporation board is considering adoption of a master plan in November with a set of variables, reflecting the difficulty the center and its high-profile constituents, like the Metropolitan Opera, have had at reaching consensus. The plan, with its various options, would then be submitted for approval to the city, which has agreed to provide $240 million over 10 years to the effort. Mr. Rose said he would stay through the November board meeting.
But Mr. Rose said that when Beverly Sills, Lincoln Center's chairman, and Nathan Leventhal, the former president, first met with him about leading the project, he told them he expected to stay about two years, which would have meant until next June.
Some Lincoln Center executives said they were surprised that Mr. Rose -- who has donated his time on the project -- lasted as long as he did. He had become a target, they say, and he was fed up with the squabbling among many of the 11 participating constituents of the center. Also, center executives say, he saw the chance to make his mark eroding given the center's deep-seated internal resentments and the city's economic uncertainty.
"It's a good time to get out," said one Lincoln Center official. "He knows it's a no-win situation at this point for him. He wanted to leave his legacy."
The redevelopment, at least as of now, calls for a widespread refurbishment of deteriorated buildings and grounds, a major overhaul of Avery Fisher Hall, home to the New York Philharmonic; and a $300-million new home for the New York City Opera.
Joseph Volpe, the general manager of the Metropolitan Opera, has been strongly opposed to two aspects of the plan that have been discussed: creation of a glass dome over Lincoln Center's central outdoor plaza and construction of a building for the New York City Opera in a section of Damrosch Park adjacent to the Met.
There have also been tensions between City Opera and the New York City Ballet, which share the acoustically poor New York State Theater, over whether the ballet would be financially damaged if City Opera left and whether the two organizations could agree on renovations to the stage if the opera company were to stay.
Mr. Rose said the redevelopment project had been scaled back to about $1 billion because of elimination or modification of certain aspects of the plan. Most elements have been agreed upon, Mr. Rose said; the remaining issues have to do with Lincoln Center's public spaces and the new opera house.
The dome is no longer part of the project. "It didn't achieve consensus," Mr. Rose said. Mr. Volpe and Ms. Sills both opposed it. 
Mr. Rose is said to have been surprised, at a recent meeting of the executive committee of Lincoln Center, by Ms. Sills' alliance with the Met on the dome and City Opera issues, and some suggested that this played a central role in his decision to leave. Mr. Rose and Ms. Sills said in interviews that they were parting on good terms. "I'm sad," she said. "It wasn't a total surprise. There was a moment when I knew he was going to cut off."
"The difficulty," she said, "is to get 11 intelligent people who run world-class institutions to find a way to get what they need accomplished. I think Marshall feels he has reached the point where, in his mind, he was finished."
Mr. Rose said he expected the master plan to be submitted with three options for the New York City Opera: having it remain in the State Theater, provided that it can reach agreement with the City Ballet; building a new opera house off-campus; or building a new opera house in Damrosch Park, while making adjustments to keep the park from being significantly diminished.
But executives at Lincoln Center say it is unlikely that Mr. Volpe will agree to a plan that includes such options, and a plan must be unanimously accepted by the constituents to proceed. In a letter Mr. Rose sent to the directors of the constituent project yesterday, he described an Oct. 18 meeting on redevelopment as "productive." But people who were there say it was as argumentative as ever because Mr. Volpe objected to the possibility of a master plan with options.
On the City Opera proposal for a new home in Damrosch Park, Ms. Sills, once that organization's reigning diva and later its general director, said, "They still have a right to dream."
Mr. Volpe declined to comment.
Mr. Rose said of Mr. Volpe: "He's a very intelligent and forceful advocate for his constituent. And I think he would like to play a constructive role."
Paul Kellogg, the executive director of City Opera, said he was sorry to see Mr. Rose go. "It's a terrible loss," he said.
Rebecca Robertson, the executive director of the redevelopment project, said she would stay on. "My obligation as executive director of this is to deliver something I really believe the constituents want and need," she said.
Whether the city will be able to come through on its pledge of support also remains in question in the wake of the Sept. 11 attacks.
Although Mr. Rose acknowledged that his task had been a difficult one -- managing "constituents with strong and sometimes conflicting opinions" -- he said in a letter to the various participating arts groups that, "The elements are in place for the constituents to choose a master plan that meets both the needs and the aspirations of Lincoln Center and the various cultural institutions that comprise it."
As a vice chairman of Lincoln Center, Mr. Rose said he expected to continue to be part of the redevelopment project, but that he felt it was time for Lincoln Center to find someone willing to oversee the effort for as much as 15 years. That did not make sense for him at age 65, he said. "It's not a sense of frustration. It's really when you realize you're now at this point when somebody has to get involved and stay involved for a long period of time."
Mr. Rose added that he was following a strategy he had used in other development and real estate projects for the New York Stock Exchange, Madison Square Garden and the New York Public Library. "It's the style that I like to work in," he said.
But Mr. Rose stayed at the library for 19 years.

HEADLINE: Metro Briefing New York: Manhattan: City Begins Selling $500 Million In Bonds 

BYLINE:  NYT (Compiled by Anthony Ramirez)

 BODY:
 New York City began the sale of $500 million in bonds yesterday, its first major borrowing since the attack on the World Trade Center. The sale, set to be completed today, is an important test of the city's ability to borrow money as it begins to rebuild Lower Manhattan. The bonds are known as general obligation bonds because they are backed by the city's taxing power. Credit-rating agencies graded the issue at solidly investment grade, single A by Standard & Poor's and A2 by Moody's. But Colleen Woodell, managing director at Standard & Poor's Public Finance, noted that "future credit direction will be tied to the city's ability to manage these extraordinary fiscal and economic issues at a time when political leadership is changing."

BYLINE:  AP (Compiled by Anthony Ramirez)

 BODY:
 A week after declaring a special session unnecessary, Democratic legislative leaders acknowledged yesterday that such a session is needed this fall to address a budget deficit estimated to be as much as $300 million. Gov. 
John G. Rowland, left, had called for a special session earlier this month, citing the economic slowdown in the wake of the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks. Democrats had resisted, saying immediate action was not required. But "clearly the budget deficiency and revenue shortfall already evident even before" Sept. 11 has worsened, said the Senate president pro tem, Kevin Sullivan.

Stadiums Still a Problem After 6 M.L.S. Seasons

BYLINE:  By ALEX YANNIS 

 BODY:
In Major League Soccer's sixth season, attendance was up by 9 percent, the caliber of play was higher and the number of young American players continued to grow. But the league still lacked soccer-only stadiums like the one in Columbus, Ohio, where the M.L.S. Cup was played Sunday.
 There has been a lot of talk about new stadiums, but not a shovel has been lifted since Columbus Crew Stadium was built two years ago by LAMAR HUNT, the team's owner-operator. 
 Commissioner DON GARBER sounded as optimistic as ever during the weekend at the league's championship match, won by the San Jose Earthquakes, 2-1, in overtime over the Los Angeles Galaxy. Garber said the Galaxy was expected to break ground on a stadium next month and the Dallas Burn was not far behind. 
 "Los Angeles is a reality," Garber said, referring to a stadium for the Galaxy that will also be a training site for the United States national teams. "It will be a stadium that will be measured against the best in the world."
 "Los Angeles should be done for the 2003 season, and we have reached the point of having a commitment from the McKinney community outside Dallas for a house for the Burn."
 The MetroStars, meanwhile, have focused their attention on Hudson County in New Jersey and they are working toward building a stadium in Harrison, N.J.
 Garber said the league's owners had enough money to operate for at least the next five years. M.L.S. will not expand in 2003 as previously planned. "This is not the appropriate economic climate," he said.
 The league's announcement of a five-year television package with ESPN and ABC, expected yesterday, will now come later this week.
 The league handed out its annual awards for its top executives over the weekend in conjunction with M.L.S. Cup. JIM SMITH of Columbus was named executive of the year. STEVE PASTORINO of Chicago won for marketing, CHRIS BRIENZA of the MetroStars for public relations and ED AUSTIN of Tampa Bay for operations.

UNITY GAMES
 There will be several guest players in Sunday's doubleheader at Giants Stadium to raise money for the families of the victims of the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks. The MetroStars will play D.C. United after the New York Power and the Washington Freedom of the Women's United Soccer Association play at 4 p.m. The same four teams will meet again Nov. 3 at Robert F. Kennedy Stadium in Washington.
JEFF AGOOS, captain of the champion Earthquakes, will play for D.C. United with two of the team's other former stars, JOHN HARKES and CARLOS LLAMOSA. Also playing for D.C. United, but only in Washington, will be JURGEN KLINSMANN, the former German international. Klinsmann works for PHILIP ANSCHUTZ, who has expanded his M.L.S. owner-operator stake with the acquisition of United. Anschutz also operates teams in Chicago, Colorado and Los Angeles.
 TONY MEOLA of Kansas City and DIEGO SERNA of Miami will be the guests for the MetroStars, who have commitments from RHETT HARTY, MILES JOSEPH and BRIAN KELLY to rejoin the team for the two games. The MetroStars are also trying to secure another former player, JIM ROONEY, who is now with Miami.
 There was no word from the women's teams on whether they would have guest players.

WORLD CUP
 Saudi Arabia reached the finals in World Cup qualifying for the third straight time after its 4-1 victory over Thailand Sunday, joining China as the other representative from Asia. (Japan and South Korea qualify automatically as the host nations.) Iran was one of the favorites, but it lost to Bahrain by 3-1 and will have to play the United Arab Emirates in a two-game, home-and-away playoff to determine who will play Ireland for a spot in the finals.
 Ireland Coach Mick McCarthy said yesterday that he would fly to Tehran tomorrow to watch Thursday's game between Iran and U.A.E. (he also plans to attend the return match, which is scheduled for Oct. 31 in the U.A.E.). McCarthy said he was undaunted about flying there despite the air strikes on Afghanistan.

COLLEGES
 ALECKO ESKANDARIAN scored the only goal to give Virginia a 1-0 overtime victory over Duke and keep the Cavaliers in second place in the coaches' ranking behind Southern Methodist, a winner over Tulsa. Third-ranked St. Louis posted its 10th consecutive victory for its best start since 1971, while St. John's, ranked fourth last week, tied Virginia Tech.
 In other games over the weekend among men's ranked teams, defending champion Connecticut (8-3-3) lost to Georgetown; Seton Hall and Syracuse tied; Notre Dame shut out Boston College; South Carolina and Rutgers tied; Oregon State beat U.C.L.A.; Stanford edged Santa Clara; and Penn State beat Michigan State.
 In women's games, Penn State captured its fourth consecutive Big Ten championship with a victory over Northwestern, and Santa Clara handed neighboring St. Mary's its first loss of the season on a goal by ALY WAGNER on a free kick with a minute left.
 In other games over the weekend, Connecticut upset Notre Dame for the first time since 1997; Maryland edged William & Mary for the first time since 1995; Florida downed Georgia; Tennessee beat South Carolina; Stanford edged Washington; and U.C.L.A. beat Southern California. ALEX YANNIS

HEADLINE: THE MEDIA BUSINESS: ADVERTISING; 
An upturn in account spending that was expected in 2002 may not come until 2003, executives say.

BYLINE:  By Stuart Elliot 

 BODY:
THE current steep decline in advertising spending will begin to reverse itself later than had been expected, several leading marketers and agency media executives predicted yesterday, partly because of the effects of the terrorist attacks and partly because of the softness in the economy before Sept. 11.
 The attacks did not affect the advertising economy so much as they "affected the brains, the heart, the psychology" of decision makers in the industry, said Jon Mandel, co-managing director at MediaCom Worldwide in New York, a media services agency that is owned by the Grey Global Group. 
 "We had been projecting the falloff in advertising would run until somewhere between May and July 2002," he added, but it is now possible "the upturn may be pushed to winter 2003."
Mr. Mandel was among the executives offering their forecasts and opinions at a panel during a general session of the 2001 American Magazine Conference at the Sheraton Hotel and Towers in Midtown Manhattan. 
Through the first six months of 2001, the latest period for which data is available from CMR, a unit of Taylor Nelson Sofres, American ad spending fell 6.4 percent from the first half of 2000.
That decline continued through the third quarter, as evidenced by reports last week from the Wall Street analysts following Madison Avenue, who reduced their estimates for third-quarter earnings for the largest agency companies like the Interpublic Group of Companies, the Omnicom Group and the WPP Group.
"Let's face it, business was lousy on Sept. 10," said David Verklin, chief executive at the Carat North America division of Carat in New York, the media services agency owned by the Aegis Group.
"Clients are not looking for a reason to spend money," he added. "They're looking for reasons not to spend money."
The process of what Mr. Verklin called "de-selection" will probably extend through 2002, he said, as ad spending declines by 5 percent to 5.5 percent from whatever the final figure is for 2001.
Next year "will be very difficult," Mr. Verklin said, "with July the earliest time we see a pickup."
"Some sectors will be particularly badly hurt," he predicted, including travel, financial services, business-to-business and technology.
One marketer panelist underscored that forecast.
"Financial service companies are hurting, all the major firms, including my firm," said Frederick W. Hill, executive vice president for marketing communications at J. P. Morgan Chase & Company in New York.
As a result, he added, for 2001 and "well into 2002, our ad dollars will be curtailed substantially, compared with levels three, four years ago."
Mr. Hill echoed Mr. Mandel by predicting a turnaround "beyond 2002," but offered these encouraging words to the sellers of ad space in the audience: "You have an opportunity, to come to us with creative ideas on how to gain market share, increase sales, in a recession. If you come with ideas other than just increasing your ad pages, we'll listen."
Another advertiser, Jeffrey A. Bell, vice president for marketing communications at the Chrysler Group in Auburn Hills, Mich., forecast that this quarter, as well as the first two quarters of 2002, "will be very painful."
One reason, said Mr. Bell, whose company is part of DaimlerChrysler, is that after the attacks many marketers "are starting to make the difficult decisions they had hoped they would not have to make," which include "filing for Chapter 11, downsizing and layoffs."
The campaigns that the Chrysler Group has run after Sept. 11 are being reshaped, he added, to emphasize "core values" for each brand that may resonate more strongly now, like "safety, security, resilience."
One factor complicating the forecasting for 2002, according to another marketer, is the increasingly shorter lead times for making ad-spending decisions.
Such decisions are being delayed "to an extraordinary degree," said Peggy Kelly, vice president for advertising services at the global marketing services group at Bristol-Myers Squibb in New York. "We're doing it absolutely as late as we can."
The events after the terrorist attacks have only increased the "incredible need all advertisers feel for flexibility," she added. The sitution is manifesting itself, she said, in the way they "need to commit at the last possible moment" as well as in the way "they need to get out of commitments."
Another problem in making predictions, Ms. Kelly said, is the fact "the economy in general is looking like a deflationary economy instead of an inflationary economy," a change that is spreading beyond consumer product categories like computers.
"It's tough to think how to reconfigure your business if you have to show growth every year in a deflationary economy," she added.
The conference, sponsored by the Magazine Publishers of America and the American Society of Magazine Editors, continues through today at the Sheraton. About 550 people are attending the conference, which was moved from Phoenix because of a reluctance many potential attendees expressed about traveling outside New York at this time.
The organizers are taking advantage of the new location -- the first time the conference has ever been held in New York -- to help city officials with efforts to spur a recovery from the attacks. Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani spoke at the opening session on Sunday night, along with the two mayoral candidates, Michael R. Bloomberg and Mark Green.
Kits distributed to those who attended included discount certificates for purchases at Bloomingdale's as well as for tickets to "Kiss Me, Kate."
Kiss, schmiss, what about buying some ad pages?

HEADLINE: THE MARKETS: STOCKS & BONDS; 
Shares Rise Despite Poor Earnings and Economic Figures

BYLINE:  By MICHAEL BRICK 

 BODY:
Stocks climbed yesterday, as investors continued to show confidence in an eventual economic recovery.
 Still, several analysts warned that the stock market's moves these days are dominated by mood rather than news, and that each bold rally is likely to be followed by a sharp retreat for quite some time. 
 Reports on corporate profits and the economy have been pretty much as expected -- bad -- and yesterday's reports were no different. Wall Street analysts seemed to find that sort of news not only unsurprising but also uninteresting. 
"The only other driver is geopolitical events," said Arthur Hogan, chief market analyst at Jefferies & Company.
Although those events were more anthrax scares and more raids on Afghanistan, investors latched onto a confident mood. The Dow Jones industrial average gained 172.92 points, or 1.9 percent, to close at 9,377.03. The technology-heavy Nasdaq composite index rose 36.77 points, or 2.2 percent, to 1,708.08. The broader Standard & Poor's 500-stock index gained 16.42 points, or 1.5 percent, to 1,089.90.
"Is it sustainable?" said David Henwood, chief investment officer for Raymond James & Associates. "We don't think so."
"There is a feeling on the part of some that you just never know when this market's going to take off," Mr. Henwood said. "You need to use these rallies in the market to take some gains on stocks that are moving without any fundamental good news."
Each of the major indexes dropped 1.5 percent or more last week, and the market's rally yesterday was enough to make back the bulk of those losses.
The gains in the Dow were led by Minnesota Mining and Manufacturing, which rose $5.22, to $107.39. The company reported a 21 percent decline in third-quarter earnings and warned that its fourth-quarter profits would fall at the low end of analysts' estimates.
American Express, another Dow component and a company that has moved its offices temporarily because of the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks, said its profits had fallen 60 percent, to $298 million, or 22 cents a share, in the quarter. Analysts expected the company to earn 19 cents to 36 cents a share, with an average estimate of 30 cents, according to Thomson Financial/First Call. Still, shares of American Express gained $1, to $30.32.
Earnings for companies in the S.& P. 500 are down 22.4 percent from last year, with about 245 companies reporting, according to Thomson Financial/First Call, which made its estimate with the assumption that companies that have not yet reported will match estimates.
Some of those most acutely affected by the terrorist attacks have yet to report. The AMR Corporation, the parent of American Airlines; Starwood Hotels; and the Hilton Hotels Corporation have scheduled announcements for this week. Many other airlines have scheduled announcements for next week.
The Conference Board, an economic research group based in New York, also reported that its index of leading indicators fell 0.5 percent in September, with the drop beginning before the attacks.

Treasury Prices Slip
 (By Reuters) -- Treasury bond prices fell yesterday as the market awaited a jumbo corporate debt sale from the Ford Motor Company.
Ford Motor planned to sell $9.4 billion in debt in what would be the sixth-largest corporate debt sale ever, and more than three times what the company originally planned, because of heavy investor demand.
The 10-year Treasury note fell 4/32, to a price of 102 30/32. The note's yield, which moves in the opposite direction from the price, rose to 4.62 percent from 4.61 percent on Friday.
The price of the 30-year Treasury bond fell 5/32, to 100 3/32. The bond's yield rose to 5.37 percent from 5.36 percent on Friday.

HEADLINE: In Tougher Times, It's a Life of Affluence Minus Trimmings; 
Pinched, But Not Really Pinching Pennies

BYLINE:  By STEPHANIE STROM 

DATELINE: COLORADO SPRINGS 

 BODY:
Only one stock in Gary Markle's portfolio is still in the black, but that did not stop him from buying a 2002 Mercury Mountaineer sport utility this month for his wife.
 "She wanted a new car, her car was two or three years old, and we said, well, sure," said Mr. Markle, a software entrepreneur who now runs the Colorado Springs Technology Incubator. "What really pushed us over the edge were the deals out there." he added. "But even without those incentives, we would have bought it." 
 Construction has also continued on the Markles' $1.5 million dream home, which they started in February. They briefly had second thoughts after the terrorist attacks but quickly decided that it made no sense to walk away from the project. 
As the nation heads into an economic period with all the hallmarks of a recession, affluent people in this affluent community of 358,000 splayed at the foot of Pikes Peak are still eating cake. They are beginning, though, to forgo the icing.
"Anything even slightly capricious is out," said Mike Edgar, president of Wells Fargo's retail banking operation here. "But they're still buying cars, and home building is still strong."
Many here, like their counterparts around the country, have lost money in the stock market. Their retirement portfolios have also shrunk. That financial strain, rather than the economic shock delivered by the attacks, seems to be the prime contributor to the more cautious attitude now evident here.
Yet even as some people are losing the well-paid jobs that help support local prosperity, housing values are so far holding up, helping maintain a general sense that the bottom is not falling out of the economy.
Colorado Springs has certainly not escaped economic distress. Layoffs are running at a record pace this year, and sales-tax revenue has sharply dropped off. Intel, the big computer-chip maker, and Atmel, a computer circuitry manufacturer, have both held off on plans for new facilities here. Tourism began to slow even before the attacks on New York and Washington. The large population of retired military people in Colorado Springs -- home to Fort Carson, Peterson Air Force Base and the Air Force Academy -- is feeling pinched, too.
Nonetheless, the well-to-do here are still buying cars, going out to dinner and pumping money into real estate. "We have had three to four years of unprecedented wealth growth in this country," Mr. Markle said. "I think people are saying to themselves, well, 'I had $3 million, and now I only have $2 million. But $2 million is still a lot of money.' "
More broadly, as the stock market posted ever higher highs and housing values doubled and even trippled in some places, economists spent countless hours the last few years analyzing the impact that increased wealth had on overall consumer spending in the United States. Estimates of the increase in spending for every dollar that wealth increases, known as the wealth effect, range from about 3 to 18 cents, depending on the analyst.
"The wealth effect has been the biggest factor behind the economy's enormous growth in recent years," said Mark Zandi, chief economist at Economy.com, a consulting firm, "and so it is also the biggest risk to continued expansion."
Now the question is whether the wealth effect works the same way in reverse. Housing values remain strong but the stock market has taken a beating, pulling down the average net worth of American households -- much of it concentrated in the upper fifth of the income spectrum -- to an estimated $363,000 at the end of the third quarter compared with a peak of $426,000 in the third quarter last year. (The net worth of the typical household is well below the average because most Americans own little stock.)
"The surge in wealth created a surge in spending, and we will go back to more normal spending behavior," Mr. Zandi said.
James Smith, a labor economist at the RAND Corporation, agreed that the fall in the stock market, if it persists, will have a negative impact on spending -- but only over a two- or three-year period. "The wealth effect has to persist for reasonable periods of time," he said. "Worrying about one day, one month or even six- month changes in the stock market is not a reasonable guide."
That is because changes in fundamental spending habits are not made overnight. George Kreigler, a senior vice president at the Quantum Corporation, a California-based data storage and protection company with manufacturing operations here, figures that he is worth twice as much today as he was in 1995, despite some losses in the stock market and a decline in the value of his options.
"In 1995, I lived a very conservative life; I don't live that way anymore," Mr. Kreigler said. "If this downturn continues, I would have to adjust my lifestyle -- and that wouldn't be easy. You get used to going out to shows, to dinner, traveling." 
For now, while self-indulgence is on the wane, signs of serious frugality are hard to see here. Indeed, if anything, many affluent residents are seeking ways to capitalize on the downturn. Nowhere is that more apparent than in real estate.
Matt A. Coleman, who heads strategy and business development for Van Gilder Insurance, a privately held regional insurer, recently took out a home equity loan and used the proceeds to buy a vacant lot in the affluent Kissing Camels residential development here. And he is looking for other opportunities to buy property.
Mr. Coleman, a graduate of the Naval Academy, sold his family's insurance business to Van Gilder in 1998. "I had watched the value of the business grow dramatically since 1992 and decided to sell," he said. "That's a kind of very meaningful wealth creation event that isn't in the public domain, and in the last several years, a lot of people have had similar good fortune."
Jeff Smith, founder of the Classic Companies, a group of housing development and finance companies, said that with mortgage rates so low, housing is still seen as a good value, particularly compared with the stock market.
"People see it as the chance of a lifetime to own a home, and in some cases, a more expensive one than they might have originally planned on," he said. "They see money as cheap."
Larry Nichols, who builds custom homes with an average price of $1 million, said revenue this year -- despite a few canceled or postponed contracts -- will be about the same as last year's record-setting pace.
"One client had to sell a house elsewhere and ran into difficulty with that; one had planned an I.P.O. that was put on hold," he said. "But they've been replaced by new buyers; some cashed in their stock holdings and put the proceeds into real estate."
Not all real estate has retained its allure, however, and some worry that high-end prices will fall a lot further.
Meanwhile, among the affluent there are signs that spending on a host of extra luxuries has already started to slow. Paul Fredell says that for the first time since he started his residential and commercial landscaping business 17 years ago, revenue will be down this year. He is taking out larger ads in the Yellow Pages and trying to increase his commercial business to help offset the decline.
For many well-off people here, the market decline does not mean cutting back on existing spending so much as postponing their ambitions.
"The downturn in the stock market has certainly made us much more conservative when it comes to purchasing big-ticket items," said Jim Johnston, a retired brigadier general who is now an investment adviser. He and his wife had considered trading their $400,000-plus mountain retreat for one in the $700,000 to $750,000 range but have put that off.
That kind of thinking is putting a real crimp in Steven R. King's business. With a partner, Mr. King has spent the last few years buying ranch properties in the area and carving them up into lots for retirement and weekend homes. Until this year it was going great. But no longer. "The only way to say it is that we started careering downhill fast after the first quarter," he said. "We usually do 65 percent of our business in August, September and October, but today we're sitting on zero."
His own investments have suffered, too, so much that the value of his son's college fund dropped to the point where he and his wife felt compelled to dip into other finances to bolster it.
Mr. Kreigler, the Quantum executive, said the drop in the stock market had cut his 18-year-old son's college fund in half, too, but even so, there is plenty left to cover the costs of four years at the University of Nebraska.
And while cautious, Mr. Kreigler is not yet worried about his immediate finances. Attracted by incentives, he recently bought a $40,000 Acura 3.5RL. He and his wife were on vacation in Hawaii on Sept. 11. He has no plans to stop buying expensive new stereo equipment.
His investment portfolio, he said, is fairly safe, heavily weighted to government, municipal and corporate bonds. He might be interested in the right investment property if something strikes his eye.
Still, he realizes that his situation has changed for the worse. His options are worth much less than before; Quantum stock hit its high for the year on Jan. 11 and is now down more than 40 percent.
"One of my longtime goals has been to retire at 50," he said. "I'm now 48, and it looks like I'm going to miss that target."

HEADLINE: A NATION CHALLENGED: THE LEADERS; 
A Flurry of Hugs for 'Gang of Five' in Capital

BYLINE:  By RICHARD L. BERKE 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Oct. 22 

 BODY:
When President Bush smothered the highest-ranking Democrats, Senator Tom Daschle and Representative Richard A. Gephardt, in bear hugs last month after he addressed a joint meeting of Congress, Mr. Bush wondered if he had gone too far.
 The next day, Mr. Daschle said, the president asked him, "Do you think it was O.K. that we hugged each other in front of all these people?" 
 Of his reply Mr. Daschle recalled, "I said, 'It just seemed like the natural thing to do.' " 
Senator Trent Lott of Mississippi, the Republican leader, did not get a hug, though he was standing behind Mr. Daschle, of South Dakota.
"That was more a bear hug from Daschle than it was from Bush," Mr. Lott said, a tad defensively. "I gave him a very strong handshake. I'm not a hugger, I guess."
They are still working out the kinks in this newfound cuddliness. The latest twist in the relations among the United States' top leaders came late last week when the House shut down because of the anthrax threat. But the Senate stayed open, leaving members of the House to cast the senators as reckless and the senators to cast the House as overly cautious. On Tuesday, the leaders and their Congressional colleagues are due back in their chambers.
Shut down or not, hugs or no hugs, lawmakers said they could not remember when Democratic and Republican leaders in Congress had worked so intimately with each other -- and with the president.
Before Sept. 11, Mr. Bush's relationships with Mr. Lott, Mr. Gephardt, Mr. Daschle and the speaker of the House, J. Dennis Hastert, were often little more than perfunctory. Mr. Hastert, of Illinois, and Mr. Gephardt, of Missouri, rarely even spoke to each other.
These days, they are the Gang of Five. Often to the exclusion -- and great dismay -- of other lawmakers, they have made fundamental decisions as a group, from the federal budget deal to the $15 billion bailout of the airline industry.
"Instead of having formal, photo-op meetings, they're actually having real working meetings where things are getting done and decisions are being made," said Senator John B. Breaux, Democrat of Louisiana. "There's been grumbling about what's happening to the process of governing though committees."
For the first time, Mr. Gephardt and Mr. Hastert are being accused of working together too closely.
"There are a lot of people who think he is being too accommodating to Denny," Representative James P. Moran, Democrat of Virginia, said of Mr. Gephardt. "I think he is being a genuine statesman."
The five leaders, who sometimes chat with one another several times a day, have formed a breakfast club since Sept. 11. Every Tuesday or Wednesday at 7 a.m., they gather around a table in the private dining room off the Oval Office.
The breakfasts, which began at Mr. Bush's behest, have become so indispensable that the president, resisting advice of aides, held one last Wednesday before he left for China. (Immediately afterward, Mr. Bush's guests escorted him to his helicopter, Marine One, to bid him farewell.) Though not an early riser, Mr. Lott sets his alarm before 5:30 a.m. to get to the breakfasts. He said he would not dare miss one.
Mr. Bush, fresh from the China trip, has scheduled another 7 a.m. breakfast on Tuesday.
The fallout from last week's breakfast was not entirely positive. Aides to Mr. Hastert and Mr. Gephardt complained that their bosses' decision to close the House last week was based on information Mr. Daschle received at the breakfast.
Even so, the leaders say the breakfasts are bound to have long-term benefits. After only four, the group has fallen into a routine. As the lawmakers are ushered into the inner sanctum, their aides are dismissed. There are no place cards, but Mr. Bush presides at the head of the table. Mr. Lott and Mr. Hastert sit on one side; Mr. Daschle and Mr. Gephardt on the other. Mr. Bush, having already had cereal, usually picks at the bowl of fruit in front of him. Mr. Lott orders from the White House menu what he calls "a full load" of coffee, juice, eggs, toast and grits.
At the breakfast last Wednesday, Mr. Bush began by laying out the latest action in Afghanistan. But the unfolding anthrax scare dominated the give and take. Two guests stopped in for presentations: Tom Ridge, the director of homeland security, and George J. Tenet, the director of central intelligence.
It was not all somber. Mr. Bush teased Vice President Dick Cheney (who has attended three of the four breakfasts) for emerging from seclusion. "He made some light mention of how great it is to see the vice president in the flesh," Mr. Daschle recalled.
The four Congressional leaders said in interviews that their dealings were far more candid than ever in the past.
Mr. Gephardt and Mr. Daschle said they were particularly struck by how Mr. Hastert had not been timid in their presence to ridicule the restive conservatives on his team. They cited one Capitol Hill meeting where Mr. Hastert found himself in a vigorous debate with Representative Dick Armey of Texas, the majority leader, and Representative Tom DeLay, also of Texas, the majority whip, over their objections to a special relief fund for the attack victims. Mr. Hastert, the most senior, cut them off.
"Dennis, to his great credit, just overruled them," Mr. Gephardt said. "He said, 'We only need four votes to do this -- we're going to do it.' "
Beyond huddling over legislation, the five men have developed a much more personal relationship. Mr. Lott said that when he turned 60 on Oct. 9, his first call was from Mr. Bush. Mr. Gephardt also called.
And Mr. Daschle, with a cake, burst into a luncheon where Republican senators were assembled. Mr. Lott -- the man who resists hugs -- found himself in an embrace.
As Senator Chuck Hagel, Republican of Nebraska, recalls the scene: "Daschle shakes his hand, gives him a hug and wishes him a happy birthday. They almost held hands."
Mr. Daschle and Mr. Gephardt said they would probably not have done anything had Mr. Lott's birthday been before Sept. 11.
The bonding has been particularly beneficial for Mr. Gephardt. Because his party does not control the White House and is the minority in the House, the other leaders had no imperative to pay attention to him.
Of his relations with Mr. Hastert before Sept. 11, Mr. Gephardt said: "There was no communication. At least now there's human communication."
Yet for all the stroking, Mr. Gephardt and other Democrats said they expected Mr. Bush to side with conservatives on economic stimulus.
"I know we're going to run into more holes in the road because we don't agree on how to do stimulus," Mr. Gephardt said.
There has always been better communication between Mr. Dachle and Mr. Lott because, with only 100 members, the Senate is more collegial.
"Trent and I have had highs and lows in our relationship," Mr. Daschle said. "But I don't know if I've ever felt that we've worked closer together."
Mr. Gephardt and Mr. Hastert said they bonded out of necessity on Sept. 11. After the attacks, the four Congressional leaders were whisked by helicopter from the Capitol to a secure location, believed to be in West Virginia. They spent hours together, eating bologna sandwiches and monitoring the news.
"We were in this room together and spent more time together than we've probably spent in our lives together," Mr. Hastert said. "When there are four people in a foxhole, you get to learn a lot about each other."
Describing how bonds were created in such dire circumstances, Mr. Gephardt said: "It was, in a way, a nightmare. You've got to remember we still didn't know what all could happen. When we got there, Cheney and others told us there were still planes out there unaccounted for. We didn't know what was going to happen. Scary stuff."
The hugs still loom as the most enduring symbol of the altered relationship.
Mr. Lott appeared rankled by the embrace. Asked if it was excessive, he took a long pause and carefully picked his words, saying, "Not really. I chose not to do that. I don't have any criticism of it either."
The morning after the hugs, Mr. Bush seemed a bit sheepish when he spotted Mr. Lott and Mr. Hastert at the White House. The president's Congressional liaison, Nicholas E. Calio, said Mr. Bush pondered whether to embrace the two Republicans but instead offered soothing words.
"He told them, 'Of course, I know you two a lot better,' " Mr. Calio said. " 'I've kind of hugged you in the past.' "

HEADLINE: Trade Panel Backs Steel Makers, Enabling Broad Sanctions 

BYLINE:  By JOSEPH KAHN 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Oct. 22 

 BODY:
A United States trade panel decided today that American steel makers had suffered serious injury from foreign competition, a ruling that will allow President Bush to impose the broadest restrictions in a decade on steel imports.
 The Bush administration sought the decision from the panel, the International Trade Commission, last summer and now is widely expected to impose hefty duties or quotas on foreign-made steel early next year. The final shape of the penalties awaits further hearings and a decision from the White House. 
 Sanctions are likely to apply to almost all types of steel goods and would affect the price of everything from automobiles to clothes hangers. Trade restrictions will answer the pleadings of one of the nation's sickest industries, but can be expected to annoy free-traders and alarm major trading partners like Britain, Germany, Mexico, Brazil and South Korea. 
Domestic steel producers have put pressure on Mr. Bush to protect their industry, which they say is on the verge of collapse because of cut-price competition from abroad. So far, the administration has responded more favorably to their appeals than the Clinton administration did.
Leo W. Gerard, president of the United Steelworkers of America, called the decision "the first ray of hope in years" for steelworkers and some 600,000 retirees who depend for their benefits on the shaky finances of the steel companies.
Groups advocating free trade criticized the ruling, urging the Bush administration to refrain from sheltering the industry from imports.
"This is the wrong time for steel protectionism," said Calman J. Cohen, president of the Emergency Committee for American Trade, an industry-backed group that favors open trade. "In this time of an unprecedented crisis, the world is looking to the United States for leadership, not protectionism."
Mr. Bush has often said that expanding free trade is among his top economic priorities, and he and the White House trade representative, Robert B. Zoellick, say it is an important component in building an alliance against terrorism. Still, administration officials have been straightforward about aiding the steel industry. Some administration supporters say privately that Mr. Bush and his top aides view help for the steel makers as one way of persuading members of Congress to support their trade proposal.
The industry and its unions are among the most potent in national politics. They make large contributions to candidates and are seen as able to influence the presidential election in several large, often closely divided states like Pennsylvania, West Virginia and Ohio. Mr. Bush won West Virginia, traditionally a Democratic state, last year after the Clinton administration declined to start a broad action against steel imports of the sort that the Bush administration initiated in June.
The sensitivity of the issue has only increased since then, with companies including Bethlehem Steel, the third-largest American producer, recently filing for bankruptcy protection.
But the political calculus is a complex one. The Bush administration is also trying to persuade foreign trade ministers to make it easier for companies to ship goods, invest in projects and win government contracts globally. The ruling against steel imports sends a protectionist signal shortly before those talks are to begin in Doha, Qatar, next month.
Administration officials will also have to weigh the impact of any aggressive tariffs or quotas on Britain and Russia, among the largest exporters of steel and steel products to the United States and most important allies in the campaign against terrorism. 
One possibility is that the administration could try to use the International Trade Commission's ruling as leverage to persuade foreign countries to restrict steel production through so-called voluntary accords, as was done in seeking to stabilize the aluminum industry in the mid-1990's.
The administration brought the steel case before the trade commission under Section 201 of the 1974 trade act. 
That step is a potent one because under Section 201, the White House can impose penalties even without determining that foreign producers gained an advantage by pricing their exports below the cost of production. Likewise, any penalties apply broadly to foreign exporters and are not tailored to punish specific countries or companies viewed as practicing unfair competition.
Judges for the trade panel did not back the domestic steel industry on every count. They rejected complaints that companies manufacturing some kinds of products, like steel wire and nails, had suffered harm from imports. But their ruling covers an estimated 79 percent of domestic production.

HEADLINE: Samsung Electronics Reports Plunge of 75% in Earnings 

BYLINE:  By DON KIRK 

DATELINE: SEOUL, South Korea, Oct. 22 

 BODY:
Officials at Samsung Electronics maintained an air of determined optimism today even as they announced a huge plunge in quarterly earnings. But they carefully avoided any mention of what many experts say Samsung needs most: for its ailing rival, Hynix Semiconductor, to collapse once and for all.
 One Samsung official acknowledged privately that the disappearance of Hynix, which ranks third worldwide behind Samsung and Micron Technology in semiconductor sales, could be the ultimate solution for Samsung and other technology companies -- but also acknowledged that the topic was taboo. 
 On Friday, Hynix, formerly Hyundai Electronics, posted a third-quarter net loss of $1.25 billion. Deep in debt, it has turned over control of its finances to its creditors and is negotiating with them over a $4 billion rescue plan. Hynix said last week that it was ready to discuss asset sales with any interested investor.
Its struggles are widely seen as one reason chip prices have been sinking to new lows on world markets, and they help explain why Samsung earnings dropped 75 percent in the third quarter from the corresponding period last year. Desperate for cash, Hynix has been selling semiconductors for half the cost of production, and Samsung and other manufacturers have had to match those bargain-basement prices to compete, analysts said.
The price of benchmark 128-megabyte dynamic random access memory chips has been slipping 1 to 2 percent a day, some analysts said, and may not stabilize until it has fallen another 20 to 30 percent.
As a result, said Kim Gee Soo, an electronics analyst at Nomura Securities here, Samsung has to rely almost exclusively on the sale of telephone handsets for its dwindling profit. On the strength of that business, Samsung earned $323 million in the quarter, down from $1.3 billion in the third quarter of 2000.
Still, James Chung, a Samsung spokesman, said "the results were beyond imagination," considering that some analysts foresaw a loss.
And Chu Woo Sik, a vice president of the company, told investors that it would not cut back on chip production, even though the division lost $292 million in the quarter.
Mr. Kim of Nomura acknowledged that the third-quarter report was better than Nomura expected but added that there was "no upside potential" despite the strong asset value of the handsets. Samsung, he said, relies on sales in the United States, where the economy was already slumping before the Sept. 11 attacks. The digital media and household goods units, which account for nearly half Samsung's revenue, were only slightly profitable, he added.
Mr. Kim predicted that losses from chips would continue to widen and said he saw little chance that Hynix's creditors, led by government-controlled banks, would allow it to die any time soon.
Mr. Chung said Samsung's earnings would increase by late next year, but did not tie that forecast to any assessment of Hynix's future.

HEADLINE: 3M's Profit Declines 21% In Last Period 

BYLINE:  Bloomberg News 

DATELINE: ST. PAUL, Oct. 22 

 BODY:
The Minnesota Mining and Manufacturing Company said today that its third-quarter earnings fell 21 percent and that its fourth-quarter profit might be less than some estimates.
 3M, which makes products ranging from Post-It Notes to electronic circuitry, said its net income fell to $394 million, or 99 cents a share, from $499 million, or $1.25 a share, in the quarter a year ago. Sales fell 7.1 percent, to $3.97 billion. 
 Excluding costs related to work force cuts and depreciation, profit in the latest quarter would have been $1.10 a share, the company said. Analysts had expected 3M to earn $1.09 a share, according to Thomson Financial/First Call.
The company's chief executive, James McNerney, who was hired late last year, has been introducing the cost-cutting and efficiency programs he learned at General Electric. 3M has shed about 4,200 of the 5,000 jobs it has said it will eliminate and plans to cut more in coming months to cope with slowing sales, Robert Burgstahler, the chief financial officer, said during a conference call.
"3M has a new focus on costs and working capital," said Lewis Johnson, an analyst at T. Rowe Price. "This will benefit the company when the economic conditions normalize."
Sales of health care products, which account for about 15 percent of annual sales, rose 9.4 percent in the quarter. The business includes dental and pharmaceutical products and health-information systems, like computers that manage patient records.
Sales fell at all of 3M's other businesses including transportation and consumer products. Especially hard hit was the electronic and telecommunications business, where sales fell 21 percent, and profit 60 percent.
Mr. Burgstahler said the drop in the company's total profitability from last quarter to this quarter was solely attributable to the telecommunications and electronic business.
Shares of the company, based in St. Paul, rose $5.22, or 5.1 percent, to $107.39. 
Fourth-quarter profit, before certain expenses, will fall to 95 cents to $1.05 a share from $1.12 in the period a year earlier, 3M said. The company is expected to have profit of $1.05 a share, according to First Call.

HEADLINE: Across America, Restaurants Adjust to a Stay-Put Nation 

BYLINE:  BY FLORENCE FABRICANT

 BODY:
THE aftershocks of last month's terrorist attacks have resonated in restaurants far beyond New York and Washington. Perhaps the hardest hit in the rest of the country was the San Francisco region, where restaurants had already been hurt by Internet company failures. The city's restaurants are strongly dependent on visitors. After Sept. 11, leisure travel fell 25 percent and business travel about 80 percent compared with a year ago, according to the Convention and Visitors Bureau.
 "Some San Francisco restaurants are still down by 20 to 40 percent," said Bradley Ogden, an owner of One Market in San Francisco and other restaurants in the Bay Area. "I know of 10 to 12 restaurants that have already closed." 
 Among the restaurants that have gone out of business are high-end places like Montage, Gabbiano's and Splendido. Niki Leondakis, the executive vice president for hotels and restaurants at the Kimpton Group, which owned Splendido, said the restaurant had already been challenged by the economy. "And after Sept. 11, we just couldn't sustain the rent," she said. Sales in the company's restaurants in six other cities, like Seattle and Portland, Ore., have not suffered as much, she added.
According to the National Restaurant Association, a Washington-based trade group, there are 844,000 restaurants in the United States. "And I would say that all felt the impact for the first 10 days," Steven Anderson, the group's president, said. Nationwide, some 100,000 restaurant workers -- 15,000 of them in New York -- have lost their jobs since Sept. 11. Suburban restaurants and neighborhood restaurants in cities seem to be weathering uncertain times better than high-end corporate or tourist-dependent restaurants. 
Tim Zagat, who publishes guides to restaurants in more than 40 American cities, said that downtown restaurants are hurting the most, especially in cities that are not vigorously promoting their restaurants, as New York has been doing.
In Chicago, several restaurateurs said business was back to within 10 percent of where it was a year ago. "Chicago did not suffer as big an economic downturn before the attacks as some other cities," said Rick Bayless, who owns Topolobampo and Frontera Grill. "And if Chicagoans were not traveling to other cities, they were staying here and eating in our restaurants." But business in the four restaurants that the Levy Organization owns in the 110-story Sears Tower is still off, partly because of increased security.
In Los Angeles, mid-level and inexpensive restaurants, especially ethnic ones, are rebounding, though high-end dining is still off. Similarly, Peter Christie, the president of the Massachusetts Restaurant Association, said that restaurants in downtown Boston, like Ambrosia, Radius and Seasons in the Four Seasons Hotel, which depend on corporate fly-in travelers, were suffering the most. "Steakhouses tend to be doing well," he added.
Todd English, who owns restaurants in Boston, Washington, Las Vegas and New York, said the one in Washington is the worst off. "We're two blocks from the White House," he said. "They have all these barriers up, and now this anthrax thing is freaking people out."
In New Orleans, tourism and convention attendance is down, but Susan Spicer, who owns three restaurants, said business has been building steadily. "You have to remember," she said, "in New Orleans the locals support the restaurants." 
In Atlanta, Pano Karatassos, the chairman of the Buckhead Life Restaurant Group, which owns 12 restaurants, predicted that October's sales would be down by only about 4 percent over last year. Nonetheless, he's taken caviar off the menu at his top restaurant, Pano's & Paul's.
Mr. Anderson of the National Restaurant Association is optimistic that restaurants will be resilient. "Fine dining has gone from being a leisure activity to an essential part of people's lives," he said.
Some restaurateurs said recent events have forced them to concentrate on providing better service. "We have to appreciate every customer who walks in the door," Mr. Bayless said. "And if anything good is coming out of all of this, that's it."

HEADLINE: MANAGEMENT; 
A Legal Tightrope for Employers After Attacks

BYLINE:  By SANA SIWOLOP 

 BODY:
Vincent Ferranti is a living management quandary, one that employers everywhere might want to ponder.
 On Sept. 11, Mr. Ferranti, 37, a bond-redemption specialist at Morgan Stanley, was walking by a window near his office on the fifth floor of 5 World Trade Center when the first plane hit 1 World Trade Center. He saw debris flying and people fleeing his building. 
 In the days that followed, he said he often felt too terrified to leave his Queens apartment. He began suffering anxiety attacks, up to 10 to 20 a day.
In an effort to wrestle free of his fears, Mr. Ferranti went back to work on Sept. 24, at temporary offices that Morgan Stanley set up about 10 blocks from the World Trade Center site. But even then, he found himself sobbing uncontrollably from time to time.
"I never experienced anxiety before," Mr. Ferranti said. "But now the slightest little thing triggers it, whether it's going through a subway tunnel or someone dropping something on a train. I just want to be home."
And therein lies the management puzzle. Just how far does his employer have to go to accommodate his concerns?
The first responsibility for corporate managers after the terror attacks was to help employees deal with their grief and fear. But now, they are also having to face up to a more conventional but equally complicated task: preparing for possible legal fallout from the disaster.
It is a delicate balancing act, to say the least. But employment lawyers and workplace specialists advise employers in New York and across the country to examine anew state and federal laws that could cause them legal or financial headaches. These can range from the threat of lawsuits for failing to abide by the Americans With Disabilities Act to the inconvenience of having to ask employees for permission to deposit paychecks automatically into their bank accounts.
"There are so many laws that were once on the back burner but that are now suddenly coming forward," said Peter J. Petesch, a partner in the Washington office of Ford & Harrison, an Atlanta law firm.
The federal disabilities law is a prime example. Most big corporations have complied with its ban on job discrimination and its requirements for special workplace accommodations. But it is not always clear who is covered under the legislation, leaving some employers to wonder what their responsibilities are to people who say the attacks have left them emotionally distraught.
Other difficult questions include:
*Whether employers risk lawsuits if they dismiss employees who refuse to be relocated to other offices, and whether such people are eligible for unemployment benefits.
*Whether employees who request time off for reasons related to the attacks are eligible for the 12 weeks of unpaid job-protected leave stipulated in the 1993 Family and Medical Leave Act.
*Whether companies can be sued if expatriate Americans who are denied requests to return to the States are injured or killed in future terrorist attacks.
*What special measures employers should institute to prevent workplace harassment of people of Mideastern origin.
*What companies' legal requirements are toward employees who are called to active military duty.
And while so far, few employment lawyers are reporting legal actions by workers against their employers, the scale of the national trauma makes it almost inevitable that some disputes will wind up in court.
Joan Caruso, a partner at the Ayers Group, a career management consulting firm in Manhattan, said that nearly all the employees that her company had voluntarily counseled at more than a dozen Wall Street firms had expressed concerns about going back to work or returning to New York.
And that, in turn, is creating confusion among employers, said Orna Guralnik, a Manhattan clinical psychologist who is also a partner at WorkLab Consulting, a Manhattan firm.
"Managers have repeatedly told us that they have people who want to stay home," and don't know whether to let them, Ms. Guralnik said.
David B. Ross, managing partner of the New York office of Seyfarth Shaw, a law firm in Chicago, describes another legal problem. After the attacks, his office heard from a number of Manhattan companies that were reeling from the attacks but to avoid layoffs wanted to ask employees to work less than five days for less than full pay.
It turned out they could not legally do so, because the Fair Labor Standards Act only allows employers to dock the pay of wage earners, not managers or supervisors who are paid weekly or monthly salaries. To comply with the act, companies would have had to reclassify their managerial employees as part-time workers, a hard administrative task, said William P. Perkins, a Seyfarth Shaw partner, who added that most of the companies opted for layoffs.
Some employers ran into another, if less daunting, legal wall when they tried to make sure faraway employees were paid on time. Ordinarily, the paychecks were sent by airmail, but because most planes were grounded, many companies queried the Society for Human Resource Management in Alexandria, Va., to see if they could require employees to use electronic direct-deposit programs for their paychecks.
The center's answer: only 10 states allow employers to make such deposits mandatory, and New York, New Jersey and Connecticut were not among them.
Generating answers for other employer inquiries may take longer. Melody L. Jones, the chief human resources officer at the Aon Corporation, which lost 200 employees in the attacks, said she was prepared for the possibility that some survivors would develop post-traumatic stress disorder, which can set off nonstop nightmares and often debilitate victims.
Ms. Jones said that a few employees had asked for medical leaves to take time off for emotional health.
"Right now our people are so focused on simply getting through this," she said.
As for Mr. Ferranti of Morgan Stanley, he is easing his way back into the workplace. His company has been sensitive to employees' fears, he says, allowing them to return to their jobs at their own pace. On his first day back, Mr. Ferranti worked for four hours and then returned home.
"It is comforting being back with fellow employees," he said. But, he added, "Right now, I don't want to be surrounded by people."

SELLING BEN CHEEVER
Back to Square 1 in a Service Economy
By Benjamin Cheever
286 pages. Bloomsbury. $25.95
 Sometime during the mid-1990's Benjamin Cheever may have wrapped you a sandwich, sold you a computer or tried to sell you a car. You might not have recognized the older man in the ill-fitting uniform from his dust-jacket photographs. Mr. Cheever had recently slipped across the class border in polyester camouflage to become an undercover writer. 
 In 1995, when Mr. Cheever lost his publisher to corporate downsizing and failed to sell his third novel, he decided to write a book about "everybody's worst nightmare," taking entry-level jobs. "Selling Ben Cheever: Back to Square 1 in a Service Economy" is an account of five years spent pursuing and occasionally landing a variety of jobs, from sidewalk Santa to car salesman, that provided some of the happiest and bleakest moments in his life.
Unlike Barbara Enhrenreich in "Nickel and Dimed: On (Not) Getting By in America," Mr. Cheever the worker lived comfortably at home with his wife, Janet Maslin, then the chief film critic of The New York Times and now a book reviewer for the paper. His safety net did not, however, guarantee him immediate success. "This is a book about failure," Mr. Cheever admits at the outset, preparing us for the embarrassing interviews, the unanswered calls, the defeats witnessed by triumphant customers and wincing colleagues.
Failure is of course what we want. For the reader the appeal of an undercover odyssey is not only voyeuristic but mildly sadistic; we get to observe those who usually interpret reality for us receiving an undiluted dose of it themselves. For a novelist, paradoxically, it is an escape into reality. This seems particularly true for Mr. Cheever, a wry observer whose laconic, eliptical style at first seems ill suited to descriptions of life at the nonironic shop-floor level but who gradually relaxes into a more expansive, less mannered approach. Mr. Cheever has always been good at humiliation. In "Selling Ben Cheever," however, it is entertaining and oddly affecting to watch him describe his own.
When Mr. Cheever is recognized selling computers in White Plains, for example, he tries not to squirm. " 'Oh, so you're into this now,' said a woman who had been an editor with me at The Reader's Digest. I can't know, but I thought from the way she worked her face that she was thinking, Ben never was all that smart." Often the squirm is self-induced.
Writing a sales slip for H. Cabot Lodge, Mr. Cheever cannot resist blurting out, "I also have a famous name." Mr. Lodge politely ignores the gaffe and continues to call him Ben.
Answering advertisements, filling out application forms and hounding employers half his age, Mr. Cheever expects to be told, "You're too good for us." But nobody says that. People ask if he can work weekends and in some cases provide a urine sample. He finds that he can.
Descriptions of early stints as a sidewalk Santa and a security guard at a Guerlain warehouse are mildly funny but unengaging, and economic statistics on the number of "failures" out there and their struggle to survive strike a similarly flat note. Mr. Cheever is an unconvincing analyst, no Ehrenreich. What interests him are the messy details that ruin a spreadsheet, the insights provided by experience. At Nobody Beats the Wiz, for instance, a trainer reveals that "if you stink, you can't sell."
Aware that Antioch College in 1966 prepared him inadequately for sales, perhaps for anything ("One woman fulfilled her physical science requirement by having a baby. She got all 15 credits and named the child Lenin."), Mr. Cheever suspects his outlook to be a further impediment: "I've often confused losing with being a good sport." Working at the Cosi Sandwich Bar, however, he is inspired to construct the perfect sandwich. Soon he makes a less wholesome discovery: He loves to sell. He loves to sell cars.
At Wegman Auto, in the book's final section, "Big Game," Mr. Cheever hits his stride, even develops a swagger. Assigned to the G.M. side of the lot when he longs to sell Toyotas (the leather-jacketed Toyota salesmen are "the R.A.F. of Wegman Auto"), he plots a sneaky strategy. "I had a bowl of clementines for my desk, plus a windup toy seal in tin to amuse the children while I charmed their parents into ruinous debt." 
His is just a variation on the Wegman philosophy. It's great to be a salesman, the trainees learn, because you get to create reality: "You want your prospect out there imagining herself in the new car. . . . You want her imagining how the new antilock brakes might save her life."
Mr. Cheever conveys the tedium of the long, customer-starved hours spent calling prospects from his cubicle or pacing the lot, the clammy awkwardness of the first approach and the tension of protracted haggling. 
Describing the economics of the business, the plays, the feints, the lies, he cautions against easy condemnation. "Car salesman are obnoxious, but change the style, and they're a lot like the people we know," he observes, recalling Upper East Side dinner parties at which beautiful women concealed with rhapsodic enthusiasm their disappointment at being seated next to him.
Joking with four other men and one woman in the car dealership, sizing up the customers, closing in on a sale, Mr. Cheever realizes that he is having a better time than he ever had at those dinner parties. "Left to my own devices, I grow self-importance as a pond grows scum," he confesses. But this looser, stripped-down self is easier to please. Having made more than $4,000 in gross profit one February, more than any other new salesman, Mr. Cheever quivers with happiness when the boss grabs his shoulder and announces that "Benny, here, done phenomenal!"
That was the high point. Calculating that he could rely on earning $246.69 for a 50-hour week and despairing of making it across the road to Toyota or even to Nissan, Mr. Cheever quits, with a book to write of course, which is where the undercover writer's illusion dissolves.
He creates and sustains that illusion more elegantly than most as he works to make the person in the uniform more visible. "The book's greatest failing is that it's turned into such a personal story," he warns in his preface, "I'm the character I talk about most." This is true, but he is mistaken. The Ben Cheever revealed in these pages is worth selling.

HEADLINE: FILM REVIEW; 
Decadence Meets Death On an 1800's Plantation

BYLINE:  By DAVE KEHR

 BODY:
Here's a real UFO, an extremely low-budget, genuinely independent film by a 22-year-old writer-director from Philadelphia that immediately establishes a distinctive and promising voice. 
 Andrew Repasky McElhinney's "Chronicle of Corpses" is a gothic horror tale set in the early 19th century on the grounds of a dying slave plantation somewhere in the Middle Atlantic states. Though once the center of a thriving economy, the plantation has degenerated into inertia and neglect, largely as a result of the deepening decadence of its ruling family, the Elliots. 
 Grandmother (Marj Dusay, of the soap "All My Children") has retreated into wordless dementia, leaving the family affairs in the hands of assorted offspring and in-laws, most of whom have serious problems with drinking and sex. There are a priest (Jerry Perna) still on retainer, a saucy young Irish servant (Margot White) who preserves what's left of the plantation's rapidly dimming life force, and the family's youngest member, Sara (Ryan Foley), a haunted teenager, who together represent what resistance there is to the dark forces gathering both inside the family and outside the house. 
Something strange and possibly supernatural is rampaging through the woods around the Elliot compound, selecting its victims at random and destroying them in assorted awful ways. Mr. McElhinney is careful not to overdefine his metaphors: the monster represents at once the waning of a singularly unjust period of American history and the manifestation of a particular disease infecting American families. 
Shooting on 16-millimeter film and using a cast drawn largely from local theater groups, Mr. McElhinney has created a movie that is not without the flaws endemic in low-budget productions but still projects an amazing degree of stylistic assurance and originality.
Unlike most of today's indie directors, he shows no interest in jittery, hand-held compositions. His film consists of strongly framed long shots in which the characters speak largely in mumbling monotones while remaining motionless, a style that recalls at once the deliberately zomboid acting of Edgar G. Ulmer's grade-Z classics of the 1940's ("Detour," "Strange Illusion") and the Brechtian alienation techniques of experimental European filmmakers like Jean-Marie Straub and Danielle Huillet. The film takes on a hushed, ritualized tone as the bodies begin to pile up, and the family confines itself more and more to the plantation's chapel. 
Mr. McElhinney is obviously an experienced cinephile (he is also the programmer of a long-running film society in Philadelphia, the Chestnut Hill Film Group), but his film doesn't drown in show-offy references to old movies. It is more a case of an antique aesthetic absorbed and revived. 
Though the technology is no longer available to create the kind of stately, formal tracking shots that Ulmer specialized in, Mr. McElhinney and his cinematographer, Abe Holtz, have been able to recreate the dreamy, fateful sense of those shots by using a Steadycam mount. 
"A Chronicle of Corpses" belongs to the small but significant tradition of outsider art in American movies -- films like Herk Harvey's "Carnival of Souls" or George Romero's "Night of the Living Dead" -- that reflect powerful personalities formed outside any academic or professional tradition. That most of these are horror films is no coincidence; they are the films that haunt American cinema, pointing to paths that were never taken, to doors that remain firmly closed. 

A CHRONICLE OF CORPSES

Written, produced and directed by Andrew Repasky McElhinney; director of photography, Abe Holtz; edited by Ron Kalish; released by ARM/Cinema 25 Pictures Inc. At the Two Boots Pioneer Theater, 155 East Third Street, at Avenue A, East Village. Running time: 83 minutes. This film is not rated.

WITH: Marj Dusay (Grandmother Elliot), Ryan Foley (Sara Elliot), Harry Carnahan Green (Tyrone), Kevin Mitchell Martin (Mr. Elliot), Sally Mercer (Mrs. Elliot), Jerry Perna (Father Jerome), Margot White (Bridgette) and Melissa Rex (the Killer).

HEADLINE: The Roots of an Afghan Nation 

BYLINE:  By Thomas W. Simons Jr.; Thomas W. Simons Jr. teaches at the Center for International Security and Cooperation at Stanford. He was America's ambassador to Pakistan from 1996 to 1998.

DATELINE: CAMBRIDGE, Mass. 

 BODY:
We are now heavily engaged in discussions on post-Taliban political structures in Afghanistan. Afghans must be the main players, but outsiders also have major roles, and that clearly includes the United States. We will have much of the responsibility for giving post-Taliban institutions traction and staying power. Political negotiations on Afghanistan have always been extremely intricate. Those now under way can be more successful if we understand that there is space in Afghan politics between universalist Islam and the ethnic groupings that are so often painted as that unhappy country's only options.
 No doubt kinship ties give most Afghans their first identity -- a generation of war has made those ties more significant than ever; and no doubt the general shape of any political arrangement is going to have to reflect their importance. A functioning post-Taliban government will have to be a highly decentralized one in which ethnic groups enjoy substantial autonomy in their home regions. 
 But we should also recognize that the ethnic groupings that gave Afghanistan much of its structure under the Pashtun monarchy -- which ruled for more than two centuries until King Zahir Shah fell in 1973 -- belong to a past that will never return. Such groups were already weakening before the king was expelled, after a period of slow and patchy modernization. By its own choice, the country still had no railroads; but by the 1970's it had built modern roads, dams and irrigation systems, marketing networks, telegraph and telephone lines, and especially schools. All these investments eroded the country's traditional ethnic constituencies by reducing regional isolation, increasing literacy and expanding the national economy, albeit modestly.
The resulting political and social uncertainties helped produce the Communist takeover of 1978, and they helped define the war that followed the Soviet invasion of 1979. This was because freshly educated young men saw too few prospects for themselves or the country within the limits of traditional power structures -- and were able to build new ones. Most of the leaders who emerged in the war -- Communist and mujahedeen alike -- have been from Afghanistan's first college-educated generation. That was why Ahmed Shah Masud, the guerrilla commander assassinated Sept. 9, spoke French, and why Gulbuddin Hekmatyar, Pakistan's longtime favorite Pashtun Islamist who is now edging toward alliance with his old Taliban enemies, can style himself an engineer.
Foreign Minister Abdullah of the Northern Alliance is a medical doctor and speaks exceptional English, and the president of the shadow government he serves, Burhanuddin Rabbani, is always careful to append "professor" to his name. All these men were detribalized. War may have reinforced ethnic identities for many, but those identities are not as simple as they once were or as easy to hold. 
The decades of war have pounded away at the country's tribal structures even further. Historically, Afghans have had no particular reputation for Islamic rigor, but with familiar ethnic contours shifting and slipping, Islamist salvationism offered spiritual relief and, for a time, political clarity. 
When the Taliban arose in the mid-1990's, they were considered an alternative to the competing warlords whose soldiers were either mercenaries or kin. While the Taliban are mainly Pashtun, with their strongest base in tribal groupings around Kandahar, they spoke and fought in the name of a universal God.
For most Afghans, the Taliban's brand of universalism has probably been discredited by their mistakes and misdeeds, and now by the new misery they have brought down on Afghanistan. But the alternative is not a return to ethnic politics. Ethnic loyalties will still be important, but they cannot define the new system. Their weakened position in Afghan society was a factor that helped bring about the decades of war, and the wars have hastened that decay. Those loyalties can and should be subsumed in government structures that encourage a sense of nationhood beyond kinship.
Most Afghans of all ethnic groupings cherish their country, and they associate relative security and modest well-being with the centuries of cohabitation before the war. In the cities, ethnic groups have lived close together. The great shrines, like those in Mazar-i-Sharif, drew pilgrims from all over the country.
 The Afghan version of Persian, Dari, was not just the mother tongue of the Tajik minority, the Pashtun Durrani dynasty, and most inhabitants of Kabul. Dari, not Pashto, has been an Afghan lingua franca. There was, and can still be, a genuine Afghan national community.
If the post-Taliban government is to be stable, the discussions taking place in Pakistan, Rome and elsewhere -- among Afghans, Pakistanis, Americans, the United Nations special representative Lakhdar Brahimi and other parties -- must do more than broker positions at the starting gate. They must also point the way toward national institutions that can work.
From these discussions, a supreme council, with 120 members, is expected to emerge; negotiations on membership are set to begin in Istanbul next week. The council will probably appoint a loya jirga, or grand national assembly -- the basic governing body for a post-Taliban state. This assembly must include respected Pashtun leaders. Pakistani and American efforts to woo some Pashtuns away from the Taliban have been disappointing -- not least because the Pashtun southerners fear their ethnic rivals in the Northern Alliance. Certainly such efforts are crucial; but their very difficulty reveals the limitations of ethnic politics in working toward a national Afghan solution.
If the loya jirga does meet, it will still be only a start. Lasting stabilization will require new institutions with national reach -- government ministries that can build roads and schools and provide health care -- not to enforce centralization but to ensure a viable Afghan government. Afghanistan, like many countries, has failed to achieve a stable balance between central government and decentralized power. It has already paid a very high price for that failure; a new regime should be structured carefully so it might overcome this historic problem.

In a sign of desperate times, many airlines on many of their flights will serve no meals.

BYLINE:  By Joe Sharkey; The Business Travel column appears each Wednesday. E-mail: jsharkey@nytimes.com.

 BODY:
"WOULD you care for dinner?" the flight attendant asks.
 "What are the choices?" the passenger says. 
 "Yes and no," the flight attendant replies.
With the mounting miseries of air travel, that little joke, which was timely as recently as two months ago when airlines were merely cutting back on the quality and variety of the food they served, is already out of date. Very soon, at mealtime on most domestic flights, most airlines will no longer offer even a Hobson's choice -- which is defined as no choice at all. 
That is because many airlines are eliminating most meal service, except on international flights. If you want lunch on that business trip from, say, Boston to Chicago, you'll probably have to brown-bag it yourself.
Yesterday, United Airlines joined most of its major competitors and said it was eliminating a big portion of its meal service. Economy-class passengers "on flights that are 1,635 miles or less, which equates to about 3 hours and 45 minutes, will not have meals," said Chris Nardella, a United spokeswoman.
In first class, meals are being eliminated on flights under two hours, or about 700 miles, she said. Meal service on international flights is largely unchanged.
United thus joined American Airlines, Delta Air Lines, Northwest Airlines, US Airways, Midwest Express Airlines, T.W.A. and others in announcing sharp reductions in in-flight meal service in recent weeks. The only major holdout was Continental Airlines, which said yesterday that it would continue to serve meals as usual on its planes.
Still, some airline analysts, echoing the refrain that everything has changed since Sept. 11, say that we may be witnessing at least the partial demise of a basic component of air-travel culture: the ubiquitous, long-defamed airline meal.
"I think it's permanent," Michael Boyd, the president of the Boyd Group, an airline consultant firm based in Evergreen, Colo., said of the trend toward ending meals.
"Of course, some of the elimination had already begun," before Sept. 11, he said. "If you were flying in coach on shorter flights, hot meals were going the way of the dodo in any case."
The domestic airline industry, already seeing its worst year in a decade after its lucrative business travel market fell sharply last winter when the economy soured, has been desperately cutting costs since Sept. 11, even after it was granted a $15 billion federal bailout.
Airlines have slashed schedules, benched aircraft and announced layoffs of about 100,000 employees. Eliminating meals on many flights -- the food cost for an economy class meal averages about $4 for an airline --is another step in that process.
American Airlines and its T.W.A. subsidiary announced on Sept. 20 that, effective Nov. 1, they would no longer serve meals in economy class on domestic flights (excluding nonstop transcontinental flights) and in first class on domestic flights of less than two hours.
Next came Northwest. Northwest is cutting meal service in domestic economy-class flights except for those between its three hubs (at Detroit, Minneapolis/St. Paul and Memphis) and the West Coast, and in domestic first-class flights under two hours, according to Kurt Ebenhoch, a spokesman.
Delta then announced last Friday that, starting Nov. 1, it will eliminate meals on domestic flights of less than 1,750 miles in economy and less than 700 miles in first class. US Airways also said it would drop meal service on most domestic flights, except transcontinental nonstops.
Mr. Boyd has projected that domestic air traffic will be off 9 percent this year and that the domestic airline industry will experience a revenue shortfall of $28 billion over previously anticipated revenue in the next 15 months. He said that he even expected some airlines to remove kitchen facilities from some planes.
"You're probably looking at hot galleys being taken off a lot of airplanes to save weight," he said. "Why have them if you're not going to serve any food?"
Continental insisted that its policy to continue serving meals would remain in effect. "We absolutely will not change it," said Rahsaan Johnson, a spokesman.
He added: "It comes down to this: If you're a business traveler who just got out of a 5 o'clock meeting and you want to catch that 7 o'clock flight to get back home and you don't have time to stop to get something to eat, you want the airline to give you a snack or a meal; you want it to be appetizing, and you remember if you didn't get it."
The airline food-catering industry is reeling from the cuts.
Two companies, LSG Sky Chefs, owned by Lufthansa, and Gate Gourmet, owned by SAir Group, the parent of the financially troubled airline Swissair, dominate the in-flight meal business, operating kitchens around the world that turn out about 60 percent of all airline meals.
LSG, whose main customer in the United States is American Airlines, said in late September that it would lay off about 30 percent of its domestic work force of 16,300 at kitchens at 58 domestic airports. Gate Gourmet said it had eliminated 1,800 jobs in the United States.
"We're getting lots of conflicting reports, but across the board, the numbers I'm getting are 20 to 30 percent staff reductions" in the airline catering industry, said Steven P. Bowling, the executive director of the International Inflight Food Service Association.
"It looks very bad, and it could get worse," said Tom Snyder, a spokesman for the Hotel Employees and Restaurant Employees International Union, which represents many of the in-flight catering industry workers. "We already have about 25 percent of our members in both LSG and Gate Gourmet laid off."
On airplanes, you can still get a cup of coffee, meanwhile. Getting some Sweet 'N Low or powdered creamer might be a problem, though.
Since the anthrax scares began earlier this month, panicked reports of suspicious white powders have diverted or delayed more than a dozen flights. As a result, one carrier, Northwest, said last week that it would no longer serve sugar substitutes or powdered creamer with coffee and tea.
Said Mr. Ebenhoch, the spokesman: "Every time it spills, it's a potential issue."

HEADLINE: THE MEDIA BUSINESS: ADVERTISING; 
Evenin a gloomy business outlook, magazine executives see some long-term opportunities.

BYLINE:  By Stuart Elliott 

 BODY:
THOUGH magazines are facing perhaps their most clouded business outlook in decades, executives at a conference said yesterday, the problems confronting the industry bring with them opportunities to strengthen operations to prepare for the inevitable cyclical upturn.
 But as if to underline the chill of the current climate, as the executives were speaking at a panel during a general session of the 2001 American Magazine Conference, not far away, the American Association of Advertising Agencies was deciding to suspend publication of its own magazine, Agency, because of the weak economy. 
 "We have not done our jobs as consumer marketers," said one panelist, Jack Kliger, president and chief executive at Hachette Filipacchi Publications in New York, a division of the Lagardere Group that produces magazines like Elle, Premiere and Woman's Day.
"We have to change the model because we've become too dependent on advertising revenue," he added. "We have been spoiled by advertising revenue being very plentiful, and I don't see it coming back in the same way" after the downturn ends. 
A study by Veronis Suhler & Associates estimates that ad revenue as a contributor to total magazine revenue will reach 62 percent by 2005, compared with 60 percent last year and 53 percent in 1995. As reliance on ad revenue increases, magazines receive less revenue from sources like readers, in the form of payments for subscriptions and copies bought on newsstands; licensing rights fees and merchandise sales.
The dependence on ad revenue is dangerous because of the accelerating decline in demand for ad pages among marketers. Through September, magazine ad pages fell a steep 9.2 percent compared with those in the first nine months of 2000, according to the Publishers Information Bureau in New York. The bureau is an affiliate of the organizations that sponsored the conference, the Magazine Publishers of America and the American Society of Magazine Editors.
For instance, at Business Week magazine, owned by McGraw-Hill in New York, ad pages will have plunged to about 4,000 by the end of the year, said the moderator of the panel, Stephen B. Shepard, editor in chief, from 6,000 last year and 5,000 in 1999.
"What's worse," he added, "profitability levels will go back to 1991," a year of a war and a recession.
A decade later, it is deja vu all over again, as Yogi Berra would say.
"It's the worst marketplace to sell magazines to advertisers and consumers since World War II," said another panelist, Steven T. Florio, president and chief executive at Conde Nast Publications in New York, the unit of Advance Publications that is closing one of its myriad magazines, Mademoiselle, with the November issue.
But "as horrible as it is," he added, you "can examine every part of your business" for potential growth.
For example, Mr. Florio said, Conde Nast is "looking at other revenue sources for the first time" like licensing and merchandising. He joked that another panelist, Martha Stewart, who is known for capitalizing on such revenue sources, was about to introduce a line of F-15 fighter jets, "and on every bomb it'll say, 'And that's a good thing.' "
Ms. Stewart, chairwoman and chief executive at Martha Stewart Living Omnimedia in New York, discussed her actual enterprises, which range from $1.3 billion worth of licensed merchandise sold through Kmart stores to Martha by Mail, her in-house catalog operation, to a coming reintroduction of her Web site (www.marthastewart.com), on which "we've been spending a lot of money," she said, "to the dismay of Wall Street."
Also, "we're thinking about starting a new magazine," Ms. Stewart said, because "it's a good time" to do so as other publishers pull back.
"I'm not going to tell you the subject," she added, laughing, but she did disclose that the company would be "testing the waters with special issues" of its flagship magazine, Martha Stewart Living. In December, about 1.3 million subscribers will receive copies of a special issue called Living With Technology, Ms. Stewart said, to be solely sponsored by Hewlett-Packard.
Mr. Kliger also praised merchandising as an alternative form of revenue, declaring that "Elle merchandise sells $500 million around the world, and I don't think we've lost one page of advertising" from companies that sell competing goods.
Additionally, Mr. Kliger said, "it's a good time to make acquisitions, to get deeper in areas where you have" strong brands already.
Another panelist, Tom Rogers, chairman and chief executive at Primedia in New York, said that his company benefited by acquiring Emap USA, a publisher of enthusiast magazines like Guns & Ammo, Skin Diver and Snowboarder.
"We used to be No. 1 or No. 2 in so many of our categories," Mr. Rogers said. "Now, we are No. 1 and No. 2."
Enthusiast magazines present growth opportunities, he added, because their "endemic advertising has held up in recessions." (Mr. Rogers is, however, "going to sell a couple things," he said, to help "pay down some debt" owed by Primedia, estimated to total $2 billion.)
Mr. Florio was asked by an audience member what he would say "to reassure us in the magazine industry" after advertising agency executives repeated several times during panels on Monday that there were too many magazines.
"First of all, there are too many agencies," Mr. Florio replied, as the audience laughed and applauded. "Four guys in a loft in SoHo, and it's an agency."
But there are fewer agencies than there were a year or two ago as the dot-com collapse and the soft economy take their toll on Madison Avenue as well as among magazine publishers. As a result, said John Wolfe, senior vice president at the agency association in New York, Agency magazine, introduced as a quarterly in spring 1990, will suspend publication after distribution this week of its fall 2001 issue.
"It's another casualty of the media recession," said Mr. Wolfe, who is also editor in chief of Agency, which has a circulation he estimated at about 40,000. "The fall issue is the last one, unfortunately, until the economy improves and we can resume publication."
The suspension is not the first for Agency, he added, which did not publish, also for economic reasons, from spring 1992 until spring 1994. Agency has been published for the agency association by Forbes Custom Communications Partners in Boston and New York, a division of Forbes Inc. that specializes in custom-published magazines.
The magazine conference, held at the Sheraton Hotel and Towers in Midtown Manhattan, concluded yesterday afternoon. It drew about 550 attendees, about 50 fewer than last year but more than had been expected given the declines in attendance at many conferences after Sept. 11.

PERSON: Rev. William Henry Kirk 

HEADLINE: William H. Kirk Dies at 92; Aided East Harlem Diversity 

BYLINE:  By WOLFGANG SAXON 

 BODY:
The Rev. William Henry Kirk, a prominent figure in the settlement-house movement and a community leader in East Harlem as it underwent a historic transformation, died last Friday in Branford, Conn. He was 92 and lived in Hamden, Conn., and on Isle au Haut, Me. 
 Mr. Kirk was executive director of Union Settlement, a number of sites providing a wide variety of services to its East Harlem neighbors, from 1949 until his retirement in 1971. 
 Under his leadership, the settlement pursued major projects to integrate the neighborhood both socially and economically, especially mixed-income housing projects. These included Metro North Housing and Franklin Plaza, a rental property he helped convert to a mixed-income, mixed-race co-op with adjoining stores, banks and other businesses.
Mr. Kirk's projects were of great interest to Jane Jacobs, the urban theorist, who frequently toured his neighborhood with him. His commitment to cohesion despite ethnic and economic frictions was an inspiration for her own advocacy of preserving neighborhoods diverse in both scale and population. 
"The basic idea," she wrote in the introduction to her classic, "The Death and Life of Great American Cities" (Random House, 1961), "to try to begin understanding the intricate social and economic order under the seeming disorder of cities, was not my idea at all, but that of William Kirk, head worker of Union Settlement in East Harlem, New York, who, by showing me East Harlem, showed me a way of seeing other neighborhoods, and downtowns too."
One of the oldest such agencies in the city, Union Settlement was started in 1895 by graduates of Union Theological Seminary. At the time, the district was peopled chiefly by Italian immigrants. Its first director, or headworker, as he was titled then, was the Rev. William E. McCord, a paragon of muscular Christianity and onetime chaplain of the Seventh Regiment.
The settlement grew into one of the city's largest, with 16 different locations that now serve 12,000 children, adults and the elderly each year. The programs include education, recreation, nutrition, addiction services and the arts, and Mr. Kirk played an important role in their proliferation.
During his tenure the East Harlem community grew, attracting African and Puerto Rican Americans as well as immigrants from Latin America and Africa. With the settlement as his base he helped pioneer strategies for mixed-income housing and the improvement of the blocks abutting the settlement sites, using private, federal and city money.
One of his proudest accomplishments was the settlement's College Readiness Program, which identified students with college potential and helped them with mentors and extra course work. Begun in the early 1960's, the program assisted more than 9,000 East Harlem youths in getting their degrees.
William Kirk was born in Newcastle, Pa., and graduated from Amherst College in 1931. He attended the Virginia Seminary and was ordained in St. Louis after graduating from Episcopal Theological School in Cambridge, Mass., in 1935.
He became rector of Grace Hill Church in St. Louis for a while, but then served as settlement director of Grace Hill House from 1937 to 1944. Five years later, he took that experience with him for his East Harlem assignment.
Mr. Kirk's first wife, Mary Michel Kirk, died in 1989 after 45 years of marriage. His second wife, Ruth Parker Kirk, died in July. He is survived by three daughters, Serena Kirk of Bangor, Me., and Susan K. Semple and Judy K. Fitzsimmons of Cambridge; a sister, Dr. Elizabeth K. Rose of Kennett Square, Pa.; nine grandchildren; and six great-grandchildren.

Hindsight's Soldier Is History's 'Best'

BYLINE:  By Richard Rothstein; E-mail: rrothstein@nytimes.com

 BODY:
AS the United States goes to war, more than a few Americans must be worrying about the performance of our troops. After all, it is widely believed that today's soldiers went to failing schools. Their literacy and numerical skills are regarded as poor. They have been passed from grade to grade without mastering the curriculum. Their drug and alcohol use has been undisciplined. Without a good background in history or literature, they can understand little of the cultural and political traditions they must fight to uphold.
 How can such youths meet the standards set by those who won World War II, we might ask? 
 Tom Brokaw in "The Greatest Generation" (1998) said that the warriors of 60 years ago displayed "towering achievement and modest demeanor." Their sacrifices enabled those who followed to prosper economically, politically and culturally. They were, Mr. Brokaw concluded, "the greatest generation any society has ever produced."
But older adults in the 1930's and early 1940's did not think so highly of the generation Mr. Brokaw praises. The conventional view then, as now, was that schools left graduates unprepared to defend the nation.
In 1940, Walter Lippmann wrote that during the previous half-century, educators had ceased teaching the "Western culture which produced the modern democratic state." In 1941, Robert Hutchins, president of the University of Chicago, worried that young people did not have the literary and historical background to participate in a democracy. Mortimer Adler, the philosopher, complained that schools no longer taught the values upon which American society relied. A resulting moral relativism, he said, rendered youth unable to muster the idealism to fight Hitler.
This view was typical. Michael A. Males, a sociologist at the University of California, has reviewed popular literature from the 1930's and found that teenagers who would later save the nation at war were not considered so great. A book about them published in 1936 was titled "The Lost Generation." It said that adolescents suffered from widespread mental illness. A Harper's Monthly article the same year concluded that young people behaved "without thought of social responsibility." A government antidrug agency reported that "dope peddlers infest our high schools."
Although in 1940 Mr. Lippmann thought that things once were better, in earlier years many commentators did not think so. In the 1920's, business leaders said students were not adequately prepared for the work force. In 1927, the National Association of Manufacturers charged that 40 percent of high school graduates could not do simple arithmetic or use English accurately.
Soldiers who fought in World War I were also, in their time, not thought to be particularly great. According to a 1921 report, the overwhelming majority of Army recruits had been taught to read in school but were unable to comprehend even simple written material.
And in the decades before World War I as well, popular magazines and serious scholars bemoaned the declining quality of the young.
This pattern of adult convictions does not compute. If every generation were so superior to the next, we could find a nation of demigods living not too far back in time. Yet although a golden age never existed, adults continually marshal statistics to confirm their disappointment in the young.
Paradoxically, the shrillness of adult dissatisfaction seems to grow in proportion to youths' educational attainment. Soldiers who will fight the war on terrorism not only have more schooling than any previous group but master more complex technologies than the artillery loaders of the past.
This situation would be funny except that the boy-who-cried-wolf fable has a serious moral. Perhaps young people today really are deficient. Perhaps teenagers in the 1930's were uniquely underrated, and those who fought World War II really were better -- in character, morals, and intellect -- than youths who will now fight terrorism. But if adolescents are always deemed inadequate, how can we know when the indictment is true and when we really need to address this crisis?
In 1944, James B. Conant, president of Harvard University, observed that almost all experts felt that America's secondary schools had failed and that students did not know as much mathematics or language as students of 50 years earlier had. But, Dr. Conant said, our citizens should also admit that the young people who were triumphing in Europe and the Pacific apparently had greater moral and intellectual strength than critics had anticipated.
When the war on terrorism draws to a close, will those who denounce today's youth have as much egg on their faces as the experts Dr. Conant described at the end of World War II? We should hope so.

Selig Denies Two Teams Will Fold

BYLINE:  By MURRAY CHASS

 BODY:
Commissioner Bud Selig had a conniption about contraction yesterday. The possibility that Major League Baseball will eliminate two teams for economic reasons has existed for the past year or so, but a Canadian newspaper reported that the decision had already been made and that the Montreal Expos and the Florida Marlins would be jettisoned after the World Series.
 Selig flatly denied the report. 
 "I've made no decisions yet," Selig said by telephone from Milwaukee. "I've been saying for a year it's a viable option. We have a lot of work to do. We have lot of questions we haven't answered yet." 
Another baseball official portrayed Selig as being angry about the report in The Windsor Star of Windsor, Ontario, and some baseball people took that reaction as confirmation that it was true. Selig acknowledged that he was upset about it but said that was because "it's misinformation."
"Contraction is a very complex process, even to consider it," he said. "There are all kinds of things to consider -- the players association, cities, stadiums, ownership. There are a myriad of factors. It's not a simple process."
The players association has maintained that the owners have to negotiate contraction and its effects. Donald Fehr, the union's executive director, said yesterday that he had heard nothing about plans to eliminate teams. "We have heard nothing from them suggesting this was a viable possibility within months," Fehr said. "All the schedules we have for next season are on the basis of 30 teams. If the story is accurate, if it's a front-burner item, we assume they will tell us."
The 2002 schedule involves all 30 teams. The union has not approved it because its executive board has to approve interleague play. Changes can be made in the schedule after it is approved as long as it remains in conformity with the basic labor agreement. A reduction to 28 teams would require significant changes to the schedule.
If Selig were planning to lop off two teams and had not had his aides discuss it with the union, the union would see that as an affront and it could have an impact on negotiations to replace the agreement that expires Nov. 7.
But the commissioner apparently has not discussed contraction with the clubs either. A high-ranking executive of one club said he had heard nothing. "Nobody has said anything to most teams," the executive said. "We've all heard the same conjecture, but there's not a shared pot of information on this."
The owners are scheduled to meet in Chicago on Nov. 6, two days after what could be the seventh game of the World Series. 
If the owners act then or subsequently to eliminate teams, they would pay the owners of those teams for their franchises. It has been speculated that the owners of the teams that would most likely be eliminated, Jeffrey Loria of the Expos and John Henry of the Marlins, would become owners of other teams.
The Walt Disney Company has wanted to sell the Anaheim Angels, and the Tampa Bay Devil Rays have been in trouble. Speculation is that Henry could take over the Angels and Loria the Devil Rays.
If teams are eliminated, their players would be distributed to other teams through a draft. If the Marlins and the Expos were eliminated, the National League would be left with 14 teams, the same number as the American League.
Owners have considered contraction as a way of eliminating teams that are weak financially. If they were eliminated, the wealthier teams would not have to share their revenue with them.

Ban the Bonds

BYLINE:  By PAUL KRUGMAN 

 BODY:
As bad ideas go, the proposal to create a new class of war bonds hardly seems worth mentioning. After all, it doesn't compare to the tax-cut package the House will probably pass today, which sets new standards for cynicism. So why pick on a proposal that, while generally acknowledged to be silly, also seems harmless? 
 Because it isn't really harmless. When the patriotic fervor abates a bit -- which it will; even the most justified war is inevitably followed by disillusionment -- the war-bonds proposal will probably be regarded as a prime example of post-Sept. 11 hypocrisy, of politicians' belief that as long as they vigorously wave the flag nobody will notice that they are busy catering to special interests. 
 A little background here. The original war bonds were, of course, introduced during World War II, when the nation was mobilized for total war. Everyone was called upon to sacrifice; not only were consumer goods rationed, but taxes were sharply increased. War bonds made sense in this context: they were a substitute for consumer spending, releasing resources for a war effort that absorbed almost 40 percent of G.D.P. 
Our current situation could hardly be more different. Even though the terrorist attack has made an increase in the defense budget inevitable, we're talking about a fraction of a percent of G.D.P. And because the economy is depressed, we want consumers to spend more, not less. So if war bonds are made available, they will be a substitute for . . . what? At best, they will offer the same return as ordinary government bonds, but carry different decorations. So people who buy war bonds will be doing no more for their country than people who choose postage stamps with a patriotic theme. 
At worst, war bonds will offer a lower return than ordinary bonds. And if some people buy them nonetheless, what will they be financing? 
Here's where that tax bill enters the picture. The remarkable thing about the "stimulus" package that passed the Ways and Means Committee on a straight party-line vote is that it barely even pretends to serve its ostensible function. It consists largely of permanent tax cuts, not the temporary cuts that you would expect in a stimulus package. It systematically gives money to those least likely to spend it -- that is, to high-income taxpayers, and above all to large corporations. 
Some of the provisions in the House bill are simply mind-boggling. For example, there is a large retroactive tax cut for corporations that would lead to immediate rebates of hundreds of millions of dollars to each of a select list of giant companies, many of them in the energy industry (though the $1.4 billion check to I.B.M. would top the list). 
On the other hand, there is almost nothing in the bill for people who might actually need more money. The extra unemployment benefits, in particular, are far less generous than those offered in the last recession, when the elder Bush was president. 
The bill, in short, looks as if it was written by corporate lobbyists -- and it probably was. Even Treasury Secretary Paul O'Neill was evidently embarrassed by the bill, dismissing its more outlandish components as "show business" designed to impress campaign donors.
But his remark was naive. Those lobbyists are serious men, who are paid by their employers to deliver results, not gestures; they wouldn't have put those provisions in unless they thought they had enough power to get them enacted. And sure enough, the White House soon contradicted Mr. O'Neill; the president, declared Ari Fleischer, was "very pleased" with the House bill. 
Which brings us back to those war bonds. The government not only isn't calling for shared sacrifice; it is "very pleased" with a proposal to give billions in handouts to corporations. And in that case, what is someone who buys a war bond really helping to finance? Put it this way: If the House has its way, the government will give far more in tax breaks to corporations over the next year than it will spend fighting terrorism. Yet somehow one suspects that people would not rush to buy "corporate tax-cut bonds." 
In an ideal world Congress and the White House would stand up to the special interests, and give us no reason to be cynical. Oh, never mind. But at least let's not add insult to injury. Ban those bonds.

 BODY:
 On the War Front

AGAINST THE TALIBAN -- United States warplanes struck Taliban soldiers on the front lines for a third day. Pentagon officials said for the first time that their goal was to choke off the group's supplies. A1

THE COMMAND STRUCTURE -- President Bush's war team is blending an approach used to run the gulf war with a more civilian-managed model used later in Kosovo. B1

TALIBAN'S TARGET -- Taliban forces stepped up attacks on a rebel-held village, firing on a public market. B2

AFGHAN DEFIANCE -- One weary Afghan refugee, a veteran of the struggle against Soviet forces, predicted a Taliban victory over America. He was echoing the thoughts of many poor Afghans, who are increasingly rallying to the Taliban cause. B4

The Diplomatic Effort

DEMANDS FROM PAKISTAN -- As continuing reports of civilian casualties came out of Afghanistan, Pakistan's leader again called for an early end to bombing. B3

UNITED NATIONS PLAN -- The special envoy to Afghanistan will consult with various Afghan factions on a plan to govern from Kabul. B4

The Anthrax Crisis

DELAYED FEDERAL RESPONSE -- Another postal worker fell ill with anthrax, and two more were confirmed dead from the inhaled form of it. Federal officials stepped up their public health response and acknowledged that they had seriously underestimated the danger to mail carriers and sorters. A1

FRANTICALLY CHANGED TACTICS -- The decision by health officials to treat thousands of postal workers with Cipro just days after warning against overprescribing the antibiotic was essentially an acknowledgment that they are struggling to contain a deliberately created anthrax crisis. A1

ANTHRAX IN THE CAPITAL -- Traces of anthrax spores showed up in a remote White House mail room, and officials announced that a growing number of such suspected "hot spots" would require more intensive treatment of workers at the capital's main mail-sorting area. A1

SENT HOME TO DIE -- When a Washington postal worker was rushed to the hospital after collapsing, he was told he had the flu and was sent home. He had worked through worsening symptoms of nausea and aches until his collapse, and he later became one of two employees killed by inhalation anthrax. B1

THE POSTAL WORKERS -- Hundreds of Washington postal workers lined up for anthrax testing, only to be given a 10-day supply of antibiotics and told that testing was being skipped in favor of immediate treatment. B6

DEADLY LETTERS -- The Justice Department released copies of three anthrax-contaminated letters, hoping they would serve as a warning for people to be wary of similar letters thought to be in circulation. B6

NEW JERSEY CASES -- As anthrax exposure increases among New Jersey postal workers, so have testing and complaints that officials have not acted quickly enough. B7

THE PRESIDENT -- George W. Bush assured reporters that he did not have anthrax, but did not say whether he had been tested. B8

Security and Treatments

AIRLINE SECURITY -- President Bush urged Congress to reach rapid agreement on some form of aviation security legislation. B5

BAYER'S CANADIAN DEAL -- The drug maker reached an agreement with Canada to provide a million tablets of Cipro within two days, heading off the country's plans to override the company's patent by buying generic versions of the drug. B8

TREATMENT ADVANCES -- Scientists are reporting breakthroughs in understanding how the anthrax bacterium attacks cells, raising hopes for rapid development of new treatments. B9

SMALLPOX VACCINE -- The administration said it was negotiating with seven companies to manufacture smallpox vaccine that could be used in case of a bioterrorist attack. B8

FOOD SAFETY -- The Bush administration, concerned that the nation's food supply could become the target of bioterrorism, is seeking money to increase the number of inspectors. B9

LAWMAKERS' HALTING RETURN -- Congress reconvened in an awkward fashion, using temporary offices and working in fits and starts. B9

Investigating Terrorism

THE INQUIRY'S SUBJECTS -- Ever since they were pulled off a train in Texas on Sept. 12 while carrying two box cutters, black hair dye and $5,600 in cash, two Indian men from Jersey City have been among the most intriguing witnesses detained in the federal terrorism investigation. B1

TAKEN IN -- A Muslim scholar unwittingly shared his San Diego home with two trade center attackers and then with a series of men who were later detained. And now, after a career spent teaching understanding of Islam, Dr. Abdussattar Shaikh says he feels betrayed and angry. B5

THE FUGITIVES -- The United States identified three fugitives thought to have been part of a terrorist cell in Hamburg that carried out the Sept. 11 attacks. B5

ARREST IN GERMANY -- A Turkish man was arrested at Frankfurt Airport as he was about to board a flight to Tehran with luggage that held a chemical protection suit, a ski mask and materials to produce a detonator. B5

Ripples From Sept. 11

GROUNDED IN KANSAS -- In Wichita, where four of the five biggest employers are airplane manufacturers, the terrorist attacks have proved to be an assault on the local economy. More than 7,000 of the city's 43,500 aircraft workers will be laid off in the next year. A10

THE HEROIN TRADE -- Although the price of Afghan heroin has dropped, police departments across Europe are not reporting much affect on street prices. B4

CRITICIZING THE POST -- The New York Post received complaints, and a cancellation, from advertisers after a cartoon portrayed the tabloid's main competitor as having mailed anthrax spores to the paper. B7

The Aftermath in New York

THE PHANTOM SKYLINE -- These days, capturing the New York skyline on canvas or on film has become a complicated, even emotionally wrenching act. The towers are such powerful symbols that they overshadow everything else -- whether they are present or absent. A1

HATE ATTACKS -- A freelance journalist born in Pakistan has been documenting recent accounts of bias against Arabs in America. Now he has found himself in the middle of his own story after being beaten and told he looked like Osama bin Laden. B10

ACCESS TO DOWNTOWN -- Public access to the area near the trade center site has been widened in an effort to ease traffic flow downtown. B10

AID TO MANHATTAN -- The Giuliani administration proposed using federal aid to give businesses a $5,000 cash bonus per employee as an incentive to set up shop in Lower Manhattan. Developers would get tax-free bonds to help build in the area destroyed by the terrorist attack. D1

FIRE DEPARTMENT STRIFE -- The Fire Department has been a family, sharing grief and regrouping after devastating losses. But even events strengthened those bonds, they did little to soften the bitter feelings that many have for Fire Commissioner Thomas Von Essen. D3

Business

THE INSURANCE TOLL -- United States regulators decided not to give special treatment to Lloyd's of London, which may have responsibility for up to a quarter of the $40 billion in losses from the trade center attack. C7

HEADLINE: A NATION CHALLENGED: THE REFUGEE; 
Again, Afghan's Flight Matches His History With His Country's

BYLINE:  By JANE PERLEZ 

DATELINE: QUETTA, Pakistan, Oct. 23 

 BODY:
Abdul Hadi pulled into the central bus station here today, sitting in the passenger seat of his hired Datsun pickup truck, four sons in the back under the tarpaulin and all his worldly possessions -- a blue wheelbarrow, a bicycle, 12 yellow jerry cans, bundles of clothes and two metal containers -- strapped to the roof. 
 He lightly embraced a cousin, then set down a piece of thin gray cloth on the concrete to pray, removing one canvas shoe and one black leather stump to do so. 
 Mr. Hadi, 53, who lost his left foot while fighting Soviet troops in Afghanistan in the 1980's and has a scarred right eye, finally decided that he had had enough of Afghanistan and closed the door on his house this morning for the ride from a village near Kandahar, the Taliban stronghold, to what he considers the safety of Pakistan. 
A peasant farmer, with a face the color of dark honey and a wild steel-wool beard, Mr. Hadi embodies much of Afghanistan's sad and violent recent history. He was at the prime of his fighting life when the Soviets invaded his nation in 1979, rolling first into his home city, Kandahar. Like most able-bodied Afghan men, Mr. Hadi immediately signed up with the resistance, joining the mujahedeen and fighting with them until the Soviets gave up and withdrew a decade later. 
In the 1990's, Mr. Hadi farmed in the flat land around Kandahar and raised five children as civil war raged among the competing warlords until the Taliban emerged as victors in 1996. 
With the Taliban now under attack from the United States, Mr. Hadi has little doubt about who will win. 
His weathered face creased into a smile: "When the Russians came to Afghanistan, they were defeated. The same thing will be repeated with the Americans." 
"I fought them for 14 years," he said of his battle against the Russians. "We beat them with rocket-propelled grenades and Kalashnikovs." The Soviet air power was irrelevant, he said. "The Americans will be defeated because the Special Forces cannot beat the Taliban. The Taliban are very strong." 
Mr. Hadi said he had heard through the village grapevine how three American helicopters with Special Forces had landed last week near the headquarters of the Taliban leader, Mullah Muhammad Omar. 
"They cannot do anything with the Taliban," he said. "They will shell from the sky, and the Taliban will be sitting in their caves." 
Despite this public bravado, Mr. Hadi expressed mixed emotions about whether he would volunteer to fight again. 
On his arrival at the bus station, he said that after assuring that his family was safe, he would return home to fight a jihad. "The Taliban are good people; they established Islamic law," he said with some fervor. 
This sentiment seemed to reflect some signs that the duration and the sharpness of the American bombing campaign was beginning to shore up support for the Taliban inside Afghanistan, where their popularity was clearly on the wane before Sept. 11. 
Repeated reports by the Taliban of American bombs' killing civilians appear to have intensified the feeling among Afghans that the United States has attacked Afghanistan, not just its rulers. The Taliban have found much of their support among simple, uneducated people like Mr. Hadi; unlike more educated Afghans here, he had nothing ill to say of them. 
But by tonight, after spending some hours with his extended family here, he said he would not be going back to Kandahar to make holy war, or to farm. 
He locked the door of his emptied house this morning, he explained, because he was worried about his wife and children. He could not work his land anymore. His animals had perished in the drought, and there was nothing to cultivate. He was, it seemed, at the end of his economic tether. 
Most of those fleeing southern Afghanistan into Pakistan since the start of the American bombing are operating on the same principle as Mr. Hadi: they are bunking with relatives and hoping to find work in a region already overloaded with two million Afghan refugees. 
Mr. Hadi is a Pashtun, and his tribesmen pride themselves on being superior warriors in a warrior society. The Pakistanis in Quetta are also Pashtuns. A favorite Pashtun tribal belief goes as follows: first a Pashtun, second a Muslim, a distant third either Afghan or Pakistani. 
Virtually every house in this town, from the few elegant villas to the poorest shanties, is filled with newly arrived Pashtuns from Afghanistan. They seem to fit in fairly seamlessly, but unemployment is high and public services are meager. 
Today's newcomer settled into a mud-and-straw, flat-roofed, two-room house he will share with relatives, who were welcoming and apparently pleased to have another senior male about. By nightfall, Mr. Hadi was being treated to a special dinner at the home of a neighbor. His wife and daughter, who had arrived a week ago, remained inside their new quarters and -- in the tradition of the Taliban -- off limits to foreigners. 
Mr. Hadi's choice of transportation today was actually a modified form of the Taliban war wagons -- Japanese pickup trucks with men stashed in the open back -- that were used in the fight among the warlords in the mid-1990's. 
This time, Mr. Hadi, with his sons on board and his women already safely ahead, seemed to have decided that despite vague glimmerings of joining another jihad, he might be riding the 130 miles from home to Quetta in a vehicle of peace.

HEADLINE: Gambling Expansion Is Part of Albany Budget Agreement 

BYLINE:  By JAMES C. McKINLEY Jr.

DATELINE: ALBANY, Oct. 23 

 BODY:
Gov. George E. Pataki has reached a budget agreement with legislative leaders that would allow the largest expansion of gambling in New York State since the lottery began in 1966.
 The agreement authorizes Mr. Pataki to negotiate compacts with American Indian tribes for three casinos in western New York and three in the Catskills. It also provides for New York to join a multistate lottery game, Powerball, and to install video gambling devices similar to slot machines in at least five horse-racing tracks. 
 The governor has promoted these gambling measures as new sources of revenue for the state at a time when the shrinking economy and the financial ripple effects of the terror attack in New York City have severely crimped state tax collections. 
But most of the money from new casinos and video gambling devices will not begin flowing right away. Three years from now, the new gambling venues are expected to produce about $1 billion in annual revenue for the state. That is not nearly enough to offset the $9 billion decline in tax revenues Mr. Pataki has predicted over the next year and a half, even after the $3 billion in cutbacks he has promised to make.
"It remains a fact that we need help from Washington to respond to the unprecedented attack on the World Trade Center," said Michael McKeon, Mr. Pataki's chief spokesman. The governor has asked Congress for $9 billion in compensation for lost revenue.
The gambling package is part of a final budget agreement that would add about $500 million in spending for social programs, education and tax incentives for business to the stripped-down budget the Legislature passed in August. Spending in the current fiscal year, ending next April, would grow about 5.8 percent, to about $84.5 billion, under the agreement, though the state's share would grow less.
The Assembly speaker, Sheldon Silver, and the Senate majority leader, Joseph L. Bruno, said late this evening that they were still ironing out some minor details in the agreement, but that both expected to finish drafting bills and to pass them Wednesday.
One unresolved issue is the size of a new economic development zone, called the Liberty Zone, to be established around the devastated area in Lower Manhattan. The state would provide about $10 million in tax credits as well as discounted electrical power to encourage businesses to remain or relocate there.
On the spending side, the agreement would devote about $200 million to nonprofit groups that the state pays every year to provide services like counselors for victims of AIDS and legal representation to the poor. Each house of the Legislature would get $100 million to give to nonprofit groups, and criteria would be written into the bill to ensure that the most critical needs are met. Many of these groups will face severe cutbacks, however, since they usually get $300 million to $500 million a year.
"We had said a long time ago some people would have to lower their expectations," said Senator Bruno, an upstate Republican.
Some advocates for the poor worried that the money might be misused for pork barrel programs dear to lawmakers. "It should go to front-line groups providing vital services," said Michael Kink of Housing Works, an advocacy group for people with AIDS. "There is a risk that it devolves into trout ponds at the sportsmen's club and Little Leagues."
The governor and Legislature have also agreed to add about $200 million in aid for education, with most of that going to finance training centers for teachers and to raise teachers' salaries in urban districts. Some extra money would also go to programs for bilingual children and children with learning disabilities.
The agreed-upon spending package also includes about $100 million in economic development measures to be controlled to a large degree by Governor Pataki. Those will include adding eight empire development zones, which are parks where new businesses receive tax breaks.
Since the gambling measures are not expected to produce much revenue this year, most of the $500 million in new spending would be financed through fiscal gimmicks or by moving money from other programs, the leaders said. The state will change a law in an attempt to keep $115 million in taxes it collected illegally, according to a judge, from a gas pipeline company. The state is also stretching out payments on its share of the cost of building new schools, a move that will save about $160 million in the short run.
But it is the expansion of gambling that will provide the most money in the long run. Under the agreement, video gambling devices would be installed at five racetracks: Aqueduct, Yonkers Raceway, Vernon Downs in Oneida County, Monticello in Sullivan County and Fingerlakes Racetrack southeast of Rochester. Local governments in Saratoga Springs, Batavia and Buffalo could vote to allow the machines at their tracks as well. Part of the earnings from the video gambling would go to increase purses for horse racing.
The machines will be considered part of the state lottery system, so the revenue will go to pay for state aid to schools and not to local governments. The tracks and businesses that operate the machines will also get a small cut.
The agreement also authorizes Governor Pataki to negotiate contracts with the Seneca Indian nation to operate casinos in Niagara Falls and Buffalo and on one of the tribe's reservations in western New York. In negotiations, the Assembly Democrats won the right of unions to organize the casino workers as well as a guarantee that a quarter of the state's share of the revenues will go to local governments.
Another three casinos would go in Sullivan and Ulster Counties to rejuvenate the faded Catskill resorts. At present, one tribe, the Mohawks, has made a proposal, with Park Place Entertainment, to put a casino in the former Kutsher's Country Club.
Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani of New York, speaking to reporters tonight after a town hall meeting in Staten Island, sharply criticized Mr. Silver for his support of the gambling legislation. 
"I don't understand the politics of this," the mayor said. He reiterated comments he has made for years: that any state authority for gambling casinos should include authorization for gambling in New York City to avoid draining revenues from the city to other locations. 
"At a time like this, I don't understand what is driving the speaker to support this," he said. He said he would appeal to Mr. Pataki to block the legislation, and added that he had made his opposition clear to Mr. Silver as recently as Monday.
The agreement to expand gambling drew strong condemnations from the Catholic Conference and the New York State Conservative Party, which argued that it amounted to a tax on compulsive gamblers, many of them poor.
"This is not something that you build the future on," said Mike Long, the chairman of the Conservative Party. "I know that a lot of legislators are using Sept. 11 as an excuse to forgo their principles and approve gambling. We got through the Depression and we got through the fiscal crisis without putting slot machines in again, and that can be done again. This is the easy way out."
But several lawmakers and their leaders said the state's desperate need for revenues in the wake of the attack outweighed whatever moral reservations they might have had.

Indictment in Towers Theft

BYLINE:  By JANE FRITSCH 

 BODY:
A Bronx man who the authorities say posed as a rescue worker at the site of the World Trade Center was indicted yesterday on charges that he stole at least six expensive watches and about $2,500 in cash from the Tourneau store below the complex.
 The man, Johnny Dunham, 26, an unemployed security guard, was also charged with stealing a New York Fire Department jacket from a damaged ambulance on Sept. 12. 
 Photographs of Mr. Dunham posing in the jacket and in police clothing near the wreckage were found in his apartment, investigators said.
Investigators are trying to determine whether the firefighter's jacket belonged to someone who died in the disaster. Mr. Dunham, dressed as an emergency worker, went to the disaster scene on Sept. 12, to "look for targets of opportunity," said Robert M. Morgenthau, the Manhattan district attorney. He called Mr. Dunham "a scavenger." At the site, Mr. Dunham ran into an acquaintance, Jacquelin Delgado, an unemployed emergency medical technician who lived in his neighborhood, prosecutors said. Back in the Bronx, Mr. Dunham gave Ms. Delgado one of the stolen watches, a $15,000 Cartier, according to prosecutors. She has been charged with possession of stolen property. 
Prosecutors said Mr. Dunham had been convicted twice before on misdemeanor charges related to impersonating officers.

HEADLINE: Metro Briefing Connecticut: Hartford: Special Legislative Session Set 

BYLINE:  NYT (Compiled by Anthony Ramirez)

 BODY:
 Gov. John G. Rowland said yesterday that a special session of the state legislature to try to close an estimated $300 million deficit in the state budget would begin Nov. 13 and end Nov. 16. The governor said the shortfall in the state's $13 billion budget was a result of lower tax revenues after the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks and an economic downturn nationwide. If the legislature can't agree on cuts before the end of the session, a spokesman for Governor Rowland said, the governor might have to make cuts under his executive power.

HEADLINE: Daimler Says Chrysler Lost Less Than Expected 

BYLINE:  By EDMUND L. ANDREWS 

DATELINE: FRANKFURT, Oct. 23 

 BODY:
DaimlerChrysler A.G. gave investors their first positive surprise in nearly two years today, reporting that third-quarter losses at the Chrysler group had been lower than expected and saying that it can still meet an overall profit goal set earlier this year.
 Chrysler's operating loss was $243 million, less than half what many analysts had predicted, though Chrysler's sales and its share of the market both declined. 
 The news helped push shares of DaimlerChrysler up 83 cents in New York, to $35.86, as the company provided evidence that its efforts to cut costs were beginning to bring results. 
Still, the latest report indicated that it was still too early to celebrate any turnaround. For one thing, the results included less than three weeks' worth of sales after the attacks on Sept. 11. Chrysler, like General Motors and Ford, began luring customers with zero-interest car loans after the attacks. The incentives, which compound the pricing battles that DaimlerChrysler had hoped to stop, are likely to dampen earnings this quarter.
Beyond that, Daimler is still struggling with plunging sales and big losses at Freightliner, its big American truck-making business. And Mitsubishi Motors of Japan, in which Daimler owns a 37.3 percent stake, also has declining sales.
Daimler executives emphasized the uncertain economic outlook, particularly in the United States. But they said the company could still meet the goal of a 2001 operating profit in the range of $1 billion to $1.5 billion. And at least for now, they said they were maintaining a goal in 2002 of an operating profit of $5 billion to $6 billion. "Sure, we are sticking to our target, but we are highly dependent on market developments," Manfred Gentz, DaimlerChrysler's chief financial officer, cautioned during a conference call with analysts.
The company's third-quarter operating profit, excluding one-time items, climbed to $606 million from $491 million a year earlier. Including the special items, Daimler said net income dropped 70 percent, to $821 million from $2.7 billion in the corresponding period of 2000. Most of the difference reflected gains last year from the sale of businesses in sectors like automotive electronics and aerospace.
Chrysler, which accounted for half of Daimler's profit just three years ago, ran up losses exceeding $1 billion in the first half of 2001 and is now in a $4 billion restructuring program overseen by its German president, Dieter Zetsche.
The number of Chrysler vehicles sold dropped 6 percent in the third quarter, and the company's market share has declined to 11.8 percent from nearly 15 percent a year ago. The declining market share reflects the inroads of Honda and Toyota in the minivan market that Chrysler once dominated.
Chrysler revenue of $13.3 billion was 4 percent lower than in last year's quarter.
As bad as that was, the Chrysler group's losses were smaller than many analysts had expected and smaller than those recently at G.M. and Ford.
DaimlerChrysler's other big problem is Freightliner, which has experienced a steep drop in truck sales in the United States. Freightliner's revenue fell 19 percent, and operating profit for Daimler's commercial vehicle division dropped 94 percent.
Other sections of the company fared better. Mercedes-Benz sales were up 9 percent, and its operating profit climbed 10 percent. Profit rose in Daimler's financial services business, as well.

HEADLINE: THE MARKETS: STOCKS & BONDS; 
Shares Close Moderately Lower, Reversing Early Gains

BYLINE:  By Reuters 

 BODY:
Stocks fell yesterday, as more reports of anthrax slammed a market already dealing with disappointing results and dim forecasts from companies ranging from SBC Communications to Pharmacia.
 Stocks erased early gains after health authorities said a New Jersey postal worker might have contracted anthrax, and anthrax was found in a mail delivery area for the White House. 
 Reports of anthrax are cropping up around the world, and the White House said it suspected the outbreak was linked to the Sept. 11 attacks on the United States. 
"There's a real lingering fear that as the anthrax issue widens it strikes not only at the physical well-being of people, but of the well-being of the economy," said Peter Coolidge, senior equity trader at Brean Murray & Company.
Worries about the war in Afghanistan also clouded the outlook for stocks, money managers said.
"There's a fear of an escalation in terrorist activity, or a military action that would potentially involve other states around the world," said Eric Wiegand, a portfolio manager for Credit Suisse Asset Management.
The Dow Jones industrial average fell 36.95 points, or 0.4 percent, to end at 9,340.08, while the broader Standard & Poor's 500-stock index dropped 5.12 points, or 0.5 percent, to 1,084.78. The technology-laden Nasdaq composite index fell for the first time in four sessions, declining 3.64 points, or 0.2 percent, to 1,704.44.
Stocks were higher over the last few sessions, as investors looked beyond the flood of quarterly earnings and bet that a rebound, while still months off, was on its way.
"We can't really point to these earnings and say fundamentals have improved," said Charles Payne, market analyst at Wall Street Strategies. "But the bar has been lowered enough that most companies have either come in line or actually beat estimates, and that's good news."
Quarterly results poured in from many companies. SBC weighed on the Dow average for the second day, racking up the biggest percentage loss among blue chips. It fell $2.62, to $38.78. after investment banks, including Goldman, Sachs, cut their ratings on its stock on fears revenue could fall further.
On Monday, SBC posted a 31 percent drop in earnings and said it would cut thousands of jobs because of the weak economy and stiff competition.
Pharmacia tumbled $4.37, to $38.39, after lowering its profit forecast for next year, which some analysts tied to slowing sales growth for its arthritis drug Celebrex.

HEADLINE: Where Planes Are Built, a Setback 

BYLINE:  By SAM HOWE VERHOVEK 

DATELINE: WICHITA, Kan., Oct. 23 

 BODY:
Cattle may once have been king in Wichita, but that was a long time ago. For years, airplanes have been the big thing.
 And here, where four of the five biggest employers in town are airplane manufacturers, where 70 percent of the country's general-aviation aircraft are built and where officials like to use the phrase "air capital of the world," the terrorist attacks on New York and the Pentagon have proved to be an assault on the local economy. 
 Roughly 7,200 of Wichita's 43,500 aircraft workers will be laid off over the next year, with the biggest impact so far at the Boeing Company's commercial aircraft division, where workers assemble parts for new jetliners and convert older passenger jets to freighters. 
When the first round of layoff notices went out a few days ago, informing 1,645 Boeing workers that they would lose their jobs effective Dec. 14, Sheryl Robertson, a sheet-metal mechanic, was on the list, leaving her to scramble for something to replace the $18-an-hour wage she enjoys now. 
"It'll be a lot less than what you can make at Boeing, but then just about everything else around here is," said Mrs. Robertson, 47.
She said she was likely to go back to school to get her certificate as a medical assistant, a job that pays about $9 an hour. 
Even before the Sept. 11 attacks, Wichita was braced for recession, as projected sales for airliners, corporate jets and smaller personal aircraft slowed. But with the plunge in air travel after the terrorist attacks, the airlines' financial turmoil slashed those projections even more. 
That prompted Wichita's mayor, Bob Knight, to convene an emergency conference to deal with layoffs at the airplane companies that will wipe away jobs that collectively pay $350 million a year here. A job fair and ways to speed production were among the ideas discussed.
"There have been incredible resources committed to New York City -- all of our hearts were absolutely broken by what happened to that great city," Mayor Knight said at the second meeting of the conference, on Friday. "But I would ask at this point for us to seriously consider how we are going to take care of our own." 
Counting their strong benefits, the jobs at Boeing and at other airplane companies here -- Cessna, Raytheon and Bombardier Aerospace/Learjet -- are generally the highest paying manufacturing jobs in the area, averaging about $50,000 a year, and growth at all four companies had helped fuel a boom in Wichita in recent years, said Janet Harrah, director of the Center for Economic Development and Business Research at Wichita State University. 
In the 1990's, the growth of service and construction jobs far outstripped the rate in aircraft manufacturing here. Services, including health care, grew by 30 percent, construction by nearly 54 percent, compared with an 11 percent rise in air industry jobs. But the aircraft jobs still amount to about 16 percent of overall employment in the area and, because they pay so relatively well, contribute 25 percent of employment earnings. 
Although total aircraft job losses are higher around Seattle, where Boeing has its commercial aircraft division and where most of the division's cuts of 20,000 to 30,000 jobs will take place, the overall impact is harsher here because Wichita's economy is so reliant on aircraft jobs. (Over all, there are 17,300 Boeing workers here.) 
It is hard to see the immediate effect, since workers here are entitled to 60 days' notice before layoffs and thus are continuing to earn their salaries. The first wave of layoffs will come in December. 
For now, some restaurants and local retail businesses, even as they noticed a sudden drop in sales the week after Sept. 11, say things seem to be back to nearly normal for the moment, although in some cases only because they have been offering deals to lure customers in the door. 
It is hard to know what the layoffs and other impacts of Sept. 11 will do to the unemployment level, which stood at 3.5 percent before the attacks, said Ms. Harrah of Wichita State. If many people take lower-paying jobs, that would not immediately alter the rate but would still have a serious impact on the economy. The aircraft job cuts themselves are the largest since the recession of the early 1980's, she said. 
"Manufacturing is very cyclical, and it's part of the deal that you're going to have some downturns," Ms. Harrah said. 
Many workers here seemed to accept that explanation, saying that cuts in jobs that involve making airplanes were to be expected if fewer people were going to be flying. But others were skeptical. 
"To me, I think Boeing is taking advantage of a tragedy," said Gina Marks, 25, a single mother and material processor who will lose her $16.34-an-hour job on Dec. 14. 
"It doesn't need to be this widespread," Ms. Marks said, then added, referring to Boeing's move last month of its corporate headquarters from Seattle, "Here they just built this office in Chicago -- it must have cost millions and millions of dollars to do that." 
Ms. Marks has been sending out resumes but believes she will be "lucky" to get a job paying anything from $9 to $12 an hour, probably in the clerical field. She continues going to cosmetology school at night and still hopes to pursue her dream of moving to Dallas and opening her own salon, but she acknowledges that the loss of her Boeing job will defer the dream. 
Others expressed optimism that the layoffs would be brief. 
"I think they're anticipating things that aren't going to happen," David Poage, 41, a modification inspector, said of Boeing's move.
Mr. Poage does not face a layoff, but he will be reclassified into a job that pays less. 
"A lot of people are going to take some long car trips at Thanksgiving, and they're not going to like it so much," Mr. Poage explained.
"People will figure out again that flying is real safe, and that it's a better way to go," he said. "So by Christmas, people will be back to flying. And then we'll be back to building airplanes."

HEADLINE: THE MARKETS: Market Place; 
BoomingCar Sales, but at a Price

BYLINE:  By DANNY HAKIM 

DATELINE: DETROIT, Oct. 23 

 BODY:
Corporate earnings are plummeting, unemployment is rising, consumer confidence is shaky, the country is at a war footing at home and abroad. Yet auto sales have rarely been better.
 Come again? 
 A forecast from General Motors predicts October will be the second-biggest month ever for overall auto sales in the United States, and many analysts have offered similar outlooks. But if the industry is on pace for one of its best sales months, the question is how it happened and how much it will all cost, not only in financial losses now but also in lost sales down the road.
In reality, the Big Three's interest-free financing plans, offered to revive sales after the Sept. 11 attacks, have evolved into a price war that is great news for car buyers and car dealers but increasingly costly for the automakers footing the bill. Some critics and environmental groups have also criticized domestic automakers for wrapping up their new discounts in patriotic ad campaigns at a time when the nation's dependence on the Middle East's oil is the subject of renewed debate. 
But for car sellers -- like those sales reps and dealers who make their living along a long stretch of showrooms and lots on Central Avenue in Toledo, Ohio -- there have been few better months than October.
"Zero percent is just bringing lots of people in, creating lots of interest," George Ballas, founder of George Ballas Buick GMC, said in an interview this week at his dealership. There is a yard-high "0% A.P.R." banner in the showroom's window and American flags fluttering from car hoods on the lot. On a typical month, Mr. Ballas, who has been a G.M. dealer for more than three decades, said he might sell 125 new G.M. cars and trucks. Last month, sales were just short of 100. This month, he thinks he can sell 150 new vehicles.
Down the road, Ross Yuse, who has been a salesman for 15 years at Jim White Toyota, extended his arm outward and tallied the white, red and green cars before him. Toyota Motor has also offered zero-interest financing on some of its vehicles.
"We're out of cars," he said. "We have four Corolla's and four Camry's. We usually like to carry 60 Camry's and 20 Corolla's."
But Mike Knierim, a previous Corolla owner, did not let that stand in the way. He was set on buying another Toyota. "You can't go wrong with zero percent interest," he said. "Chevy, Ford or Toyota -- it's a deal."
G.M. led the wave of zero percent offers, which were ignited in part by the visit of Commerce Secretary Donald L. Evans and Labor Secretary Elaine L. Chao to Detroit shortly after the attacks. The Bush administration's focus was on restarting economic activity and it urged the industry to do what it could.
Shortly after the meeting, G.M. introduced its Keep America Rolling interest-free financing with a splashy ad campaign. The subtext was clear: Do your part to fight terrorism by buying American vehicles.
But when G.M. moved recently to extend its program past the end of the month and through at least Nov. 18, it was a bid to sustain its recent glimmer of momentum in recapturing market share. The news, however, was not well received by Ford Motor or Chrysler, whose financial positions appear to many analysts to be worse than that of General Motors. Chrysler is a unit of DaimlerChrysler.
G.M. sees the discounts, coupled with a fresh lineup of sport utility vehicles and pickup trucks, as a chance to stem years of market share declines. The company needs to maintain its scale, if for no other reason than to keep up with its enormous legacy costs -- G.M. has about 2.5 retirees per worker whose benefits and pensions it must continue to support. On the other hand, such incentives only increase its red ink. Last week, the company reported a net loss of $368 million for the third quarter.
Still, G.M. is gaining a small amount of market share while Ford and Chrysler, which matched G.M.'s zero percent financing offers, continue to lose ground and money. Top executives of both companies have expressed concern recently that the offers are pulling sales from the future and hurting profits now.
"While programs like this make the equation work for our customers, it is unsustainable for us in the longer term," Jacques Nasser, chief executive of Ford, wrote in a memo to employees last Friday. "Even without zero percent financing, our marketing costs are still far too high."
Martin Inglis, Ford's chief financial officer, said last week that incentives had risen from 11 percent of the company's revenue last year to 16 percent this year. Each percentage point increase, he said, deducts about $1 billion from the company's pretax profits. 
In recent forecasts, G.M. predicted October's seasonally adjusted annual sales rate would come in above 19 million. That would rank it right behind the record 21.2 million sales pace the industry achieved in September 1986, according to Ward's AutoInfoBank, a data service in Southfield, Mich. John Casesa, an analyst at Merrill Lynch, projects a rate of 20.2 million vehicles.
But then what? Ending a sale is harder than starting one. When G.M. gave its October forecast, it also lowered its forecast for total 2002 sales of 15 million to 15.5 million units, which would be considered a mediocre year. Mr. Casesa sees 2002 sales dropping to an even worse rate of 14.6 million vehicles.
The falloff, Mr. Casesa said, is "going to lead to very cautious production schedules in the first quarter."
"These companies," he added, "are going to go from working on overtime to working half-shifts."
"That will cause a retrenching in their businesses," he said, "and that will ripple through the supply chain." 
From some perspectives, increasing sales to near record levels at a time of turmoil is distasteful, especially when the Big Three are increasingly dependent on sport utility vehicles and trucks. Take a recent cartoon in the New Republic magazine, which depicted a man putting an "End our dependence on Arab oil!" bumper sticker on a smoke-belching vehicle so enormous his head reached only the top of the wheel.
"Detroit is treating this tragedy as a chance to pad their profits by pushing gas guzzlers," said Daniel F. Becker, director of the global warming and energy program for the Sierra Club. "Real patriotism means showing responsibility by decreasing our oil dependency by producing more fuel-efficient cars." 
For the Big Three, padding profits is not the issue. Stemming losses is.
And holding off the resurgent foreign automakers. "All three of the Big Three are between a rock and a hard place," said Stephen J. Girsky, an auto analyst at Morgan Stanley. "The competition is not each other, but the competition is the outside parties."
A recent Morgan Stanley report pointed to Ford and G.M.'s huge financing operations as areas of concern, for several reasons. First, the residual value of leased vehicles continues to decline as sales of new cars, and leases, increase. That influx of sales reduces the value of vehicles coming off leases that are reclaimed by Ford and G.M. 
Second, recent downgrades of the credit of Ford and G.M. make their loans to customers more expensive. Ford and G.M. raise money to make those loans with big bond offerings and their borrowing rates, while still quite low, will become less attractive for the companies at a time when they are charging customers less, and in many cases, nothing, for loans. Third, the worsening economy has caused the rate of customers' defaulting on auto loans to increase. 
For dealers and buyers, this is not their problem. At least not yet. 
"It's absolutely spectacular," said Michael Maroone, president of AutoNation, which operates dealerships in 17 states, referring to the zero percent deals. 
"It's an absolute windfall for the dealers," he said. "The business climate right now is fantastic."
For some Americans shopping for a new car, there is little doubt that heart-felt patriotism is one of the main reasons they are buying now.
"I had one little old gal tell me that was the only reason she was buying a car," said Jim Nimphie, a vice president of George Ballas Buick GMC.
But Mr. Ballas believes the improving sales have less to do with patriotism and more to do with low prices and free money. With the new offers, he said, "you could save roughly $4,500 on a $20,000 car."

For some automakers, October is shaping up to be one of the biggest months ever for sales. Makers offering zero percent financing have done especially well -- at least in the short term. (Bloomberg News) Chart: "Back to the Showrooms"Spurred by interest-free financing plans from Detroit's Big Three, total vehicle sales this month are expected to top an annual pace of 19 million, second only to the record 21.2 million sales pace set in August 1986. In recent years, Americans have shifted to buying many more trucks and sport utility vehicles, where Detroit is strong, helping to keep down the market share of imports.

SPIEGEL POSTS 3RD-QUARTER LOSS AND CUTS OUTLOOK

BYLINE:  Reuters 

 BODY:
 The Spiegel Group, the catalog retailer, posted a third-quarter loss yesterday and cut its fourth-quarter expectations almost in half. The company, which is based in Downers Grove, Ill., and owns the Eddie Bauer retail apparel chain, said it expected weak consumer spending and economic uncertainty to damp its overall results. 
Spiegel said it now expected fourth-quarter revenue to fall 5 percent to 10 percent. Spiegel's loss for the third quarter ended Sept. 29 was $12.3 million, or 9 cents a share. In the year-earlier quarter, Spiegel posted a profit of $13.5 million, or 10 cents a share. Sales for the period fell to $703.8 million from $807.5 million a year earlier. Spiegel's stock fell 69 cents, to $6.30 a share.

HEADLINE: Maker of Small Jets Sees a Silver Lining 

BYLINE:  By JENNIFER L. RICH 

DATELINE: SAO PAULO, Brazil, Oct. 23 

 BODY:
When the first of the sleek new 70-passenger ERJ-170 jets from Embraer rolls out of the factory next Monday, it will fly off into a world vastly different from the boom times in which it was conceived two years ago.
 Global air travel has fallen by nearly one-third. Airlines are scrapping flights, pruning routes and laying off workers by the tens of thousands; some have collapsed entirely. 
 Embraer, formally known as Empresa Brasileira de Aeronautica, knows that it, too, will have to hunker down for a year or two to weather the aviation downturn. But the company's hopes for the ERJ-170 and its regional-jet siblings are undimmed because Embraer expects the current crisis to propel the market to its door even faster than before. 
"Our fleet is flying at an average occupancy of more than 50 percent, while traffic on the big airlines is substantially below that," Mauricio Botelho, the president of Embraer, said in an interview. "Many of the big airlines like Continental and United are already announcing that they are substituting narrow-body aircraft with regional jets."
Mr. Botelho's optimism is shared by a number of analysts, who say that as the major airlines streamline their operations and cut costs, they will move to retire most of their older narrow-body aircraft with 120 to 150 seats -- planes like 737's.
The routes that those planes now fly will be served instead by the big airlines' regional partners, like Continental Express and America West Airlines, which operate the smaller jets made by Embraer and its main rival, Bombardier of Canada.
Because they can be handled by smaller air crews and ground staffs, the regional jets are much cheaper to operate. They are also considered more aptly sized for commuter routes: big enough to accommodate business passengers, but not so big that fickle, fare-conscious tourists are needed to fill seats. 
Jim Parker, a managing director at Raymond James & Associates, said the regional jets could be a good idea for airlines. "By switching to regional jets," he said, "they can hand off most of the unprofitable leisure travelers to the low-fare airlines." 
But even if the long-term tide is running Embraer's way, right now airlines are putting off dates to take delivery, and production is expected to slow considerably at Embraer's factory in the interior of Sao Paulo state. Early this month, the company said it would deliver 25 fewer planes than expected this year, and perhaps only 135 jets next year, down from an earlier target of 205. The slowdown may reduce 2001 revenue by $700 million and 2002 revenue by $1.2 billion.
About $1 billion worth of tentative orders, known as options, have been called off since Sept. 11, the company said on Monday. Still, Mr. Botelho said that none of Embraer's 543 firm orders had been canceled outright. 
Analysts treat that assertion with some care. "There could be some marketing behind pledges that the airlines are going to honor their orders," said Roberto Reis, an aviation analyst at Sudemeris Corretora, a Brazilian brokerage firm. "Airlines need to give the impression that they are continuing to invest so that passengers will feel comfortable buying tickets."
Another issue is the willingness of lenders to finance jet purchases in the current crisis environment. Airlines usually put up 20 percent of the cost of a new jet and finance the rest. Among Embraer's biggest customers, two -- American Eagle and Continental Express -- may benefit from the loan guarantees included in the United States government's airline bailout.
But government aid can cut two ways: Embraer has complained bitterly that Canada has violated global trade rules by offering subsidized financing for airliners to buy Bombardier's regional jets, and it won a favorable ruling from a World Trade Organization panel last week in a case involving a big order by Air Wisconsin.
And it is unclear how the Swiss government's restructuring of Swissair and its former regional subsidiary, Crossair, will affect Embraer. Crossair is one of only a handful of airlines to order the ERJ-170 and the new 108-seat ERJ 190-200, scheduled to be ready in 2004.

HEADLINE: City Proposes Priority Uses Of Federal Aid 

BYLINE:  By JENNIFER STEINHAUER

 BODY:
The Giuliani administration has set two priorities for the aid it is seeking from the federal government to encourage the redevelopment of Lower Manhattan, concentrating on a small portion of the $54 billion that the state had requested.
 Under the city's proposal, businesses that agree to return to or set up shop in Lower Manhattan would receive a $5,000 cash bonus for each employee, and developers would have access to tax-free bonds to help erect buildings in the area destroyed by the terrorist attack last month. The city estimates that the cost of reconstructing downtown at between $8 billion and $15 billion. 
 Earlier this month, Gov. George E. Pataki and Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani announced that the state would ask the federal government for a huge package of incentives, tax breaks and other direct federal subsidies to rebuild New York. Federal officials were polite but cool, and some complained that elements of the plan, like billions of dollars for reimbursements for lost tax revenues and money to build a high-speed train from Manhattan to upstate New York were a bit out of line with normal disaster aid. 
The White House budget chief has rejected supporting any more new aid this year, aside from the $20 billion in emergency relief provided for New York, Virginia and Pennsylvania. 
Senators Hillary Clinton and Charles E. Schumer have been trying to cobble together a more modest proposal, drawing from plans offered by business leaders and New York officials that they believe would have an easier time making it through Congress now that the country's wartime bills are growing, too. 
City officials say they while they do not begrudge the state any of its wish list, they would be happy with a plan that costs the federal government more in lost -- and ultimately unanticipated -- revenue than in pure cash outlays. "The city has a lot of needs," said one official, "but in Lower Manhattan we are looking at specific elements to encourage employers to come in and to encourage developers to build new buildings. The goal is to keep lower Manhattan as the financial hub." Last week, the city's budget director, Adam Barsky, and Deputy Mayor Robert Harding paid calls to legislative leaders in Washington and to officials in the Bush administration to press their case.
The city proposes offering businesses $5,000 per employee the first year, and would decrease that incentive to $2,500 per worker for each of the next two years. The cash benefit could be applied to the company's federal tax bill, or taken as a lump sum. The city offers a modest version of this plan involving city taxes for businesses opening in some neighborhoods outside Manhattan.
The program for returning businesses to lower Manhattan would be capped at $750 million, or the estimated amount needed to repopulate what some calculate is the 25 million square feet of space lost to the attack. The cap is designed to signal to the federal government that the city is not trying to tuck general economic development into the package. 
Other refinements under consideration by Mr. Schumer and Mrs. Clinton include tax credits for businesses and tax-exempt financing for reconstruction projects, according to people familiar with the plan. Their plan would likely lengthen the time period of the cash credit for employees and might not contain a cap. 
However, city officials hinted that since it was unlikely that two huge towers would be built in the World Trade Center's space and that smaller buildings might go there instead, businesses that chose to set up shop in other boroughs might be accommodated by this plan if lower Manhattan became overpopulated.
For some developers, who are loath to build in Manhattan because of high costs and bureaucratic hurdles, the city would like to offer access to tax-exempt bonds that would significantly reduce their costs of building. The city envisions developers going to its Industrial Development Authority to secure bonds on which purchasers would not be obligated to pay city, state or federal taxes, in turn lowering the interest rate for the developers. 
City officials argue that the benefit is attractive because although it would represent a loss of about $13 billion in tax revenues for the federal government, it would not require a cash payout to the city. Tax on bond interest was not anticipated revenue anyway, since there were no plans before Sept. 11 to do major rebuilding in lower Manhattan.
Outside of rebuilding and repopulating the area, known as the Liberty Zone, the city would also like to have a federal insurance pool created for businesses that cannot afford insurance, and pay for the rebuilding of a destroyed power substation, subway station and telephone switching station at a cost of roughly $2 billion.

HEADLINE: Lawmakers' Votes on Economic Legislation Will Test Talk of Bipartisanship 

BYLINE:  By RICHARD W. STEVENSON 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Oct. 23 

 BODY:
For all their recent pledges of bipartisanship, Republicans and Democrats are headed for an ideological showdown over how best to revive the economy.
 Republicans are pushing for tax cuts for corporations. Democrats are seeking to put money in the hands of low- and middle-income people and workers who have lost jobs. Both sides have reached the point where it has become all but impossible to paper over the depth of their differences. 
 The House was scheduled to take up a Republican economic stimulus plan on Wednesday that would cut taxes this year by nearly $100 billion, with more than $70 billion going to companies. It is expected to pass despite strong objections from Democrats.
In the Senate, Democrats seem to be reaching the limits of their willingness to negotiate a bipartisan compromise. The chairman of the Finance Committee, Senator Max Baucus, Democrat of Montana, today unveiled a $70 billion stimulus plan that would include $33 billion for expanded unemployment and health-insurance benefits, $14 billion of tax rebates for low- and moderate-income people and a $20 billion menu of temporary tax cuts for business.
Treasury Secretary Paul H. O'Neill said tonight he was disappointed with Mr. Baucus's plan.
The Senate is also likely to consider proposals for billions of dollars in new spending on highways and mass transit to create jobs, a traditional Democratic response to economic downturns.
Republicans say helping companies via tax cuts will avert layoffs, bolster stock prices and encourage investment. Democrats say providing money to individuals will not only help the people who need it most but will also stimulate demand for goods and services.
The most hotly debated of the Republicans' specific proposals would repeal the corporate alternative minimum tax, which was created to insure that companies did not avoid income taxes altogether through deductions.
By decreasing the taxes of many companies at a time when earnings are plummeting, Republicans said, the proposal would reduce the pressure on employers to eliminate jobs. Republicans said it would also give Wall Street confidence that corporations could weather the downturn without too much financial damage and provide companies with more cash to buy equipment and supplies.
The House bill would make the repeal of the tax retroactive to 1986. Companies would get refunds this year equal to the difference between what they paid under the alternative tax since 1986 and the lesser amount they would have paid under the regular corporate income tax.
The combination of the repeal and the refund of past payments would total $25.4 billion this year.
Citizens for Tax Justice, a liberal research organization, said more than one-fifth of the benefits would go to just 12 corporations. They include International Business Machines, which the group said would receive a $1.4 billion rebate; General Motors, which would get $833 million; and General Electric, which would get $671 million.
Most Democrats argue that the centerpiece of any stimulus plan should be an expansion of unemployment insurance to cover laid-off workers who otherwise would not be eligible for such benefits. They want to include benefits for many part-time workers and for those who had not worked long enough to qualify under current law.
Democrats are also pressing for more money for a program that helps unemployed people keep their health insurance.
The rationale for focusing the stimulus package on the unemployed is that people who have lost jobs will immediately spend all the benefit payments they receive, helping the economy.
The two parties are also battling over a Republican proposal to accelerate a portion of the income tax-rate reductions enacted in June. The bill the House plans to vote on this week would immediately cut the current 27 percent rate to 25 percent. That rate applies to taxable income starting at $27,000 for individuals and $45,000 for couples.
Republicans say permanent cuts in income tax rates encourage more spending by consumers. Democrats said the provision would benefit only the top 25 percent of earners, who they said would not be likely to spend the money immediately.
Many Republicans are also calling for a reduction in the capital gains tax on profits from the sale of stocks, bonds and other assets. 
Democrats are pressing for big public works projects, like building highways, as a means to create jobs. Economists said increased government spending could have a substantial effect on the economy. But they said it often takes months or even years for government spending programs to begin, delaying the economic effects until after any downturn is over.
While the parties remain at odds over these core issues, there are some areas of agreement.
There is a broad consensus on the need to provide businesses with tax incentives to invest more money in new factories and equipment.
The House bill would try to address the problem by allowing companies to write off 30 percent of the cost of capital investments immediately. That provision, which would remain in place for three years, would amount to a tax break estimated for companies this year at $39.3 billion.
In the Senate, Mr. Baucus's plan would allow companies to write off 10 percent of their capital investments, but would limit the tax break to a single year. His approach would save companies $14 billion.
Advocates of the provision say it would encourage companies to buy new computers and telecommunications equipment, build new factories and invest in cost-saving machinery and software.
Some economists, though, said tax breaks for capital investments would have limited effect as long as corporations continued to have more production capacity than they needed.
The two parties also appear to have reached a general agreement on providing a one-time tax rebate to low- and moderate-income workers. Both the House bill and Mr. Baucus's plan would make the payments -- $300 for individuals and $600 for couples -- to workers who did not qualify for the first round of tax rebates sent out this summer because they did not make enough money to pay federal income taxes.
Both parties had been hoping to put the proposed rebate checks in the hands of consumers by the Christmas shopping season. But the Internal Revenue Service said today that it probably would be unable to get the checks out before Jan. 1.

HEADLINE: Giving Hip-Hop A Cultural Beat; 
Rappers Visiting From Cuba Find a Welcoming Audience

BYLINE:  By MIREYA NAVARRO

 BODY:
They are social chroniclers of a different daily life, one of food quotas that do not last until the end of the month and of women who fall for the capitalist wiles of foreign men.
 They talk about the artist's responsibility to value message over money. And at a recent panel discussion at the Caribbean Cultural Center in Manhattan, they seemed taken aback when somebody asked if there was a gangster element to their music. 
 "In Cuba, people don't have pistols," said Yosmel Sarrias, 27, speaking in Spanish through a translator. "There are problems in Cuba, but we don't have gangsters." 
They rap in Spanish and come from a socialist world, but the first Cuban hip-hop delegation visiting the United States has found an appreciative audience in New York City, where hip-hop was born. The seven artists and two Cuban hip-hop organizers are on a monthlong cultural exchange that has taken them to schools and community organizations to talk about hip-hop in their homeland.
To young New Yorkers like Danny Rivera, 17, dissatisfied with the rap fare on radio and MTV, the visiting Cubans seem closer to American hip-hop in its early political phase -- critical and socially conscious, as opposed to materialistic and self-absorbed -- than today's American hip-hop stars.
"I don't believe Eminem and Jay-Z are hip-hop," said Mr. Rivera, a break dancer who met the Cuban artists last week during a workshop at El Puente Academy for Peace and Justice, an alternative public school in the Williamsburg section of Brooklyn. "They think about the revolution while Jay-Z is thinking about girls, girls, girls."
This is the first time that Cuba has sent hip-hop artists as official cultural ambassadors (exchanges between Cuba and the United States are allowed under the American economic embargo). After initially rejecting the idea as an American export, the Cuban artists said, the government has increasingly embraced and funded hip-hop as an authentic voice of contemporary Cuban youth.
The visit by three rap groups -- "Anonimo Consejo" (Anonymous Advice), "RCA" (for Crazy Rappers of Alamar) and "Obsesion" -- was arranged by International Hip-Hop Exchange, a group of community organizers, journalists and artists. The group includes Danny Hoch, an actor and executive producer of the New York Hip-Hop Theater Festival, who has taken American hip-hop artists to Cuba in recent years. Mr. Hoch is a fellow at the Vera List Center for Arts and Politics at the New School for Social Research, which is sponsoring the exchange with the Caribbean Cultural Center.
Mr. Hoch said his hope is to steer young Americans back to hip-hop's earlier social awareness, which he said exists today in a growing minority marginalized by the major labels or by the news media. Nowadays, he said, most successful rap in this country is party music devoid of thought-provoking lyrics.
"One of our goals is to have more cultural exchanges so that hip-hop can strengthen itself as a global movement more than just pop culture," Mr. Hoch said.
As in the United States, hip-hop in Cuba is an urban, mostly black movement that in Cuba caught on in the 1980's and was redefined in the 1990's. But despite problems in gaining mainstream acceptance, the delegation said it now counts on more than 400 rap groups, an annual festival in its seventh year and a homegrown version of the form that often lays words over Afro-Cuban rhythms.
But while the hip-hop that sprang up from poor black and Hispanic neighborhoods in the Bronx in the 1970's became an expression of political resistance, the visiting Cuban rappers are critical of society and its individuals, (exposing police harassment of blacks, prostitution and other issues). They do not, though, openly question the government of Fidel Castro.
"Cuba is a country with 42 years of revolution and all the young people were born under the influence of socialism," said Pablo Herrera, a hip-hop music organizer who is traveling with the delegation and also produced "Cuban Hip-Hop All Stars Volume 1," a compilation of Cuban rap released this year by the New York label Papaya Records.
"Our badge has been positive, conscious rap," he said. "In Havana now, if the rapper doesn't talk about something to improve something, the public doesn't respond to it."
But such lofty portrayals have drawn skepticism at some of the group's appearances around the city. At the panel discussion at the Caribbean Cultural Center last Thursday, the Cubans were asked whether they were representative of most rap groups in the island. Do all of them place art above money? 
In fact, Americans knowledgeable about Cuban hip-hop said, every American style is imitated in Cuba, including gangsta rap that talks about guns, drugs and violence, although it may not be the most popular.
"Everybody wants money," said Juan Rodriguez, 20, who studies hip-hop beats at The Door, a Manhattan youth center, and who attended the panel discussion at the Caribbean Cultural Center.
But Yako Prodis, 20, a hip-hop music producer and assistant teacher at The Door, said the Cubans have an advantage in not having a music industry to contend with. The visitors said there is no recording industry to speak of in Cuba -- people hear most performers live -- and only a handful of rap groups have made compact discs.
"Art here is a reflection of what the record labels want," Mr. Prodis said. "That's why you see these negative stereotypes of mostly minorities in hip-hop."
The Cubans, who are staying through November, said they were also concerned about the state of American hip-hop. "Rap has come a long way in Cuba because we've all established goals and worked together," said Magia Lopez, 29, who, with her husband, Alexey Rodriguez, 28, forms "Obsesion."
Around New York, however, the Cubans have often been indistinguishable from the Americans in attire, attitude and bob of the head. At the Nuyoricans Poets Cafe in Manhattan on Saturday night, where the Cubans alternated with local groups on stage, they met performers like Benny Blanco, 26, who rapped about the "hate in your blood" and the military might of the United States in its war against terrorism.
The audience hollered and waved arms in rhythm when the Cubans' turn came, getting their energy and cadence, if not always the deep meaning of their words. Anonimo Consejo, for instance, rapped about "los desaparecidos," the disappeared people all over the world, including those Cubans who take to the sea because of their dire economic condition and end up drowning. 
"I don't know Spanish, I don't understand it," an M.C. who called himself Gaston said after one Cuban performance. "But I don't need to know the language, to know they did damage."

The National Transportation Safety Board, citing the case of the American Airlines jet that ran off a runway in Little Rock, Ark., in 1999, killing 11 people, said the F.A.A. should promptly rewrite its rules on how many consecutive hours airline crews are allowed to work.

HEADLINE: Israel Rebuffs U.S. Demand To End Its West Bank Raids 

BYLINE:  By TIM WEINER 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Oct. 23 

 BODY:
Israel today rebuffed President Bush's personal request to withdraw its forces from Palestinian-controlled territory, putting new pressure on American-Israeli relations and the United States' counterterrorism coalition with Arab allies.
 The impasse became clear after President Bush and Secretary of State Colin L. Powell met separately today with the Israeli foreign minister, Shimon Peres. 
 They renewed the United States' demand that Israel pull out of Palestinian-controlled areas of the West Bank. Mr. Peres said Israel would not do so until the security forces of Yasir Arafat, the Palestinian leader, arrested the men who murdered Israel's tourism minister last week. 
Mr. Peres said President Bush warned that violence in the Middle East made it harder for the United States to maintain its antiterrorism coalition. "He would like very much the flames to go down, and I told him we shall do whatever we can to reduce them," Mr. Peres said.
Mr. Bush said, "I would hope the Israelis would move their troops as quickly as possible." And Secretary Powell reiterated his demand, made on Monday, for an immediate pullout, a spokesman said.
Mr. Peres said: "We would like to withdraw immediately. The minute the Palestinians will take the necessary steps, this may happen." 
 But the violence continued Wednesday in the West Bank, as three Palestinians were killed by Israeli soldiers in the town of Tulkarem, Agence France-Presse reported. 
Israeli forces began to reoccupy parts of six Palestinian-controlled cities and towns last week after an assassin shot Rehavam Zeevi, the tourism minister, in Jerusalem on Oct. 17. The Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine, a secular group with Marxist-Leninist roots, said it killed Mr. Zeevi to avenge Israel's assassination of its leader, Abu Ali Mustafa, in August. 
The ensuing tensions placed the region at its "most dangerous moment in a decade," the United Nations special envoy for Middle East peace, Terje Roed-Larsen, said in a statement released today.
Mr. Peres, who also received Mr. Bush's condolences on Mr. Zeevi's death, took pains to convey the impression that no differences existed between Israel and its strongest ally, the United States. 
"I didn't discover any contradiction in the American policy and the Israeli policy," he said. 
The call for an immediate Israeli withdrawal was balanced by American demands on Mr. Arafat for arrests in Mr. Zeevi's murder, along with suspects in terrorist attacks on Israelis.
"We continue to call upon Chairman Arafat to do everything he can to bring the killer to justice," Mr. Bush said. "It's very important that he arrest the person who did this -- or those who did this act -- and continue to arrest those who would disrupt and harm Israeli citizens. He must show the resolve necessary to bring peace to the region."
Mr. Bush stopped short, however, of calling for Mr. Arafat to turn over the accused killers to Israel for trial there, a demand made by some Israeli officials. 
In Ramallah, on the West Bank, the Palestinian information minister, Yasir Abed Rabbo, said, "The Palestinian Authority is determined to find those responsible for the murder and to take them before Palestinian tribunals." He said that it had made arrests, though he did not provide any details, and he said Mr. Arafat had recommitted Palestinian groups to a cease-fire.
The Palestinian leadership, he said, had held "an intensive dialogue with all factions telling them that this is the end of the game and that everyone should abide by the rules and the obligations that we have made."
Addressing Israeli criticism that the United States was pressuring Israel to build support among Arab nations, Mr. Abed Rabbo said, "What's wrong with getting support from the Arab world?"
Since the Sept. 11 attacks, the United States has tried to build a coalition against terrorism that embraces as many Arab allies as possible. But each of those Arab allies demands some progress toward peace in the Middle East. Each, in varying degrees, sides with the Palestinians.
Israel, long seen as the United States' staunchest ally in the Middle East, and the recipient of billions of dollars in annual American military and economic aid, is also a crucial counter-terrorism partner. Its national security has been a fundamental part of American foreign policy since Israel's creation.
So the American effort to strike a balance is delicate at best. In the days before the killing of Mr. Zeevi, the United States hoped for a return to political talks between the Israelis and Palestinians, said Richard Boucher, the State Department spokesman. The killing, the Israeli reaction and Israel's rebuff of the United States' demands today appeared to have damaged those hopes.
The American demand for an Israeli withdrawal was viewed by many Israelis as an effort to score points in the Arab world at Israel's expense. 
Shlomo Ben-Ami, a former Israeli foreign minister and a critic of Prime Minister Ariel Sharon, said: "Imagine now that Sharon says, 'Well, all right, I withdraw.' Then what will be the image of Israel in the Arab world?"
Zalman Shoval, a former Israeli ambassador now visiting the United States as Mr. Sharon's envoy, said the American demand "will again encourage the Palestinian side to draw the wrong conclusion, that the pressure is now on Israel and not on them."
"When people speak of a crisis in the relationship, that's perhaps nonsense," said Mr. Shoval, who also has met with senior American officials. "But there are differences of opinion which I have not gotten an answer to from the United States. 
"A senior Israeli political person is assassinated by people who are well known," he said. "So what do you advise us to do? What would you have done in our place? I did not so far hear anything beyond 'wait.' " 
Arab governments have questions for the United States too, Mr. Boucher said.
"Are we really trying to end the violence?" he said. "Are we really trying to create conditions where Palestinians can live better? Are we really trying to offer a path back to negotiations?" The answer, he said, is, "definitely yes."
Mr. Peres, speaking at the Brookings Institution in Washington today, said the United States expected Israel "to calm down as much as we can the situation in the Arab world, namely in the conflict between the Palestinians and ourselves."
"We are asking ourselves how to do it," he said. But Israel cannot do it without clear signs that Mr. Arafat can control militants or arrest suspects within Palestinian-controlled areas, Mr. Peres said. 
"If there is a leader that can do nothing, why do we need him?" he asked. "If a leader cannot lead, who needs him? If he can lead and doesn't, again, what is the value of him?"

HEADLINE: Dazed but Game at Furniture Expo 

BYLINE:  By LIZ SEYMOUR

DATELINE: HIGH POINT, N.C. 

 BODY:
WITH buyer attendance off nearly 30 percent and SWAT teams stationed on the roofs, the International Home Furnishings Market opened here last Thursday on a subdued note. There were few flamboyant debuts or blockbuster collections. Visitors saw a surprising range of sectional sofas, some splashes of orange and chartreuse, new striped fabrics and moderate-price sofas that can be ordered in custom lengths.
 For an industry that just went through its worst six months in two years, world events made a tough situation tougher. "We're used to coming up with something new during bad times, giving people some reason to buy, but what reason can you give them when they're frightened?" said Mitchell Gold, a North Carolina furniture maker. His answer was familiar slouchy slipcovers and saucy stripes, with a program called "Mitchell Gold by the Inch," offering sofas 60 to 120 inches long. 
 At the La-Z-Boy display, Faith Popcorn, who coined the term "cocooning" 20 years ago, demonstrated new cocooning recliners for women ($799). "When a trauma crosses a trend, change ensues," she said. 
Grasping at the thinnest of straws, some speculated that newly introspective Americans might turn to buying furniture. "I don't want anyone to think we're profiting from this, but we're seeing a new appreciation for family, friends and home entertaining," said Jerry Epperson, an industry analyst and partner in the Richmond-based Mann, Armistead & Epperson. "We have an opportunity here."
In normal times the furniture industry would have been near recovery. Factory orders were up in early September, and a strong housing market and low interest rates should have boosted furniture sales. But no one said these were normal times.
The dominant color theme was red, white and blue, from hastily stitched throw pillows to Made in America stickers and giant flags. Larry Laslo, the show's avatar of Modernism, drenched the Directional showroom in chartreuse, charcoal gray and white but still found room on one sofa for a tiny flag pillow of grosgrain ribbon stripes, with pearls on a field of blue satin.
Sectionals, those family room favorites, were back at every price: Directional, Mitchell Gold and Dellarobbia all had striking examples. Dellarobbia's six-piece mix-and-match Capsule sectional by GoodmanCharlton of New York, shown in Necco Wafer shades of brown, blue and off-white ultrasuede, was a hit, even at $12,000. Lower-price fabrics can cut the price to $6,000. Stanley Friedman, the upper-end Modernist, making his debut in the retail market with three new collections for Weiman, showed sleek sectionals. Barbara Barry shook up the staid Baker showroom with a cushy six-piece sectional clad in a topaz rayon-and-linen blend ($23,000).
Many of the new pieces were hiply unhip -- or what might be called the new dowdiness. Thomas O'Brien, whose sophisticated urban collection for Hickory Chair two years ago set off a cycle of dark wood and silver hardware, added a grandmotherly skirted sofa to his Hickory Chair collection. Fabrics were nubbly and comfortable, wood finishes a little warmer, and purely traditional designs were much in evidence.
It was a spirit that predated recent events. American-theme country groups had been planned by Drexel Heritage (American Tempo) and Hickory Chair (American Portfolio). "We came to market looking for furniture that was less gaudy, less ostentatious," said David Kaplan, senior vice president of Beacon Hill, a chain of upper-end design showrooms. "Our customer has been moving in that direction over the last year anyway."
Ready-to-wear was a big inspiration in many showrooms, where Kate Spade-like stripes, Burberry-style plaids, big checks and hot colors were the rule. Modernism was by no means dead: Michael Weiss designed a spiffy new group of pieces for Vanguard Furniture -- saddle-stitched leather, brushed nickel hardware and ash wood, with echoes of elegant French Moderne at a mid-American price.
Manufacturers are trying to remain optimistic. "People who buy our furniture have money, and they're the kind of people who always have money," said Robert Dillon, president of John Widdicomb, which was introducing a new $10,000 mahogany bed in its Studio line. "When the economy goes bad, our business generally stays even. But this time it's different. This time it's very different."

Burb Cocooning? Who Has Time?

BYLINE:  By JOE QUEENAN

 BODY:
ONE inevitable result of a disaster like Sept. 11 is a profusion of quasi-scientific ruminating about the psychic health of the nation. My favorite is the notion that the American people have entered a period of intense national "cocooning" that may last from 3 months to 10 years. 
 Shortly after the attacks, Faith Popcorn, the self-anointed trends prognosticator who coined the term "cocooning" 20 years ago, introduced an even more extravagant neologism, "armored cocooning": stocking up on antibiotics, air filters, viral filters -- the full home nuclear-winter arsenal. 
 Other cocooning buffs draw a distinction between "home cocoons" and "neighborhood cocoons." This leaves open the possibility that we may soon be grappling with concepts like "tract-home cocooning," "time-share cocooning," "split-level cocooning" and "McMansion cocooning." Not to mention "gated-community cocooning." 
Contemporary cocoonery is not devoid of a merchandising component. On Oct. 18, The Wall Street Journal ran an article titled "Retailers Pin Hopes on Cocooning TV buyers." It quoted an electronics chain store executive as saying, "TV, in a time of crisis, feels like a necessary thing, while a speaker and a stereo system might feel more discretionary." One assumes this is because entire families can cocoon around a single 52-inch TV set watching CNN, whereas no self-respecting teenager is going to cocoon in the living room while his parents are playing their old Carly Simon records.
As a resident of Tarrytown, a suburban village 25 miles north of Manhattan, I live in precisely the sort of Norman Rockwell-type community where cocooning should be the modus vivendi. So far, I'm not seeing it. 
The Greek diner up the street from my office is packed day and night. Churches are filled. The high school kids are still getting into trouble with the police. The village hall is still filled with grumpy citizens complaining about unprincipled developers, questionable budgetary expenditures and woefully inadequate warnings that a Richard Dreyfus television program was being filmed downtown. The soccer moms and dads are still overwhelmed by the need to ferry their tykes from one disastrously lopsided game to the next. "I'd love to be able to stay home and cocoon," said T. J. Elliott, a Tarrytown human-resources consultant. "But I've got three kids; I'm driving to soccer games all over the county."
What many people -- particularly young, unmarried urban journalists -- fail to realize about the suburbs is that the tyranny of routine precludes rest.
"Everybody's got a program, and everybody's got a program all the time," said Tom Staudter, a teacher, journalist and father of two who has lived in the area since childhood. He was trying to squeeze in a Jets game between dinner and a Denzel Washington movie while attending the harvest fair at the Union Church of Pocantico Hills nearby. He has not now cocooned, nor will he ever. 
In suburbs like this, the infrastructure of normality eats up enormous amounts of the day (and night): school board meetings, parent association meetings, fund-raisers, swim competitions, teacher conferences, garden club socials, planning board hearings, multiplex visits, football, soccer, volleyball. Senior citizens have flu shots to get, art classes to attend, tai-chi lessons, bills to complain about. And a recital at the library featuring Anton Del Forno, master of the classical guitar. Free.
A cynic might argue that all these activities qualify as "communal cocooning," that by its very nature life in a quiet, unassuming hamlet involves some form of villagewide intellectual vegetation. 
But this sneering perspective overlooks the definition of classic cocooning, with its a sense of hunkering down, hanging crepe over the windows, battening down the hatches, waiting for this awful Taliban thing to blow over. 
This is hardly the kind of behavior we are seeing in the lower Hudson Valley. The leaf watchers have been out in force every weekend, bikers and joggers are even more abundant than usual, caffe lattes are still being sold in prodigious quantities. When the Ying Quartet played at the high school a few Saturdays ago, almost 600 people showed up. War or no war, people are still getting married, boys are still having bar mitzvahs, babies are still getting born. 
At a festive wedding I attended last Saturday it was obviously going to take more than Osama bin Laden to keep the Electric Sliders off the dance floor. Not while the fabulous Jimmy D was spinning the platters.
This is not to say that suburban life has been unaffected. People from here died in those buildings. Other people could have died. There were funerals, vigils, church services. And the economic impact is being felt all over.
A man who runs a service that takes people to airports says business has fallen off 90 percent. Several people I spoke with seem reluctant to visit prominent malls and certainly do not want their children visiting them. Many Thanksgiving travel plans are on hold.
People are worried about anthrax and microbes in their water, just as they are worried about the safety of the Indian Point nuclear power plant a few miles up the river. Judy Kass, who worked in Tower 2 for a subsidiary of Marsh & McLennan, which lost 292 people in the World Trade Center attack, says that she no longer hangs out in Grand Central Terminal, admiring its splendors, visiting its shops. "Now I wait outside until it's time for my train, and get on it," she said.
Still, when she has free time on the weekend, she's not staying indoors. If you're going to cocoon in a place like this, you're going to have to cocoon in your car.
In these information-overloaded times, when "crisis counselors" and "bioterrorism experts" seem to be more numerous than blades of grass, we must be careful to resist the allures of the portentous anecdote.
But here's a little chestnut to nibble on. After my son's soccer game on Sunday, the coach discussed a trip to Hawaii next July for a national tournament. Between now and then, it will be up to the parents to decide whether they feel comfortable having their children fly 6,000 miles.
My wife and I must make a decision soon, even though we have no way of knowing what the world will look like nine months from now. But the kids were already debating which players weren't going to make the final cut. You could see from the look on their faces that a week in Hawaii sounded pretty good. A lot better than a week in a cocoon.

HEADLINE: Several Orchestras Are Troubled Financially 

BYLINE:  By ALLAN KOZINN 

 BODY:
Two major symphony orchestras, the St. Louis Symphony and the Toronto Symphony, are on the brink of bankruptcy and are asking musicians to take pay cuts and possibly shorten their seasons, while a third, the Chicago Symphony, is projecting deficits for the first time in 15 years.
 The Toronto Symphony, which is facing an accumulated deficit of $7 million (Canadian), could be bankrupt by the end of the week, orchestra officials said. Last week in California, the San Jose Symphony dissolved its board after posting a $2.5 million deficit on a budget of $7.8 million. That regional orchestra is hoping to restructure. 
 And now the Chicago Symphony, a renowned ensemble that has long been the picture of solvency, is projecting deficits for this season and next. Chicago's problems are by no means as dire as those of St. Louis and Toronto, both highly regarded orchestras, and the Chicago musicians are not being asked to take cuts. But a flagship educational program has been canceled, and a dozen staff positions have been eliminated, most through attrition. 
Through the stock market boom of the late 1990's, many of the best North American orchestras found ways to meet their budgets, build endowments and expand their reach through educational programs and other community projects. But in the current economic downturn, with falling interest rates whittling away at the endowment incomes that some orchestras use to underwrite operations, musicians and managements are nervous.
Spokesmen on both sides have also noted a slowing in ticket sales that they attribute partly to the economy and partly to audience skittishness since Sept. 11. Others say that downturns at a handful of orchestras don't necessarily mean the start of a trend.
"When the economy goes down, you always have orchestras that are vulnerable," said Robert Levine, the chairman of the International Conference of Symphony and Opera Musicians and a member of the Milwaukee Symphony. "But there are quite a few orchestras that are doing fine. The Seattle Symphony just closed its fiscal year with a surplus."
Still, the situation in Toronto is particularly perilous. On Sept. 25, the orchestra's executive director, Edward Smith, resigned abruptly after only 10 months in his post, declaring starkly that "I don't believe the organization will be able to withstand the problems with which it is faced."
That same day, Robert Weiss, the chairman of the Toronto Symphony, told the board that the orchestra had lost $2.26 million this year (all Toronto Symphony figures Canadian), bringing its accumulated deficit to $7 million. Its annual budget is $17 million. Without $1.5 million in immediate cash and $1 million in credit, Mr. Weiss told the board, the orchestra might have to declare bankruptcy by Nov. 30. Within a week, the orchestra hired Lambert Huizingh, the president of International Restructuring Corporation, to restructure the orchestra. By mid-October, the players were asked to consider a 15 percent salary cut as well as a six-week curtailment of the season, which would bring salaries down another 8 percent. The proposal included a reduction in the orchestra's ranks, to 84 from 98.
When the musicians quickly agreed to reopen their contract, the Toronto Symphony Orchestra Foundation agreed to advance $1.5 million in interest payments from the orchestra's $22 million endowment, as an emergency measure. But since that money was to have been paid in 2002 and was expected to cover expenses next season, it does not solve the problem.
The transaction has also angered the musicians, whose contract, won after an 11-week strike in 1999, promises them a 29.8 percent increase over four seasons. The current minimum annual salary at the orchestra is $64,000.
"We came to an agreement almost two years ago, but I don't know what the point was," said Bill Skolnik, the executive director of the Toronto Musicians Association, Local 149 of the American Federation of Musicians. "We saw the books at that time, and we saw that unless there was a major improvement in getting revenue and cutting costs, this was likely. But that required an effort on the board's part, which we thought that the board would undertake in order to fulfill their agreement. But that didn't happen." 
This week, the players and Mr. Weiss closeted themselves in negotiations and imposed a news blackout. But Jane Rannie, the orchestra's spokeswoman, said that the money in the advance from the foundation would last only until Friday. The orchestra could be bankrupt by the end of the week.
At the St. Louis Symphony, the mood has gone from euphoria to near-depression in less than a year. Last December, Andrew C. Taylor, the chief executive of Enterprise Rent-a-Car, announced a $40 million challenge grant from his family, the largest grant ever made to an arts organization. If the challenge is met -- so far the orchestra has raised $18 million -- it will give the organization an $80 million nest egg, $10 million of which can be used for operations, with the rest destined for an endowment currently at $18 million. 
But even as the orchestra celebrated its gift, it was clear that all was not well. The organization had been running annual deficits as high as $7 million for much of the last decade on annual budgets of around $25 million. Last summer, the board proposed severe measures, including possibly reducing the size of the orchestra. Its executive director, Don Roth, abruptly resigned (and was hired by the Aspen Music Festival, which had just lost its executive director, Robert Harth, to Carnegie Hall). W. Randolph Adams, a retired banker and financial consultant, was appointed to succeed him.
"What caused this," Mr. Adams said, "was that over the last 30 years, the orchestra has taken on a set of activities that were well meaning, but which overloaded the boat." He cited as examples a music school, which has now been transferred to Webster University, and some costly pops programs.
His plan to get the orchestra through its crisis includes cutting $7 million from the budget and obtaining $29 million by Dec. 31 (with payments in hand by August) to pay outstanding debts, as well as raising the remaining $22 million needed to match the $40 million Taylor grant. Although Mr. Adams has backed away from the idea of reducing the size of the orchestra, he said that he would probably ask the musicians to trim the season by a few weeks and to take pay cuts of as much as 20 to 30 percent. (The orchestra's minimum salary is $75,400.)
The orchestra has not yet decided whether to reopen its contract, and a faction is said to be too angry to consider it. 
The Chicago Symphony Orchestra's problems may seem trivial by comparison. At a board meeting early this month, the orchestra, which has an annual budget of $60 million and a $168 million endowment, projected deficits of $1.3 million this year and $2 million in 2002. 
"I admit that we spent up to our resources, even as those resources were climbing at the height of the stock market," Henry Fogel, the orchestra president, said. "But the economy turned over the last year and a half, and that had an effect on fund-raising."
Mr. Fogel also noted that while attendance had remained strong, box office income had been flat because of audience resistance to price increases, and that the value of the endowment had dropped.
Ticket sales since Sept. 11 have been about 20 percent below the orchestra's projections. And in an unrelated blow, the orchestra's nationally syndicated radio broadcasts were discontinued this month when new sponsors could not be found to replace BP. 
Mr. Fogel eliminated five administrative jobs and has frozen seven others through attrition. The orchestra also trimmed costs for a staging of Wagner's "Tristan und Isolde" and closed ECHO, the music education center opened with considerable fanfare in September 1998. 
"The issue isn't the $1.3 million, but what's going to happen to fund-raising and ticket sales post-Sept. 11," Mr. Fogel said. "We've done what we can for 2002, but we're looking to cut $4 million to $5 million from the budget in 2003 and 2004. But where our problems differ from other orchestras in crisis is that we are not looking at cutting core activities. We're looking at extra things we've done and asking if we can afford them."

HEADLINE: Hong Kong Debates Link to Dollar 

BYLINE:  By MARK LANDLER 

DATELINE: HONG KONG, Oct. 24 

 BODY:
With the economy falling and public discontent rising, Hong Kong has been questioning one of its cornerstones: the linking of its currency to the United States dollar at a fixed exchange rate.
 The debate began last month when the territory's financial secretary, Antony Leung, told a local newspaper that the peg, as the exchange rate is known, was an obstacle to an efficient economy. 
 Mr. Leung, a former banker at J. P. Morgan Chase who joined the government in May, stirred matters further last week when he said that removing the peg would give Hong Kong more flexibility in adjusting prices. 
Both times, he went on to say that Hong Kong had no plans to abandon the policy now because it would invite speculation against the Hong Kong dollar. But few people paid attention to his disclaimers.
Currency traders bet heavily against the Hong Kong dollar, hoping to capitalize on a shift in the government's policy. And longtime opponents of the linked exchange rate urged Tung Chee-hwa, the territory's chief executive, to abandon the policy, which has been in place since 1983. Mr. Tung is widely expected to try for -- and win -- a second term next March.
"Mr. Tung should consider scrapping the peg during his second term," said James Tien, the head of the Liberal Party and a former chairman of the Hong Kong General Chamber of Commerce, in an interview with The South China Morning Post last month.
Asked by reporters in Shanghai after the recent Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation meetings about such a possibility , Mr. Tung said, "The answer is no, no, no!"
Few economists believe that Hong Kong will sever the link between its currency and the United States dollar any time soon. Discussions about the wisdom of the policy are almost a parlor game here. But analysts say this debate is more vigorous and public than previous ones have been, and that shows how deeply the global economic downturn has shaken Hong Kong, a former British colony.
Hong Kong's exports tumbled 9 percent in August, and economic growth has stalled. Unemployment is expected to rise close to 6 percent, rivaling the darkest days of the Asian economic crisis in 1997-98.
While most Asian countries, with the notable exception of China, are also suffering, people here say Hong Kong bears an extra burden. Its currency has not depreciated in value like that of its neighbors. That makes Hong Kong expensive as an export market and as a place to do business.
"It is an open secret that the currency is overvalued," said Sin-ming Shaw, a market commentator and former economist at Chase.
Hong Kong has been willing to tolerate this disparity in the past because linking its dollar's exchange rate to the United States dollar has given it stability. Foreign investors could put their money here and be confident that it would not be jeopardized by Hong Kong's stormy transition to Chinese sovereignty.
"It was introduced at a time when the talks over Hong Kong's future were going badly," said Richard Margolis, a former British diplomat who is now a strategist at Merrill Lynch. "There was a bit of panic."
At times, defending the currency link has been costly. In 1998, the government spent $15 billion on shares in the local stock market to foil foreign traders whom it accused of manipulating the currency.
While Hong Kong recovered from the crisis, a bubble in real estate prices that had been building for most of the 1990's burst. As property prices plummeted, many people found themselves holding mortgages exceeding the value of their homes.
"We're going through a slow, painful process of deflation that breeds discontent," Mr. Shaw said.
In this environment, the exchange rate is an easy target. People say it is a costly relic. Hong Kong's political stability is no longer in doubt, as China has mainly stayed out of local affairs. And the strength of the Chinese economy has become one of Hong Kong's prime selling points.
Supporters of the status quo say Hong Kong is mainly a financial center, not an exporter competing with Taiwan and Singapore. So devaluing the currency would not necessarily bolster the economy. They say Hong Kong needs to confront more basic problems, like its real estate market, which is dominated by a cartel.
The most pressing reason for Hong Kong to stick with its policy may have little to do with this city of seven million and more to do with other countries with currencies linked to the United States dollar.
"If you abandoned the dollar peg tomorrow, what would happen in Argentina?" said Simon L. Ogus, the chief executive of DSG Asia, a research group here. "We would have an emerging-market default."

HEADLINE: Hallowed Ground Zero; 
Competing Plans Hope to Shape a Trade Center Memorial

BYLINE:  By DINITIA SMITH 

 BODY:
How will the horror be remembered? Since the World Trade Center attack on Sept. 11 there have been no shortage of ideas for a memorial for the thousands of people who died there.
 Should a portion of the skeletal remains of the tower that still stand in the ruins serve as a memorial, just as the frame of a building destroyed by the atomic blast was left as part of the Peace Memorial in Hiroshima? 
 Another suggestion calls for two huge beams of light to search the night sky, a symbol of the vanished towers. And there are those who argue that the site is sacred ground, still a smoking funeral pyre containing the remains of thousands, and that nothing should be built on it. 
Meanwhile, Larry A. Silverstein, who holds the lease to the site, has asserted that the best memorial would be to rebuild in the same place, which constitutes some of the most valuable real estate in Manhattan, and has commissioned the firm of Skidmore Owings & Merrill and Cooper Robertson & Partners to draw up plans for four 50-story buildings and a park that would include a memorial. But there has been no consensus yet. And architects and historians say that given the lessons of recent history, the process could be fraught, only adding to the universal pain of the catastrophe. 
"Our concern is that the memorial not be seen as an afterthought," said Michael Manfredi, an architect who has become involved in an effort by architects, artists and representatives of the business community to help shape the process through which a memorial will be chosen.
The participants are serving on a committee that calls itself the Memorial Process Team. It hopes to avert the acrimony that has developed over projects like the Jewish Museum in Berlin, which eventually had a successful opening, and the World War II memorial in Washington, which is not yet built. It is an offshoot of the Design Coalition, organized by the American Institute of Architects, consisting of professional, civic and cultural organizations considering how to rebuild downtown Manhattan. 
The memorial team has no authority, and is purely advisory, said one of its coordinators, Ray Gastil. He is executive director of the Van Alen Institute, an advocacy group to improve public architecture. The team will hold a meeting tomorrow.
It will not make recommendations for a design, Mr. Gastil said, but "we are trying to set up the best principles." The group will look at the way other memorials were built, like the one in Oklahoma City, consisting of 168 empty chairs in a parklike setting to commemorate the victims of the 1995 bombing.
The building of any memorial is an immensely complex undertaking, said Richard Scherr a member of the team, who along with James Rossant was a finalist for the Oklahoma City Memorial. To be successful, he added, the end product must necessarily "work on symbolic levels, political and cultural levels." 
And while the design for the memorial will inevitably be chosen by committee, which many designers and architects assert should include a strong presence of victims and survivors, Mr. Manfredi said, "it's important that whatever art is done, it's not done by committee." Mr. Manfredi and his partner, Marion Weiss, designed the memorial to women of the armed forces at Arlington National Cemetery.
Diana Balmori, a landscape and urban designer also on the panel, suggested that while the process of deciding is under way, there could be a temporary memorial on the site, which would "reflect the different stages which the site goes through, like an organic, living thing." The site is largely closed to the public now, Ms. Balmori noted, while crews search for remains and remove debris. A temporary memorial might include a viewing platform from which people could see the location. "The hiding of the site is not a good idea," she said. "Seeing the site, gives the site a chance to heal and the people a chance to heal." 
Whatever happens, timing is critical, architects and engineers say, with Mr. Silverstein's announcement that he is already drawing up plans for new buildings for the site and the state and city considering how to organize a rebuilding effort. Mr. Manfredi said that it was important that a memorial "not be a footnote to a large development project."
"While moving forward is important," he said, "what you wouldn't want is a little statue or a little plot." 
Timing is also important because of the sheer rapidity with which the site is being cleared, with debris being hauled away to the Fresh Kills landfill on Staten Island, and to locations in New Jersey where it is already being ground into scrap. Some of the debris, Mr. Scherr said, "represents a fabric that exists from the site that can speak to us from the site" and could be used in a future memorial. 
To ensure that objects are preserved for this kind of use, the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey, which owns the land, has appointed a committee to designate objects to be salvaged. The committee consists of two architects -- Marilyn Taylor, chairman of Skidmore Owings & Merrill, and Bart Voorsanger, who designed the remodeling of Asia House -- and Saul Wenegrat, an art consultant who was involved in choosing public art for the World Trade Center. 
"We think of it as collecting objects for a museum," Mr. Voorsanger said. The committee's members have already tagged remnants of the public art that once stood at the World Trade Center, like Fritz Koenig's "Sphere," for preservation. They also want to preserve some of the impromptu memorials created by work crews, the great cross of ruined steel that has become an icon of the rescue effort, and some of the firetrucks, taxicabs and passenger cars that were crushed under the weight of tons of steel. The twisted vehicles are a shocking and direct link to the moment of the disaster. "There is no way someone wasn't in that car or taxi," Mr. Voorsanger said in his office, pointing to a photograph of a car that was nearly flattened by the force of the explosion, and which is a blood orange color.
The group has also tagged huge pieces of construction debris for salvaging. "Look at this," Mr. Voorsanger said, pointing to a huge steel beam bent into a U-shape by either the force of the attack or the subsequent inferno, as he gave a tour of Metal Management's yard in New Jersey, where some of the debris has been hauled by barge from ground zero. "There is no equipment strong enough to bend it like this." 
The chunks of ruined steel might be used in a memorial in the same way that museums reconstruct ancient pottery, Mr. Voorsanger suggested, with a piece of original material joined together with facsimiles of missing pieces to recall the building.
The immense steel beam that was impaled in the side of one of the buildings in the World Financial Center could also be left in place as a memorial after the building is restored, Mr. Voorsanger suggested, as a symbol of the sheer force of the attack. "It was like Zeus hurling thunderbolts," he said.
But the committee's search for objects raises further questions about the memorial's design. Should it even include objects from the site, or statues or likenesses of the victims? Or should it deal with the event more abstractly, like Maya Lin's Vietnam memorial in Washington? 
On the subject of involvement by survivors and relatives, Mr. Gastil said he hoped that they would soon join the Memorial Process Team. The involvement of survivors and relatives of victims in the Oklahoma City memorial is widely acknowledged to be one reason for its success.
Mr. Scherr also emphasized the importance of survivors and relatives in decision making. But the Oklahoma City memorial involved 168 victims, Mr. Scherr pointed out. "Here you are talking about over 5,000 people," he said. "And when you magnify that to relatives and others who were involved, it becomes thousands and thousands of people." 
But the voice of relatives and victims in shaping a memorial is no guarantee of success. The World War II memorial planned for Washington was designed with much input from veterans groups, but it has also been the object of protest from others who dislike the design. Even if the Trade Center memorial does not incorporate artifacts from the site, Mr. Voorsanger said, it is important to have them in case they are needed. "What do you reclaim as memory?" he asked. "This memorial needs a level of poetry." But for the memorial to work as poetry, the objects must become metaphors, he said, adding, "Metaphor is the only way you can speak to future generations." 
"Was it Wallace Stevens who said you need the literal in order to create the metaphor?" Mr. Voorsanger asked. 
In the past, much more time passed between a tragic event, and the discussions of how to memorialize it, said Edward Linenthal, a professor of Religion and American Culture at the University of Wisconsin in Oshkosh, who studies memorials. But in a culture that embraces an almost therapeutic mode of openness, Mr. Linenthal writes in "The Unfinished Bombing: Oklahoma City in American Memory" (Oxford University Press), memorialization has become a significant form of cultural expression. And daily accounts in the news media of the search for bodies, the anguish of families, have only intensified the national empathy for the victims of national tragedies and their survivors. 
In a telephone interview, Mr. Linenthal who has also written books on battlefield memorials, and the creation of the Holocaust Memorial in Washington, said that the grounds of the discussion in New York have been largely the same as in Oklahoma City. The first impulse in New York, Mr. Linenthal said, was "we will not let terrorists alter in an enduring manner the landscape of New York. We will rebuild." 
In Oklahoma, he said, "People were going to rebuild the federal building. But what developed rather quickly was the opposite pole, that this is, if not sacred ground, at least charged ground. It has been transformed, just as a battlefield is by the loss that took place there."
He endorsed deep community participation in the project. "The whole process enfranchised people," he said, and was part of a general democratization in the creation of memorials that has also occurred in recent years. One instance of this is the way that people make their own mark on places like the Vietnam memorial, tracing names on the stone, and leaving objects there.
"Memorials have become much more than just static places to honor long ago events that quickly become of only antiquarian interest," he said. "The purpose is not just to mourn the dead, but to actively reshape the moral conscience of people who come through." 
The conversations about the Trade Center memorial will probably be more complex than any of the others, Mr. Linenthal said. But he added that the debates themselves could be more important than whatever memorial is eventually built.
"I happen to think it is in the conversations, in the careful selection of people to think about this, that we in fact agonize and come to grips in certain ways with these massive, horrendous events," he said. "From my perspective, what is more important is the process -- in some cases, it is more important than the memorial."

Collateral Damage

BYLINE:  By BOB HERBERT 

 BODY:
When the Yankees clinched yet another trip to the World Series by thrashing the Seattle Mariners, 12-3, before 56,000 chanting, screaming fans in the Bronx on Monday night, it was like a giant pep rally for a beleaguered city.
 It was a well-deserved respite. But on Tuesday morning New Yorkers woke again to the terrible reality that is the aftermath of the World Trade Center attack. Even as the grieving continues for the many who died, the city has to confront economic consequences that, if not dealt with smartly and swiftly, could undo the progress of the past several years and usher in a long period of decline. 
 "In addition to the enormous human toll," said Comptroller Alan Hevesi, "there's the dramatic loss of infrastructure and earning power -- businesses that were destroyed, businesses that were hurt, businesses that are contemplating leaving New York City, either temporarily or permanently, and businesses that are floundering because of the fear factor, like the airlines, the entertainment industry, Broadway and so on.
"We've already lost $47 billion with the destruction of the World Trade Center offices, the downtown devastation, the loss of fire trucks and other equipment, lost transportation facilities, and the lost earnings of people who were either killed or lost their jobs. And for the rest of the fiscal year, eight months to go, it will be another $45 billion or so."
That's an economic hit approaching $100 billion over two years. Entire neighborhoods outside of the immediate disaster zone -- think Chinatown, think Little Italy -- are threatened with economic ruin.
The attack and its aftermath, combined with an already faltering economy, will have a gruesome effect on the city's budget. Estimates of the deficit for the current fiscal year range from $738 million to more than $1 billion. And the expected deficit for the following fiscal year, which begins next July 1, is $4 billion.
These are not problems that can be papered over with pretty words and the passage of a little time. New Yorkers are going to suffer a tremendous blow in terms of their personal financial well-being and the quality of the city's services. How well and how quickly those problems are managed will determine whether the city can regroup and recover in the short term -- or, conversely, if the nation's premier metropolis has been permanently wounded by the terrorist attack.
The severity of the situation was underscored in a comment that Mark Green, the Democratic mayoral candidate, made during a campaign speech on Tuesday. "It's a simple fact," he said, "that the hardest hit segments of our economy -- finance, tourism, retail -- are the segments that are most critical to the success of our economy and our ability to generate jobs for people in all five boroughs of our city."
The real question is whether New Yorkers will attempt to pull together as one -- as they cheered as one for the Yankees on Monday night -- in the face of this continuing grave threat to the city. What will happen, for example, when the cops and firemen -- heroes all -- and the teachers and other municipal workers begin lining up for contract negotiations in an environment dominated by multibillion-dollar budget gaps and a dismal national economy?
"The hope is that you could look at ways to make city government more efficient," said Diana Fortuna, president of the Citizens Budget Commission, a civic watchdog group. "You'd want to talk to the unions very seriously about ways of streamlining work that's done now."
Personnel cuts of some kind -- through attrition, buyouts or layoffs -- seem inevitable. But ratcheting down services is a tricky business. When services become subpar, the city's competitiveness suffers and the downward spiral begins. Who wants to visit or relocate to a dirtier, less safe or otherwise less appealing city?
More immediate is the need to retain and revitalize the businesses that are here now. Said Mr. Hevesi, "If the next mayor moves quickly, we can contain this crisis over the next two years. If we miss the boat, we won't recover for 8 or 10 years."
The interdependence of all New Yorkers will be made clear as this many-layered tragedy continues to unfold.

HEADLINE: Does the U.S. Still Trust Markets to Work?; 
If Every Bailout Could Be Like Chrysler's

BYLINE:  By FLOYD NORRIS 

 BODY:
In 1983, Lee A. Iacocca, then the chief executive of Chrysler, proudly posed with a check for $813,487,500, the company's final payment of the $1.2 billion it had borrowed with a government guarantee in 1980. Without federal help, Chrysler would have gone broke.
 Now, with requests for help from one industry after another multiplying as worries about terrorism escalate, that bailout is viewed as a successful model. The workers kept their jobs. The company went on to prosper. The government, which received Chrysler warrants for guaranteeing the loans, made a profit of $311.1 million. 
 To be sure, some question whether even such a successful bailout was the right thing to do. The company might have survived in bankruptcy reorganization, and some have argued that the bailout delayed a needed overhaul of the American industry to make it more competitive with foreign automakers. 
But the rescue of Chrysler, now a unit of DaimlerChrysler, is hardly representative of all such interventions. Many bailouts end in failure, some quite quickly. The bailout of the savings and loan industry became a multiyear fiasco. And on the global front, the International Monetary Fund agreed to a $17 billion bailout of Russia in June, 1998, only weeks before its currency collapsed. Within months Russia was defaulting on its debts.
Bailouts start with a huge disadvantage. By the time the government -- or the I.M.F. in the case of countries -- is asked for help, the borrower is in trouble. Private lenders usually have refused to lend money, or at least to do so on terms that the borrower can hope to repay. A lender who has the last choice of borrowers is not well positioned.
But they are approved in most crises, because the risks of not acting seem to be too great. Whether it was Lockheed in 1971, New York City in 1975, or Russia in 1998, stepping in seemed to be less risky than doing nothing.
Is there a choice? Bankruptcy filings have their own advantages compared with bailouts, although those seeking bailouts usually make it sound like bankruptcy is a black hole. Most companies are reorganized rather than closed, simply because creditors can squeeze more from a live company than a dead one.
But there can be long delays and uncertainty if various groups of creditors are battling. For countries, there is no bankruptcy law, but they are sure to keep operating. The issues there become losses for creditors and possible damage to the country's economy, financial system and credit standing.
When the airline bailout was rushed through Congress last month, there were fears that much of the airline industry would fail in ways that the bankruptcy system could not handle. Would plunging airline revenues and potentially unlimited liability if there were more terrorist attacks mean that no airline could obtain private financing? What would a collapse of the airline industry do to the economy? Phrased that way, there seemed to be no choice.
But as airlines -- and probably insurers, as well -- receive government assistance, it is important to understand why the Chrysler rescue worked out so well. The biggest part of the answer is that the company was overhauled as part of the package. Workers, suppliers, lenders and dealers all were forced to make sacrifices by a Congress that was reluctant to approve the deal.
"The genius was that when you were done with all the sacrifices, Chrysler was no longer bankrupt," said Robert Barbera, now the chief economist of Hoenig & Company but then a congressional aide involved in shaping the package.
Requiring effective reforms may seem like an obvious step. After all, there are clearly problems that led to the need for action. But in practice, such things are hard to impose and even harder to enforce.
The I.M.F. routinely requires promises of changes when it rescues countries, but the countries rarely keep them all. Then, confronted with the chaos that might result from a default, the I.M.F. often signs a new agreement, providing more money in return for more promises. 
There are often international political reasons it seems unwise to let a country go under. Turkey, for example, is now dealing with an I.M.F. plan that may not be enough. Given its strategic role in the Middle East, the United States no doubt will want to find a way to keep it solvent.
That brings up the issue of "moral hazard." Investors who are confident they will be bailed out are less likely to exercise prudent judgment, and thus increase the need for a bailout. It is easy to promise not to bail out those who made the bad loans, but often harder to live up to those promises in a crisis.
It is also harder when the government is on the hook before the crisis erupts, as was the case in the savings and loan industry. Deposit insurance had been legislated in the 1930's as a way of restoring confidence in the financial system and assuring that small depositors would not be wiped out in bank failures. When the savings and loan institutions got into trouble, the government looked for ways to avoid paying the bill. The stalling tactics ended up giving financial institutions the power to keep gambling with taxpayer money, and made the situation much worse.
The airline bailout legislation provided $5 billion upfront for the industry -- with virtually no strings attached. The quick distribution of much of that money eased the pain for some carriers that were in financial straits before Sept. 11, but did nothing to address the industry's underlying problems.
Now the government is to guarantee up to $10 billion in loans. The Bush administration would like to minimize that, noted Daniel M. Kasper, a managing director of LECG, an economics consulting firm, and is "building in incentives to force carriers that can get other financing onto the commercial market."
But most airlines want the money, and tough choices remain. "Someone now has to make a series of credit judgments," said Henry Kaufman, an economist and money manager.
And the numbers make it more likely that some bailed-out airlines will still fail, particularly if the economy does not recover soon.
If that happens, the government will face the decision of whether to take its losses or provide more guarantees. Budget arithmetic may -- wrongly -- make it appear cheaper to hand out more guarantees, since that would delay having to pay the money.
There are slightly different issues as the government decides how to help insurance companies. Help seems likely because it would hurt the economy if insurers refused to cover terrorism in future policies. And if there are large uninsured losses to terrorist attacks, the government would probably end up picking up the tab anyway.
It is not clear, however, how such aid should be structured. President Bush's plan, which faces some resistance in Congress, has no provision to allow the government to make money if all goes well.
Logically, it makes sense for the government to collect premiums for its insurance, and to price them high enough -- assuming terrorism does not become a common occurrence -- that the industry will soon decide to assume the risk itself.
But that course would imply very high premiums. "Everything they collect goes into the cost of insurance," something that everyone pays, said Laurence Tisch, co-chairman of the Loews Corporation, the parent of CNA Insurance. Those premiums would amount to a tax, one that many would feel they had to pay, given the risk of losing everything. 
Without government premiums, assuring that insurers will not underprice their product -- confident that the penalty will not be failure but a bigger check from Uncle Sam -- may be an issue. In similar ways, it may not be easy to push the airline industry to deal with its pre-Sept. 11 problems while loan guarantees assure no immediate consequences.
Indeed, agreeing to bailouts is often the easiest part. The hard part is getting them to work.

HEADLINE: In a Shift, Muslim Groups Cast Themselves as Loyal Critics 

BYLINE:  By GREG WINTER 

DATELINE: LOS ANGELES, Oct. 24 

 BODY:
Ever since terrorists razed the World Trade Center, Michel Shehadeh says, his tongue has grown sore from biting it so much. He is being only somewhat facetious.
 In speeches at businesses, police departments and schools in recent weeks, Mr. Shehadeh, the West Coast director of the Arab-American Anti-Discrimination Committee, had tiptoed around contentious topics like Israel or Iraq, careful not to enrage the very audiences he was appealing to for tolerance. 
 Then, on Oct. 11, Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani of New York rejected a $10 million gift from a Saudi prince who chastised American foreign policy, and Mr. Shehadeh decided it was time to weigh in on the subjects he tried so hard to avoid.
"It's not politically correct to talk about the grievances people have against the United States," Mr. Shehadeh said. "So we're going out there and trying to fill that vacuum."
Racing to prove their loyalties to the nation, Arab-American and Muslim groups have praised President Bush's handling of the crisis, promised to help the Federal Bureau of Investigation unearth terrorist cells and even circled religious edicts, called fatwas, that cite their right to fight fellow Muslims overseas.
Now, however, many organizations in California and elsewhere say they are shifting gears.
Whether preaching in mosques, lobbying Congress and the Bush administration or debating on nationally televised talk shows, the groups are swiftly returning to the positions they have long held: that military aid to Israel and sanctions against Iraq create the ideal atmosphere for recruiting terrorists.
"We kept quiet on that in the initial stages, not wanting to be seen as insensitive or political opportunists," said Aslam Abdullah, editor of The Minaret, North America's top-selling Muslim magazine, based in Los Angeles.
This month's issue of The Minaret condemned the Sept. 11 attacks and mourned its victims.
The next issue will argue that anti-American sentiment, born of the United States' support for undemocratic governments in Saudi Arabia and Kuwait, is partly to blame for the attacks. 
"People are asking why this is happening," Mr. Abdullah said. "We are telling them."
In a sign of the renewed criticism of American foreign policy, one organization, the Muslim Public Affairs Council, started running advertisements on a Los Angeles radio station last week, saying United States intervention in the Middle East had inflamed anti-American sentiment in the region.
Within minutes of broadcasting the advertisement, the radio station, KNX 1070, was inundated by angry calls, as was the Muslim council. Fearful of a sustained backlash, the council pulled the spots a day later so that they could be toned down. 
The shift in pronouncements is opening deep rifts in a community struggling to present a united -- and, above all, benevolent -- face to the American public. Angered by the suggestion that American policies could provoke terrorist attacks, some Muslim and Arab-American groups are condemning what they call the misguided and irresponsible positions of their peers. 
"The terrorism was the result of a suicide death cult that was hellbent on killing a lot of people," said James J. Zogby, president of the Arab American Institute. "It simply wasn't edifying in the face of the horror and the shock to discuss any of these grievances. There's not a connection." 
Other organizations point out that the Bush administration has already expressed support for an independent Palestinian state, making criticisms of its policies inappropriate, if not inflammatory.
"This is a defining moment for the community," said Aly R. Abuzaakouk, director of the American Muslim Council. "There are issues of concern for our community, and we will get to them. But for now, the country is in crisis, and we need to show our loyalty to it by standing by the administration. We need to build bridges, not break them."
And despite the anti-Muslim hate crimes that appear to have been committed in the nation since Sept. 11, many Muslim and Arab-American groups say they have been most deeply moved by the outpouring of tolerance and openness most Americans have shown, and are wary of alienating the many supporters who have recently come to their defense.
"Of course, we're worried about it," said Sarah Eltantawi, spokeswoman for the Muslim Public Affairs Council in Los Angeles.
Ms. Eltantawi continued: "Bringing up grievances can very easily be misconstrued as justification for terrorism. But you can't think about addressing this problem without talking about human rights in the Middle East." 
For some, taking on American foreign policy means venturing into political territory where they rarely went before. 
Hussam Ayloush, the director of the Arab-American Anti-Discrimination Committee's Southern California chapter, spent most of the year choosing educational books about Islam for local libraries and making sure vendors who claimed to sell kosher food really did. Now Mr. Ayloush is touring churches and college campuses, passing out leaflets and debating international politics with whomever will listen. 
"After the attack," he said, "there was a need for differentiating between Islam as a religion and the terrorist attacks. Now that we've done that, we need to look at how our foreign policy, intentionally or not, breeds frustration among many people.
"It's not a favor we do for the terrorists. It's a favor we do for ourselves."

HEADLINE: European Converts to Laissez Faire See the Rush to Intervene as Heresy 

BYLINE:  By ALAN COWELL with EDMUND L. ANDREWS 

DATELINE: LONDON, Oct. 24 

 BODY:
For decades, the United States' economic prescription to friend and foe was almost a mantra in its consistency: leave it to the market.
 State intervention was out. Subsidies were a nonstarter. Government should be limited, trade should be free, and regulation should be minimal. 
 It was a creed that grated on many, but it found fervent believers in Britain and, as the booming economy seemed to validate the American model, a growing number of grudging supporters across Europe. 
Now, in the wake of the Sept. 11 attacks, the roles have reversed. The United States is spending billions to help airlines and considering billions more for insurance companies. But the European Commission in Brussels has been miserly, if not hostile, toward similar pleas from European companies.
And while the White House and Congress want to jump-start the American economy with new tax breaks and spending, Europe's center-left governments -- most of them locked into the rigorous fiscal constraints of the European single currency -- have thus far avoided similar pump-priming.
On trade, the United States has angered European and Asian leaders by edging toward new antidumping fines on imported steel. And on intellectual property rights, Washington -- after long arguing that patents for AIDS drugs should be sacrosanct in the developing world -- threatened to cast aside Bayer's patent for Cipro to extract a lower price for Americans desperate to have protection against anthrax.
"The Americans had been teaching us the gospel of free markets," said Elie Cohen, a leading economist and adviser to Prime Minister Lionel Jospin of France. "But when it turns out the Americans are facing the same problems, they seem to forget the universal laws of the market."
European leaders know full well that the exceptional events since Sept. 11 call for exceptional measures. But many economists and politicians -- at senior levels and on both the left and right -- say the Bush administration has undermined decades of American preaching just as the sermons were winning converts.
"It's a huge wake-up call about economic policy," said Will Hutton, a prominent British author and chief executive of the Industrial Society, a left-leaning advocacy group in London. "This validates people who have always argued yes to capitalism but no to the concept that all you have to do is let it rip."
Mr. Hutton says the United States seems to be returning to the prescriptions of John Maynard Keynes, the British economist who advocated vigorous public investment and deficit spending in hard times.
And that is exactly what worries conservative European politicians. For years, they have cited the United States as the model for reducing government spending and limiting regulation.
"These are all things that the Americans have been advocating, but now the people who are advocating them are doing things differently," said Hermann Otto Solms, a leader in Germany's pro-business Free Democratic Party. "It is a dangerous influence. The change in direction in the United States is falling on very fertile ground in a negative sense."
Indeed, some Europeans are eager to return to the old ways. Last week, the administrative arm of the European Union, the European Commission, under pressure from politicians and aggrieved airlines, put aside its hostility to government subsidies and allowed Belgium to lend money to its bankrupt airline, Sabena. Switzerland, which is not a member of the union, did the same, providing $1.5 billion to bail out Swissair.
Even Britain, a free-market cheerleader, moved this month to, in effect, renationalize Railtrack, the rail infrastructure company.
But Europeans have also been amazed at the United States' willingness to turn to government subsidies and corporate tax giveaways that were once denounced by free market Republicans.
"You have the Bush government putting money into private companies," said Mr. Cohen, in Paris. "From a European perspective, that is quite surprising."
In this role reversal, the most adamant opponent of pump-priming has turned out to be Chancellor Gerhard Schroder in Germany, who controls a center-left government consisting of the Social Democratic Party and the Green Party.
Mr. Schroder has come under enormous pressure to relax Germany's commitment to achieving a balanced budget in the next few years. German economic growth has come to a complete stop, and forecasters expect nothing more than a meager recovery next year.
Yet Mr. Schroder has rejected pleas for emergency programs.
"The irony is that you have a red-green government in Germany trying to uphold fiscal virtue," said Thomas Mayer, a senior economist at Goldman Sachs in Frankfurt, "while in the United States the Republicans are very comfortable with a large fiscal stimulus."
European business leaders are acutely aware that it took them years to win support for free market changes, most of them driven by the European Commission and resisted by national governments. These include the privatization of government-owned airlines, utilities and manufacturing companies; the elimination of trade barriers within Europe; and a steep reduction in government subsidies for business.
Karl-Heinz Neumeister, secretary general of the Association of European Airlines, said the European Commission had allowed very little airline aid after Sept. 11 because it feared that governments would revert to old habits of pouring billions into moribund national carriers. "It was only two years ago that they said they did not want to subsidize airlines," Mr. Neumeister said. "They are afraid of falling back now."
Perhaps the biggest debate now raging through Europe is whether to imitate the United States by using fiscal and monetary policy to try to spark an economic recovery. Big spending programs or new tax cuts are difficult because all 12 countries that adopted the euro as their currency are supposed to keep their budget deficits low and strive for balanced budgets within a few years.
But with growth slowing and unemployment rising, many leaders are pushing to relax the requirements.
In France, Mr. Jospin has floated a package of small tax cuts. It is a modest plan, but it goes against the stability pact that holds countries in the euro zone to strict fiscal discipline. 
In Germany, five economic research institutes that advise the government argued on Tuesday that the country should relax its adherence to the stability pact by accelerating tax cuts and certain spending programs. Mr. Schroder rejected the advice, but no one knows if he will for much longer.
Britain, which has not adopted the euro, has been wrestling with similar issues. When Gordon Brown, chancellor of the exchequer, recently unveiled plans for public spending to upgrade the country's creaking health and education services, he courted international and domestic criticism of the plans as inflationary.
One of the most startling shifts in American attitudes since Sept. 11 has been toward pharmaceutical patents. The United States and other Western nations have adamantly supported the rights of drug companies, which contend that they need years of exclusive rights to recoup vast research and development outlays. That has led to years of passionate debates in nations like Brazil and South Africa, where patented drugs are seen as just too expensive for most victims facing AIDS and other life-threatening illnesses.
Yet this week, as the number of anthrax attacks mounted, the White House abruptly warned Bayer that it might declare an emergency override of the company's Cipro patent unless it lowered the price. Bayer, which charges pharmacies more than $4 a tablet, reached an agreement today with the government on a price of just under $1 each.
That move came right after Bayer agreed to give the Canadian government a similarly low price to keep Canada from buying supplies from a generic manufacturer.
To people who have quietly sided for years with poorer countries that fought to escape the high prices allowed by patents, both moves seem cynical.
"Here you have a health emergency in Canada and you override the patent when people have been telling developing countries not to do this," said Sophia Tickell, an official of Oxfam, a British charity. "What this has highlighted is that there's massive potential for double standards."

Catastrophe bonds could fill the gaps in reinsurance.

BYLINE:  By Hal R. Varian; This column appears here every Thursday. Hal R. Varian is an economics professor and dean of the School of Information Management and Systems at the University of California at Berkeley. E-mail: hal@sims.berkeley.edu.

 BODY:
THE insurance industry faces claims of at least $40 billion tied to the World Trade Center attacks, and it remains exposed to significant risk from future incidents. Retail insurance companies are considering exclusions for terrorist damage, leaving property owners unable to buy the coverage they need.
 The problem lies in the reinsurance industry, the wholesale market where insurers lay off large risks to pools of investors willing to absorb them. Warren E. Buffett's reinsurance company, General Re, has done well in the last few years offering property reinsurance because there have not been major hurricanes or earthquakes. But its luck ran out last month: General Re has said it is liable for over $2 billion of the total industry losses in the Sept. 11 attacks. 
 Earthquakes and hurricanes, unpleasant as they are, present manageable risks: insurers know roughly how often they occur in various places, what their likely magnitudes are and how much property damage might be expected.
Terrorist risk is much harder to quantify, leading to the current paralysis in the reinsurance market. The insurance industry has been lobbying in Washington to make the federal government the insurer of last resort against terrorism, which means that taxpayers will end up bearing the financial risk of future attacks.
Britain adopted a government-backed reinsurance market several years ago and, so far, it has worked reasonably well. But there is another way to supplement traditional reinsurance markets that has been attracting increasing attention: catastrophe bonds. These bonds, generally sold to large institutions, have typically been tied to natural disasters, like earthquakes or hurricanes, but they could, in principle, be used to provide financial backing for terrorism insurance.
Here is how they work. A financial intermediary, like a reinsurance company or an investment bank, issues a bond tied to a particular insurable event, like a Los Angeles earthquake. If there is no earthquake, investors are paid a generous interest rate. But if the earthquake occurs and the claims exceed an amount specified in the bond, investors sacrifice their principal and interest.
How generous does the interest rate have to be? That is left up to the market. If the bond sales offer cheaper reinsurance coverage than do traditional private placements used in the reinsurance market, these bonds, known as cat bonds, are a preferred method of finance.
Cat bonds are a form of "contingent security," a concept first formulated by Kenneth J. Arrow of Stanford University, winner of the 1972 Nobel in economic science. 
Back in 1952, Professor Arrow came up with the idea of a security that would pay a fixed amount of money depending on whether or not some event occurred. He showed that portfolios of such contingent securities could be used to allocate virtually any kind of risk in an efficient manner.
The analysis by Professor Arrow was long thought to be of only theoretical interest. But it turned out that all sorts of options and other derivatives could be best understood using contingent securities. Now Wall Street rocket scientists draw on this 50-year-old work when creating exotic new derivatives.
There are a number of special cases of contingent securities. Consider a security tied to my house burning down. This would certainly affect my net worth, but would have negligible impact on the owners of the other 70 million housing units in the United States.
This kind of personal risk can easily be shared among many people, each paying only a small amount if the event occurs, and homeowners insurance is to ease this kind of risk sharing.
This works fine for small independent risks, but there are other sorts of events that impose large costs on many people at the same time, like earthquakes or hurricanes. Insurance companies are able to deal with such events using reinsurance markets, where the risk is transferred to large investors.
There are other financial institutions that also allow for risk transfer for this sort of widespread risk. The orange juice futures market in Chicago is essentially a market in a contingent security tied to whether it freezes in Orlando, Fla.
A futures market allows market participants who bear a significant risk (like farmers worried that their crop might be destroyed) to transfer some of that risk to others, who are, of course, paid to absorb it. The futures market allows shifting of risk rather than a simple sharing of risk.
Risk sharing and risk shifting are familiar terms, but there is another phenomenon worth noting, something I like to call "risk shafting." This is when some risk -- often a particularly large risk -- is transferred to a third party who is forced to bear it involuntarily.
In many cases, these third parties are taxpayers, who are not even aware of their potential liability.
Hence the debate that is going on in Washington now: should the insurance industry be able to transfer the risk from future terrorist attacks to taxpayers? Or would it be better to use existing reinsurance markets or new financial instruments like catastrophe bonds to shift the risk to those willing and able to bear it if appropriately compensated?
Cat bonds have some attractive features. They can spread risks widely and can be subdivided indefinitely, allowing each investor to bear only a small part of the risk. The money backing up the insurance is paid in advance, so there is no default risk to the insured.
As the market for cat bonds matures, secondary markets may develop, particularly if the bonds become standardized and bundled into portfolios. If so, the market price of cat bonds will reflect the market perceptions of the likelihood of the event associated with the bond, just as price changes on the orange juice futures market reflect the likelihood of a freeze in Florida.
The market for cat bonds is still immature, and is only a fraction of the size of traditional reinsurance. But cat bonds and other sorts of contingent securities may well end up being part of the long-run solution to the problems of the reinsurance industry.

Equities Rise on Reports From Technology Companies

BYLINE:  By Reuters

 BODY:
Stocks rose yesterday as investors looked past gloomy forecasts from the blue-chip icons Eastman Kodak and AT&T, and focused on better-than-expected results from technology companies.
 Kodak and AT&T both warned that the weakening United States economy would bite into future results, causing a slide in their stock prices -- with Kodak hitting a low unseen since 1985. On the plus side, the software maker Citrix Systems bolstered hopes after reporting profits that beat analysts' forecasts and predicting strong sales growth. 
 Wall Streeters are expecting that the Federal Reserve's nine interest-rate cuts, along with a $100 billion fiscal stimulus package working its way through Congress, will help corporate America get back on its feet.
"I'm seeing companies' numbers come in a penny or two above expectations -- especially in the tech names," said Lynda Calkin, a money manager for Westwood Management, which oversees $4 billion. "Earnings were revised down to what companies can actually show, stocks have corrected substantially and we're looking at the greatest infusion of liquidity -- both fiscal and monetary --we've seen in years."
Wall Street is proving resilient to jitters over anthrax scares and continued fighting in Afghanistan. The market has dipped every time new cases of the potentially deadly disease were discovered, but it has always clambered back. 
The technology-laden Nasdaq composite index rose 27.10 points, or 1.6 percent, to 1,731.54. The Dow Jones industrial average gained 5.54 points, to 9,345.62. Together, Kodak and AT&T sliced 33 points off the Dow.
The broader Standard & Poor's 500-stock index inched up 0.42 point, to 1,085.20.
Kodak tumbled $3.46, to $30.71, after it warned that its profit would fall short of Wall Street's estimates on slack demand for its film and camera products in a lagging economy.
AT&T's stock fell $1.36, to $16.34, after it reported a sharp drop in profits and warning economic softness and stiff competition would hurt its core telephone business through 2002. Lehman Brothers cut its investment rating on the stock.

HEADLINE: Time Runs Out on Welfare 

 BODY:
About 50,000 New York families will reach the five-year federal limit for cash welfare benefits in December, and become eligible for a last-ditch state safety net. At a time when America is being battered by a slowing economy and terrorist scares, the state is in a poor position to do an in-depth screening of all these cases. The best approach, for both the government and the families, is to make the short-term transition as easy as possible. 
 New York is one of a few states whose constitutions require them to take care of poor families after federal welfare benefits have expired. The program covers rent and utilities, along with a small cash payment. Even legislators who wrote the state welfare law thought people who reached the limit would be transferred automatically to state benefits that are meant to keep the poorest citizens from going hungry or losing their homes. Instead, state welfare officials have ordered recipients to apply for safety-net funds in person, suggesting that those who do not pass muster will be penalized. 
 The state sees this as an innocuous process in which welfare recipients fill out a simple application. But people almost always fall out of the computers when they are required to reapply for eligibility. And this is not a good time to herd tens of thousands of people into welfare offices, while the system is jammed with New Yorkers who are applying for help in an economic downturn.
The state should move welfare recipients onto the safety net right away and sort out issues of long-term eligibility carefully at a later date. That could be taken care of during the twice-yearly recertification sessions that welfare recipients are already required to attend.
The 50,000 families that will hit the five-year time limit in December are difficult cases. More than 50 percent have been continuously on welfare for 10 years or more, suggesting deep-seated problems that make them tough candidates for job placement. If their benefits are cut off even temporarily, many are likely to fall into homelessness. 
Most of the families at risk live in New York City, where the terrorist attack damaged the computer network that manages welfare, Medicaid and food stamp cases, slowing down the system. The confusion is bound to get worse as the economy declines and more people apply for services.
The state has a great deal to be proud of in the way it has carried out welfare reform. Right now it needs to take care not to place its most vulnerable citizens at risk. New York has enough to worry about without creating trauma unnecessarily.

HEADLINE: A NATION CHALLENGED: THE ECONOMY; 
Divided House Approves Economic Recovery Plan

BYLINE:  By RICHARD W. STEVENSON 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Oct. 24 

 BODY:
Saying business tax breaks are the best way to preserve jobs and revive the economy, Republicans muscled their version of an economic recovery plan through the House today, brushing aside criticism from Democrats that the bill did too little for the unemployed and other people who need help the most.
 The vote was 216 to 214. Seven Republicans voted against the bill. Three Democrats voted for it. 
 The narrow margin of victory reflected an intense, often bitter partisan debate on the House floor over how best to encourage recovery from a downturn that began a year ago and intensified after the terrorist attacks last month.
It also suggested that many of the House bill's provisions were likely to be stripped out or scaled back in the Senate, which is controlled by Democrats. Efforts to negotiate a compromise in the Senate have been faltering, all but ending hopes expressed by both sides of getting a bill signed into law quickly at a time when layoffs are mounting, corporate profits are withering and consumer and investor confidence is fragile.
The House legislation's centerpiece is a package of corporate tax cuts that would total more than $70 billion this year. The bill also includes $28 billion in tax cuts for individuals -- including one-time payments of $600 to couples and $300 to single people whose incomes were too low to receive rebate checks under the tax bill signed into law by President Bush this year -- and $12 billion to help states bolster programs for people who have lost jobs.
Under pressure from Democrats to explain their focus on companies rather than individuals, Republicans said that assisting corporations would help avert further layoffs and lay the groundwork for an economic rebound by encouraging companies to invest more in new equipment and factories. 
"Something very important has gotten lost in the furious slinging of accusations over who benefits from the business components of this bill," said Representative Bill Thomas of California, the main author of the Republican plan. "And that is the plain fact that businesses are America's employers. They're the hardware store, the diner down the street, the gas station on the corner. They're not the enemy of working families."
Democrats said the Republican plan benefited big companies at the expense of working people and those who have lost jobs, and would do little to help the economy pull out of the economic downturn.
Most of the benefits of the business tax cuts would go not to small businesses but to a relative handful of big corporations, Democrats said. The tax cuts for individuals, they said, were skewed to middle- and upper-income people. And Democrats said the provisions in the bill to help states deal with surging unemployment were woefully inadequate.
"This bill is a giant tax giveaway to corporations and the wealthy," said Representative Richard A. Gephardt of Missouri, the Democratic leader in the House.
Democrats attacked a provision that would repeal the corporate alternative minimum tax, which was created in 1986 to make sure that companies could not escape paying income taxes through use of deductions. The bill would not only end the tax, but in effect allow companies to claim refunds of the tax back to 1986.
The repeal of the tax and the refunds would total $25.4 billion this year. According to the nonpartisan Congressional Research Service, seven corporations would receive $3.3 billion of the $25.4 billion. Among them are I.B.M., which could receive $1.4 billion, General Motors, which could receive $832 million, and General Electric, which could get $671 million.
The White House said it strongly supported the bill, and Mr. Bush reiterated his case today for an emphasis on tax cuts -- including repeal of the corporate minimum tax -- in assembling a recovery plan.
"Part of the war we fight is to make sure that our economy continues to grow," Mr. Bush said in a speech to employees of a printing company in Maryland.
But even as the House was debating the legislation, Treasury Secretary Paul H. O'Neill was huddled with lawmakers in the Capitol trying to revive bipartisan negotiations in the Senate that would almost certainly jettison a number of the provisions in the House bill.
Last week, Mr. O'Neill called the House bill "show business," saying it was in part an effort by Republicans to put themselves on record supporting measures that they knew were unlikely to make it into law.
In addition to repealing the corporate minimum tax, the House bill would encourage businesses to spend more money in new equipment, machinery and factories by creating a tax break for capital investment. The bill would allow companies to write off immediately 30 percent of the cost of any such investments for the next three years. It would total $39.3 billion this year.
The bill would also extend, to five years from two years, the period in which companies can offset tax bills from previous years with a portion of their current losses. The provision is valued at $4.7 billion this year.
The bill includes a provision supported by both parties to give rebates to about 34 million households that did not qualify for the first round of rebate checks sent over the summer. The checks went only to people who earned enough to pay federal income taxes. The new round of checks would total $13.7 billion.
The House plan would also accelerate the planned reduction in the 27 percent income tax rate, which is paid by single people starting at about $27,000 and by couples at about $45,000. Under the bill, the 27 percent rate would drop next year to 25 percent, four years ahead of schedule.
The House bill would reduce the top rate on long-term capital gains to 18 percent from 20 percent by eliminating the requirement that stocks and other assets be held for five years before qualifying for the 18 percent rate. Under current law, assets held at least one year but less than five years are taxed at the 20 percent rate; under the terms of the House bill, assets held for one year would qualify for the 18 percent rate.
Democrats said the legislation was a grab-bag of provisions sought by special interests and pushed by Republicans for years. They said it would do little to revive the economy in the short run, and would threaten fiscal health in the long run.
"This bill pretty much leaves laid-off workers and their families to fend for themselves," said Representative Martin Frost, Democrat of Texas.
Republicans defended their approach as balanced and prudent, saying Democrats were offering nothing but a discredited reliance on increased government spending to address the economy's ills.

HEADLINE: Insurance Rates Are Rising Sharply Across U.S. 

BYLINE:  By JOSEPH B. TREASTER 

 BODY:
The terrorist attacks on the World Trade Center and the Pentagon have triggered steep increases in insurance prices across the nation, raising costs for small businesses, factories, farms, homeowners and drivers, as well as large corporations. 
 Far from being limited to cities and companies that seem most vulnerable, the rising rates are reaching into the quietest, most remote areas of the country. At the same time, the demand for insurance has soared. 
 "The insurance companies have just taken a big hit and, to recoup, they have to raise prices for people in Santa Barbara and Oshkosh, Wis., and Tillamook, Ore., and everywhere else in the country," said Tom Caesar, an owner of Caesar & Seider, a commercial insurance broker in Santa Barbara, Calif. "The fact that people want more coverage is only making matters worse, as far as prices go." 
The increased rates stand as a vivid and direct example of how the attacks have raised the costs of living and doing business, often in ways only indirectly related to terrorism. 
Rates are rising high enough that investors are seeking to take advantage of the insurance industry's growth potential. Yesterday, two investment firms announced plans to invest $750 million in the Arch Capital Group, an insurer based in Bermuda. Investors are working on at least a dozen more deals. 
The higher insurance prices are taking effect immediately for many commercial customers as, toward the end of the year, renewals come up. Increases, far from uniform, are in many cases extreme. Customers considered the most likely to file claims -- based more on their records and their perceived riskiness than on the terrorism threat -- face the highest increases. 
Premiums have doubled, for example, for one poultry farm in Missouri. A heavy equipment manufacturer in California received the same shock; its umbrella liability coverage bill doubled to $8 million. 
A plastics maker in Lansing, Mich., paid $388,000 for workers' compensation coverage, up from $240,000, while a manufacturer of prefabricated houses north of Detroit paid $185,000 for property coverage that last year cost $50,000. "Prices are going through the roof," said Damian Testa, a division president of Kaye Insurance Associates, a regional broker in New York.
With less capital and more demand, the insurers are also rationing coverage. Many are providing full coverage to only the least-risky customers, offering others lower coverage limits, higher deductibles or prices they know are likely to be unacceptable.
Of all businesses, the airlines have been hit the hardest. "They're looking at total coverage costs of $4 or $5 a ticket as opposed to $1 or $2 before the attacks," said Grahame Chilton, chief executive of the Benfield Group, an international insurance broker in London. Analysts say the costs are being passed on to airline passengers.
People who live in co-op apartments and condominiums, which are covered by commercial insurance contracts, are already starting to pay significantly more. Mr. Caesar said that a town-house condominium in Newberry Park, Calif., north of Los Angeles, paid 40 percent more for $30 million in coverage when it renewed last week.
But, partly because of tighter regulation, increases in the cost of insuring houses and cars are expected to be less pronounced, as they are gradually imposed over the next year. Economists and analysts say the attacks could add 2 percent to 4 percent to homeowner insurance bills, and probably less for drivers.
But prices for home and auto coverage had already been expected to rise this year, by an average of at least 6 percent, up from 3 percent last year. 
While apartments towers will cost more to insure, in the New York area and across the nation, residential coverage is also likely to rise sharply where insurers, and their customers, face the greatest risks from causes apart from terrorism. 
The increases are likely to be among the largest in Florida and California, where hurricane and earthquake coverage is sold separately from general coverage on houses, said Robert Hartwig, chief economist for the Insurance Information Institute, a trade group. This additional coverage relies heavily on reinsurers, who share major risks with retail insurers. But because the reinsurers are likely to bear so much of the costs from Sept. 11, they have become much more cautious.
The rate increases result from the $40 billion in losses that insurers expect to suffer from the terrorist attacks, their worst losses ever. Most, though not all, insurers can cover their costs from last month's attacks. But some doubt they could sustain another huge round of losses. Insurers say they can continue to provide terrorism coverage only if Congress limits their potential losses.
Many corporate customers now need to patch together coverage from several insurers. The managers of a huge metal processing company in the South that has had some big claims was told last week, for example, that the insurer providing $1 billion in coverage would sell them just $10 million next year. 
"We're going to have to scramble to get them coverage," said Stan Loar, the chief executive of Woodruff-Sawyer & Company, a broker in San Francisco. "It's going to take 15 to 20 companies to get what they bought from one company last year." He expects his client's annual premiums to double, to $3 million.
Companies wanting added coverage are also in a squeeze. A maker of computer equipment in Silicon Valley, worried that a terrorist attack might disrupt its flow of supplies, doubled its business interruption coverage to $10 million, Mr. Loar said. Usually, he said, the premium for the second $5 million would be lower. But now, the insurer is charging $35,000 for the added coverage, on top of an initial premium of $22,000. 
Commercial insurance costs had already been expected to rise 10 percent to 20 percent, at least, in part because of lower investment returns. 
Some brokers say rates will probably increase again as most businesses renew their policies in January. "Premiums for some coverages will probably go up 200 percent or 300 percent next year," said David M. Lockton, chief executive of the Lockton Companies, a commercial insurance broker in Kansas City, Mo. 
Among some businesses, desperation has set in. Tarragon Realty Investors, based in New York, owns 85 apartment complexes around the nation. Usually, Tarragon shops around for the best insurance prices. 
But after the attacks, Bette Slowther, who buys Tarragon's coverage, heard that more than half the insurers that cover apartment buildings had quit of the market. "The insurance companies are looking very carefully at what they write," she said, "and deciding they are not going to take as many chances."
When her present insurer, Royal Specialty, offered to renew her $2 million premium at a 25 percent increase, with the same $10,000 deductible, she jumped at it. She worried that if she hesitated, Royal Specialty might change its mind. "Then we might not have any insurance at all," she said. "Or we might end up with hundreds of thousands in deductibles or a price increase of 40 percent or 50 percent."
But her worries are not over. The companies that have been selling Tarragon coverage for employee lawsuits and general liability have told her they will not be renewing. The alternatives? "I'm hearing as much as 100 percent increases," Ms. Slowther said.

HEADLINE: A NATION CHALLENGED: THE MAYORS; 
Cities Seek Millions in Crisis Aid

BYLINE:  By ELIZABETH BECKER 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Oct. 24 

 BODY:
Mayors meeting in Washington said today that they were asking the Bush administration for millions of dollars to help pay for the emergency and policing responsibilities thrust on them since Sept. 11. 
 At the start of a two-day security meeting here, the mayors said they were upset that despite the heroic example of Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani and New York's police and firefighters, the administration was giving less than $500 million of its $10 billion terrorism budget to local governments, and most of that was going to the states, not the cities. 
 "The airlines have been given billions of dollars of help but the cities have been asked to pick up all of their costs," Mayor John Street of Philadelphia said. 
The mayors also want money to improve security at airports, railways, roads and seaports, projects that could stimulate their economies.
According to a draft plan to be presented on Thursday to Tom Ridge, director of the Office of Homeland Security, the mayors are asking for money for command and control centers, disaster coordinators, protective gear and training. 
"We don't mind if the big dogs eat first," Mayor Marc Morial of New Orleans, president of the United States Conference of Mayors, said, "but we do mind if they eat it all." 
The mayors said they were rankled at being on the bottom rung in the intelligence world. They have been told to put their cities on alert without being told why. They only recently got access to the Federal Bureau of Investigation watch list of people the authorities want to question about terrorism. "We're the ones in charge of the 650,000 police officers in this country but we know so little about the suspects that we could stop one for a traffic violation and not know who he was," Mayor Martin O'Malley of Baltimore said. 
Robert S. Mueller III, the bureau's director, said he found "many of the concerns are valid."
"You have my commitment to better the communication between mayors and federal law enforcement," Mr. Mueller said in an address this morning.
Throughout the day, the mayors recited the expenses their budgets have had to absorb since Sept. 11: $5,000 moon suits, $25,000 night-vision goggles and tens of thousands of dollars of police overtime.
Nearly every speaker underlined the burden of the city's role of "first responder" to any disaster. 
"This is what it has meant to be a first-responder in the last few weeks and check out one anthrax scare," Mayor Sheila Young of San Leandro, Calif., a city of 75,000, said. "You have to send in 30 personnel, including police officers and members of an entire fire engine company, all of whom have to wear a hazmat suit that costs us $4,000 apiece."

HEADLINE: Sears to Cut Jobs and Revamp Stores 

BYLINE:  Bloomberg News

DATELINE: HOFFMAN ESTATES, Ill., Oct. 24 

 BODY:
Sears, Roebuck will cut 4,900 jobs, or 22 percent of its salaried workers, and overhaul its stores to compete with discount chains like Wal-Mart Stores and Target.
 "We've been a department store," the company's chief executive, Alan J. Lacy, told analysts and investors at a meeting today in Chicago, and "don't want to do that anymore." 
The changes will include central checkout areas and more self-service displays. 
 Sears also posted a 5.8 percent decline in third-quarter profit.
Mr. Lacy is trying to win back shoppers from discounters, which speed purchases with features like an array of cash registers at the exit. Sears shares have risen 30 percent the last year on optimism that Mr. Lacy, who turned around Sears's credit business before becoming chief executive a year ago, will revamp stores and lower expenses.

HEADLINE: CANTV Shareholders Approve Buyback of Stock 

BYLINE:  By SIMON ROMERO

 BODY:
The shareholders of Venezuela's largest telecommunications company approved a share buyback and dividend yesterday in the latest chapter of a takeover battle involving two prominent American companies, the AES Corporation and Verizon Communications.
 The shareholders of C.A. Nacional Telefonos de Venezuela, or CANTV, agreed to management's plan to repurchase 15 percent of the company's stock for $30 a share. 
Shareholders also agreed to a dividend of about $550 million to be paid in two installments. 
 The approval of these moves by shareholders increases pressure on AES, a power company based in Arlington, Va., that is one of CANTV's largest minority shareholders. AES is seeking to wrest control of CANTV through a hostile bid of $24 for each American depository share in the Venezuelan company. 
CANTV's A.D.R.'s, which trade in New York and represent stock in the company, climbed 9 cents yesterday to close at $23.16.
Some investors said yesterday that they expect AES to raise its bid for CANTV, although perhaps only by a dollar or two. Officials from AES could not be reached for comment. AES said in a statement yesterday that it preferred a larger dividend from CANTV, of about $845 million, but this proposal was rejected. 
The dispute among AES and the foreign concerns that are CANTV's largest shareholders, Verizon and Telefonica of Spain, is one of Latin America's most publicized takeover battles. The region has mostly been spared visible shareholder disputes until recently.
In Brazil, Latin America's largest economy, a similar squabble has unfolded in which Telecom Italia is disagreeing with the Opportunity financial group over strategy and control of Brasil Telecom, a telecommunications company.

HEADLINE: Lernout Is Declared Insolvent 

BYLINE:  By PAUL MELLER 

DATELINE: BRUSSELS, Oct. 24 

 BODY:
Lernout & Hauspie Speech Products, the once highflying software company brought low by an accounting scandal and management turmoil, was declared insolvent today by a court in Ypres, Belgium, where it is based. The court appointed five liquidators to dispose of the company's Belgian assets.
 The company had asked the court on Monday for a two-month extension of Chapter 11-like protection from creditors -- enough time, it said, for an orderly sale of its eight remaining divisions, a request the court denied today. 
 "The debts of the company total around 520 million euros," Wim Orbie, the clerk of the court, said. "The sale of assets wouldn't even reach 25 million euros," or about $22.3 million. 
A number of prospective bidders for pieces of Lernout have stepped forward in recent days. Over the weekend, a voice technology maker, SpeechWorks International of Boston, offered just more than $12 million for a large chunk of Lernout's core speech and language technology business. MedQuist, based in Marlton, N.J., was the high bidder for Lernout's medical division at an auction in New York on Monday, offering $25 million.
A Lernout employee said another bidder for the core businesses appeared on the scene today, promising to save up to 300 jobs, but the employee did not name the bidder.
Meanwhile, Janet and James Baker, the founders of Dragon Systems, a Newton, Mass., speech recognition company that Lernout acquired last year for stock that is now worthless, were said to be looking into retrieving Dragon and possibly buying other parts of Lernout, The Boston Globe reported.
"It is up to the liquidators to continue these discussions," Mr. Orbie said of possible asset sales. They will also have to sort out Lernout's legal status in the United States, where the company still has Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection. "That could be a problem," Mr. Orbie said. The liquidators were not available for comment.
Lernout's chief executive, Philippe Bodson, told Belgian reporters that he thought the court's verdict was harsh. Neither he nor the company's press officers were available for comment after the ruling, which came late in the day.
The Ypres commercial court's ruling contradicts one it made last month extending Lernout's bankruptcy protection until next June. The company appealed that decision, saying the conditions attached to the extension were too strict. 
Specifically, the court required that at least 80 percent of proceeds from asset sales be set aside to pay creditors' claims rather than finance the company's efforts to reorganize. And it demanded that the company's core businesses be disposed of in a way that guaranteed long-term economic activity and substantial employment in Belgium.
Last Thursday, a court in nearby Ghent threw out the company's appeal and lifted its bankruptcy protection in Belgium. Lernout tried to forestall immediate insolvency by reapplying for protection in the Ypres court.
Explaining the court's change of mind, Mr. Orbie said: "A lot has happened since we last granted the company protection. The Ghent court ruled in the meantime that conditions cannot be attached to the granting of bankruptcy protection."
Lernout began to unravel when a $100 million cash shortfall was discovered in its South Korean unit last summer. An investigation uncovered accounting irregularities throughout the company that had overstated sales by $373 million from 1998 to 2000.
The company's founders, Jo Lernout and Pol Hauspie, were arrested by Belgian authorities in April, and were among four top executives charged with falsifying accounts and stock manipulation. The cases against the executives are awaiting trial. Neither is now associated with the company, though both hold stock in it.

HEADLINE: With the World Redesigned, What Role for Designers? 

BYLINE:  By WILLIAM L. HAMILTON 

 BODY:
FOR the last two years, the field of design has enjoyed the popularity of a professional lifetime. It has appeared on the covers of Time and Business Week, its now famous figures profiled on Ted Koppel's "Nightline" and Charlie Rose. Annual awards were created, and new design-related publications proliferated. 
 With its titanium coating and colored gels, design was, literally, the bright surface of economic success, the gleam in the eye of a public eager to play with the products of prosperity, from Target teakettles to iMacs. 
 In light of last month's events, design's sharp flash, as a mirror of public mood, has started to reflect a different picture -- a view of an altered world, pocked by new realities. But design's traditional talent -- to pose then to solve problems -- could give it a role in leading the national recovery, emotionally and economically. 
On Oct. 17, seven accomplished designers were presented with the Chrysler Design Awards, prestigious annual prizes for innovation and achievement in various disciplines of design.
That afternoon, the editors and reporters of House & Home invited them to sit and to discuss their responses to Sept. 11 and to the situations of the last six weeks. Can -- and should -- design play an important part? And how? 
This year's award winners included Robert Mangurian and Mary-Ann Ray, architects whose company, Studio Works in Los Angeles, is working with the Los Angeles Unified School District on high school design that could defuse the battle-like presence of high-security measures.
Susan Kare, an interface graphic designer in San Francisco, is known for the family of desktop icons produced for Apple, including the wristwatch whose hands spin as a task is performed -- work that has become a humorous, reassuring standard for personal computing software.
Stefan Sagmeister, a graphic designer based in New York, is well known for iconoclastic rock music packaging for clients like the Rolling Stones.
Kathryn Gustafson, a landscape architect in Seattle, creates meditative integrations of structure and nature, like the Arthur Ross Terrace for the Rose Center for Earth and Space in New York.
Daniel Rozin is a new-media artist working as director of research at New York University's Interactive Telecommunications Program at the Tisch School of the Arts, to transform complex digital technologies into humanistic crafts that engage the imagination.
Thom Mayne is an architect in Santa Monica, Calif., whose company, Morphosis, is presently designing a federal courthouse in Eugene, Ore. He has proposed a glass box for the project that will, he hopes, transcend with optimistic transparence a fortress-like future that may now seem inevitable in the construction of government buildings.
Also participating in the round table were Paula Scher, a graphic designer at Pentagram in New York; David Kelley, an industrial designer and founder of Ideo in Palo Alto, Calif., whose resume includes the Palm V and the Apple mouse; John Hockenberry, an NBC News correspondent and design writer; Patrick Best, an industrial design student; Steven Heller, art director of The New York Times Book Review and the author of 80 books on design; and Phil Patton and Chee Pearlman, who write for House & Home.
Several days later, several designers also responded with actual designs -- ultimately, what designers do when called to answer. Ms. Scher created a pin that is part flag, part memorial in its graphic symbol. Mr. Sagmeister's proposal for Cipro, right, facilitates its correct use in an emergency by incorporating instructions into the packaging itself. He is also at work on a pin, "A Heart (Unbreakable)," stamped from metal from the rubble of the World Trade Center.
As Ms. Kare wrote in a follow-up note, "When times are confusing, it's more important than ever to produce images of clarity and simplicity."

Q: How might design participate now, in the national effort at recovery and reassurance?

STEFAN SAGMEISTER: After the 11th, I felt fairly useless. I would make a really bad fireman or rescue worker. What can one do? What we're working on right now is a pin. Sort of like a personal memorial.

PAULA SCHER: There's going to be a lot of involvement between design and the city -- because they're married. New York City is a design city -- designers will be involved. We're going to rebuild a whole section of town. Which is what designers do -- they make things.

JOHN HOCKENBERRY: It's a city that functions because essential information is communicated to large numbers of people very, very quickly, which is what the signage is about. I think design is, in many ways, a language in which we will understand the aftermath of Sept. 11. There's been an excavation of the function of the city through these events: the image of Con Ed, of the firemen. It's a kind of a beginning to redefine and to reconnect with all these kinds of institutions. And designers will be leading that task.

Q: Should designers be reassessing what they do?

ROBERT MANGURIAN: In the last 10 years, the computer information industry turned the economy into a revved-up, hyped-up machine that is producing endless numbers of extremely well-designed objects. But new things keep the economy rolling. So it's problematic. If you design a perfectly good chair, it really could last forever. Which puts designers out of business. And puts chair makers out of business too.

Q: Should this be seen as a call for designers to be more socially responsible then?

THOM MAYNE: Architecture over the last 20 years has been somewhat aloof from its social tasks. For me it's not at all an issue of responding instantly to this event. It's meaningless -- it's like the flags going out. I find them actually quite disturbing -- somehow kind of intentionally not allowing us to understand the kind of deeper meaning of this. I think in architecture, hopefully, that it's going to force us to, as a community, re-look at our work. Kind of interesting it's taking place in the beginning of a new century.

MARY-ANN RAY: If we have to make do with less, how do we as designers operate in that situation? We travel to other countries that don't have the kind of means that we have, the kind of invention and design. But just on the street, the way things are made have a kind of wisdom.

MANGURIAN: We saw a great thing in Tunisia, at an archaeological site. A person there -- he had a plastic bottle, like any good yuppie would have, walking around drinking his water. But on the plastic bottle was a sock. And every once in a while the sock would get dipped in water, which would chill the water down in here 15 degrees.

RAY: Through evaporative cooling. Basically it was the terra-cotta vessel they've always used.

MANGURIAN: There's nothing to sell. It's a problem. (Laughter.)

SCHER: I didn't feel powerless. The thing that just kept coming to my mind was, design matters. Because what surrounds you -- happiness, love, joy -- that gets into your soul. We create environments for people. We create things that make their soul, hopefully.

MAYNE: It's radically different from my colleagues in Europe. Like all American architects, we've grown up in the private sector. You either support work in the private sector, or you resist it. I'm 57 years old. At 55 you supposedly arrive. You start getting the public work that my pals in Europe get when they're 35. You can do schools and buildings and universities and courthouses. It takes you that long, to get to the point of even dealing with public as an idea or civic as an idea.

Q: Should the public demand, or should designers provide, responsible design then?

SCHER: Both. There's been too much information that's speeded up, so that there's no collective understanding. Part of what's happened to us was a result of a whole nation not paying attention, because they were looking someplace else -- because of the way information is designed. I think that graphic designers have a responsibility both to their client and their public to enable them to understand what they're looking at when they read information -- what the structure of the information is. The New York Times is organized a specific way, and specific things appear in certain sections. Something on Page 3 -- is that necessarily less important? The public has to be informed as to the devices.

HOCKENBERRY: The lifeblood of discourse -- whether you're a storyteller, or a television guy or a designer -- is the shared experience of a community. And one of the impacts of consumer culture is to reduce the amount of shared experience. Without that shared experience, you're atomized: We'll make money off of individual, little fragments of the market. An event like this brings us back to the notion that the shared experience is, in fact, the most profound resource of any designer. This is an opportunity, I think. Designers have to be radical advocates for preservation of this shared experience, rather than successful entrepreneurs of the latest month-old icon. I think World War II created a shared experience in America. I think the frontier created a shared experience in America. But we let it go.

Q: Will design, as it did in World War II, address the national mood?

MAYNE: The problem here is that we live in a culture where, as a designer, regardless of the discipline, to look for that consensus -- it doesn't exist.

DANIEL ROZIN: The biggest question is, Who are we designing for? It seems like we're designing for ourselves, Americans. Once every century or half a century we're thrown into the international arena, and then we tend to sink back to this state of self-sufficiency -- where we design for ourselves. A designer's work is about communication and information. And we have a huge case of misconception here between us and our adversaries. Who are they? We think they're evil; they think we're evil. It's a design problem.

The word "they" is actually the root of it. Is there a "they"? If design is universal?

KATHRYN GUSTAFSON: In Europe, the public demands and asks for a good design. Especially in our fields of landscape and architecture. Our field doesn't move across the Web the way yours does. And so they're very concerned -- it's much more community-oriented. What are we doing wrong that our public doesn't know that it matters?

SCHER: It takes time for a culture to accept and embrace design as part of its way of life. And I actually have seen, in the past 30 years, a tremendous growth of sophistication here. But it's a very slow process.
Q: What have clients been saying?

DAVID KELLEY: The clients still come in, and they're about innovation or business. But we're talking about something that's a little different. Everybody I know has this collective worry, this collective kind of "I don't know what's going to happen next." I've never seen that. I doubt if the Second World War was that way. Certainly Vietnam wasn't that way. There were a bunch of people who were worried about whether they were going to be drafted. But the whole world, at least the whole country, wasn't. It comes back to doing the best you can, to innovating our way out of this mess. They're not talking about whether Maya Lin should design the memorial. We're not there yet. Designers are also going to be who designs the new toothpaste, the new everything.

Q: Is there any indication from clients that designs are being redirected by concern?

KELLEY: I had a whole bunch of clients stuck in my office for eight days. They couldn't get home. Because you now share this collective human feeling, I can bring up subjects with clients that I don't think I could bring up before. Sustainability is much easier to talk about. They're just in a different mood. Anything that has to do with human is on the table now with business-based people. We always talk about emotional stuff, almost spiritual subjects as designers. I think we can engage that kind of discussion with clients. I think we're going to come out of this with a much more human culture in the United States. There are designers who are humanists, and they're going to come to the front.

GUSTAFSON: We're talking about community sustainable. I felt like we were living in our little houses. Hopefully, the public as client will understand that you need tolerance to have a whole world, a whole society.

Q: What role will the economy play now in design's future?

KELLEY: We were already on a downturn. Clients that were big on innovation thought they could get out of it by innovation. You can't just keep cutting cost. You have to have the courage to say, "O.K., our company is going to succeed by doing things that really please people." That's a point where you can make a difference as a designer. Get them excited about the prospects.

SUSAN KARE: In times of stress, people are reassured by what's familiar. Some of that can be imagery. Art history shows the power of imagery. You still look at those cave paintings, you look at those Egyptian figurines in the cases at the Met; you're not aware of exactly what was happening politically as you see those creations. This has made me think about how important symbols are. Everybody got out their flags. Everybody you saw. It was not only a statement that made people feel better -- it was a statement that the wearer was affected.

CHEE PEARLMAN: Given the opportunity to jump on a new job tomorrow if you got the call, what would it be?

SAGMEISTER: Patient information booklet for Cipro. I think this event and this situation would need some sort of unifying symbol.

MANGURIAN: We're doing some work for the L.A.U.S.D. (Los Angeles Unified School District). They have been doing the under-siege sort of tactic for a long time with the schools. The job I would like to do would be to somehow convince people at the L.A.U.S.D. to open the doors, and have the strength to make it work. To "close it all down" -- it produces a war-zone mentality. You see it as you drive through the cities now. We're producing that kind of mentality; it's dangerous. Protecting ourselves, protecting our lifestyle, which I think should be just the opposite.

HOCKENBERRY: What would you do about the mail, in the light of biochemical attacks?

PATRICK BEST: One of the joys of the mail is that it's a surprise. It's like Christmas. You get a letter from your grandmother, a letter from your kid at camp -- you don't want to lose that. You also, obviously, want to get a sense of security. It's a challenge, to experiment with new materials. Because obviously paper envelopes or paper packaging has an extreme limitation.
I think there's an opportunity now to educate people. That's what monuments a lot of times do. Like the Vietnam Memorial. When you read about the Vietnam War in a book it doesn't have any emotional impact. But when you go to the Vietnam wall, you sense the anguish, you sense the monumentality of it. I think I'd propose a monument to enlightenment. That we need to enlighten ourselves in the way we go about designing, living. Because they're completely intertwined.

HOCKENBERRY: I talked to a counterterrorism person. He worked on the Tylenol killer case. What happened there, and the reason it's never happened again, was in part a design. Sealable packaging. It didn't involve the Constitution, and it didn't involve the First Amendment, and it didn't involve any of the values that supposedly we worried were going to be tossed down the drain. It was this simple sort of union of perception meeting a design that is reassuring. And our lives from now on are going to be filled with those things, he said.

MAYNE: The intersection between the reality of defense and the necessity for openness that Robert talked about -- we're doing a courthouse in Eugene. They're going to build a glass box. And it's an absolute symbolic statement of a chief justice, Oregon in this case, who refuses to acknowledge the necessity of a defensive strategy. In fact it is promoting a new openness.

KARE: I'm interested in trying to convey as much clarity, and simplicity and meaning in "small device" spaces. Say, cellphones. Standardize a symbol set that was both clear and warm, and slightly more humane. Screens -- you're able now to have a little photograph of something. I think you can work on a lot of those symbols, that would help.

HOCKENBERRY: If the symbolism is universal, I think that's reassuring, independent of the function of the object often.

Q: Design often plays the "edge." Is that suitable now? Is it acceptable to be funny?

SCHER: It's going to have to be, or what a grim world.

SAGMEISTER: I heard a very young designer from Holland say that the time for being "against" is over. That it's for the old. We actually want to be for something. I know for myself that I'm much less cynical. I mean, you know -- I look at Sting now differently.

Q: We're going into the holidays with an enormous pall. People feel they can't fly, they don't know if they should buy, they're facing enormous layoffs. Do we need another design push, an optimistic movement like the streamlining that accompanied the Depression?

KELLEY: I was thinking more of a kind of simplicity. I had dinner with old friends here last night, and my toast included an acknowledgment to living a charmed life in this culture. And having just been reminded that we're now joining much of the rest of the world in another existence. And how important our friendship is. It was understood a little differently than it was two months ago. The importance of some sort of continuity, or some sort of a constituency, that sustains a design sensibility -- it's beyond the necessity of sustaining some economic goal.

Q: If Americans are in part resented for their cultural imagery, what do designers do about this?

SCHER: I'm uncomfortable with following symbols. I find that the best manipulator of symbols in this whole thing was Osama bin Laden. The image of the World Trade Center being hit by the planes was the most powerful use of symbol. I think that to a degree we may have a responsibility for defusing symbols to make people understand how they may be manipulated by what they see.

SAGMEISTER: It's not the fault of the symbol; it's the fault of how we apply it and for whom we apply it. The swastika by itself was an age-old symbol that had different values in different cultures. But the way it was applied -- and it was a strong application. But did it help make our world a horrible place?

SCHER: The most moving art that I saw made was in Union Square Park and in the parks where people made their own private demonstration, without the intellectual baggage that we bring to all of that stuff. Because it was really human.

ROZIN: It's made us all designers. I think as designers, what we need to develop now is not so much a symbol, but a whole narrative of what it means to be us. What do we stand for? And we need to communicate it to ourselves, because we really don't know who we are right now and what do we stand for? And we really don't understand why they hate us. I don't think a symbol could help you. I think symbols are too powerful. We're talking about a ground-up narrative that has to emerge.

PEARLMAN: If we were around this table a year from now, any thoughts about what we'll be up to?

MANGURIAN: The instructions for living, which I think the Shakers wanted to do, are somehow placed within, into the drawing or the object. Like the Tylenol cap. You don't look at it and think of the problem, and it ruins your life. I think finding a way to place really good instructions that are generous and open, and so on, in things is really -- that's what I would like to be doing a year from now.

HEADLINE: The House Acts Badly 

 BODY:
The razor-thin margin by which the House Republicans passed their economic stimulus package yesterday was a tribute to how really dreadful that proposal is. A huge package of tax cuts, no matter how ill advised, can generally attract supporters. But despite desperate pressure from the House leadership, and the assurance that whatever they voted for would be made more sensible by the Senate, the stimulus plan squeaked through the House by only two votes. 
 The House bill was top-heavy with giveaways to corporations and tax cuts to the wealthiest 30 percent of Americans. Since those citizens are the least likely to immediately spend new money they acquire, it made little sense as an economic stimulus. At a time when the country is being urged to make sacrifices for the common good, the idea of well-to-do Americans lining up for a tax break is appalling. Even many of the people to whom the cuts are directed would probably willingly forgo them at this time of crisis. But the nation has been distracted by the anthrax scare and the war against terrorism. Only the House, it seems, has the leisure to dream up giveaways for special interests and campaign donors. 
 Far superior to the House measure was a $70 billion package of tax breaks and subsidies announced Tuesday night by Max Baucus, chairman of the Senate Finance Committee. It would provide rebates for families left out of the tax cuts enacted earlier this year, as well as tax cuts to help businesses write off their capital investments at an accelerated rate. Other features would help the poor and unemployed get health coverage. These provisions do everything the House bill does not do: help those who need it most, provide a genuine stimulus to the economy and carry an affordable price tag.
A couple of weeks ago Treasury Secretary Paul O'Neill memorably characterized the House measure as "show business," with little likelihood of winning final passage. Yesterday Republicans put on quite a different kind of show, as House Speaker Dennis Hastert and Tom DeLay, the Republican whip, cajoled, threatened and pressured wavering Republicans to go along with this unacceptable legislation. Even so, they barely succeeded. There will now be a negotiation involving Senate Democrats and Republicans in the House, along with President Bush. The Baucus bill should serve as the basis for their discussions and for the final stimulus package enacted into law.

HEADLINE: Greenspan Says Protectionism Is Hardly an Antidote to Terror 

BYLINE:  By RICHARD W. STEVENSON

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Oct. 24 

 BODY:
Calling globalization "the antithesis of terrorism," Alan Greenspan, the Federal Reserve chairman, set out a case tonight for continuing to knock down trade barriers and integrating economies across borders.
 Acknowledging the spread of protests in recent years against the brand of unfettered capitalism that he supports, Mr. Greenspan said allowing competition, products, money and ideas to flow between countries had proved a powerful force for economic advancement, but that the process yielded losers as well as winners. 
 The Fed chairman said the answer was not to inhibit international competition, but to help people who are hurt by what the economist Joseph Schumpeter called "creative destruction." He cited worker retraining, and long-term unemployment or welfare benefits, as possible solutions.
"Protectionism will only slow the inevitable transition of our work force to more productive endeavors," Mr. Greenspan said in a speech here to the Institute for International Economics. 
"To be sure," he said, "an added few years on the job may enable some workers to reach retirement with reasonable security and dignity, but if we hinder competitive progress, we will almost certainly slow overall economic growth and keep frozen in place younger workers whose opportunities to secure jobs with better long-term prospects diminish with time."
Mr. Greenspan did not comment on the economic outlook or give any hint of how much further the Fed is likely to go in cutting interest rates this year.
His comments seemed an oblique attempt to give his support to a new round of global trade talks at a meeting of trade ministers next month, and to press Congress into giving President Bush expanded authority to negotiate trade deals.
But his speech also appeared to have a broader goal. It set forth an intellectual framework from which advocates of market forces could counter the protests against globalization and the tendency for nations and individuals alike to turn inward when faced with cataclysms like the terrorist attacks on the United States last month.
"Terrorism poses a challenge to the remarkable record of globalization," Mr. Greenspan said.

An Old Tactic: Painting A Rival Red

BYLINE:  By JOYCE PURNICK 

 BODY:
AT a breakfast appearance this week, Mark Green spoke more substantively than ever about the grave problems confronting New York City, about the anemic economy and how to rebuild downtown, about the argument for tax credits and the need for cooperation from Albany and Washington.
 You may not have heard about the Green speech because the event, sponsored by Crain's New York Business, was overshadowed by the distractions of a white-haired man who prowled the back of the room at the Grand Hyatt, muttering and pacing, as if waiting to pounce. That he was. 
 Mr. Green had barely left the stage when William Cunningham, senior adviser to Michael R. Bloomberg, sought out reporters to make an accusation that recalled the redbaiting 1950's. Yes, in the aftermath of a terrorist attack that killed thousands and dealt New York a body blow, a flashback to the painful days of "Are you now or have you ever been . . . ?" 
Noting that Mr. Green had referred to a book he had written, Mr. Cunningham said, "He finally admitted that he wrote some books, and now they can become part of the campaign dialogue, including his defense of Joseph Stalin on one occasion."
He was talking about Mr. Green's "Winning Back America," a 1982 book in which he accused Ronald Reagan of a tendency to revise history. He wrote that Mr. Reagan had been wrong to say that the aim of all leaders of the Soviet Union was world revolution because, Mr. Green wrote, Joseph Stalin "pushed for 'socialism in one country.' "
A brief history lesson: historians have long interpreted Stalin's slogan of "socialism in one country" as meaning that the Soviet Union would not sacrifice its interests for world revolution, but nonetheless dreamed of communism spreading throughout the world. 
Robert Legvold, professor of political science at Columbia University, said yesterday that Mr. Green had oversimplified -- "Stalin saw the Soviet Union as leader of a trend," he said -- but called the Cunningham accusation "nuts."
"This is not a defense of Stalin by any means," Professor Legvold said. "To say what Green wrote represents sympathy with Stalin is crazy. Green oversimplifies and Bloomberg makes a false accusation."
Because Mr. Cunningham is an adviser, not a candidate, his remarks would rate a footnote at most if Mr. Bloomberg had repudiated them, or just distanced himself from them. But the Republican candidate said, "Mark Green has been very liberal all of his life."
He called Mr. Green a "liberal, leftist kind of guy." He added: "I don't know whether he is a Stalinist. I think it is true that he has a record of being a very liberal person."
HERE is what Mr. Bloomberg did not say. He did not say that the tactics of Joseph McCarthy have no place in his campaign. Nor did he say that Mr. Cunningham did not speak for him, or that sometimes campaign advisers become carried away. He said nothing to signal disapproval of the Stalin tactic.
This raises questions about the kind of City Hall staff Mr. Bloomberg would build as mayor, whether he would appoint aides like Mr. Cunningham, a longtime political operative not known for subtlety. This summer he pushed, cursed and ejected a Daily News reporter from a forum because he objected to something the reporter had written. On another occasion he ripped information on Mr. Bloomberg's charitable donations from the hands of a reporter for The New York Observer.
Asked yesterday if he had second thoughts about his Stalin routine, which some political analysts saw as a sign of desperation, Mr. Cunningham said: "History is history. Stalin was a murderer, Stalin was a Communist, he wrote it," referring to Mr. Green.
Mr. Green showed annoyance when a reporter asked him yesterday if he was a Stalinist. "How do you answer that question?" he asked. "I'm also not a fleeing felon." 
But otherwise the job of handling the Cunningham charge has gone to a spokesman, Joseph DePlasco, who parried with a query about Mr. Bloomberg's company and whether it invested in South Africa before apartheid was fully dismantled (another matter of great relevance to running New York City).
Both candidates agree on what is most relevant -- the city 's recovery -- but not on how to achieve it, not even how to rebuild downtown. Mr. Green favors putting a new city-state authority in charge, and Mr. Bloomberg would rely on existing agencies.
Wonder what Stalin would say?

HEADLINE: Pataki Visits Washington, But Aid Plea Meets Doubt 

BYLINE:  By RAYMOND HERNANDEZ 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Oct. 24 

 BODY:
Gov. George E. Pataki of New York emerged from a meeting at the White House today and for the first time expressed doubts about the prospects of his $54 billion plan to help the state recover from last month's terrorist attack at the World Trade Center.
 Mr. Pataki said he had received no firm commitments during his meeting with Mitchell E. Daniels Jr., the White House budget director, and he appeared willing to scale back his request for federal aid. 
 "The bipartisan recognition of the unique impact this has had on New York has been very encouraging," the governor said during a news conference outside the White House. But he added: "That's not to say we're going to get everything we requested. We know that's not the way Washington or the world operates."
Several elements of the request Mr. Pataki delivered to Washington two weeks ago have been unofficially rejected by many leading lawmakers on the Hill. In particular, they pointed to extraneous items like a high-speed rail link to Schenectady, and seemed appalled by the fact that the plan did not account for insurance reimbursements that could offset billions of dollars in losses.
Today the governor acknowledged that that number could be reduced considerably, because insurance companies will have to pay for part of the cost of the reconstruction effort. "There could be 8, 10, 12, 15 billion dollars in private and other insurance to reduce that number," he said.
To clean up the devastation in Lower Manhattan and rebuild there, Mr. Pataki wanted about $34 billion, nearly twice what the White House and Congress set aside last month for exactly those purposes.
The governor's comments reflected the difficulty he has faced in securing additional aid beyond the $20 billion that Washington has already allocated to New York, Virginia and Pennsylvania.
Last night, Mr. Pataki's spokesman phoned reporters to stress that the governor had no intention of backing away from his plan, though he acknowledged that the overall figure could come down, depending on how much of the reconstruction was covered by insurance companies. The spokesman, Michael McKeon, also noted that the point of the governor's trip was to drum up support for the part of his plan that seeks about $20 billion in federal aid to stimulate the state's economy.
Just a few days ago, Mr. Daniels ruled out the possibility that the Bush administration would provide any more aid to New York this year.
Members of New York's Congressional delegation have been urging the governor to scale back his numbers, arguing that he runs the risk of undermining the credibility of legitimate aid requests. In fact, a prominent lawmaker said that throughout the day, at various meetings, Mr. Pataki was "met with polite disdain."
The governor met with Mr. Daniels, the White House budget director, and his staff for about a half hour in the afternoon, then arrived at the Capitol for a 45-minute session with William M. Thomas, a Republican from California who is the chairman of the Ways and Means Committee. Members of the New York delegation also attended the meeting.
Mr. Thomas told Mr. Pataki to "refine" his federal aid request, according to people at the meeting. Afterward, Representative John Sweeney of New York said that Mr. Thomas had given a general commitment of support. "We made our case, and the chairman indicated an interest in being as helpful as he can be," Mr. Sweeney said.
Mr. Pataki went over to the Treasury Department for a meeting with Secretary Paul H. O'Neill, and met separately with Senator Max Baucus, Democrat of Montana, the chairman of the Finance Committee.
Mr. Pataki's aides insisted that he did not expect to come away from today's trip with any specific commitments of support. Instead, they said, the governor wanted to ensure that Washington's focus did not drift away from the devastation in New York, at a time when it was suddenly grappling with other pressing matters, like the war in Afghanistan.
"He wanted to make sure New York doesn't fall off the radar," one Pataki aide said.
The governor's plan also seeks about $20 billion to stimulate the economy. That includes $12 billion in additional federal aid to make up for lost tax revenues, a proposal that has met with some skepticism here, since the federal government has not compensated local governments for lost revenues in other disasters.
Today, Mr. Pataki seemed to be trying to address that skepticism when he pointed out that the state had taken steps to put its fiscal house in order by moving to cut spending by $3 billion over 18 months. "We're not just looking to Washington," he said.

HEADLINE: National Party Hasn't Clogged The Airways For Schundler 

BYLINE:  By DAVID M. HERSZENHORN 

DATELINE: TRENTON, Oct. 24 

 BODY:
Just two months ago, national Republicans seemed ready to spend substantial sums of money on advertising in the New Jersey governor's race, prompting fears and a lawsuit from Democrats.
 But with less than two weeks until Election Day, the Republican National Committee has yet to buy a single penny of major television or radio advertising, either in support of Bret D. Schundler, the party's nominee, or against his opponent, James E. McGreevey. 
 Mr. Schundler's aides and Republicans in Trenton and Washington are quick to note that the national party has committed more than $2 million for direct mailings and get-out-the-vote operations -- more than it has ever spent on a New Jersey governor's race. But the absence so far of major-media advertising by the national committee has surprised both Republicans and Democrats, who by contrast have spent heavily on advertising in recent weeks. 
Given that the New Jersey race is one of only two gubernatorial contests in the country this year, many Republicans said they were stunned by the lack of advertising, even as they expressed gratitude for the other spending by the national committee. 
"The only thing that I have heard from our side is just the basic grumbling about why they aren't doing more," one Republican strategist said. 
Democrats said they thought the Republican Party leadership was walking away from Mr. Schundler. 
"There is pretty clear evidence that even the R.N.C. has come to the conclusion that Schundler and his campaign have not caught fire with the electorate in New Jersey," said Steve DeMicco, Mr. McGreevey's campaign director. 
National Republicans have been slow to rally to Mr. Schundler's side in other ways. Former Gov. Christie Whitman campaigned for Mr. Schundler tonight in New Jersey for the first time since he won the Republican nomination in June. Mrs. Whitman attended a women's rally in Parsippany.
And it is unclear if President Bush, who has voiced support for Mr. Schundler, will visit New Jersey to campaign with him because of the conflict overseas. 
Privately, many New Jersey Republicans say they have their fingers crossed both for a visit by President Bush and for a blitz of spending on advertising in the campaign's final days. Officials at the Republican National Committee declined to indicate what their plans were. 
"The R.N.C. has already committed over $2 million to a get-out-the-vote program for the elections in New Jersey," said Trent Duffy, a spokesman. "That's the starting point for the R.N.C.'s support."
Even if the Republicans decide to make a huge advertising push, it is unclear whether they will find available broadcast time, especially in New York, where there is a highly competitive mayor's race and where the World Series is about to start. 
Mr. Schundler's aides said they were not counting on help from Washington but would welcome it. "Would I love for the R.N.C. to come in and spend $2 million over the next 13 days?" said Bill Pascoe, Mr. Schundler's campaign manager. "Of course I would. But because that's an independent expenditure, something that's beyond our ability to ask for or control, that has never been a part of our winning strategy."
In August, the Republican Party seemed poised to inject a lot of money into the New Jersey race. The party sought guidance from the state's Election Law Enforcement Commission, which ruled that the national party could spend as much as it wanted on behalf of Mr. Schundler so long as it made "independent expenditures" not coordinated with the Schundler campaign. 
In response, the McGreevey campaign filed a lawsuit arguing that it was impossible for the national party to be independent of the Schundler campaign. 
The lawsuit was dismissed by Judge Arthur N. D'Italia of State Superior Court in Hudson County because the national Republicans had not spent any money on the race. Lawyers involved in the case said they had expected to be back in court on the matter, but so far there have been no expenditures by the national Republicans worth fighting over. 
Officials at Republican national headquarters said that they had, in fact, made some independent expenditures in the New Jersey race and that the expenses would be detailed in a report to state election officials due on Friday. Democratic strategists said the only expenditures they had seen by the national Republicans were large mailings of absentee ballots and an abbreviated purchase of radio advertising in Atlantic City several weeks ago. 
By contrast, the Democratic National Committee is expected to spend more than $3 million on Mr. McGreevey's behalf by the time the race is over, Democrats said. 
At the rally tonight, Mrs. Whitman, who is now the administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency, addressed a rollicking crowd of about 500 Republicans, most of them women.
"Unless we want to return to the days of high unemployment, high taxes and high anxiety," she said, "we need to make very sure that Bret Schundler is the next governor of New Jersey."
Mrs. Whitman was introduced by Mr. Schundler's wife, Lynn, and gave him a warm introduction as New Jersey's next governor. There was no mention of their past differences, including Mrs. Whitman's criticism over the summer of Mr. Schundler's positions on abortion and gun control.

HEADLINE: Political Memo; 
As Time Runs Low, Bloomberg Runs Rough

BYLINE:  By ADAM NAGOURNEY 

 BODY:
Hemmed in by an unusually brief campaign season and his own lack of experience in politics, Michael R. Bloomberg is encountering repeated difficulties as he moves into the final phase of his mayoral campaign, struggling to engage an increasingly confident and politically aloof Mark Green.
 In the course of a week, Mr. Bloomberg has tried three separate attacks against his Democratic opponent, at a time when aides to both candidates say their private polls show Mr. Green with a substantial lead. Mr. Bloomberg's campaign has been diverted by distractions arguably of its own making, most recently when it struggled to reconcile conflicting explanations from the candidate and his aides about his business dealings in South Africa. And he continues to be less than sure-footed as he travels the city, in a way that has stirred concern among some fellow Republicans because media attention to his campaign has been increasing in recent days. 
 At a news conference yesterday in which Mr. Bloomberg was endorsed by Gov. George E. Pataki, Mr. Bloomberg first criticized Mr. Green for being too liberal, and then a moment later responded to a question by declaring, "I am a liberal, yes." 
Mr. Pataki -- a self-described doctrinaire conservative who defeated Mario M. Cuomo in 1993 by hammering him as a "liberal" -- stared in astonishment into space.
The perception that Mr. Bloomberg is having trouble has encouraged Mr. Green to make his own strategic change over the past few days. He has returned to the unadventurous campaign course he followed for most of the primary season, offering either familiar or uncontroversial campaign proposals while trying to avoid the last-minute mistakes that might turn what he sees as the tide of an election breaking his way. 
If there are any attacks to be made, they will be pressed mainly by surrogates, as when he dispatched William J. Bratton, the former police commissioner, to go after Mr. Bloomberg's public safety credentials. And after a primary campaign in which he boasted about the number of times he had shared a stage with his Democratic rivals, Mr. Green has agreed to only two debates with Mr. Bloomberg.
At a news conference at Union Square Park yesterday, Mr. Green listened patiently as reporters pressed him to respond to a charge by Mr. Bloomberg's senior aide that he was a Stalin apologist, and another by Mr. Bloomberg that Mr. Green had played the "race card" by raising the issue of apartheid. 
"I don't really have to respond to him," Mr. Green said. "Today I am focused on the three large goals of rebuilding the economy, enhancing security and educating our children."
Mr. Bloomberg's advisers contend that he is presenting a strong case against Mr. Green, particularly in television advertisements, and that these episodes are not a meaningful distraction from his candidacy. A number of polls suggest that support for Mr. Green is not particularly deep, meaning that a hard-hitting week of TV ads could turn the tables.
Nonetheless, some Republicans expressed distress at the way Mr. Bloomberg's campaign has progressed recently. They said it underlined their concern that Mr. Bloomberg today, like Rudolph W. Giuliani the first time he ran for mayor, was not prepared for the peculiar difficulties that come with running for office in New York. And some Republicans said they were starting to worry about his prospects.
"It's the syndrome of a first-time candidate," said Nelson Warfield, a conservative Republican consultant with ties to New York, "and it's the syndrome of a candidate who before the race really didn't have any political beliefs. What he should do is stay inside the edit suite where the people are putting together the ads so they can change what he says before people hear him."
As it is, Mr. Bloomberg faces difficulty in trying to win an election in a city where Democrats outnumber Republicans by better than five to one. His task is complicated by the fact that he has less than three weeks to make his case against Mr. Green, in a general election season cut short because the Sept. 11 terrorist attack in New York forced a two-week delay in the primaries. And he is competing for attention with world events, not to mention the prospect of the Yankees' winning the World Series again.
The shorter campaign season means that Mr. Bloomberg has less time to turn public discussion away from unwelcome subjects -- like apartheid and Stalin -- to issues that seem more likely to hold sway with New York voters.
It also means that he has less time to find an effective message against Mr. Green. As a rule, in politics, candidates try to figure out their most effective line of attack and stick to it.
Mr. Bloomberg's initial argument against Mr. Green was that New York needed a business leader rather than a professional politician to guide it through the tough years ahead. Then he sought to undercut Mr. Green's support among black and Hispanic voters by contending that he had run a racially divisive primary campaign against Fernando Ferrer. Yesterday, he moved to attack Mr. Green as too liberal for New York. 
Mr. Bloomberg has hired some of the most experienced political professionals in the country, led by David Garth, a longtime expert in New York politics. (Mr. Garth has not returned telephone calls in recent days seeking comment about the state of his client's campaign.)
But for all that expertise, he has encountered logistical difficulties that are typical of less experienced campaigns. And he has found himself overshadowed by his own senior adviser, William Cunningham.
At a breakfast of business and civic leaders sponsored by Crain's, where Mr. Green was speaking earlier this week, Mr. Cunningham showed up and paced back and forth along the wall, staring intensely at Mr. Green. When Mr. Green jocularly said he did not want to do anything that might make him "look arrogant," Mr. Cunningham said loudly from across the hall, "Too late."
And it was Mr. Cunningham who suggested, based on an academic and generally unremarkable passage Mr. Green wrote about 20 years ago regarding Stalin's rule, that the Democratic candidate was sympathetic to Stalin. While many of Mr. Bloomberg's other advisers dismissed Mr. Cunningham's remark as absurd, it was potentially problematic for Mr. Bloomberg because, given its hyperbole, the remark made it harder for him to get his point across: that Mr. Green was too liberal to be mayor of New York.

HEADLINE: A NATION CHALLENGED: THE DISEASE; 
MORE CHECKED FOR ANTHRAX; U.S. OFFICIALS ACKNOWLEDGE UNDERESTIMATING MAIL RISKS

BYLINE:  By TODD S. PURDUM 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Oct. 24 

 BODY:
Health officials here monitored increasing numbers of people for suspected anthrax today while John E. Potter, the postmaster general, acknowledged that he could not guarantee the safety of the mails. President Bush warned that the nation was "still under attack."
 Their statements reflected the growing sense that government officials had badly underestimated the threat posed by the anthrax contained in a handful of letters sent to Congress and news organizations in recent weeks. Two postal workers in Washington have died and at least two others have been infected. 
 Dr. David Satcher, the surgeon general, said that in hindsight, "we were wrong" not to have considered that a sealed envelope containing anthrax might pose a hazard as it passed through a post office. 
Officials are particularly concerned about the letter sent to the Senate majority leader, Tom Daschle, Democrat of South Dakota. Several top scientists said today that the powdery anthrax found in that letter was advanced and highly dangerous, contradicting officials who had suggested over the past week that the substance was relatively primitive.
In particular, the scientists said that it had been altered to reduce its electrostatic charge, making the spores less likely to clump together and more likely to float in the air. One expert said that only the United States, the Soviet Union, and Iraq were known to have developed the necessary technique to do this. Page B6. 
A government official said it was now clear that the envelope sent to Mr. Daschle was porous enough, and the spores inside small enough, that germs could have leaked out even though it was taped shut.
Health officials here and in New Jersey said they were investigating at least a dozen cases of possible inhaled anthrax, including at least one person linked to the Senate, in addition to the two confirmed cases and two deaths among postal workers here. Officials said another 20 people in the Washington area who might have been exposed to anthrax were being monitored.
But as a precaution, health officials expanded their recommendation for immediate antibiotic treatment to include all workers in 120 institutions that receive bulk mail, including the Library of Congress. The decision was based on concern that such mail might have been contaminated at the district's main processing center on Brentwood Road, which handled the Daschle letter.
Another suspected anthrax case was reported in New York. Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani said a second employee of The New York Post had probably contracted an anthrax infection of the skin. Page B7. 
It was another unsettling day as the government's top officials grappled with an insidious and invisible enemy. Despite a sprawling investigation, law enforcement officials said they now believed that additional anthrax attacks were a certainty.
Addressing the U.S. conference of Mayors, the F.B.I. director, Robert S. Mueller III, said the anthrax attacks "were clearly meant to terrorize a country already on the edge."
Mr. Mueller was the first official to link the anthrax attacks with a warning of more expected terrorism issued by the F.B.I. on Oct. 11. 
Mr. Bush, in remarks at a Maryland printing plant to promote his economic stimulus package, repeated that he had no direct evidence connecting anthrax to the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks, but said, "There are some links."
"Both series of actions are motivated by evil and hate," Mr. Bush said. "Both series of actions are meant to disrupt Americans' way of life. Both series of actions are an attack on our homeland. And both series of actions will not stand."
Moving to grant new powers to law enforcement, the House of Representatives today passed a compromise version of comprehensive anti-terrorism legislation sought by the administration. Senate passage is expected as soon as Thursday. The measure would grant stepped surveillance and detention powers and crack down on money laundering. 
Inhalation anthrax has been diagnosed in six people nationwide this month, including the four postal workers here and two employees at American Media Inc. in Boca Raton, Fla. One of those in Florida, Robert Stevens, a photo editor, died on Oct. 5, but the other, Ernesto Blanco, 73, a mailroom worker, was released from the hospital late Tuesday, officials announced today.
Seven people, most of them employees of New York news outlets, have less threatening form of skin anthrax and are responding to treatment or have been cured.
A news employee who covers the Senate is among six people who have been admitted to Holy Cross Hospital in suburban Silver Spring, Md., for possible anthrax exposure, a Congressional official said today. The woman, who was not named, works for an electronic news organization, the official said. She is the first person to be hospitalized with a suspected anthrax case from exposure in the Hart Senate Office Building, where the Daschle letter was opened.
Though hundreds of workers have been tested, officials here and in New Jersey reported no new confirmed cases of either form of the disease today, but they offered new details on several patients hospitalized with suspicious, flulike symptoms.
A 2-year-old girl and an 11-year-old boy were admitted on Tuesday to Children's National Medical Center in Washington with "possible exposure to anthrax," and were in good condition, the hospital said.
With demand for antibiotics growing, Tommy G. Thompson, secretary of Health and Human Services, announced an agreement with Bayer A.G. to buy 100 million doses of its patented drug Cipro at the sharply reduced price of 95 cents each. 
In morning television appearances, Mr. Potter, the top postal official, said that risks from opening the mail were slim, but acknowledged that the mail's safety could not be guaranteed. "The chances are very, very slim, but, again, people should do things that are safe, and when they handle mail, they should wash their hands," he said.
Officials said the Postal Service, whose 800,000 workers make it the nation's second-largest private employer after Wal-Mart, was in the process of ordering new machinery that can irradiate mail to remove contaminants, in the same way food is treated.
The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention is expected on Thursday to issue recommendations for protecting mail handlers. Among them will be the installation of HEPA filters and exhaust hoods for high-speed mail-handling equipment.
Increasingly, investigators said, they were finding evidence that the anthrax in the letter to Mr. Daschle, the Senate majority leader, had spread through machines. They said it left a trail of spores as it sped through automated sorters in the Brentwood station, and tests consistently found anthrax spores along the precise path taken by the Daschle letter and others bound for the same ZIP code.
In an appearance on NBC's "Today" program this morning, Dr. Satcher, the surgeon general, said experts had never expected that an unopened envelope passing through a post office could expose workers to anthrax. "Until a week ago, I think all of the experts would have said "no," he said. "The fact of the matter is, we were wrong, because we haven't been here before." 
On Capitol Hill, the Russell Senate Office Building, one of three Senate offices shut last week for environmental testing, reopened today, but the others, including the Hart building, remained closed. A new spot in the Hart building tested positive for anthrax today, police investigators said. 
All three House office buildings remained closed because tests were incomplete. But Capitol police said tonight that the Rayburn House Office building and garage and Cannon House Office building would be opened on Thursday.
At the White House, preliminary anthrax tests on some 120 mail sorting workers found no exposure to anthrax. Trace amounts of the bacteria were found in a remote mail screening outpost at Bolling Air Force Base, a few miles from the White House, on Tuesday, and though officials said they were confident no tainted mail reached the White House complex itself, a total of 200 workers who might have had contact with the mail were being treated with antibiotics protectively.

HEADLINE: Bill That Expands Gambling Is Approved by Legislature 

BYLINE:  By JAMES C. McKINLEY Jr.

DATELINE: ALBANY, Thursday, Oct. 25 

 BODY:
The State Legislature approved the largest expansion of gambling in state history early this morning after an impassioned debate, laying the groundwork for six Indian casinos in the Catskills and western New York. The State Senate voted 52 to 8 late Wednesday to approve a bill authorizing the six new Indian-run casinos, the inclusion of New York in the multistate Powerball lottery and the installation of video slot machines at horse tracks. After midnight the Assembly gave final approval to the bill, voting 93 to 40 in favor.
 Proponents say the gambling measures are expected to bring in as much as $1 billion in new revenue to the state within three years. They gained support in the Legislature after it became clear the Sept. 11 terror attack would severely curb state revenues. Senate Majority Leader Joseph L. Bruno argued on the floor that the state could no longer afford to let New York's gamblers spend millions in neighboring states and Canada. 
 "We are looking for revenue sources," he said. "Those dollars now are going into Canada, supporting education, into Connecticut, into New Jersey, not into New York."
As the Legislature wrestled with the gambling bill Wednesday, Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani and Assembly Speaker Sheldon Silver feuded over the depth of Albany's commitment to New York City, touching on the lack of a casino for New York.
Mr. Giuliani complained that the final budget deal that legislative leaders had negotiated with Gov. George E. Pataki shortchanged the city on school aid and robbed it of $134 million in other subsidies. He also charged that the agreement between the Assembly's ruling Democrats and the Republican governor to allow three of the casinos in the Catskills and three in Western New York would further sap the city.
"The guy who we have to have in there fighting for us like a tiger is Shelly Silver, and he is nothing like a tiger," said Mr. Giuliani, a Republican. Mr. Silver, a Democrat, and the mayor have recently been at odds, with the speaker saying he would oppose extending Mr. Giuliani's term.
Mr. Silver, who had been seeking Wednesday morning to expand the Lower Manhattan zone that would get funds for rebuilding, said that Mr. Giuliani should lay the blame for the budget on his own party's leaders, the governor and the Senator Bruno.
"It's unfortunate he's being political in his waning days as mayor," Mr. Silver said. "He ignores the fact that George Pataki put forth the proposals."
The gambling measures were included in a bill putting in place a final budget agreement for the fiscal year ending in April. The agreement provides for about $500 million in new spending in an $84 billion budget for school aid, charity-run social programs and seed money for new industries. But the pact did not appropriate about $150 million for buying parkland and protecting the environment.
Environmentalists complained the Legislature's failure to reach an agreement with Mr. Pataki on how to spend $150 million in the Environmental Protection Fund meant a host of programs would not be financed until next year, among them recycling, landfill closures and parkland acquisition.
The two bills containing the gambling and budget measures were not printed and distributed to lawmakers until 7:40 p.m., minutes before debate began in the Senate. They contained several other provisions, like an extension of health benefits for indigent children, making them difficult to oppose.
While proponents of the bills said the terrorist attacks made it necessary to seek new revenues, opponents said gambling amounted to a tax on the poor and was a cowardly way to address a budget shortfall. They also complained the deal had been negotiated by the legislative leaders and the governor behind closed doors.
"I can't believe we are doing this here tonight, and to make it even worse, we are using the guise of the terrible tragedy of the terrorist attacks on New York to make New York one of the biggest gambling states in the nation," Senator Thomas K. Duane, a Manhattan Democrat, said Wednesday. 
But Senator Bruno and other proponents said the damage had already being done to New York society by casinos in neighboring states without the government benefiting. They pointed out gamblers voluntarily risk their money. "No one drags them," Senator Bruno said.
Many of the same arguments were made on the floor of the Assembly, with most of the speakers rising to vote no. Arthur O. Eve, a Buffalo Democrat, said he believed a planned casino in that city would further impoverish already poor neighborhoods. Alexander B. Grannis, a Manhattan Democrat, called the casinos "economic sponges" that would provide no boost to the economy. Other opponents said the governor's plan to install Indian-run casinos amounted to a blatant attempt to circumvent the state Constitution's ban on gambling and slot machines.
"What we are attempting to do is an end-run on the constitution," Assemblyman William Parment of Jamestown said.
As the bills were distributed, new details of the budget deal emerged. Of the $200 million in additional operating aid for schools, about $52.5 million will go to increase teacher salaries, $20 million will be spent on training teachers and $11 million for educating bilingual children.
The additions also include about $100 million for economic development, including $10 million in grants and $6 million worth of state-subsidized electricity to help businesses in the area devastated by the trade center. The governor has called the area the Liberty Zone and is seeking tax incentives from Congress to encourage businesses to remain there.

HEADLINE: Leader's Aide In Chechnya Calls to Offer Peace Talks 

BYLINE:  By MICHAEL WINES 

DATELINE: MOSCOW, Oct. 24 

 BODY:
A top aide to the political leader of Chechnya's separatist guerrillas proposed opening talks with the Kremlin on disarming the rebels and ending their two-year-old war, President Vladimir V. Putin's envoy to southwestern Russia said today. 
 The envoy, Viktor G. Kazantsev, said he received the offer by telephone this morning from an aide to President Aslan Maskhadov, who is in hiding. Mr. Kazantsev said in a television interview that the proposal had arrived without conditions and that he expected discussions to be held in Moscow in 10 days. 
 The offer could represent the first significant move toward peace since the war began in August 1999. It is one of several hopeful developments that appeared to spring from the Russian-American alliance that has grown since the attacks on Sept. 11. 
Mr. Putin's aide and chief spokesman on Chechnya, Sergei Yastrzhembsky, appeared later to scorn the proposal. He said discussions with Mr. Maskhadov's government did not rise to the level of a dialogue between the warring sides.
"Those who are hiding in mountains and forests are not in power in Chechnya," Mr. Yastrzhembsky was quoted as saying by the Interfax news service. 
Mr. Maskhadov was elected president of a quasi-independent republic of Chechnya in 1997 and was recognized by President Boris N. Yeltsin, who received him in the Kremlin. Under Mr. Putin, the Kremlin has insisted that Mr. Maskhadov is a figurehead in a war controlled by Islamic extremists and that his republic does not exist. 
That rebuff notwithstanding, Mr. Maskhadov's offer to talk joins a list of recent, if small, developments that together suggest that something more substantial is afoot in the conflict. 
Mr. Putin has long argued that Islamic outsiders exploited the semi-independent status given the breakaway Chechen province in the 1990's, in a drive to create a new extremist state on the model of Afghanistan. Until this fall, however, American officials have focused less on Islamic extremists than on Russia's brutal campaign to subdue Chechen guerrillas, an effort widely condemned by human-rights advocates and the West. As recently as March, the foreign minister of the Chechen republic was allowed to meet officials at the State Department.
United States officials continue to raise concerns about human-rights abuses in Chechnya. But since Sept. 11, they have also publicly begun to endorse Mr. Putin's view of Chechnya as a terrorists' refuge. In recent weeks, the United States is known to have privately sent Mr. Maskhadov a blunt message to renounce the extremists who have seized control of the rebellion and, Russia alleges, his political structure, or face American isolation as well.
Mr. Putin has appeared to soften, ever so slightly, his hard-line military and propaganda campaign against the separatists and Chechnya's beleaguered civilian population. In a nationally broadcast speech a month ago, when he committed Russia to a global antiterrorism coalition, Mr. Putin also issued an oblique demand, that within 72 hours separatists "and those who call themselves political figures" sever all ties to terrorists and contact Moscow to discuss disarming and returning to civilian life.
Although the Kremlin denied it, many saw the statement as a veiled invitation to begin talks on a political solution to the war. Mr. Maskhadov now appears to have accepted that offer.
In an interview today with the NTV television network, Mr. Maskhadov's aide, Akhmed Zakayev, said disarmament, the return of perhaps 150,000 war refugees from neighboring Ingushetia, a cease-fire and "economic issues" should be discussed at the talks.
In an interview today, a spokesman for Mr. Putin's envoy to southwestern Russia, Maksim Fedorenko, said the request for talks showed that "sober thinking tendencies" had gained the upper hand among Mr. Maskhadov's political supporters. Mr. Fedorenko said, however, that disarmament was the only issue on the table at the discussions. 
"The meeting will supposedly take place in a few days," he said. "And maybe then we'll learn more."
For its part, the Kremlin has recently begun addressing basic human-rights concerns about the conduct of Russian troops in Chechnya. The army suspended a number of officers in Chechnya this month after surveillance of 60 checkpoints on roadways found widespread extortion and abuse of civilians, a ubiquitous -- and long ignored -- complaint.
Last week, the military appointed a new commander for its forces in Chechnya, Gen. Vladimir Moltenskoi, who drew praise as someone "who strictly follows the letter and spirit of the law" from the head of the pro-Russian Chechen regional government.

HEADLINE: Bush Advisers Press for Help For Insurers 

BYLINE:  By STEPHEN LABATON 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Oct. 24 

 BODY:
President Bush's senior economic advisers told lawmakers today that the nation would face an economic crisis if Congress failed to quickly guard the insurance industry against losses from any future terrorist attacks. But the administration's proposal, which would have the government pay at least 80 percent of any claims next year, ran into a storm of criticism from both Democrats and Republicans.
 Opening a series of hearings in the House and Senate on an assistance package for the insurers, Treasury Secretary Paul H. O'Neill and R. Glenn Hubbard, the chairman of the White House Council of Economic Advisers, warned of dire economic consequences if the government did not intervene. They said that construction, manufacturing and other projects in such industries as energy and transportation would grind to a halt as bankers and other lenders around the country stopped offering loans or raised their rates because insurers were unwilling to renew their coverage for terrorist attacks. 
 "We're facing a cliff," Mr. O'Neill said in testimony before the Senate banking committee, and largely repeated later in the day before a House subcommittee. "The administration believes the economy is facing a temporary, but critical, market problem in the provision of terrorism risk insurance. Keeping our economy moving must be our overriding concern. Leaving this problem unresolved threatens our economic stability."
"From our conversations with insurance company representatives, state insurance regulators, policyholders, banks and other entities which provide financing for property transactions, the next two months are critical," he added, asserting that the reduction in insurance coverage "has the potential to cause severe economic dislocations in the near-term either through higher insurance costs or higher financing costs."
While a clear consensus emerged today among senior lawmakers that Congress must do something in the few remaining weeks of the legislative session, there was widespread disagreement about how to proceed. Moreover, Mr. O'Neill conceded that the cost-sharing formulas advanced by the administration's proposal might not work, and therefore Congress should consider giving the White House the authority to adjust the figures without seeking new legislation.
The urgency of the situation could be seen in big and small ways today at the hastily convened hearings, which had to be held in the basement of the Capitol building because many Congressional offices remain closed to cleanse them of possible anthrax problems. The House proceeding was in such a cramped room that the treasury secretary shucked some of the formal niceties of typical hearings and testified in his shirt-sleeves. Many of his questioners were similarly informal.
But they did not temper their skepticism of the central details of the administration's plan, under which the government would pay at least 80 percent of the claims from the first dollar of losses in 2002. The plan also limits the industry's total liability for damages from any future terrorist attacks at $12 billion next year, $23 billion in 2003 and $36 billion in 2004.
Mr. O'Neill and Mr. Hubbard said that the formulas were designed to encourage the insurers to offer coverage at reasonable rates, but many lawmakers said they would never pass a measure that did not force the industry to bear the initial financial burdens of any future attacks.
"I think politically the members would feel more comfortable if the first dollar lost is private and the federal government serves more as a backstop," said Senator Phil Gramm of Texas, the ranking Republican on the banking committee. He and others said it would be far more palatable if Congress began the program with the contribution formula proposed by the administration for 2003, in which the industry would have to pay the first $10 billion in claims before the government stepped in.
"I have strong concerns about requiring the taxpayers to assume, even on a temporary basis, such a large percentage of the cost -- especially on the front end," said Senator Bill Nelson, Democrat of Florida, and a former state insurance commissioner. "A more responsible approach, in my view, would be to require the companies to cover terrorist-related losses up to a certain level before any federal help would kick in. The industry is flush right now with huge surpluses. Whatever our solution to this aspect of the terrorist crisis, we must require insurers to pay their fair share."
Other lawmakers were critical of the administration for offering to help the insurance industry and bailing out the airline industry, but doing nothing for many other industries and labor groups pleading for help in the wake of growing losses and layoffs.
"There is a growing danger that we are responding to this crisis and challenge in an unbalanced and inequitable way," Paul S. Sarbanes, the Maryland Democrat who heads the Senate banking committee, sternly warned Mr. Hubbard. "The administration has to give careful thought to having a more balanced response so that there is a sense in this country that it is more equitable."
There was also widespread criticism of what some lawmakers said was basically socializing the costs of future attacks while privatizing the profits should there be no further attacks.
"I have a real problem with the federal government basically guaranteeing profits for the insurance industry," said Senator Jim Bunning, Republican of Kentucky. "You are basically guaranteeing that insurers will not lose over a certain amount."
Some House Republicans agreed.
"The administration's proposal is reminiscent of some of the government-sponspored enterprises," like the Federal National Mortgage Association, or Fannie Mae, said Representative Richard H. Baker, Republican of Louisiana, who heads the Financial Services Subcommittee on Capital Markets, Insurance and Government Sponsored Enterprises. "If you lose money, you get a partner. If you make money, you get to keep it."
Still others raised questions about how the federal government, which has no oversight role over the insurance industry, could supervise an assistance package without imposing new federal regulations on the insurers. Some lawmakers have said privately that a system that relies on federal assistance for state regulated industry was eerily reminiscent of the savings and loan bailout a decade ago.
"If the federal government puts its toe in the water, we have got to make sure we have all of the appropriate federal safeguards," said Representative John J. LaFalce, Democrat of New York.

HEADLINE: A NATION CHALLENGED: WHITE HOUSE MEMO; 
Home Front Is a Minefield For President

BYLINE:  By ELISABETH BUMILLER and DAVID E. SANGER 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Oct. 24 

 BODY:
When President Bush's helicopter touched down on the South Lawn of the White House in the early hours Monday, the president emerged fresh from solid victories abroad: He had cemented Russia as an enthusiastic partner in the war on terrorism, neutralized China's objections, and, by remote control from his hotel room, overseen the first operation involving ground troops in Afghanistan.
 If only things were so organized at home. 
 In his first 72 hours back, Mr. Bush discovered that the more complex and immediately dangerous front is here in what the White House calls "the homeland." As the president said in a speech today in suburban Baltimore, "It's something that, obviously, we're not used to in America." 
Perhaps for that very reason, the administration's response to the spreading threat of anthrax has been seen by even its supporters as ragged and confused. Officials have contradicted each other in competing press conferences. While the Pentagon seems to be anticipating how the Taliban will move from cave to cave, the White House seems less certain how toxic mail might move from building to building. 
Today, White House officials conceded that while the remote facility that receives all the mail addressed to 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue has been on "high alert" for bombs and chemical and biological threats since Sept. 11, no one notified the Postal Service's Brentwood facility -- where the same mail is first sorted -- to be on a similar alert. 
"The lesson we're learning," one administration official said today, "is that you can bomb the wrong place in Afghanistan and not take much heat for it. But don't mess up at the post office."
Today Mr. Bush was stretched across the war's two fronts. He spent hours in intelligence, F.B.I. and national security briefings, and had a session with the Joint Chiefs of Staff about the size and composition of America's arsenal of nuclear weapons. Then he flew to suburban Baltimore to promote his economic stimulus package.
Back in Washington, there were more reports of anthrax, and nothing seemed entirely under control.
The administration has come under intense criticism for not testing postal workers at the Brentwood facility -- which handles mail for Congress, the White House and much of residential Washington -- even while it was clearing Congressional office buildings and offering Cipro to hundreds on Capitol Hill. At least four employees at Brentwood have contracted anthrax, and two have died. 
And the White House abruptly reversed itself this week on Bayer A.G., the German pharmaceutical giant that makes Cipro, the anthrax antibiotic. Last week Tommy G. Thompson, the health and human services secretary, said it was illegal to break Bayer's patent to allow other companies to make generic versions. By Tuesday he was threatening to do exactly that, and he ultimately forced Bayer to sell the drug at about half the price it sought.
At the same time, the administration continues to send conflicting messages about how worried the public should be.
John E. Potter, the postmaster general, said this morning that he could not guarantee the safety of items delivered in the mail. But Ari Fleischer, the White House press secretary, said only hours later that the mail was "overwhelmingly presumed to be safe." By midafternoon, Mr. Fleischer had a slightly more refined riff. "People should feel safe opening their mail," he said. "People should also be alert as they proceed as they open their mail."
If the war at home seems more fumbling and disorganized than the war in Afghanistan, there may be a simple explanation: Americans are watching each anthrax case live on television, where every contradictory story and bureaucratic misstep is on display, while they are getting the Pentagon's sanitized version of the unseen battles half a world away.
It is hardly as if the air war in Afghanistan has been error-free. In the 18 days since the bombing started, American forces have mistakenly hit a residential area in Kabul, damaged a military hospital or a senior citizens' home (the United Nations and the Pentagon disagree) in Herat and a United Nations demining center, killing several employees. Yet the criticism has been relatively minor, especially compared with the reaction after civilians were killed in the bombing of a bunker in Baghdad in the Persian Gulf war. 
Why the difference? "We've been lucky that civilian casualties have been light," one senior administration official said today. But the White House has also been lucky that there are virtually no reporters or even independent observers in the Taliban-controlled sections of Afghanistan. That means no pictures of wounded or dead children, and it means the Pentagon's account of events trumps the Taliban's. 
The Pentagon has also thought out its public relations strategy. Briefings are often done by Defense Secretary Donald H. Rumsfeld, who sounds confident if curt, and the new chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, Gen. Richard B. Myers, who inspires confidence because of his long experience in the Air Force and good relations with the press.
Of course, all this could change quickly. A major mistake in bombing, the loss of a large number of American ground troops, a failure to find Taliban leaders or Osama bin Laden could all turn public opinion.
But for now, Americans seem far more concerned about their mail and their paychecks than the grainy war videos released by the Pentagon.
At moments, so does the president. Mr. Bush has long told aides that he will not repeat the mistake his father made: neglecting the domestic economy during the gulf war, which contributed to his father's defeat in 1992.
So today, in a speech to employees of a box-making plant in Glen Burnie, Md., Mr. Bush said: "Some might ask why, in the midst of war, I would come to Dixie Printing. 
"And the answer is because we fight in the war on two fronts. We fight a war at home, and part of the war we fight is to make sure that our economy continues to grow."

 BODY:
 Warnings and Precautions

UNDER ATTACK -- The postmaster general acknowledged that he could not guarantee the safety of the mail, and President Bush warned that the nation was "still under attack." Their statements reflected a growing sense that government officials had underestimated the threat posed by the anthrax contained in a handful of letters sent to Congress and news organizations. A1

MAIL PROTECTION -- The Postal Service plans to install devices in some threatened sites that would use powerful beams of electrons to kill anthrax and other deadly organisms in sacks of mail. B5

CARRIERS AT WORK -- Postal workers in Washington are going about their appointed rounds but feeling the stress of the anthrax attacks. B5

The Biological Threat

SEEKING A STRATEGY -- Public health and law enforcement authorities gathered at the White House to devise a strategy for responding to future strikes, which they say are almost certain to occur. A1

POWERFUL STRAIN -- Scientists in and out of government said that the anthrax attack on Capitol Hill involved an advanced powder that is quite dangerous and not relatively innocuous, as others have said. B6

ADVISING DOCTORS -- Federal health officials are urging the doctors treating Washington postal workers to look aggressively for symptoms of inhalation anthrax. B6

MORE ATTACKS SEEN -- Additional anthrax attacks are a virtual certainty, federal officials said, but they acknowledged that the case remained a mystery. B7

FLU SHOTS URGED -- Mayor Giuliani went beyond the usual recommendations of federal health officials by urging all New Yorkers to get flu shots. B7

FEARS AT MAIL CENTER -- Many workers at Morgan Station, New York's largest mail-sorting center, fear that anthrax may strike there next. B7

The Federal Response

THE HOME FRONT -- President Bush is finding that the more complex and dangerous front in the war on terrorism is in what the White House calls "the homeland." A1

SECRETARY IN SPOTLIGHT -- Tommy G. Thompson, the secretary of health and human services, has had a rocky start in obtaining and disseminating information on anthrax. B1

AGREEMENT ON CIPRO -- Federal officials and Bayer reached an agreement that will nearly halve the price the government pays for the anthrax medicine Cipro. B8

THE VACCINE BUSINESS -- The administration's plan to buy enough smallpox vaccine to inoculate every American has produced a surge of interest by pharmaceutical companies. B8

HELP FROM DRUG FIRMS -- In something of a reversal, four of the nation's biggest drug companies offered specific services in the government's battle against bioterrorism. C2

MAYORS SEEK AID -- Mayors meeting in Washington said they were asking for millions of dollars to help pay for the policing responsibilities thrust on them since Sept. 11. B8

Military Tactics

A LONG SIEGE -- Britain's top military officer said ground troops might have to survive in Afghanistan for weeks at a time if they are to ferret out and destroy Osama bin Laden's terrorist network. A1

WARNING ON SUPPLIES -- The Pentagon warned Afghans that the Taliban regime might poison humanitarian food supplies. B2

Battle on the Ground

MILITARY UNITY -- A program in which Green Berets train troops in Uzbekistan has blossomed into the large-scale American deployment of special forces units and aircraft. A1

FORCES PUT TO TEST -- Special assault units that a rebel Afghan leader put in place in the year before his assassination could prove to be the best chance the Northern Alliance has to breach the Taliban's defenses. B3

Anti-Taliban Allies

HIJACKERS MAINLY SAUDI -- Fifteen of the 19 men who hijacked four airplanes on Sept. 11 were from Saudi Arabia, federal authorities said, a disclosure likely to complicate diplomatic relations. A1

MAPPING THE FUTURE -- A huge assemblage of pre-Taliban Afghan leaders met in Pakistan to map strategy for a post-Taliban Afghanistan. B4

DEATHS IN VILLAGE -- The United Nations said that an American cluster bomb had left a village near a Taliban camp strewn with "bomblets" that killed eight people. B4

MONEY TO HIJACKER -- The man suspected of flying the second plane into the World Trade Center on Sept. 11 received $100,000 through a money changer in the United Arab Emirates last year. B3

Security and Policy

TERRORISM BILL PASSES -- The House passed sweeping antiterrorism legislation including new attacks on money laundering. B9

ECONOMIC MEASURE -- Saying business tax breaks are the best way to revive the economy, Republicans pushed their version of a recovery plan through the House. B9

COSTS OF OVERHAUL -- Proposals in Congress to overhaul airport security could enrich or harm the companies that now perform the task -- with costs as yet unclear for the airlines, travelers and taxpayers. B9

PILOTS AND SECURITY -- Airline pilots are becoming frustrated and worried about security. B9

SUITS AGAINST TERRORISM -- Important battles in the war on terrorism are likely to be fought in American courts through lawsuits against terrorists and those who support them. A19

MUSLIM POPULATION -- A new survey indicates that the Muslim population of the United States may be about 1.1 million, much smaller than has been widely estimated. A16

POLICIES FAULTED -- Many Arab-American groups are returning to positions they have long held: that military aid to Israel and sanctions against Iraq create the ideal atmosphere for recruiting terrorists. A16

MUSLIM COALITION -- A coalition of Muslim professionals was created after the attacks to educate fellow Americans that Islam neither endorses nor tutors terrorists. D2

Aftermath in New York

COUNTING THE DEAD -- Adding up numbers from sources including corporations, the Fire Department and the airlines, the total missing and presumed dead in the trade center disaster reaches about 2,950, a figure far lower than the city's estimate. B1

A SEARCH ENDS -- A man who spent years wondering where his father had gone received a saddening answer after the terror attacks. B1

TRACKING DONATIONS -- The American Red Cross has tentatively agreed to participate in a database that would keep track of how donations raised in the aftermath of Sept. 11 are distributed to families. B10

DOUBTS ABOUT AID -- Governor Pataki for the first time expressed doubts about the prospects of his $54 billion plan to help New York recover from the terror attacks. D8

The Arts

MEMORIAL PLANS -- A group of architects, artists and business people is trying to smooth the process of creating a trade center memorial. E1

Business

AID TO INSURERS -- President Bush's senior economic advisers said the nation would face an economic crisis if Congress failed to guard the insurance industry against losses from any future terrorist attacks. C1

HEADLINE: ART REVIEW; 
Brazil in All Its Extravagant Glory

BYLINE:  By MICHAEL KIMMELMAN 

 BODY:
FOR the Guggenheim's "Brazil: Body and Soul," the French architect Jean Nouvel has painted the rotunda black and turned off almost all the lights except for spotlights on the art and a projection on the ceiling to suggest a canopy of leaves, as if in a rain forest. 
 Half the rotunda is occupied by an immense altar, in gold, made in the 1780's, rising almost to the top of the building. From Sao Bento de Olinda, the altar's arrival was delayed by legal problems in Brazil apropos of Sept. 11, and now the museum will need several weeks to assemble it. When you see the show you find workers, some of them hanging from scaffolding 40 feet in the air, fitting pieces of the altar together. 
 There's more, of course. Videos of Brazil and Brazilian films are in the stairwells, while the top of the rotunda, devoted to modern Brazilian art, is all-white, the light from this part of the museum shielded by wavy black baffles that nod (one of Mr. Nouvel's smarter touches) to the architecture of the Brazilian modernist Oscar Niemeyer, or so it seems. 
The upshot: part 1970's nightclub, part trade fair, part boutique, part construction site. Mr. Nouvel's installation is not especially friendly to people who have trouble seeing in the dark, not to mention that the installation, like earlier transformations of the Guggenheim by famous architects, vies with the art it ostensibly caters to.
But what can I say? It's aptly over the top considering the show is about a culture gloriously, self-consciously excessive, and you would be missing something if you didn't see it, which in the end is almost all any museum can ask of its exhibition designer. 
In this respect and others, "Body and Soul" conforms to previous Guggenheim extravaganzas, each having provoked detractors who see in the director Thomas Krens's museum the end of civilization as we know it. Civilization, however, should survive this show, too, which could also cause people to become intrigued by Brazil, people who had not thought much about it before. Inspiring interest seems the bottom line of an exhibition's success.
Organized by Edward J. Sullivan, who oversaw the curatorial team that produced an accompanying six-pound catalog (a Guggenheim standard by now), the show doesn't pretend to be a comprehensive survey of Brazilian art. It's more of a phenomenal sampler, glamorously packaged, concentrating on the Brazilian Baroque, which here encompasses the 17th century through the early 19th century, and on the modern era.
Portugal colonized Brazil, then brought slaves from Africa. The Dutch came, too. So European, indigenous and African sources mixed. That mixture, diversely manifested, produced an amazing melting-pot vivacity.
The 20th century brought a fresh influx of foreign ideas, again melded to local interests. Artists like Tarsila do Amaral went to Paris in the 1920's and translated the forms of Leger and Andre Lhote into a language distinct to Brazil.
This transformation of Cubism and Futurism evolved eventually into an original brand of performance and conceptual art, always with ties to the past.
You can see these connections between early and later eras throughout the exhibition. Religious processions and Carnival became sources for innovators like Lygia Clark and Helio Oiticica, shamans of Brazilian postwar art, and for contemporaries like Ernesto Neto, whose work invites audience participation, too.
Physicality, spectacle, eroticism married to spirituality, and excess: these cliches of Brazilian culture are all present in the exhibition. 
Did I mention that many of the objects are stunning to look at? Mr. Nouvel's idea to put Baroque art in a dark space is counter-intuitive, the art being about light. But it is also about theater, which is conveyed by the theatricality of these works as they are picked out of the darkness by spotlights.
I am referring to sculptures more than to paintings. Painting wasn't a medium that inspired Brazilian artists the way sculpture did, although Brazil inspired European painters who traveled there. Fortunately, the Guggenheim will be getting from Copenhagen (the loan has been delayed) several of the Dutch artist Albert Eckhout's enormous ethnographic portraits and still lifes, painted in Brazil during the 17th century. They should improve the argument for the medium.
As for what came: indigenous works, like feathered masks and crowns in multicolored configurations, are inanimate behind glass, despite having been conceived to be objects in motion on the people who wore them. But even out of context they are amazing to see.
So are the Afro-Brazilian totems by Agnaldo Manoel dos Santos: black polished figures, bullet-shaped and perfectly smooth, from the 1950's.
Ex-votos, wood heads, hands, breasts, hearts and stomachs, made as offerings for healing miracles, are further evidence of popular craft, as are the ships' figureheads, enormous carved animals, mostly lions, the big surprise in the exhibition. 
Most stupendous, of course, is the altar, which if you are a cynic is a stunt of exhibition planning, but which also makes an important point about scale. Size counts in Brazil, not least because many of the sculptures in the show come from churches whose size and complexity are integral to the art but hard to convey. The altar provides a context.
These sculptures dominate the exhibition, by sheer number: a polychromed wood Christ, all lightness and elegance, by Frei Domingos da Conceicao e Silva; Christ bloodied, in different gory versions by various anonymous carvers; a black St. Elesbao, resplendently decorated and clunky, also by an anonymous artist; a stiff St. Francis receiving the stigmata from an even stiffer Christ, improbably sweet; and processional figures, meaning figures made to be carried in religious processions, that are folk mannequins, painted wood objects of hypnotic weirdness. 
Then come the works by the most famous sculptor of the Brazilian Baroque, Aleijadinho, the Little Cripple. Antonio Francisco Lisboa's unidentified malady, or so the story goes, compelled him to carve with tools strapped to his arms. To him is attributed, among various works, a St. George, extravagantly decorated, deeply sincere, whose innocence brings to mind a giant Christmas creche figure or toy soldier. Magnificently homegrown, Aleijadinho's style, notwithstanding its eloquence, exemplifies the gap between the Brazilian Baroque and its sophisticated European counterparts, which is in no way meant to imply a qualitative difference. 
Brazil clearly cultivated genius eccentrics like Aleijadinho. At the Venice Biennale several years ago, Arthur Bispo do Rosario's mixed-media constructions and fabric pieces were on view in Brazil's pavilion. Bispo do Rosario was another eccentric, a seaman, boxer, doorman, bodyguard, jailbird and mental patient who died in 1989 at the age of 78. He made altars out of sneakers and rubber sandals. He sewed banners out of bed sheets and embroidered them with long incantatory lists of places and people, including a presentation mantle he made for himself to wear before God on Judgment Day.
His work, gloriously intricate and colorful, is here, too, where it fits neatly, as he no doubt never intended, with Lygia Clark's and Helio Oiticica's interactive clothing and performance pieces, all of them conveying the same joyous ethos.
From Bispo do Rosario, Clark and Oiticica it is a natural step to a younger generation: to Mr. Neto, with his huge stocking stuffed with lavender, which you are invited to smell, and to Antonio Manuel, whose "Phantom" is a white room with black coals hung from the ceiling, through which we may navigate.
El Museo del Barrio at the moment has an elegant survey of contemporary Brazilian art, which raises similar points about the importance of touch and smell, about weaving and sewing, about indigenous traditions, impermanence and spectacle. Summing up any national culture, especially over the course of 400 years, is a fool's game, and I wasn't surprised to hear someone suggest that the Guggenheim would not have tried this if the country were Italy or France. Maybe. But that argument seemed a little too clever to me. I'm just grateful for art I hadn't seen before.
Anyway, after Sept. 11, "Body and Soul" may be the last of its kind for a while. To organize huge, expensive shows, the Guggenheim depends on tourists, and on corporate sponsors who depend on tourists, and you can't ask airline companies for money when they have their hands out, too. What the new economy means for the museum's big picture (for a Frank Gehry-designed Guggenheim in Lower Manhattan or for the Guggenheim's new Las Vegas sites, on which the whole museum was counting for cash) can't be known yet. It may be that the drift of American museums before Sept. 11, toward expansion and commercial enterprise, abruptly ended that day. Necessity will dictate retrenchment.
If so, the Guggenheim's critics, who already are saying "Body and Soul" was put together only to promote the idea of a Guggenheim branch in Brazil, may celebrate. But don't be too surprised if you end up pining for the days of shows like this.
"Brazil: Body and Soul" is at the Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum, 1071 Fifth Avenue, at 89th Street, (212) 423-3500, through Jan. 27. "The Thread Unraveled: Contemporary Brazilian Art" is at El Museo del Barrio, 1230 Fifth Avenue, at 104th Street, East Harlem, (212)831-7272, through Feb. 3.

HEADLINE: ART REVIEW; 
A Collection Where Cultures Connect and East Meets West

BYLINE:  By HOLLAND COTTER 

DATELINE: BALTIMORE 

 BODY:
"We're all connected" is the big-picture story of art. It always has been. If you have any doubts, visit the Walters Art Museum here, where that message comes across soft and clear, and in exquisitely concentrated form.
 There's no better time to make the trip. The museum has just fully reopened after a three-year renovation. A large chunk of its permanent collection has been reinstalled, a move that puts one of the country's finest gatherings of Egyptian and Byzantine art back on view. Its recent acquisitions of Ethiopian art, probably the best assemblage outside of Africa, are taking their inaugural bow. 
 Finally, and first to some of us, one of the most important collections of South Asian material in private hands is making its full-dress public debut in a special show titled "Desire and Devotion: Art From India, Nepal and Tibet in the John and Berthe Ford Collection." Devotees of Asian art already have their pilgrimage gear packed and Amtrak tickets reserved. 
With such exemplary things to contemplate, it's a little reassuring to learn that the museum's collection is not the product of some superorganized master plan, but came together almost by accident. The man who amassed it, the Baltimore-born entrepreneur Henry Walters (1848-1931), was a learning-on-the-job shopper. He had eclectic tastes and picked up this and that from here and there over a period of nearly 50 years, sometimes without being exactly sure of what he was getting.
His single biggest buy, for example, was basically a glorified version of a sealed box lot at a country auction. In 1902 the contents of the Palazzo Accoramboni in Rome were put up for sale. Despite rumors about the dubious quality of some of the work in the collection, Walters trusted that there were treasures to be had and dashed over to take a peek.
He couldn't see much. The palace was so cluttered and murky that almost nothing was readily visible, certainly not enough to make an informed selection. So in one of those big-spender American gestures that still leave the rest of the world gasping, he bought the whole package for what was then the stupefying sum of $1 million, with the idea that he'd sort it out later.
The gamble paid off. Sure, there was junk. But the good items were unbelievably good. The prize was a group of seven marble sarcophagi, as deep as hot tubs and covered with dense, high reliefs of twisting figures dating from the second century B.C. Now on display together in one small room, they are an overwhelming, almost suffocating presence, with a sculptural energy that keeps pushing you back out the door.
They are among the largest of the 20,000 pieces that Walters bequeathed to Baltimore, but not necessarily the most spectacular. His real love was for extravagantly wrought small objects. Hundreds of them are included in the revamped permanent galleries on the second and third floors of the museum's Center Street building. But even before you get to them, there are riveting things to see in the special exhibitions gallery on the first floor, where "Desire and Devotion" appears.
Organized by Hiram W. Woodward Jr., the museum's curator of Asian art, the show begins with early Indian sculptures of women, among them a sandstone figure of a goddess or nature spirit, now headless. Her voluptuous form is the quintessential Indian image of candid sexuality, an emblem of relaxed joie de vivre, as much part of the natural world as ripe fruit or an undulating landscape.
In her the sensual and the spiritual, usually kept separate in the West, merge. And their union is the underlying theme of the Ford collection. In some images, like an 18th-century miniature painting of two lovers holding lighted sparklers as they embrace, desire is a lighthearted, festive affair. But in art associated with the esoteric forms of Hinduism and Buddhism known as Tantra, it burns with a beyond-the-fringe devotional fervor.
Tantra is based on a body of texts, images and practices used as instruments of salvation. And salvation is achieved by disrupting the rhythms of everyday life, turning the world inside out. One way to do this is through meditation, a kind of shutting down in order to be beamed up, an intensely dynamic form of passive resistance. Another is by deliberately flouting accepted social mores, breaking taboos, sexual and otherwise, to get beyond the impulses they suppress and control.
Some of the most dramatic Tantric images are from the Himalayas. "Desire and Devotion" is rich in them, with highlights including a hypnotic painted mandala from Nepal with the Buddhist goddess of wealth, Vasudhara, sitting enticingly at its center, and a fiery Tibetan depiction of the deity Raktayamari copulating with his consort, a transcendent union of wisdom and compassion that can be conveyed only in an image of physical bliss.
The collection, ornamented with a catalog by the art historian Pratapaditya Pal, will be on the road over the next two years, but its future lies at the Walters. The Fords, longtime Baltimore residents, are giving all the objects in the show, along with 50 more, to the museum, an act of largesse that automatically makes this institution, which already has superb Asian holdings, a major player in South Asian art.
The Ford pieces will be in cosmopolitan company. A museum news release describes the reinstallation of the collection as telling the story of Western civilization from ancient Egypt to medieval Europe, which it more or less does, though there's a point of contention right at the start: some historians would strongly resist bringing Egypt under the Western umbrella. At the same time, more and more scholars are acknowledging the deep debt owed by European culture to African achievements. So the debate balances out.
There's no question that the Walters's Egyptian material is exceptional, and it looks that way in an atmospheric setting that simulates the shadowy interior of a temple sanctuary. A limestone tomb carving of a singer named Enehey sits majestically near the front, a rattle in her hand. Items from daily life -- pots and pans and makeup jars -- are shown nearby. Haunting faces float behind her: a quartzite head of a king, as sleek as a cat, and a gilded mummy mask with quizzical, staring eyes.
Branching out from either side of the Egyptian galleries are others devoted to the ancient Near East and the Mediterranean Classical world, which were both linked to Egypt and to each other through trade. The Classical selection is outstanding not only for the great sarcophagi, but also for Etruscan bronzes and a display of powerhouse Hellenistic jewelry studded with egg-size gemstones in the Oriental style.
But it is on the third floor, with Byzantine art saturated in religious emotion, that everything comes into rhapsodic focus. Organized by Gary Vikan, the Walters's director, these galleries show the museum at the top of its form, fleshing out the complex cultural map of early Christianity with an economy, thoroughness and beauty that institutions many times its size can only envy.
The Christian world is introduced by a simulation of a seventh-century Syrian altar set with silver liturgical vessels. From there, one path leads through Roman Catholic Europe, from gilded Romanesque reliquaries to a Gothic altar to a tiny portrait, cut from an altarpiece by Hugo van der Goes, of a man praying as John the Baptist leans over his shoulder as if whispering instructions.
Orthodox Christianity took other, separate directions, and does so here. In an octagonal gallery devoted to international Byzantine culture, one route heads north, with Russian icons and Armenian Gospels, objects attributed with miraculous powers that are easy to believe in from the examples here. The other moves south to Ethiopia, represented by a charismatic cluster of upright processional crosses surrounded by illuminated books.
A few years ago, museums barely knew Ethiopian art existed; the Walters began collecting it only in the mid-1990's. Yet the work is beautiful beyond words, and Ethiopia itself plays a distinctive, symbolic role within the context of African-American culture, from the social vision of Marcus Garvey to the Rastafarian mysticism of Bob Marley. This is the first time the Walters has shown its Ethiopian art in depth, and this part of the collection is worth a visit in itself.
But the reinstallation doesn't close its cultural embrace there. Adjacent to the Ethiopian work, the museum has placed the 11th-century wooden door from the ark of the Torah in the Ben Ezra Synagogue in Cairo. Just beyond that is the door of a Muslim tomb from 16th-century Iran.
In fact, if you stand at a certain point in the third-floor galleries, you will see the Gothic altar, the Ethiopian crosses, the doors of the Torah ark and the Islamic tomb fall into perfect visual alignment, their forms, so different in shape but so similar in spiritual purpose, overlapping and echoing one another. Could any perspective speak more directly and hopefully to the moment we live in now?
"Desire and Devotion: Art From India, Nepal and Tibet in the John and Berthe Ford Collection" is at the Walters Art Museum, 600 North Charles Street, Baltimore, (410) 547-9000, through Jan. 13. It travels to the Santa Barbara (Calif.) Museum of Art (March 2-June 2); the Albuquerque (N.M.) Museum of Art (Sept. 7-Jan.5, 2003); and the Birmingham (Ala.) Museum of Art (March 9-May 25, 2003). "Wondrous Journeys: The Walters Collection From Egyptian Tombs to Medieval Castles" is on permanent view.

HEADLINE: Sony Loss of $107 Million Adds to Gloom in Japan 

BYLINE:  By KEN BELSON 

DATELINE: TOKYO, Oct. 25 

 BODY:
The bad news pouring in from Japan's electronics industry is reinforcing fears about the depth of the global economic downturn. 
 The Sony Corporation, saying it saw little hope of a rebound in demand for electronics and components before spring, reported a net loss today of 13 billion yen ($107 million) in the quarter ended Sept. 30, not the small profit that analysts had expected. 
 Its sales of electronics, accounting for two-thirds of Sony's revenue, fell 4.9 percent from the period in 2000, more than wiping out gains made by its games and movie divisions. The company also wrote off inventory and costs related to reorganization of its Aiwa unit and other businesses and early retirement packages. 
"It's tough to see where the bottom is in the current environment," said Teruhisa Tokunaka, Sony's chief financial officer. "We have to be ready for this difficult situation to continue for some time." 
Even so, Sony stuck to its forecast for a 3 percent rise in sales and a net profit of 10 billion yen for the full fiscal year, which ends on March 31. The main reason is that its PlayStation 2 video game console is finally taking off: the company expects to sell 20 million of them by the end of the fiscal year and is doubling the number of software titles available for it, to almost 600. Sony's game division made money in the latest quarter for the first time since the console was introduced in late 1999.
Analysts say those forecasts will prove unrealistic if consumer demand for home electronics does not recover by Christmas, particularly in the United States, where Sony gets about one-third of its sales. Sony itself has said it expects a 10 percent fall in sales in the United States and Europe from now to March 31.
Sony announced some belt-tightening moves today, scaling back or closing 48 business units and looking for ways to reduce procurement costs by 15 percent, or 300 billion yen ($2.4 billion). Analysts said the moves would only partly offset the damage done to Sony's results by falling prices in important product categories like semiconductors, personal computers and display screens. Chip prices, for example, have fallen by about two-thirds in the last year, and Sony said today that its semiconductor sales fell by 25 percent just in the latest quarter.
The company's reputation suffered this year when it recalled more than a million cellphones because of software defects, taking a charge of 40 billion yen ($330 million). "Sony has lost a lot of credibility in the handset business in Japan," said Yukie Saito of Lehman Brothers in Tokyo. Sony has apparently also lost some credibility with investors: its stock price has fallen nearly 40 percent in Japan this year.
Sony still has hope for growth in the cellphone market outside Japan; it said it expected its new handset joint venture with Ericsson of Sweden to be profitable next year. 
Where Sony's fortunes depend on consumers buying gadgets, its rival Fujitsu, Japan's largest computer maker, needs a revival in business demand. On Wednesday the company reported a 4 percent decline in sales and a group net loss of 174.7 billion yen ($1.44 billion) for the half-year ended Sept. 30.
To cut costs, Fujitsu said it would add 4,500 more layoffs to the 16,400 it announced in August as part of a plan to refocus the company on more profitable software and services businesses and reduce the emphasis on hardware and components. 
The company said it now expected a loss of 310 billion yen ($2.6 billion) for the full year, including charges for reorganization and layoff costs and for write-offs in its semiconductor operations and staff reductions.
Analysts expect the news to be gloomy when another leading Japanese electronics company, NEC, reports results on Friday. NEC set aside plans for an American listing for its stock as the technology slump deepened over the summer.

HEADLINE: W.T.O. Says Trade Growth Will Be Virtually Stagnant 

BYLINE:  By ELIZABETH OLSON 

DATELINE: GENEVA, Oct. 25 

 BODY:
World trade, growing by leaps and bounds a year ago, has now all but stagnated, according to a study released today by the World Trade Organization. Meager growth of 1 or 2 percent is the best that can be expected this year, the study said.
 In its annual report on the state of world trade, the organization said that there was no sign of a return to the roaring 12 percent growth rate recorded in 2000. In May, the group forecast 7 percent growth in 2001, but demand in the global economy has since cooled much more quickly than the group anticipated, and the aftermath of the Sept. 11 terror attacks made matters much worse. 
 The subsequent slump in the airline, hotel, travel and tourism industries has shriveled international trade in services, the organization's analysts wrote. Furthermore, consumer demand in Western Europe has gone cold unexpectedly, and so have imports into the United States, the report said.
Another major contributor to the slowdown has been the worldwide fall in demand for information technology products, the 219-page report said. Worldwide sales of personal computers are expected to fall for the first time, and shipments of semiconductors in the first six months of this year fell 30 percent.
Asian nations have been hit hardest, because they conduct a large trade in such products. Only China appears to have escaped the downturn, posting a 9 percent increase in exports in the first half of the year.
Over all, the report said, based on performance in the first half of the year, Western Europe as a region could expect the most trade growth for the full year, at about 4 percent, while North America would be roughly flat or grow only slightly and Japan's trade would contract for the full year.
World trade has not grown as slowly as a 2 percent rate in any year since 1982.
The report sets a subdued stage for the organization's biennial conference next month, which is still scheduled to convene in Doha, Qatar, despite security concerns. One goal of the conference is to begin a new global round of talks on trade liberalization.

HEADLINE: Europe Holds the Line on Rates 

BYLINE:  By EDMUND L. ANDREWS 

DATELINE: FRANKFURT, Oct. 25 

 BODY:
Brushing aside signs of plunging business confidence and stagnating growth across Europe, the European Central Bank once again rebuffed widespread pleas today to reduce interest rates and stimulate the economy.
 The decision was a clear disappointment to investors and corporations, who have become more pessimistic than at any time in the last five years. It also puts the central bank on a collision course with European government leaders, who have already been pressing the central bank for easier money and are almost certain to become much more blunt in the weeks ahead. 
 Unlike the United States Federal Reserve, which has lowered interest rates nine times so far this year in hopes of rekindling growth, the European Central Bank is preoccupied with stamping out any hint of inflation and with maintaining the credibility of Europe's fledgling common currency, the euro. 
The result is that Europe's benchmark short-term interest rate, now at 3.75 percent, is significantly higher than the analogous rate in the United States, the Federal Reserve's overnight lending rate, even though inflation is slightly higher in the United States than in Europe.
The economic gloom over Europe has thickened and darkened considerably since the terrorist attacks on Sept. 11. Business confidence in Germany, Italy and Belgium has plunged in the last month, according to widely followed surveys in each country. Economic growth has all but stopped in Germany, Europe's biggest economy, and forecasters at Deutsche Bank warn that the 12 nations adopting the euro will not grow by more than 1 percent next year. 
Scores of German companies have announced plans to eliminate thousands of jobs each. They range from manufacturers like Siemens and MAN A.G. to chemical companies like BASF and banks like Commerzbank of Frankfurt. HypoVereinsbank said today that it would eliminate 9,000 jobs over the next year. BASF warned this week that it was sitting on huge inventories of chemicals that had gone unsold because business confidence had fallen so far.
Pressure on the European Central Bank has mounted from across Europe. Belgium's finance minister, Didier Reynders, has repeatedly goaded the central bank by insisting that it has room to relax monetary policy. France's finance minister, Laurent Fabius, has made similar remarks. 
Below the surface, the political pressure is much blunter still. "The markets expect a rate cut, and there is room to cut rates," an economist close to the Belgian government said. "If the situation deteriorates further and the E.C.B. does not react, this could have disastrous consequences."
Wim Duisenberg, president of the central bank, issued a brief statement about the decision today and refused to elaborate. But when he met with European political leaders last weekend in Ghent, Belgium, he said he did not want to act until the 12-country average annual inflation rate dropped to or below the bank's target of 2 percent. At the moment, it is more than 2.5 percent.
Many analysts think the central bank is moving far too slowly. After reducing interest rates in an emergency session shortly after Sept. 11, the central bank returned to its dogged opposition to easier money and ignored the Federal Reserve's move to flood the markets with new money.
"It is a great risk they are taking," said Holger Fahrinkrug, an economist in Frankfurt at UBS Warburg. "If the economy really gets much weaker in the next couple of months, people will blame it all on the E.C.B.
"The politicians in Germany and France won't say they got it wrong. They are going to say the E.C.B. got it wrong."
Under the treaties that govern the European Monetary Union, the European Central Bank is guaranteed political independence. Mr. Duisenberg has relished that independence, often going out of his way to gruffly reject advice from political leaders. 
But impatience and hostility to the bank's policies are on the rise. Gerhard Schroder, Germany's chancellor, acidly suggested that monetary policy had reached "the height of common sense." Germany, which accounts for one-third of the euro zone's economic output, has had no growth for months and will probably close out the year with an anemic showing of just three-quarters of 1 percent growth. Capacity utilization has plunged to its lowest level in years, and unemployment is rising steadily.
None of this has been helpful for the euro, even though the American economy is in much more dire straits than that of Europe, and even though a restrictive monetary policy often tends to strengthen a currency, to the detriment of exporters. 
The euro, wobbly against the dollar since Sept. 11, slipped immediately after the central bank announced its decision, but then regained its lost ground after a new statistical report from the United States showed an unexpectedly steep drop in orders for durable goods. In European trading, the euro rose a bit to 89.6 American cents.
Robert Hayward, a currency analyst at ABN Amro in London, said the euro could easily drop further in value if investors decide that pump-priming by the Federal Reserve is more likely to produce faster growth in the United States. 
"There is a real premium on economic growth," Mr. Hayward said. "What the market seems to be doing is looking forward to 2002 and saying that the Federal Reserve seems to be doing what is needed."

HEADLINE: WPP Is Rebuffed in Effort to Break a Deal 

BYLINE:  By SUZANNE KAPNER 

DATELINE: LONDON, Oct. 25 

 BODY:
The WPP Group, the giant British advertising agency company, had a setback today in its attempt to abandon a deal to acquire the Tempus Group, a media-buying concern, when British regulators ruled that it must proceed. The deal is worth more than $620 million at current exchange rates.
 WPP said it would appeal the decision. 
 The company had asked regulators for permission to invoke an escape hatch, saying that the terror attacks of Sept. 11 had brought about adverse changes in Tempus's business.
The regulatory body, the Panel on Takeovers and Mergers, did not provide details of how it reached its decision. But analysts said the panel had probably concluded that a downturn affecting the entire advertising industry did not qualify as a valid reason for invoking the escape clause.
Shares of Tempus rose 3.9 percent yesterday, to 530 pence ($7.58).
Tempus, which buys advertising space and plans media budgets for clients, would account for only 4 percent of WPP's revenue. Some investors said they were more interested in what they considered a larger problem: how the overall economic slump would affect WPP's core advertising revenue.
"The advertising business is far more important and will determine the future of WPP much more than Tempus," said Mark Westwood, an analyst with Legg Mason Investors, the British arm of the United States fund management company.
WPP said today that it might miss profit targets, and that revenue for all of 2001 could fall 2 percent. It estimated that the Sept. 11 attacks reduced revenue the last three weeks of September by $30 million. The decline was so swift that WPP was unable to cut costs fast enough, the company said.
Sir Martin Sorrell, WPP's chief executive, said ensuing events like the anthrax attacks in the United States that have roiled the postal service, have raised fresh questions, especially for direct marketers.
WPP's third-quarter revenue rose 41 percent, lifted by last year's acquisition of Young & Rubicam.
The shares rose 5.6 percent yesterday, to 591.5 pence ($8.44).
"It is a relief bounce," Mr. Westwood said. "People are glad that things aren't worse."
In recent weeks, Havas, the French rival that WPP outbid for Tempus, and Cordiant Communications of Britain have both warned that profits for the year might fall short of expectations.
WPP and Tempus will now present their arguments to the takeover panel's governing body, some 20 executives from the financial community.
But some analysts remained skeptical that, without new information, the ruling would be overturned. "Given that WPP's argument had been rejected once, it's hard to see how it could win on appeal," Nicola Stewart, an analyst with Commerzbank Securities, said.

HEADLINE: WORLD SERIES PREVIEW; 
Schilling Builds on Father's Influence

BYLINE:  By TYLER KEPNER 

DATELINE: PHOENIX, Oct. 25 

 BODY:
There will be more than 48,000 fans at Bank One Ballpark when Curt Schilling throws the first pitch of the World Series on Saturday. At least one of the seats will be empty.
 That is the seat left for Cliff Schilling, who has had a ticket for each of the nearly 300 games his son has started in the major leagues. Cliff died in 1988, Curt's first year in the majors. His influence has never left. 
 "Mentally, I would like to think we're very close," said Schilling, the Arizona Diamondbacks' bulky and overpowering right-hander. "Physically, we're built alike. But my dad was a quiet person, very calm, never rattled. And I'm far from quiet." 
Except on the days he starts, Schilling is loud. His friend and former manager with the Philadelphia Phillies, Terry Francona, joked that the best days were when Schilling pitched, because he was all action, no talk.
A piece of paper titled "Patton's Address to His Troops" is taped to the side of Schilling's locker, next to a photo of George C. Scott as General Patton. It is evidence of Schilling's enthusiasm for motivating others, and it stems from a passion instilled by his father.
Schilling's father served 22 years in the Army, spending some time in the 101st Airborne and retiring as a Master Sergeant. Schilling was born in Anchorage, and the family moved around. "He was just your basic run-of-the-mill grunt," Schilling said.
Schilling, 34, grew up with a sense of history and feelings of national pride instilled by his father. He is so passionate about military history that he once published a magazine about a World War II board game and now owns a company, Multiman Publishing, that creates similar games for Hasbro.
"One of the things I've tried to understand and comprehend is why we have what we have and why we are what we are right now as a nation," Schilling said. "Starting with my generation and some of the generations that have followed, you could ask them what D-Day is and they would probably give you the name of a band or something."
After the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks, Schilling wrote a column for ESPN's Web site and urged all players to donate one day's salary to relief efforts. On Wednesday, he left the Diamondbacks' clubhouse wearing an F.D.N.Y. T-shirt. He returned the next morning wearing a shirt with a patriotic message. He has written "God Bless America" in silver letters around the American flag on his cap this postseason and will visit the World Trade Center site on Monday.
Schilling is uncomfortable with the portrayal of the Yankees as the sentimental favorites because of how that role casts the Diamondbacks.
"I don't want people to think that it's us against them," Schilling said. He also rejects any comparison between wars and ballgames. "I don't look at the baseball field as a battlefield," he said. "That would be belittling what war really is."
In the strict baseball sense, though, Schilling's aggressiveness and mentality can make him seem like a warrior, in the way George Steinbrenner uses the term for Paul O'Neill. Schilling writes "Whatever It Takes" under the bill of his cap and has a passion for finishing what he starts.
Schilling has 71 complete games since 1992, matching Greg Maddux for the most in the majors. He has completed his last four starts in the postseason, including three this year, and in 1998 he pitched more complete games, 15, than 24 teams.
"You give him the ball before the game," Francona said, "and you've got to wrestle it away from him three hours later."
In the Yankees' last 75 postseason games, only one pitcher -- Cleveland's Bartolo Colon in the 1998 American League Championship Series -- has thrown a nine-inning complete game against them. Schilling could be the next. Lots of pitchers say they want to complete their starts, Francona said, but few really know how. Schilling has learned to economize his pitches and find something extra late in games.
Schilling might throw fastballs averaging 94 miles an hour for eight innings. Then, in a crucial spot in the ninth, he may show hitters something much harder. Randy Johnson, the Diamondbacks' other ace, is the same way.
"They can be their own closers," Arizona catcher Damian Miller said. "That's why those two have so many complete games, because they have the ability to change themselves physically to change the outcome of the game. Curt's throwing 94 and all of a sudden he'll throw one 99 miles an hour -- after 100 pitches, which is freaky."
There is no special sign he can give for that, Miller said. It is a level Schilling reaches on his own. Besides, while Johnson relies heavily on Miller to call a game, Schilling decides what to throw. 
His preparation allows him to do that. Schilling has extensive video clips of opposing hitters on his laptop and keeps a hand-written, detailed notebook on hitters' tendencies, which he and Miller consult on the bench between innings.
Before his start against Atlanta in the championship series, Schilling and Miller looked at video of Chipper Jones for 15 minutes, breaking down at-bats from Jones's entire seven-year career. This week, Schilling said, he has spent hours studying the Yankees, getting tips in telephone conversations with the Phillies coach John Vukovich and others.
"Curt's the most prepared player I've ever been around," Miller said. "When you study as much as he does and do all that kind of stuff, you have a tendency to trust him and trust what he wants to throw."
Schilling has a splitter and two breaking balls to complement his fastball, and he uses them to both blow away and baffle hitters. His style is nothing like Maddux's, but they are similar in one way.
"Greg Maddux was the smartest pitcher I ever played with until I met Curt Schilling," Arizona first baseman Mark Grace said. "Curt Schilling's the smartest I've ever played with."
Grace hit Schilling well when he played for the Cubs, but facing him was never fun. "And now I know why: because he knew everything about me going into it," Grace said.
It was not always this way. When Schilling came up with the Baltimore Orioles, he was a brash kid with a mohawk haircut and no plan for his starts. He was shifted to middle relief, traded to Houston and pitched decently. Then he met Roger Clemens, and everything changed.
Schilling and Clemens were both working out at the Astrodome one day after the 1991 season. Clemens, who had just won his third Cy Young Award for the Boston Red Sox, had heard Schilling, 25, wanted to meet him.
"I said I would love to talk to him," said Clemens, the Yankees' Game 3 starter, "but I didn't want to waste my time."
Clemens was an established star by the time he was 25, and he saw in Schilling a pitcher with a similar body type and style who had achieved almost nothing. Clemens was blunt.
You get out of baseball what you put into it, Clemens told him. If you don't work hard off the field, he said, you cheat yourself, your teammates and your family. Schilling said the lesson took hold immediately.
"It was like getting a third eye," Schilling said. "I looked at the game with a whole new approach, outlook, respect. I just realized that I couldn't continue to do things the way I had done them and put my head on the pillow at night and say I'd done everything I could. There was just so much more that I could do."
The Astros did not wait for the new Schilling. They traded him to Philadelphia for Jason Grimsley the next spring, and a year later Schilling was pitching in the World Series and embarking on a standout career. Clemens has watched with pride.
"He continues to want to get better, and that's something that you admire," Clemens said. "He doesn't look like he's wasting time, and he's knocking down new thresholds, finding out where he can go and how good he can be."
Schilling has tried to impart similar lessons on young pitchers, not always successfully. In Philadelphia, Francona said, he scolded Garrett Stephenson about his work habits and implored him to get more out of himself. Stephenson would blossom years later, but he did not understand Schilling's message at the time.
In Arizona, Schilling has tried again. After a bad outing by the rookie right-hander Mike Koplove in September, Schilling suggested he keep a notebook on opposing hitters. Koplove thinks he might. Arizona Manager Bob Brenly said he has seen a difference in the staff because of Schilling's influence.
"Maybe they approach their craft a little more seriously now, a little more diligently in their digesting of the scouting reports and looking at the video," Brenly said. "It just seems to me that as a staff, our guys have a much better idea of what they want to do."
The problem with young pitchers, Schilling said, is that so many of them fear failure. Why commit to extra work when it does not guarantee results? If Schilling has gotten through to teammates the way Clemens reached him, great, he said. But it is never really up to the person giving the lecture.
"It's not as much the talker as it is the talkee when it comes to stuff like that," Schilling said. "You have to have the strong desire to want to be good, and that's something I've always had. I've always wanted to be better than everybody else in the room. And I've never been afraid to take the steps to figure out if I could do that."

HEADLINE: Economic Data Are Suggesting Slower Recovery 

BYLINE:  By DAVID LEONHARDT 

 BODY:
With the Federal Reserve cutting interest rates and Congress vowing to pass a large stimulus package, economists have said that the current downturn could end up being a short one. The economic shock from the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks would make the slowdown worse, many analysts said, but the reaction would have the economy growing again by the start of next year.
 That outcome has suddenly begun to appear less certain. 
 In recent days, a handful of economic indicators have been even weaker than expected, suggesting that a recovery could be difficult for policy makers to bring about quickly. Businesses continue to cut their spending, layoffs are still mounting and consumers are displaying growing signs of hesitation. 
After the release of a new round of statistics yesterday, bond prices rose as investors bet that the Federal Reserve was now almost certain to lower its benchmark short-term interest rate by another half-point before the end of the year. Stocks fell broadly in the morning but recovered in the afternoon, with the Dow Jones industrial average closing up 117.28 points, or 1.25 percent, at 9,462.90.
The Commerce Department said yesterday that companies' new orders for durable goods -- typically expensive items that last at least three years -- fell 8.5 percent in September, to $165.4 billion, their lowest level since 1996. Sales of existing homes, meanwhile, dropped 11.7 percent last month, the National Association of Realtors said yesterday.
The economy continues to suffer this month, too. Commodity prices, which reflect demand for raw materials, remain low. Jobless claims rose to 504,000 last week, climbing above 500,000 for the second time in recent weeks, the Labor Department said yesterday; the level had not previously been as high since 1992. 
With every other large economy in the world struggling as well, the United States could have difficultly emerging from its slowdown in the coming months, according to a growing group of investors and analysts. 
"We are in a global, synchronized recession," said Lakshman Achuthan, the managing director of the Economic Cycle Research Institute in New York. "Those are really hard to get out of," Mr. Achuthan added, because companies cannot shift their resources to economies that are still growing. The last recession to be so widespread occurred in the mid-1970's and lasted for almost a year and a half.
Today, government officials are trying to rouse the economy by cutting interest rates, lowering taxes and increasing spending. 
With the support of the White House, the Republican-led House of Representatives passed a $100 million stimulus package on Wednesday, consisting mostly of tax reductions they say will encourage new spending. Democratic leaders in the Senate are proposing a smaller bill -- about $70 billion -- that would give less money to businesses while subsidizing health care coverage for unemployed workers.
Already, the Federal Reserve has lowered its federal funds rate to 2.5 percent, from 6.5 percent, since the start of the year. That makes it less expensive for businesses and consumers to take on new debt and lowers the cost of their existing debt, giving them more cash to spend.
But even before the attacks, the economy seemed somewhat unresponsive to the Fed's push, and many economists blamed the unusual nature of this downturn.
Recessions in the United States typically begin with consumers cutting their spending, often in reaction to interest rate increases brought about by Fed officials worried about inflation. Sales then decline, businesses lay off workers and consumer spending drops further.
This year, however, companies were the first to cut their budgets, as many executives realized that their earlier sales projections -- made in the heady late 1990's -- had been far too optimistic. Having added more workers, more factories and more equipment than they need, companies have cut spending severely over the last year.
Still, only about 75 percent of the nation's industrial capacity is now being used, the lowest level in 18 years, and profits are still falling. 
"There will be further rounds of layoffs," predicted Michael K. Evans, the chief economist of the American Economics Group, a consulting firm in Washington. In the current circumstances, he added, lower interest rates and taxes will not be enough to convince many companies to increase spending immediately.
"There's no magic bullet," Mr. Evans said.
Consumer spending remains healthier, though it is weakening. 
Last week, the number of people applying for a mortgage to buy a house fell to its lowest level since last year, according to an index calculated by the Mortgage Bankers Association of America. The decline erased the index's gains during late September. "It was a big enough drop that I would say it signifies something," said Douglas G. Duncan, the association's chief economist.
But even if a recession lasts longer than many economists had hoped -- into next spring, for example -- few doubt that the short-term recovery will be stronger than it would have been without the attacks. Eventually, economists say, the government's stimulus will have a significant effect and both consumers and businesses will decide they have delayed purchases long enough.
"Sharp recessions beget very strong recoveries," Mr. Achuthan said. "There is a larger amount of pent-up demand that at some point, when the floodgates open, comes out real quick."

HEADLINE: House Passes a War-Bond Bill, but Bush Is Not Enthusiastic 

BYLINE:  By LIZETTE ALVAREZ 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Oct. 25 

 BODY:
Eager to strike a patriotic chord, the House passed a bill this week to offer old-fashioned war bonds for the first time since World War II.
 The Treasury Department, though, is reluctant to support the measure because it fears the bonds will encourage saving and discourage spending, making it harder for the country to recover from the recession many economists now say has begun. 
 The legislation, approved by a voice vote on Tuesday, would give the Treasury the authority to issue Freedom Bonds, a new class of savings bonds that would be offered along with its existing bonds. 
"These war bonds serve as an ideal vehicle for Americans to support efforts to bring those responsible for these attacks to justice," said Representative John E. Sweeney, Republican of New York, who sponsored the bill. "The bonds will provide the average citizen with a convenient option for exercising their patriotism and showing their support for our efforts."
The Senate has already passed a similar measure, sponsored by Senator Mitch McConnell, Republican of Kentucky, as part of a bill to finance the Treasury Department.
While calling the bill a good patriotic gesture, the Bush administration is not going out of its way to promote the legislation, arguing that in today's economy it is important to encourage consumers to spend.
Under the bill, savings bond proceeds would go directly into the government's general spending fund.
"War bonds are one of several opportunities for Americans who wish to make patriotic gestures," said Betsy Holahan, a spokeswoman for the Treasury Department. "We certainly advocate direct giving to charities, as well as maintaining regular consumer spending, which is so critical to our economy. A strong economy is perhaps our greatest asset as we move forward in the efforts to fight global terrorism."
Jack Quinn, the chief operating officer of U.S. Savings Bond Consultant, a New Jersey company that analyzes government savings bonds, said war bonds made a lot of sense in the early 1940's, when consumer goods were scarce and Americans had few ways to use their money.
"Now the government is flush with money," he said, "and we're facing a recession. The only way you get out of it is by spending. Instead of investing in savings bonds, you ought to go buy a dishwasher or an automobile."
Mr. Quinn also points out that government-issued savings bonds are already available. The government offers the Series I, which yields 5.92 percent, and the series EE, which yields 4.5 percent.
The government first began selling savings bonds to pay for the Union effort during the Civil War. During World War II, Americans bought $185 billion in war bonds.
The House legislation empowers the Treasury to set the new bond's yield and maturity rate. Ms. Holahan said it would take the agency one month to set the program in motion.
Representative Amo Houghton, Republican of New York, said he originally opposed the bill because he wanted Americans to make purchases rather than buy bonds. "But then in thinking through what is happening here, everybody wants to be a part," he said. "I think this is a worthy cause and something which Americans can identify with, and I think it is the right thing to do."

HEADLINE: THE MARKETS: STOCKS & BONDS; 
Despite Dismal Economic News, Shares Post Solid Gains

BYLINE:  By MICHAEL BRICK 

 BODY:
Stocks reversed sharp early losses and finished with solid gains yesterday as investors displayed confidence in the government's ability to stimulate the economy.
 Technology shares led the afternoon surge as investors overcame their initial discouragement, caused when new data showed that the Sept. 11 attacks had a harsher effect on the economy than Wall Street had expected. Investors have shrugged off many negative reports in the last week, but the latest reports were the most relevant and dismal yet, showing steeper-than-expected declines in September housing sales and orders for durable goods. 
 By the end of the day, though, the market had taken the data in stride, apparently seeing it as a sign that the government would work harder to stimulate the economy. The market has been driven by mood lately, with many analysts talking more about the fear over anthrax than earnings, and market strategists were somewhat hard pressed to explain the reaction to the new data. 
"I'm at a loss, a little bit," said James W. Paulsen, chief investment officer at Wells Capital Management in Minneapolis, adding that the economic reports could lead the Federal Reserve to lower its benchmark interest rate for the 10th time this year, to 2 percent from 2.5 percent.
After falling as much as 167 points, the Dow Jones industrial average rebounded to gain 117.28 points, or 1.3 percent, to 9,462.90. The technology-weighted Nasdaq composite index rose 43.93 points, or 2.5 percent, to 1,775.47. The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index climbed 14.89 points, or 1.4 percent, to 1,100.09.
Yesterday's weak economic reports caused Lehman Brothers to predict a deeper recession than it had previously forecast. Since the terrorist attacks on the World Trade Center and the Pentagon, the Fed has quickly reduced interest rates, cutting the federal funds rate on overnight loans between banks to 2.5 percent from 3.5 percent before Sept. 11. The government has, meanwhile, promised a package of extensive tax breaks and new spending.
Much of the economic deterioration from the attacks became clear for the first time yesterday in reports based largely on data gathered after Sept. 11. Orders for durable goods fell 8.5 percent, to $165.44 billion, the lowest level since August 1996; the drop was far steeper than expected. Sales of existing single-family homes dropped 11.7 percent, the biggest decline in more than six years. And initial claims for unemployment benefits last week hit their second-highest level in more than nine years.
"The recession that we're in will go a little bit deeper," said Charles L. Reinhard, a senior strategist at Lehman Brothers. "It's difficult to negatively surprise the market beyond what we saw on Sept. 11." But he added that investors discovered yesterday that "the fourth quarter is going to be a deep-negative G.D.P. quarter, it's going to be a deep-negative earnings quarter."
The bond market rallied on the weak data. The price of the benchmark 10-year Treasury note rose 14/32 , to 103 20/32 , while its yield, which moves in the opposite direction, fell to 4.54 percent, from 4.59 percent on Wednesday. The 30-year bond rose 27/32 , to 101 12/32 , while its yield fell to 5.28 percent from 5.34 percent.
Shares of technology companies, their earnings outlooks among the least clear, posted solid gains, with semiconductor stocks showing unusual strength. Xilinx rose $4.15, to $33.30; KLA-Tencor jumped $4.39, to $45.25; and Applied Materials gained $2.09, to $37.43. The Philadelphia Stock Exchange's semiconductor index rose 24.25 points, or 5.26 percent, to 485.10.
Microsoft rose $1.24, to $62.56, as the company introduced its Windows XP operating system.
Some Dow components fell in the morning but turned around and posted gains by the end of the day. American Express rose 68 cents, to $30.67; Disney was up 58 cents, to $19.02; and Intel gained 62 cents, to $26.10.
Among other issues, Dow Chemical said its earnings dropped 84 percent, and its stock fell 15 cents, to $34.85. Goodyear Tire and Rubber reported a 45 percent decline in earnings, which was not as bad as analysts had expected, and its stock gained 48 cents, to $19.23.

HEADLINE: News Helicopters Curbed by Air Restrictions 

BYLINE:  By GREG WINTER 

DATELINE: LOS ANGELES, Oct. 25 

 BODY:
Squirming restlessly, Aaron Fitzgerald spends much of his day at a desk now, flipping the channels of his three police scanners in the distant hope that he will come across something really worthwhile. A fire. A car chase, perhaps. Maybe even a bomb scare.
 The phone rings. From the stairwell of an office tower in Los Angeles, a man on a cellphone says thousands are being evacuated. Itching to take to skies, Mr. Fitzgerald, a helicopter reporter for KCBS television, merely grunts in frustration. The building is in the no-fly zone that covers the city like a blanket, forcing him to pass on yet another breaking news event. 
 "I would have been there to film the fire department arriving," said Mr. Fitzgerald, wistfully. "There are so many stories that we've just had to let go."
This week, the Federal Aviation Administration opened the skies over the nation's largest cities to virtually anyone who owns an aircraft, including recreational pilots, responding to Congressional complaints that the nation's economy had been grounded along with its private planes.
Yet news helicopters of every kind, whether peering down at traffic or hovering over crime scenes, still have to keep clear of most major metropolitan areas for reasons that have lobbyists and legislators guessing.
"If we don't get some information this week, we are prepared to subpoena the National Security Council," said Representative John L. Mica, a Florida Republican who chairs the House subcommittee on aviation. "They should at least give us a reason."
Publicly, the aviation agency simply says news helicopters, with a small group of other aircraft like sight-seeing tours and banner-toting planes, present unique threats to national security, but it has refrained from specifying what those risks are. In private, however, agency officials say that the erratic flight paths of news helicopters, which often change as quickly and significantly as the day's events unfold, make it hard to distinguish between legitimate pilots and potential terrorists.
Television and radio stations around the country complain that the restrictions strip them of an important news-gathering tool, depriving viewers of the type of instant information they take for granted.
"We've created this expectation for immediate news," said Barbara Cochran, president of the Radio-Television News Directors Association, which has been pressuring Congress to get the ban lifted. "And now at a time when our viewers need information more than ever, we can't bring it to them."
Without their helicopters, Ms. Cochran said, television stations were unable to cover a toxic spill at a chemical plant in Houston, because the roads around it were closed. Nor could they reach a wooded part of Orlando, Fla., where a student pilot, unfettered by the restrictions that news helicopters face, recently crashed his plane.
But perhaps no city has been as affected by the no-fly zone as Los Angeles, where the art form was born. Since its beginnings in the late 1950's, when pilots stuck a studio camera in the passenger seat and hovered 50 feet above a local parade, tethered to the ground by a ribbon of thick power cords, the news helicopter has practically come to define television journalism in Los Angeles, delivering some of the most striking and contentious images in the city's recent history.
The sight of O. J. Simpson's white Ford Bronco fleeing from the police in 1994, just like the live broadcast of a man committing suicide on a crowded Los Angeles freeway in 1998, drew huge numbers of viewers, proving the commercial importance of news helicopters even as it raised objections to their use.
And with seemingly endless swaths of highway that are often too congested for news vans to traverse, Los Angeles television stations say reporting the news or keeping watch on traffic is nearly impossible without the ever-present whirlybirds that previously speckled the city's skies.
"We're willing to do anything to ease the F.A.A.'s concerns," said Mike Nolan, a helicopter reporter for KFI-AM and KOST-FM in Los Angeles. "But they just won't give us a chance."
Helicopters can still skirt the city's periphery, as long as they remain at least 25 miles away from a major airport. In cities like Los Angeles, though, that eliminates nearly all of the metropolitan area, where news stations say more than two-thirds of the events they cover normally take place.
Knowing how important live images are to their competitive edge, some television stations say they simply choose not to cover events, like bomb scares at Los Angeles airport, if they cannot get pictures of the action in time. In a strange bit of luck for many news shows, the dry winds have spread brush fires throughout the outlying hills, giving helicopters plenty to chase outside the no-fly zone.
Traffic reports, however, are not so easily replaced, and because news helicopters cannot circle over downtown highways to see for themselves they are forced to rely on the California Highway Patrol's computers for road conditions.
During the temporary ban, some industry watchers hope that television stations will lessen their dependence on live feeds from helicopters.
"There's no question that they've been overused," said Joan Bieder, a senior lecturer at the Graduate School of Journalism at the University of California at Berkeley, who teaches television production. "The practice has less to do with journalism than marketing."
As for many of the Los Angeles residents who have grown accustomed to the clamor of rotors above their heads, the temporary ban is nothing short of a welcome relief. "It's so quiet it's wonderful," said Austin Ray, 42, a singer from West Hollywood. "We sleep much better now."

HEADLINE: The Big City; 
Skating Along Despite Trying Times

BYLINE:  By JOHN TIERNEY 

 BODY:
AFTER the guys in moon suits appeared for the second time in our building to investigate powder-filled letters, I asked a clerk in the mailroom how he was coping with the new drawbacks of his job. He said he didn't like working with plastic gloves (too hot) or worrying that any piece of mail could be fatal. But what really bothered him was his commute.
 "Nothing scares me as much as taking the subway," he said. "Here we're taking precautions. Down in the subway you're helpless if someone releases something." 
 You could argue with that comparative risk assessment, given that anthrax has been found in mail at other news organizations. But he's right to recognize that the rest of the the city is potentially as dangerous as a mailroom. New York, unlike Afghanistan, is a target-rich environment.
We could use irradiation to kill bacteria in every piece of mail, and terrorists could find countless other ways to spread anthrax. We could search every subway rider, and terrorists could still attack restaurants and offices with germs or bombs. If we miraculously kept terrorists out of every building, they could go on murderous rampages using nothing more sophisticated than cars on crowded sidewalks.
At best, the precautions can stop some terrorists and prevent another mass murder so spectacular that it causes masses of people and businesses to flee the city. But the main effect of the measures will probably just be to divert terrorists to other targets. No amount of precautions can stop determined terrorists from killing New Yorkers.
We're vulnerable because there are so many of us crowded together. Randal O'Toole, an economist with the Thoreau Institute and a defender of suburban sprawl, notes how much less damage the sprawling Pentagon suffered on Sept. 11 compared with the World Trade Center towers, and he sees a similarity between Al Qaeda and suburbia.
"The very reason that terrorism is so hard to combat is that terrorists absolutely refuse to bunch up," he writes. "Though Americans may want to defy the terrorists, the notion that we should all subsidize New York's position as America's economic capital, effectively bunching ourselves up, is absurd."
He and others have argued that Manhattan is a dinosaur in the decentralized era of the Internet, and that terrorism now gives people yet another reason to prefer low-rise communities like Silicon Valley. But city dwellers have always faced special dangers. Their density made them vulnerable to crime and violence, to plagues (nature's bioterrorism) and to fires that routinely devastated huge sections of cities.
Yet cities survived and grew because the risks of density were outweighed by the benefits. Those benefits are still enough to keep people in New York -- if we don't respond to recent events by making life prohibitively inconvenient here. But so far, security precautions are probably doing more to discourage residents than terrorists.
DESPITE all the publicity, so far the odds of contracting anthrax in New York are small, even if you're a postal worker or a journalist. But the odds are quite high that you've been delayed by a checkpoint on the road or a shutdown of a subway line. Subway stations are closed every day as police investigate "suspicious substances" that turn out to be baby powder, Sweet'n Low or sugar from a doughnut. Yesterday there were six separate closings affecting nine subway lines between 7 a.m and 3 p.m.
These investigations don't seem to accomplish anything except to drive people like me and Andrea Truppin off the subway. I met her yesterday at a stoplight on 12th Avenue and 55th Street, as we were on our new commuting vehicles: Rollerblades. Rollerblades. Ms. Truppin, a communications consultant who commutes from the Upper West Side to Wall Street, had given up on mass transit.
"The 1 train just kept getting delayed," she said. "I'd never really been claustrophobic, but I got anxious when we kept stopping between stations. One day I tried going over to the East Side to catch the subway, but there was a police investigation going on there, too. I even went all the way crosstown to catch a ferry on the East River, but that just took too long."
We both knew that skating had its own risks -- probably greater than anything terrorists posed in the subways or the mails. But we also figured that the risks of getting hit by a car were small compared with the immediate benefit of not sitting in a stalled train for half an hour while the police investigated the remnants of a jelly doughnut.

Bayer Seen Breaking Even On Cipro Deal and May Profit
When Bayer agreed to sell 100 million tablets of its anthrax medicine, Cipro, to the government for 95 cents each, Bayer and the Bush administration said the deal assured an ample supply at a very low price.
 But executives at generic drug companies and suppliers of pharmaceutical raw materials say that Bayer is breaking even and may even be making a large profit. And some infectious-disease experts warn that Bayer remains unable to supply enough Cipro if terrorists start releasing anthrax strains that are resistant to other antibiotics. Page A1.

HEADLINE: TECHNOLOGY; 
Jupiter, Internet Research Firm, Is Being Bought by NetRatings

BYLINE:  By SAUL HANSELL 

 BODY:
Jupiter Media Metrix, the Internet research firm that once was one of the pillars of Silicon Alley in New York, agreed yesterday to sell itself to the much smaller NetRatings of Milpitas, Calif., in Silicon Valley.
 The deal values Jupiter at $71.2 million, or $1.95 a share. The company's shares traded as high as $65 in October 1999, but had fallen to 63 cents yesterday before the deal was announced. NetRatings shares closed yesterday at 13.09; its record high had been $53. 
Jupiter Media Metrix was formed in June 2000 as the combination of Media Metrix, which monitors a sample of Web users to tell advertisers and investors which sites are the most popular, with Jupiter Communications, a collection of young analysts that specialized in advising big companies about how to get hip to the Internet.
NetRatings, originally a spinoff of the electronics company Hitachi, was another attempt to measure the audience of Web sites. It combined in September 1999 with a similar effort from A. C. Nielsen, the company that measures television audiences. VNU, the Dutch firm that owns Nielsen, owns 70 percent of NetRatings and will own 58 to 60 percent of the combined company, which has not been named yet.
Jupiter Media Metrix had four times the revenue of NetRatings and its rating service was more widely followed both on Madison Avenue and Wall Street, but NetRatings was more fiscally prudent. NetRatings has actually been increasing its cash reserves, which are now at $335 million. Jupiter has been quickly burning through its remaining cash, which fell from $98 million to $49 million in the first half of this year.
Robert Becker, who was hired in July to be Jupiter's chief executive, said that the company needed to raise another $30 million to $40 million to stay in business long enough to turn a profit. That is even after slashing its payroll to 430 employees from 1,000 at the beginning of the year. 
Mr. Becker said that he had been looking at various deals that could raise that money, but that in the wake of the Sept. 11 terrorist attack, none was forthcoming. Selling the company to its archrival proved to be his most attractive option.
The companies said there would be layoffs but would not say how many. NetRatings has 140 employees.

HEADLINE: Lonely, but Steadfast in Midtown; 
Tourists Scarce, Manhattan Chili Rethinks Its Business

BYLINE:  By LESLIE EATON 

 BODY:
Seven years ago, Sally Sterman cleaned out her bank account and gave all her cash -- $34,000 -- to her son, Bruce, so he could move his restaurant to an unpopular but promising neighborhood: Times Square.
 It was a gamble, to say the least. "I imagined taking my mother's hand, walking to the edge of a cliff, and jumping off," Mr. Sterman says now. 
 That bet more than paid off; his restaurant, the Manhattan Chili Company, quickly became popular with both office workers and tourists, and eventually expanded to a second location, up Broadway at 53rd Street. 
But recently, that sinking feeling has come back to Mr. Sterman and his wife and co-owner, Luba Pincus. The economy has crumbled, tourism has tumbled and business at their restaurants fell by 25 percent after Sept. 11. Rather than figuring out what their next expansion will be, the Stermans are now trying to figure out how to stay open. 
In many ways, the straits the Manhattan Chili Company is in are similar to those faced by restaurants all over Midtown Manhattan, which despite being far from ground zero has experienced steep drops in business since the trade center disaster. 
A survey by the New York Restaurant Association of some "high-end" members found that sales were down 56 percent the week of Sept. 11, and 40 percent the following two weeks. "The ones in Times Square took the biggest hit," said E. Charles Hunt, executive vice president of the association's greater New York City chapter.
Since then, "In Midtown, most restaurants have come back a long way," said Tim Zagat, emperor of the restaurant-rating enterprise and the chairman of NYC & Company, the city's tourism board. "But the more tourist-driven you are, the more difficult the recovery has been."
And Times Square had been tourist driven (or tourist clogged, depending on a person's point of view). Not now. "On Monday night, I was walking in the middle of the sidewalk and I didn't bump into anyone," Mr. Sterman said.
Of course, there were not all that many tourists in Times Square when Manhattan Chili opened there in 1994, across from the old Nathan's hot dog emporium. But the lease was up on its original restaurant, on Bleecker Street in Greenwich Village, and business there had stopped growing.
The new location, on West 43rd Street, was no bigger than the old place, and the rent twice as expensive. But the Stermans hoped there would be a steadier stream of business (the old place was hopping only on the weekends). And the kind of cuisine the Stermans serve (Bruce calls it "quickly food," not fast food) seemed perfect for lunch and pre-theater meals: 10 kinds of chili, from the mild Abilene to the "hot hot" Texas Chain Gang, as well as nachos and chicken wings.
Sally Sterman, at 84 a retired accountant who now works full time at the restaurants, was sure the neighborhood was on the upswing. "I knew it was not going to go backward," she said. 
In fact, business rose steadily -- and strongly. Sales rose by 17 percent in 1996, 20 percent in 1997. The next year, construction accident at the Conde Nast building across the street killed a woman and kept the street closed for much of July and August. Even so, sales rose by more than 12 percent. And in 1999, sales jumped by 18 percent.
That was the year the Stermans expanded uptown, to the restaurant adjacent to the Ed Sullivan Theater, where David Letterman tapes "The Late Show." It's much bigger (as many as 200 seats, versus 80 on 43rd Street), with a much larger kitchen. That was important because Manhattan Chili's delivery business had outgrown the small kitchen on 43rd Street.
And it is fun, Mr. Sterman said, being part of "Dave's neighborhood." The folks who line up for tickets come in for chips and beer before the shows, sometimes the guests stop in for a drink, and the show occasionally uses the restaurant's bar as a set. (Only Mrs. Sterman has actually appeared on the show, with a male stripper, but that's another story.)
Even though it was now competing with itself, Manhattan Chili continued to grow, by almost 10 percent at 43rd Street, by 20 percent uptown. If the uptown business was never quite as good as Mr. Sterman had hoped (he originally thought he would need seven waiters, but ended up with three), things were still going well.
Until this year. On 43rd Street, sales began edging down in January. Uptown, the decline didn't start until May, but it was a shocking 11 percent. The economic-slowdown-cum-recession had begun. Then there came Sept. 11 -- and there went the tourists. For the entire month, business was down 13 percent uptown, 18 percent downtown. This month, Mr. Sterman estimates, it will be down by about 20 percent at both places, compared with last year. 
But costs are not down by anything like 20 percent, Ms. Pincus said. "The only thing you can really reduce is the food and beverage purchases," she said. "In a restaurant like this, you need a certain number of people. Rent, utilities, insurances, taxes, all of that continues."
A restaurant with dishes in their price range (most of the entrees are about $10) and that is well-run, usually has a profit margin of about 8 percent before taxes, said Malcolm M. Knapp, a New York City restaurant consultant. "It's a leveraged business, in that sense," he said. "You can get into trouble pretty quickly." The Stermans have not laid off anyone, but their 80 employees are anxious, Ms. Pincus said.
She and Mr. Sterman are anxious, too, though they consider themselves lucky compared with their peers in TriBeCa, or around the corner in the Theater District. 
So what have the Stermans done? They have had to put off paying their purveyors, and to stall on their rent. They have participated in every promotion NYC & Company has organized. They are wondering about adding more televisions to attract sports fans, even considering getting a cabaret license. And they may expand the geographical reach of their delivery business, which has been booming lately despite the glorious weather. (Mr. Sterman thinks it may be anthrax anxiety.)
Basically, they are rethinking the business. "OK, we don't have tourism," Mr. Sterman said. "Let's focus on the customers who are here."
The bad news, for the Sterman family, is that companies are not booking holiday parties the way they have in the past. (One of the few events they have scheduled is the watch party for Kenny Kramer, Libertarian candidate for mayor and Mr. Sterman's step-brother.) 
The good news is that earlier this week, they got a disaster assistance loan from the Small Business Administration for several hundred thousand dollars. So the tomato lady and the meat guy and the landlord will all get paid. (Even though both restaurants are pledged to pay it off.)
And if business does not improve, what will the Stermans do? He'll go to law school, Mr. Sterman jokes, or go back to waiting tables. Actually, he thinks he'll start another business. In no event, he said, will he leave Manhattan.
His mother doesn't think he'll have to. "It's tough, it's draining financially right now," Mrs. Sterman said. "But I have no doubt the business will make it."

No Worry, But Wary: Security At Series

BYLINE:  By JAMES STERNGOLD 

DATELINE: PHOENIX, Oct. 25 

 BODY:
John Chafe, a vendor in front of the Arizona Diamondbacks' stadium here, says there is at least one benefit to the big increase in security planned for the first World Series game against the New York Yankees on Saturday. 
 "All the extra officers," he said, "I hope they all eat hot dogs from my cart." 
 If that was a cavalier response to any concerns about a terrorist attack, at an event expected to draw 50,000 fans to Bank One Ballpark, then Mr. Chafe was hardly alone. People here, from law enforcement officials to souvenir sellers, are expressing only modest anxiety over further terrorism, and confidence that the beefed-up security will be adequate. Any real nervousness is largely over the Yankees' formidable lineup, and the prospect of rowdy fans. 
Law enforcement officials said they were taking the obvious precautions, like barring large backpacks and coolers from the stadium, requiring valid ID's for all employees and keeping the skies overhead free of aircraft (there will be no blimp scudding above the field, or planes dragging advertising banners). But security, they said, will be relatively unobtrusive, although among the fans inside the park will be a number wearing dark glasses and talking into their sleeves.
On this brilliantly sunny day, the Diamondbacks worked out and took batting practice with the mood in the stadium relaxed. Groundskeepers, vendors and reporters wandered casually in what genuinely felt like a ballpark, not a fortress.
"So far, if you can call it that, it's been a pleasant experience," said George Bevans, the Diamondbacks' vice president for security. "We'll intensify a few notches. We'll be more vigilant. But this will be as much as possible a normal ballgame, except it's the World Series."
Mr. Bevans said much of his time had been spent coordinating with an unusual number of organizations that will have a hand in security, including the F.B.I., the local police, the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms, and Major League Baseball. If anything, the mood has been businesslike and cheerful, he said, adding that even the decision whether to close the retractable dome above the stadium would be based on the weather, not security.
Brian Jenkins, a counterterrorism expert at the RAND Corporation, said there was only so much tightening officials could do in any case.
"Any public gathering of tens of thousands of people is going to have some inherent vulnerabilities, war or no war," Mr. Jenkins said. "We cannot turn our stadiums into a fortress any more than we can turn a public street into a fortress or a mall into a fortress."
Michael Cherkasky, the president of Kroll Associates, a security and investigation company, said it appeared that officials here were focusing on precautions with which they could exert the greatest control, like sweeping the stadium well beforehand, checking the fans as they enter and restricting nearby traffic.
"You don't have time to put in whole new systems, so you are in a remedial phase," Mr. Cherkasky said, adding that in spite of the anthrax attacks on the East Coast, he considered a bioterrorist threat a small risk.
Mr. Bevans, the security chief at the stadium, said officials would rely heavily on the huge number of video cameras that scan the ballpark. In addition, he said, there will be a substantial increase in the number of officers, both inside the park and outside. The police have also been sweeping some buildings in the area with bomb-sniffing dogs.
But among some here, at least, the greatest security concerns will be the more customary ones, like rowdiness.
Brandon Yount, manager of Hi-Tops, a bar across a plaza from the stadium, said it had beefed up its own security, but largely to control people who might drink too much.
"It's going to be like a rock concert out in the plaza," Mr. Yount said, "and so we're taking whatever precautions you do for that. But you know, I'm really not losing any sleep over this. I'm not expecting any real trouble."

HEADLINE: Gambling Bill Is Questioned On Constitutional Grounds 

BYLINE:  By RICHARD PEREZ-PENA 

DATELINE: ALBANY, Oct. 25 

 BODY:
The sweeping gambling bill passed Wednesday night by the Legislature is likely to be tied up in court for years, with opponents, some state lawmakers and legal experts saying that it might violate the State Constitution's restrictions on gambling in several ways.
 The measure's defenders, including Gov. George E. Pataki's office, insist it will hold up in court. But even some legislators who voted for it say it might fail legal tests. 
 And if, as opponents hope, the courts rule that the slot machines permitted by the measure are unconstitutional, New York could end up with six new Indian-run casinos, and no revenue at all for the state.
Supporters say the state desperately needs the tax revenue that new gambling will generate -- estimated by different camps at $300 million to more than $1 billion a year -- particularly after Sept. 11. 
Yet many lawmakers said they voted for the bill with great reluctance. These legislators, Democrats and Republicans, said they could not turn down either the spending on various programs that were included in the bill, or the chance to help the economies of depressed areas.
The bill approves six Indian casinos in the Catskills and western New York and declares slot machines legal for Indian casinos. The only state revenue from the proposed Indian casinos would come from slot machines. Without them, the state gets nothing.
The bill also permits horse-racing tracks to install video lottery terminals, and authorizes New York to join the Powerball lottery. 
If successful, it would be by far the broadest expansion of legal gambling since the state lottery began in 1966, and would vault New York to the front rank of gambling states.
Donald J. Trump, whose Atlantic City casinos would lose money to New York competitors, said he would probably challenge -- or help challenge -- the law in court. He said he was also considering an advertising campaign against the gambling initiatives. 
Others say they also plan to sue, including the Saratoga Chamber of Commerce, which fears a loss of tourist dollars; a handful of legislators; and anti-gambling groups.
Michael McKeon, a Pataki spokesman, said he would not be surprised by suits. But, he said, "We believe that we are on very solid ground."
State Senator Frank Padavan, a Queens Republican, said, "I'm convinced that the whole thing is unconstitutional," a view echoed by many who opposed the bill.
The Senate also voted to amend the State Constitution to legalize casino gambling -- a tacit admission, many members of the Republican majority said, that the gambling bill was legally vulnerable. The proposed amendment would have to clear several hurdles to become law, and previous attempts at such an amendment have failed.
A central question in any court fight will be the legality of slot machines. A passage in the State Constitution since 1938 has been widely interpreted as banning them, and in 1994, G. Oliver Koppell, then state attorney general, issued a formal opinion to that effect. But the provision has never been tested in court.
The relevant part of the Constitution, Article 1, Section 9, never actually mentions slot machines. It forbids gambling, but makes several exceptions, like horse race betting and low-stakes games run by religious and charitable groups.
"None of the constitutional provisions on their face even purport to bar slot machines," said James McGuire, counsel to Mr. Pataki.
More important, he argued, it does not matter what the State Constitution says, because it is superseded by a 1988 federal law. That law says that when a state allows casino-style gambling, even under limited conditions, it cannot prohibit Indian tribes from using such games. 
That means, Mr. McGuire contends, that because New York allows charities and churches to hold low-stakes casino nights, it cannot forbid Indian casinos to operate slots.
But the 1990 case that tested the scope of that law dealt with a state, Connecticut, that did not have constitutional provisions like New York's, a distinction that gambling opponents say would carry considerable weight in court.
Another legal question involves video gambling machines, which New York's two existing Indian casinos, both upstate, have instead of slots. Gambling opponents argue that video gambling machines are just electronic slot machines, and are also prohibited. 
That, too, is a question that has never been tested in court. If the courts prohibit slots, the casinos can switch to video machines. But if the courts ban both kinds of machines, gambling experts say, no casino can survive. Slot machines -- or, in their absence, video gambling machines -- are by far the biggest money-makers for casinos.
The bill approved Wednesday allows Aqueduct, Yonkers and Monticello raceways, as well as some upstate tracks, to install video lottery terminals, similar to video gambling machines in casinos and likely to face the same legal challenges.
The bill says the horse tracks will receive 12 to 25 percent of the take from their lottery terminals, far higher than the 6 percent paid to other lottery vendors. But it requires that the tracks use 45 percent of their cut to increase race purses.
"That's nothing but an attempted end-run around the State Constitution's requirement that lottery revenues go to education," said State Senator Eric T. Schneiderman, a Manhattan Democrat.
Another legal question concerns Powerball. The State Constitution says that only "lotteries operated by the state" are permitted. Powerball is operated by the Multi-State Lottery Association: 21 states and the District of Columbia.
Opponents say that makes joining Powerball unconstitutional. Supporters disagree, noting that New York's own lottery would carry out the games within the state.

HEADLINE: Bush White House Reverses Clinton Decision on Mining 

BYLINE:  By KATHARINE Q. SEELYE 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Oct. 25 

 BODY:
The Bush administration today reversed an 11th-hour Clinton administration ruling on mining policy, making it easier for companies to mine for gold, copper, zinc and lead on public lands. It also issued a legal opinion that could clear the way for a Nevada company to dig an open-pit gold mine in a part of the California desert considered sacred by a local Indian tribe.
 Officials of the Bureau of Land Management said they were removing unduly burdensome provisions of the mining regulations. The mining industry blames what it says was a hostile and inhospitable attitude during the Clinton administration for a sharp drop in new mines in this country over the last decade and for forcing the industry overseas. 
 Environmentalists said the move gutted regulations protecting public lands and stood as a stark example of what they said was a Bush administration tilt toward industry at the expense of the environment.
The Clinton administration had given the Interior secretary the ability to veto permits for mines on federal lands if the mine could cause "substantial and irreparable harm" to the community. In a rule to be published on Tuesday and to go into effect on Dec. 31, the Bush administration withdraws that veto power.
"Our solicitor has just issued a legal opinion that says denial of a mining permit on the grounds of substantial and irreparable harm is not legally supportable," Larry Finfer, a spokesman for the Bureau of Land Management, told reporters today.
Mr. Finfer defended the decision on three grounds. He said the Interior Department already had the authority to deny mining permits if the operation did not comply with laws regarding clean air and water. He said the public had not had time to comment on the Clinton policy, which went into effect the day before Mr. Clinton left office. And he said it was not fair to force a mining company to go through the lengthy permit process and then deny a permit on the basis of what he said was a subjective standard.
The Clinton regulation, Mr. Finfer said, essentially told mining companies, "You've cleared all 10 hurdles, but we're saying you lose anyway."
At the same time, he said, the bureau was retaining part of the Clinton rules -- sought by environmentalists and endorsed by the mining industry -- that required companies to be bonded so they pay all clean-up costs when they finish mining.
He said the timing of the actions was the result of four lawsuits involving mine permits.
Jack Gerard, president of the National Mining Association, said the new regulations were "a tempering of the excesses that occurred in the previous administration."
Mr. Gerard said a decrease in expenditures on mining in the United States -- the money spent for mineral development since 1993 dropped by 88 percent -- meant that the nation was seven times more dependent on foreign sources for minerals. "We hope this is a signal that we will stop that negative slide that has chilled the U.S. industry and has encouraged us to take our resources elsewhere."
But environmentalists complained that the new rules essentially say that no mine can be denied because of its effect on the environment.
Lexi Shultz, legislative director of the Mineral Policy Center, a nonprofit environmental group in Washington, said the ruling was a "handshake with the industry" and a further subsidy of old mining laws that allow private companies "to take billions of dollars of valuable minerals out of public land for free without paying a royalty and without having to fully consider the damage that they leave behind."
In addition to eliminating the secretary's veto power over mining permits, Mr. Finfer said the department's solicitor, William G. Myers, had issued an opinion that would allow Glamis Gold Ltd., based in Reno, to proceed with a mine in the desert near El Centro, Calif. The Clinton administration denied the company's plan for a mile-long open-pit mine that, it said, would harm sacred sites of the Quechan tribe.
David Hyatt, a Glamis Gold vice president for investor relations, said the company was pleased with the opinion, which could bolster its position in court, but was not certain whether it would go ahead with that mine, for which it first sought a permit in 1994.
"We're not sure what it means," Mr. Hyatt said, noting that the plan was tied up in court and that the company was focused on other projects. "We plan on proceeding with the permitting process, but a 'go' decision would be based on the new economics and the price of gold." 
Roger Flynn, a lawyer for the Western Mining Action Project, based in Boulder, Colo., which opposes the Glamis mine, said the legal reasoning that could help the company was "the flimsiest I've ever seen." Mr. Flynn said the Clinton rule said a mine could be blocked because it would cause "undue impairment" to an area, but the Bush rule was saying "you never defined 'undue impairment' so we can't protect against it."

HEADLINE: State Asks Court to Overturn School Financing Ruling 

BYLINE:  By ABBY GOODNOUGH 

 BODY:
Lawyers for Gov. George E. Pataki urged a state appeals court yesterday to overturn a landmark ruling that would force the state to sharply increase spending on New York City schools, saying the city's Board of Education squanders the billions of dollars that it already receives.
 But while the judges hinted that they agreed that the board had not done enough to cut waste both centrally and among its 32 local school districts, they also questioned whether the state was trying to duck its legal responsibility to New York City, where more than 60 percent of the state's poor children go to school. 
 The five-judge panel of the Appellate Division of State Supreme Court heard arguments from both sides in the case yesterday in Manhattan, nine months after Justice Leland DeGrasse of State Supreme Court in Manhattan ruled that the state had failed its obligation under the State Constitution to provide a "sound, basic education" to the children of New York City. Justice DeGrasse said the remedy would have to include a major increase in financing for city schools, and while he did not provide a figure, state officials have estimated it at $1 billion a year or more. 
As the city's economic outlook weakens, many educators and politicians are pinning their hopes on the school financing case as the only opportunity for a large influx of money into city schools over the next few years. Mark Green, the Democratic candidate for mayor, told a group of education advocates yesterday that the ruling could bring up to $2 billion a year in additional aid to city schools, insisting that the expectation was "not pie in the sky." 
Mr. Green, like most of his fellow Democrats, has enthusiastically supported the lawsuit, which was filed in 1993 by a coalition of advocacy groups called the Campaign for Fiscal Equity. The city's prominent Republicans, including Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani and Michael R. Bloomberg, Mr. Green's opponent in the mayor's race, have quietly approved but tried not to be closely associated with the plaintiffs.
The state filed its appeal in August, arguing that education in city schools met or exceeded the constitutional standard and that Justice DeGrasse's remedy infringed on legislative powers. Mark Gimpel, the lawyer representing the state yesterday, reiterated those claims and added that poverty and other socioeconomic problems, not a lack of state funds, were to blame for the fact that so many students struggle academically.
"If, unfortunately, they bring bad health or bad nutrition or a home situation that's not supportive of education," Mr. Gimpel said, "that is not something that is laid at the door of the education system."
Mr. Gimpel also strenuously argued that if any government should contribute more money to New York City's education budget, it should be the city itself. That led one judge to dryly ask why the state had not sought to have the city be a co-defendant in the case. 
"It's never a complete defense to say, 'It's not our fault,' " said Justice Joseph P. Sullivan.
Yet the judges also tried to poke holes in the arguments presented by Joseph F. Wayland, the lead lawyer for the plaintiffs. Justice David B. Saxe asked whether the kind of education that the plaintiffs have demanded for all city children surpasses the constitutional requirement.
Justice Alfred D. Lerner wanted to know how many administrators were on the Board of Education payroll, and Justice John T. Buckley asked whether the system of community school boards, which many politicians have described as corrupt and wasteful, was a main factor in what he called the school system's "large administrative structure."
Both seemed to be suggesting that the Board of Education could find a lot more money for classrooms in its existing budget if it slashed its own bureaucracy.
In his January ruling, Justice DeGrasse ordered Mr. Pataki and the Legislature to simplify the bewildering array of formulas the state uses to parcel out school aid to communities around the state -- a reflection, more than anything else, of political deal-making -- and to create a new system based on what districts actually need. The plaintiffs have proposed that the Legislature start by studying, in great detail, the financial needs of schools in each region of the state. 
But Justice Saxe appeared concerned that if the plaintiffs did not like the Legislature's findings, they would constantly run to the courts.
Lawyers for both sides said they expected the appeals panel to rule in two to four months.

HEADLINE: HORSE RACING; 
Tracks Pleased to Add Video Lottery Terminals

BYLINE:  By BILL FINLEY 

 BODY:
With most of horse racing focusing its attention on the Breeders' Cup on Saturday at Belmont Park, where more than $14 million in purse money will be given away, racetrack managers and horsemen started the celebration early yesterday.
 They were responding to the approval by the State Legislature early yesterday of the introduction of video gambling devices similar to slot machines at some racetracks. 
 From Yonkers to Aqueduct to a pair of struggling harness tracks upstate, the legalization of video lottery terminals in New York tracks is expected to bring significantly higher purses and a brighter future for both the harness and the thoroughbred industries in the state.
"If this works out the way we hope it works out, Yonkers Raceway will be here for a long time and will be giving out some nice purses," said Bob Galterio, general manager at Yonkers, a track that has teetered on the verge of extinction for years. 
Video lottery terminals and slot machines have been phenomenally successful at each of the dozen or so racetracks in which they have been installed in the United States and Canada. They have attracted a new clientele, few of whom seem to have much interest in the live races that are only a few yards away from the gambling machines, into which they pump thousands of dollars. 
A portion of the revenue from the machines and the terminals will go to racing purses, which have more than tripled at some of the tracks that have the additional forms of gaming. Higher purses attract better horses and better racing, which, in turn, produces a higher betting handle.
"There's not a lot of difference between a video lottery terminal and a slot machine, and wouldn't you like to have a room full of slot machines in New York City?" said Maury Wolff, an economist who specializes in the racing industry. "Of course you would. 
"When you look around the country and see what has happened at other racetracks, you can see why they wanted them so badly in New York. They have done wonders for purse structures."
The three tracks run by the New York Racing Association -- Belmont, Aqueduct and Saratoga -- already offer some of the highest purses in the country. But a recent increase in purses at Monmouth Park and the Meadowlands in New Jersey, which were subsidized by the state, and the lucrative purses at Delaware Park, a thoroughbred track in Stanton, Del., which has slot machines, have made it more difficult for the New York Racing Association to attract the best horses.
Officials of the association are hoping that video lottery terminals, or V.L.T.'s, will again make New York racing a leader in the industry.
"We are extremely pleased by this news," said Terry Meyocks, the association's president and chief operating officer. "The one thing we have always tried to do here is to get more money for purses, which this will accomplish. And somehow, some way, we hope this will get people back to the racetrack.
"We hope to bring in the V.L.T.'s, show them a good time and hopefully they will cross over to racing."
The racing association does not want the gaming terminals at Saratoga, fearing that they would spoil the track's charm and tradition. The association wanted them at both Aqueduct and Belmont Park, but Belmont was not included in the compromise that led to the legislation.
In addition to Aqueduct and Yonkers, the machines were approved for Finger Lakes, a thoroughbred track near Rochester, as well as for Monticello, a harness track in the Catskills, and Vernon Downs, a harness track near Syracuse.
For the harness tracks, the addition of gaming terminals was seen as nothing less than a savior.
"I think it's going to save harness racing in New York," Galterio said. "Yonkers Raceway would certainly have closed down. There are always things that can happen, and I can't see into the future, but if things go the way we expect them to go, harness racing has a great future in New York, and thoroughbred racing has a great future in New York."
Galterio estimated that the machines would be available for use at the tracks within six to eight months, although lottery and racetrack officials still have several details to iron out. 
One is how the revenue will be divided between the tracks and the state. It is believed that the tracks will receive a commission of 12 percent to 25 percent of the machines' revenues. Of that, about 35 to 45 percent will probably go to purses. It has not been determined how many machines will be permitted at each track.

HEADLINE: THE MEDIA BUSINESS: ADVERTISING; 
News organizations try to dispel the notion that ads and bad news don't mix.

BYLINE:  By Stuart Elliott 

 BODY:
MEDIA companies whose properties provide news coverage are for the first time forcefully seeking to persuade marketers and agencies to reconsider a reluctance to advertise alongside the coverage of calamities.
 For decades, many marketers, on the advice of Madison Avenue, have avoided running commercials and advertisements that would appear in news coverage deemed too downbeat or depressing. The rationale for that reflexive reluctance was a belief that it would be counterproductive to make pitches to consumers who were being made too anxious to consider shopping as they watched words and pictures devoted to events like wars, violent deaths or terrorist attacks. 
 "The conventional wisdom is that advertisers don't necessarily want to be there" when news environments are dominated by cataclysmic coverage, said Edward R. McCarrick, publisher at Time magazine in New York, part of the Time Inc. division of AOL Time Warner. "But there is no conventional wisdom at a time like this." 
So since Sept. 11, Time and the other newsmagazines, television news channels and newspapers have been urging advertisers and agencies to rethink their longtime sensitivities. Business executives from the news media are developing or reworking sales presentations, commissioning surveys, distributing "open letters" to media buyers and running trade campaigns, all intended to generate additional ad dollars or woo back skittish clients -- crucial goals when revenue was already weakening on Sept. 10.
"For us to go out there and say, 'Resume business as usual,' sounds self-serving," said Larry Goodman, president for sales and marketing in New York at CNN, the cable news network owned by AOL Time Warner, "but President Bush has made that almost a daily mantra: 'Let's get back to our normal lives.' "
The efforts being made by the news media's sales forces are focused primarily on two arguments. One is that consumers seem comfortable, at least for now, with the coverage, as evidenced by huge increases in circulations and ratings, to levels not seen in years, if ever.
For instance, at The New York Times, retail single-copy sales last month increased 37 percent from September 2000. At USA Today, single-copy sales through last week were still ahead of last year's levels by 15 to 20 percent. At Newsweek, some issues are selling 10 times the usual number of copies on the newsstands, with similar results at Time and U.S. News & World Report.
At CNN, ratings are as high as 4 times normal levels, and they are up 11 times among viewers ages 18 to 34 -- one reason the channel just landed its first movie advertiser seeking younger audiences, the Columbia Pictures division of Sony, for "Riding in Cars With Boys."
Ratings for a CNN competitor, the Fox News Channel, are 2 to 5 times what they were previously. "We're saying we're covering the most important story, and our audience is extremely committed, which will make them pay attention to your commercials," said Paul Rittenberg, senior vice president for advertising sales at the Fox News Channel in New York. "This may be the most efficient advertising buy advertisers ever make." The channel is owned by the News Corporation.
Janet L. Robinson, president and general manager at The Times, said that "we're letting our advertisers know about the circulation increases" for newsstand copies and home delivery. The company is also sharing letters and e-mail messages from readers to demonstrate that "the papers are being read with such involvement, which can correlate with the effectiveness of the advertising," she said.
"That's not to say they don't request the A-book, because they do," she added, laughing. The reference was to companies wanting to run ads in the A section of The Times; most news coverage related to terrorism appears in a new B section called A Nation Challenged, which has been running without ads.
The other point being made by the sales executives is that, as Mr. Goodman of CNN put it, "this story is going to be with us for a while, in one incarnation or another." Therefore, they assert, withdrawing to the sidelines to wait it out may gravely harm companies dependent on the sales stimulation that ads can provide.
That is also part of the approach at Newsweek. "I just met with one advertiser who is very dependent on response" among consumers to each print ad the company buys, said Greg Osberg, executive vice president and worldwide publisher in New York for Newsweek, adding, "This advertiser has stayed with us and seen a lift in sales."
"The dilemma for advertisers," Mr. Osberg said, "is that they're seeing more interest from consumers in news vehicles, and that's going to be sustained, but they have a different level of comfort with that type of editorial environment. So we're trying to manage that very carefully." For example, he said, "just as we usually let advertisers know what's coming so they've an opportunity to pull out, we're now letting them know about opportunities where the environment might not be as controversial," like in feature sections. Newsweek is owned by the Washington Post Company.
William Holiber, publisher at U.S. News & World Report in New York, which competes against Newsweek and Time, said that a lot of discussions the newsmagazine was having with advertisers centered on defining the publication as "an environment that's helping people understand these difficult times and helping them make decisions that affect their lives."
As a result, "we're getting interest from advertisers not usually focused on the newsweekly category," he added, "and we're hoping they'll follow through." U.S. News & World Report is owned by Mortimer B. Zuckerman and Fred Drasner.
At CNBC, Pamela Thomas-Graham, the president and chief executive, said, "In terms of outreach, we're taking responses from consumer research done by NBC that are specific to CNBC and showing them to advertisers." CNBC, the business news cable network in Fort Lee, N.J., is part of the NBC division of General Electric.
Those responses are centered on data that "show viewers are ready to hear advertising messages because they say those messages help drive the economy," Ms. Thomas-Graham added, "and our viewers in particular are interested in getting the economy restarted."
At USA Today, owned by the Gannett Company, "it's a matter of accommodating" various categories of advertisers, said Tom Curley, president and publisher in Tyson's Corner, Va. 
There has been less demand for travel advertising than for advocacy advertising, he added, referring to campaigns meant to change opinions rather than sell products. But several travel advertisers "have started to come back," he said.
At Time, Mr. McCarrick wrote a letter addressed "To Our Friends in the Advertising Community," which was wrapped around copies of the Oct. 8 issue and sent to agencies. "Terrorism and war are not topics of our choosing," he wrote, "but as the leading news-gathering magazine in the world, they are something we are obligated to report on."
Time is also updating its trade campaign, by the New York office of Fallon Worldwide, part of the Publicis Groupe, by introducing ads with more topical themes. One, scheduled to appear next week, shows a photograph of Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani as if he were on the cover of Time, with a headline reading, "The mayor that never sleeps."
"It would be hard for me to tell my clients they should be out there advertising," Mr. McCarrick said, "if I didn't put my money where my mouth is."

HEADLINE: A NATION CHALLENGED: TRADE; 
On Smuggling Routes, There Are Good Taliban and Bad

BYLINE:  By DEXTER FILKINS 

DATELINE: FARKHAR, Afghanistan, Oct. 25 

 BODY:
The smugglers come down from the mountains each morning at sunrise, their donkeys in tow, laden with rice and tea and cooking oil.
 These days, the smugglers are returning with stories as well: of beatings and shootings at the hands of Taliban guards, of bribes and detentions and arrests. Of old routes blocked, goods seized and friends taken away. 
 "It's more difficult now, since the Americans began to bomb," said Muhammad Yusef, a 25-year-old smuggler who arrived at dawn in this border town following a six-hour walk from the front. The night before, Mr. Yusef said, he was stopped and beaten by Taliban guards and allowed to pass only after he handed over a hefty bribe. His companion, Ghulam, was shot in the leg and taken away. "The Taliban said, 'You are aiding the enemy,' " Mr. Yusef recalled. "We told them, 'No, we only want to feed our children.' But still they beat us." 
In the five years that this mountainous swath of northern Afghanistan has held out against the Taliban, smuggling has been the trade that has kept it alive. With the country's northern border with Tajikistan mostly sealed, the secret routes into Taliban-controlled territory have supplied Afghans on the rebel side with almost every conceivable need: food, soap, clothing, even weapons. The trade has continued through the worst of times -- slowing during heavy fighting, but nearly always carrying on through the mountain passes and valley roads that crisscross this desolate landscape.
Now, the rules have changed. The smugglers who gather in border towns like this one say that the Taliban soldiers who guard the trade routes, and who even a few weeks ago allowed the commerce to pass without much trouble, are now edgy and violent, accusing the smugglers of aiding their enemies, the Northern Alliance and the United States. The smugglers who have made it safely back say they are paying a higher price for their efforts, in steeper bribes and sometimes with beatings and death.
Smuggling is as old as Afghanistan itself, and it has never been easy, least of all in the area controlled by the Northern Alliance. The landlocked country has been at war for 22 years, and its economic base is in ruins. With the borders of the former Soviet Union tightly controlled to the north, most manufactured goods enter the country from Pakistan in the south and Iran in the west. The region in northeastern Afghanistan held by the Northern Alliance has but one choice: rely on smugglers to take their donkeys across the front lines, load them up and sneak back.
In the five years since the Taliban captured the Afghan capital, Kabul, the clandestine trade has flourished in the face of numerous hurdles. There were bribes to be paid, land mines to be avoided and, after every new offensive, new borders to be crossed. Yet for a war-ravaged area ostensibly cut off from the rest of the world, the system, even now, appears to work with remarkable efficiency. 
In Farkhar, as in many towns across northeastern Afghanistan, the bazaar teems with products from other lands. Sher Aga's shop in the Farkhar bazaar, for instance, offers cooking oil from Iran, baby powder from China, cigarettes from South Korea and mint toothpaste from Pakistan. . "What do you want?" asked Mr. Aga, as he turned down the Indian pop music playing on a cassette recorder in his stall. "A pen? A tape recorder? Just tell me."
Just down the muddy, unpaved road from Mr. Aga's shop lies the area known as The Inn, a walled-in open-air space where the smugglers gather each morning to unload their goods. To one side, there is a large pen where smugglers pay 10,000 Afghanis -- about 12 cents -- to park their donkeys. These days, the talk among the smugglers is of the troubles encountered along the way and of friends left behind. Ali Sher Khan, wandering among the donkeys and merchants, said Taliban guards stopped him as he carried 150 pounds of rice and wheat through a mountain pass called Namakow. The guards accused him of supporting the enemy, Mr. Khan said, shot his donkey and burned his rice. Then they sent him on his way.
"I saw this with my own eyes," Mr. Khan said, his battered turban resting atop his weathered face. "Our job is very dangerous, but the Taliban never did this before."
Some of the smugglers who made it through the lines measure their increased difficulties in the higher cost of bribes. Two months ago, before the American bombing, smugglers said, the Taliban guards typically charged about $1 a donkey -- a not insignificant amount in this impoverished land. But now, they said, the Taliban guards often charge several times that, enough to wipe out the profits of many a smuggler. 
"I am losing money," said Zalmai, a smuggler who said he recently paid 1,200,000 Afghanis -- about $15 -- so his four donkeys would be allowed to carry some 600 pounds of tea, cooking oil and sugar through the lines.
Like others in Farkhar, Zalmai referred to the "good Taliban" and the "bad Taliban" -- the good faction being comprised mostly of local Tajiks and the bad ones of Pashtuns from southern Afghanistan, the base of the Taliban. 
Encountered on a mountain pass, the good Taliban usually let the merchants pass through, often for a small bribe, Zalmai said. The bad Taliban, he said, almost always mean trouble. Zalmai said he could always spot a bad Taliban. 
"If you give them 1 million Afghanis, still they will not let you pass," Zalmai said. "The bad Taliban, they will kill you."

HEADLINE: Ford Settles Ignition Suits By Extending Warranties 

BYLINE:  By KENNETH N. GILPIN 

 BODY:
A California judge yesterday approved a proposal by the Ford Motor Company to settle lawsuits in five states by reimbursing current and former owners who replaced flawed ignition systems on millions of cars and trucks. 
 Ford reached the agreement with plaintiffs in the case in August. The accord was formally presented to Michael E. Ballachey, the California judge who was preparing to begin hearings to assess damages that could have totaled billions of dollars. 
 The settlement is structured as a warranty extension and not as a recall. An economist hired by the plaintiffs estimated the agreement could cost Ford as much as $2.7 billion, a figure Ford said was overstated. 
In August, some lawyers for the car owners estimated the cost at $750 million to $1 billion. In addition, Ford has agreed to pay $29 million to seven law firms representing the plaintiffs.
The lawsuits involve about 22 million vehicles, most of which were produced between 1983 and 1995. The settlement will pave the way for the current and former Ford owners nationwide to be reimbursed for repairs and related expenses, such as towing fees. Ford has agreed to extend warranty coverage to 100,000 miles on the vehicles.
Jeffrey L. Fazio, the lead lawyer for the plaintiffs, said yesterday that just under 14 million cars are left on the road.
Kathleen Vokes, a Ford spokeswoman, said plaintiff estimates of the costs involved are substantially overstated. "The $1 billion number would mean every single possible vehicle would replace its thick film ignition module, and that is absurd," she said. "Real world data show the modules run more than 100,000 miles on average."
In 29 models sold between 1983 and 1995, the module was mounted on the distributor near the engine block. The module regulates electric current to the spark plugs. Some safety experts said it was improperly placed in a position where it would overheat, causing the engine to stall.
Last year, Judge Ballachey ordered Ford to recall as many as two million vehicles in California after determining they could stall at high engine temperatures. He was the first judge in the country to issue a vehicle recall.

HEADLINE: A NATION CHALLENGED: THE TREATMENT; 
Bayer Halves Price for Cipro, But Rivals Offer Drugs Free

BYLINE:  By KEITH BRADSHER 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Oct. 25 

 BODY:
When Bayer agreed on Wednesday to sell 100 million tablets of its anthrax medicine, Cipro, to the government for 95 cents apiece, Bayer and the Bush administration said the deal assured an ample supply at a very low price.
 But while Bayer nearly halved its previous price, three big pharmaceutical companies have since stepped forward to offer large quantities of their antibiotics free if the Food and Drug Administration will approve their use for the treatment of anthrax. Executives in the generic drug industry say Bayer is still at least breaking even and may even be making a large profit. And some infectious-disease experts warn that Bayer remains unable to supply enough Cipro if terrorists start releasing new strains of anthrax that are resistant to other antibiotics. 
 Tommy G. Thompson, the secretary of health and human services, strongly endorsed the Bayer deal today. "If you can get a company to reduce its price from $1.75, to 95 cents, for the first 100 million -- and I hope that's all we'll need -- then that's an excellent deal," he said.
Bayer officials did not return nearly a dozen calls for comment today, but said on Wednesday that they had happily made concessions for the good of the nation in their negotiations with Mr. Thompson.
"I was smiling going in because how often in your life do you and your company have an opportunity to make a difference," said Helge H. Wehmeier, Bayer's chief executive of American operations, who refused to discuss whether Bayer was making a profit on the deal.
Some executives in the generic drug industry, like Bruce L. Downey, the chairman and chief executive of Barr Laboratories, say Bayer's price is comparable to what they might charge to cover their costs and make a modest profit. A few executives suggest that Bayer might even be making a large profit on the pills, because Bayer manufactures by the ton the raw material for Cipro, ciprofloxacin, and this creates considerable economies of scale.
Agnes Varis, president of Agvar Chemicals, a pharmaceutical trading company in Little Falls, N.J., said ciprofloxacin costs 12.5 cents to 20 cents a tablet in global markets. It is manufactured by dozens of factories around the world because Bayer's patent has expired in practically every country except the United States, which allows longer patents than do most countries. Cipro was approved by the F.D.A. in 1987.
The raw material can probably be manufactured by the ton by Bayer's own factories for 5 cents or less a tablet, she said. But raw materials are not the only cost. It costs another 5 to 80 cents a tablet to blend the raw material, make tablets, test them for safety and chemical stability and meet government regulations. 
Patented drugs like Cipro cost far more than do generic drugs partly because pharmaceutical companies need the profits to pay for the research to discover new medicines. Bayer also agreed to supply subsequent Cipro shipments if needed at 75 cents or 85 cents apiece and to rotate inventories for freshness.
The Bayer deal on Wednesday included the donation of two million tablets beginning next week. But that offer has been quickly upstaged. Johnson & Johnson announced late on Wednesday that it would provide up to 100 million tablets of its Levaquin free if the F.D.A. approved its use for anthrax. Bristol-Myers Squibb said today that it would provide free Tequin to anyone exposed to anthrax if the F.D.A. approved it for anthrax.
Dr. Sandro K. Cinti, a specialist in infectious diseases at the University of Michigan and a member of Michigan's bioterrorism task force, said that Tequin and Levaquin were chemically very similar to Cipro and were considerably newer than Cipro. "They would be at least as effective and possibly more effective," than Cipro, he said.
GlaxoSmithKline also said today that it wanted the F.D.A. to approve two of its older medicines for anthrax and would provide free all the medicine the government needed to treat anthrax. Eli Lilly and Pfizer offered to provide drugs at cost.
"People need to know that there are drugs other than Cipro, that the supply will not be a problem and that these drugs will be available to the government at a reasonable price," said Henry A. McKinnell, chairman of Pfizer. "We don't intend to make a profit on this threat to the nation."
While the various offers of free drugs are generous, they could also benefit the companies by raising sales as the public becomes aware of their brands.
Dr. Cinti and other experts also questioned whether the government was buying enough Cipro from Bayer. Federal health officials initially recommended that anyone exposed to anthrax take two Cipro tablets a day for 60 days. But the government is now recommending that someone exposed to anthrax take only two Cipro tablets a day for 5 days and then switch to other antibiotics for 55 more days if laboratory technicians decide that the type of anthrax is vulnerable to other antibiotics.
Federal officials say all the anthrax discovered so far is vulnerable to all antibiotics. But lingering concerns remain about what became of the special strains of anthrax created by the Soviet Union, which bred them to be resistant to antibiotics available in the 1970's and 80's.
Kenneth F. Bastow, associate professor of pharmacy at the University of North Carolina, said Cipro and similar medicines like Tequin and Levaquin were most likely to be effective against any strain of anthrax. "Of all the strains of anthrax that are known, and there are lots, resistance to Cipro has never been documented, while resistance to some of these others has been," he said.
Health officials say more than 10,000 Americans are taking Cipro now, including 7,600 in Washington alone, mostly postal workers. The postal workers are being given 10-day supplies of Cipro, not 5-day supplies, partly because the pills are commonly shipped in packs of 20.
With the Bayer deal, the nation will have 120 million Cipro pills in government stockpiles by the end of the year. Mr. Thompson said this is enough for 12 million Americans, but this is true only if each person takes the medicine for only five days. If doses were ever needed for 60 days, or 120 tablets a person, then the stockpile would be adequate for only a million people.
Dr. Cinti said people should not take Cipro unless prescribed for actual exposure to anthrax. The powerful medicine is used to treat pneumonia and blood infections in critically ill patients in hospitals' intensive-care units, but if too many Americans take it, these ailments will develop resistance to Cipro, he said.

Few Hospitals Are Ready for a Surge of Bioterror Victims

BYLINE:  By MILT FREUDENHEIM 

 BODY:
Hospitals across the country are scrambling to prepare for terrorist attacks, anticipating situations that seemed like science fiction nightmares before Sept. 11. But public health experts and hospital industry officials say that many hospitals are far from ready for a surge of patients in the event of a major attack.
 Fifteen years of cost-cutting under managed care has shrunk emergency room capacity, sharply cut inventories of drugs and equipment and eliminated thousands of hospital beds. A nationwide shortage of nurses and pharmacists would make it even harder for communities to respond quickly to a major disaster. 
 Many county and city public hospitals that played an important role in past medical emergencies, including the 1918 influenza pandemic and 50 years of polio outbreaks, have been taken over and slimmed down or closed by for-profit chains. And the victories scored against scourges like polio and smallpox have fostered feelings of security and even complacency that have left them ill-prepared for an influx of patients from a biological threat like anthrax.
"Hospitals are working at a bare minimum to meet the needs of patients," said Dr. Mohammad N. Akhter, executive director of the American Public Health Association. "If there was a bioterrorist attack, the number of patients would overwhelm our system."
"If they use a contagious agent like smallpox, we will not have isolation facilities to quarantine people," he said. "If there's a major attack that would require more than 500 beds, no community has that number of extra beds available."
The Department of Veterans Affairs said it could provide 3,300 beds to the public on short notice, and 4,300 more later, but the beds are spread across 130 V.A. centers.
Even on normal days, many hospitals are already struggling with shortages of nurses, pharmacists and medical technicians. Disaster planners say hospitals need to identify rosters of part-timers and retirees who can be trained in advance and summoned in an emergency.
"We don't have the data to keep track of where nurses are working, part time or full time, in hospitals or other settings or not working," said Cheryl Peterson, a policy expert at the American Nurses Association.
Hospitals in several large cities, including New York, Chicago and Dallas, have long consulted regularly with public health, fire and police officials on emergency plans, but in many places, hospitals have only recently begun to do so.
In some cities, competing hospitals have even made disaster plans that sometimes banked on the same scarce resources, like the available temporary nurses. "Whether it is decontamination rooms or appropriate personal protective equipment, in general, hospitals are not prepared," Ms. Peterson said.
Under pressure to reduce costs, most hospitals have cut their drug inventories and rely on wholesalers to supply them on short notice. Many have equipment shortages as well, said James D. Bentley, senior vice president of the American Hospital Association. "Every hospital needs something," he said, including radio communication; surveillance and detection equipment; protective equipment; decontamination equipment; training courses and mental health programs.
"Preparedness is all over the map, everything from totally prepared down to places that never heard of bioterrorism before Sept. 11," said Dr. Dennis O'Leary, president of the Joint Commission on Accreditation of Healthcare Organizations.
Hospitals are now being told to keep drugs and important equipment on hand in case of terrorist attacks, but the shift is expensive. Johns Hopkins Hospital in Baltimore has just committed itself to spend $7 million to build up its emergency supplies of drugs and medical gear.
If a chemical or biological weapon begins causing widespread damage, the early warnings have to come from doctors who see patients and alert local and state health departments and the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. But a recent survey of hospitals and the joint commission's own observations showed "a major disconnect" between hospitals and public health officials, Dr. O'Leary said.
"But many hospitals in our country are not connected to the health department electronically," so they have no way to quickly spot suspicious patterns of cases. "That needs to be corrected immediately," Dr. Akhter said.
Senate aides have been negotiating with administration officials this week on proposals by Senators Edward M. Kennedy, Democrat of Massachusetts, and Bill Frist, Republican of Tennessee, that would provide as much as $5 billion in block grants to states for preparedness programs for hospitals and health officials. 
But Tommy G. Thompson, the secretary of health and human services, told the American Public Health Association this week that $300 million in extra financing would be a reasonable first step.
"Hospitals are the first line of defense, the first institutions that will feel the effects of an attack," said Charles N. Kahn III, president of the Federation of American Hospitals, a trade group of for-profit chains. He said his members were re-evaluating their needs.
"Some of the cost containment measures they generally apply may not be relevant now," he said. Hospitals that may have two quarantine rooms are asking should they have 10 quarantine rooms," he said.
Doctors and executives at the University of Pennsylvania Medical Center are beginning to tailor existing disaster plans to better respond to bioterrorism, said Dr. Patrick J. Brennan, an infectious-disease specialist.
City and federal public health officials began surveying bioterrorism measures in New York hospitals after the Sept. 11 attack, said Susan C. Waltman, senior vice president of the Greater New York Hospital Association.
And although nearly all beds are normally occupied in New York hospitals, she said that immediately after the attack, some "patients were discharged early and others were transferred to the outer boroughs and nursing homes, freeing up hundreds of beds."

HEADLINE: A NATION CHALLENGED: THE RECRUITS; 
Not Yet Citizens but Eager to Fight for the U.S.

BYLINE:  By DAVID W. CHEN and SOMINI SENGUPTA 

 BODY:
As a youth in Kazakhstan, Alexandr Manin had no interest in the war that the Soviet Union was waging in Afghanistan in the 1980's. But since arriving in New York three years ago, he has had a change of heart, and has joined the military.
 The United States military, that is. 
 Mr. Manin, who is here as a legal permanent resident but is not yet a United States citizen, is scheduled to leave on Nov. 5 for basic training with the Marines. The law allows permanent residents like him -- those who have a green card -- to enlist. 
"It doesn't matter that America is not my country; New York is my city, and what happened shook my life," said Mr. Manin, a fast-talking 25-year-old from Greenpoint, Brooklyn. "I feel patriotic, and I have this itch now to go sooner."
Particularly in New York, with its huge population of immigrants, many residents for years have been signing up to fight under the American flag, even though they do not carry an American passport. In fact, immigrant men and women seem more likely to enlist than their native-born peers.
In New York City, 13 percent of those under the age of 18 are immigrants, both legal and illegal. But in the Navy, 1,200, or 40 percent, of all New York City recruits were green-card holders in the last year. In the Marines, the number is 363, or 36 percent; in the Army, it is 589, or 27 percent. 
On a national level, the percentage of green-card military recruits is relatively small, hovering around 5 percent for most services. Even so, the proportions have been steadily rising in recent years, especially in cities like Los Angeles and Miami.
There is no simple explanation for why these permanent residents opt for the military. Some do it because they want to speed up the citizenship process. Some do it because they are, like many immigrants, of meager means and believe that the military offers economic and social mobility. And some do it because they feel patriotic and want badly to belong.
That has been especially true during wartime historically, and the weeks after Sept. 11 are no exception.
"There's an us versus them thing," said Philip Kasinitz, a sociologist at Hunter College who studies the assimilation of the children of immigrants. "This happens in wartime generally. As a result, a lot of immigrants and certainly the children of immigrants feel a need to assert which side of the line they are on."
Many of the green-card recruits in New York reflect the city's changing demographics, and come from countries in Latin America and the Caribbean such as the Dominican Republic, Jamaica and Ecuador.
And while there are proportionally fewer recruits with Asian backgrounds, one immigrant from Hong Kong, Wai Wan, a 22-year-old from Sheepshead Bay, Brooklyn, recently joined the Air Force because he thought the technical training would look impressive on his resume. But after Sept. 11, he felt a patriotic tug, too.
"We asked for computer-related jobs," said Mr. Wan, who signed up with a friend, Alex Wong (a Brazilian green card holder). "But now, we've been looking for combat-related jobs."
For immigrants, the military has long served as a gateway to the American mainstream and a ticket to American acceptance. Indeed, to prove their loyalty, many Japanese-American men volunteered in the Second World War, even as their families were forced into internment camps as "enemy aliens."
There are tangible benefits as well. For permanent residents, military service can shorten the wait to apply for citizenship from five to three years.
Between 1994 and 1999, more than 3,600 immigrants became United States citizens through this provision, according to the Immigration and Naturalization Service. There is nothing in immigration law that prohibits illegal immigrants from serving in the military, but the services say anyone without the proper documentation is automatically rejected. 
But even those immigrants who do qualify but are not citizens face restrictions, too. They are not eligible for up to $17,000 in college tuition aid under the R.O.T.C. program. They are generally not allowed to perform certain duties, including reconnaissance, intelligence and data systems. 
If they are from what the military deems to be a hostile country like Afghanistan or Iraq, they need to go through additional security checks. But residents from Egypt or Saudi Arabia, the birthplace of the Sept. 11 hijackers, are not considered to be from hostile countries and need no special security clearance.
Through the years, a few improbable figures have emerged from the gallery of immigrant soldiers. The Marines can claim the famous -- Shaggy, the Jamaican-born and Brooklyn-raised singer -- and the infamous -- Hussein Mohammed Farah, the son of the late Somali warlord, Gen. Mohammed Farah Aidid. 
But the numbers in New York now are stark. In some neighborhoods, like Flatbush in Brooklyn or Washington Heights in Manhattan, up to 90 percent of recruits are not yet citizens.
Some 40 percent of all Naval recruits in New York City in the last fiscal year which ended in September, were green-card holders, up from perhaps 20 percent a decade ago, said Senior Chief Tim Stewart of the Navy Recruiting District New York. Throughout the country, the figure was 8 percent, up from 5 percent in 1995.
The Navy's national recruiter of the year was Petty Officer Second Class Lenny Ramos, whose territory includes most of Manhattan. And one of his most recent green-card recruits was Samantha Ruiz, 19, who moved to Washington Heights 11 years ago from the Dominican Republic and signed up two weeks ago.
This summer, she gave some thought, though not serious, to joining the military because of the citizenship and travel perks. But then came the terrorist attacks.
"That pushed me along to make me really want to join," said Ms. Ruiz, who now spends much of her time as a volunteer in the Navy's recruiting office in Harlem. "This is my home now. And I just felt, I would better be able to contribute by being in the Navy."
In Lower Manhattan this week Gunnery Sgt. Duane Silvera, who is in charge of Marine recruiting in Manhattan, welcomed Mr. Manin, the Kazakhstan native, into his office near City Hall to go over some final preparations before he starts basic training at Parris Island, S.C.
Mr. Manin said that his wife -- an American citizen whom he married in 1999 -- had mixed feelings. And his parents, who still live in his hometown of Petropavlovsk, were uncomfortable with his decision because they know of too many young men who never came back or were disabled after the Soviet war with Afghanistan.
But he was unbowed. He talked excitedly about becoming an infantryman, maybe doing reconnaissance work, maybe using his fluency in Kazakh (which is similar to Uzbek), Russian, Polish and Czech.
"I've been asking that I can go to Afghanistan to participate," Mr. Manin said.
His brother, Pacha, a 20-year-old who is now studying English at Fordham, wanted to enlist, too. But he is here on a student visa and does not have a green card -- not yet.
But Sergeant Silvera, 35, said that if Pacha Manin gets his green card, he would be a prime candidate. After all, Sergeant Silvera himself was a permanent resident and Jamaican citizen when he enlisted in the Marines.

HEADLINE: For the Asking, a $480 Seat 

BYLINE:  By JESSE McKINLEY 

 BODY:
Saying they want to cut into the lucrative market dominated by ticket scalpers, the producers of "The Producers" are preparing to set aside at least 50 seats every performance and charge the unprecedented amount of $480 a ticket.
 The sum is nearly five times the current cost of $100 for the most expensive seats, itself a Broadway high. 
 The plan is set to begin early next month with the sale of 50 premium orchestra and mezzanine seats at the St. James Theater, seats that have been almost impossible to attain since the show opened to rave reviews in April. 
The move marks the first time in Broadway history that producers will withhold, and aggressively mark up, some of the best seats for those willing to pay for assured access, a practice already employed in luxury suites for teams like the Knicks and the Yankees, as well as in boxes for events like the U.S. Open and in special seating at rock concerts. 
The producers said the decision was made after months of watching scalpers buy tickets for the show and then quickly resell them to hungry theatergoers at an enormous profit.
"What we're trying to do here is strike a blow at the heart of the scalping operation," said Rocco Landesman, one of the play's producers and the president of Jujamcyn Theaters, which owns the St. James. "The scalpers and their profits serve no one but the scalpers. Those monies belong to the people who created the show, pure and simple."
The plan was outlined in a memo provided to The New York Times by the producers of the show in response to a reporter's query. Originally, it was to have been announced last month but was delayed because of the attacks upon the World Trade Center on Sept. 11.
Whatever the price, the demand for "Producer" tickets are still white hot. Even during the drop-off that struck Broadway in the weeks after the attacks, customers lined up on West 44th Street to see Nathan Lane and Matthew Broderick in Mel Brooks's musical comedy about two producers who scheme to gain a windfall by intentionally backing a flop, a musical about Hitler.
Scalpers are regularly getting hundreds of dollars above face value for "Producers" tickets outside the St. James, with less covert, but no less profitable, sales going through hotel concierge desks and through ticket brokers. The online market, in particular, is booming. Sites like www.the-producers-tickets.net advertised yesterday four orchestra seats for Tuesday night at $742.50 each, or $642.50 above face value. While such markups are illegal in New York, many such sites are based in other states.
"We're trying to get a part of that market," said Tom Viertel, another of the musical's producers. 
The outline of the plan notes that the target customer base for the $480 ticket is "large corporations, first-class tourists and individuals seeking prime locations, frequently on short notice," a group that previously had "been forced to obtain these seats through brokers unaffiliated with the show."
The $480 ticket easily eclipses the current top ticket price on Broadway -- $100 -- a figure also set by "The Producers," and subsequently matched by this season's musical hit, "Mamma Mia," a musical built around songs of the Swedish pop group ABBA. 
The new income is likely to also increase the show's weekly potential take to more than $1.2 million a week, which would be another Broadway high. 
Industry insiders debated yesterday about how successful the "Producers" plan might be, and wondered whether, like the $100 ticket, other shows might soon imitate it.
"The problem they are going to face is the public relations aspect," said Gerald Schoenfeld, the chairman of the Shubert Organization, the largest Broadway theater owner. "It's all right for Madison Square Garden or the World Series to charge thousands of dollars, but there seems to be a sort of different idea when it comes to tickets for theater."
Officials for two other blockbuster hits, "The Lion King," the Disney spectacular, and "Mamma Mia," said there were no immediate plans to join the "Producers" premium-ticket plans. That said, one theater official suggested that it might be just a matter of time. 
"Other people will follow, absolutely," said the official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity. "It's too big a market not to."
Especially in the wake of Sept. 11 attacks and the reeling economy, "Producers" officials were loath to appear to be gouging the public or getting greedy with a hit. Mindful of the timing, the producers of "The Producers" pledged to donate $150 from every $480 ticket to the Twin Towers Fund for several months. 
The producers justified the increase by saying that it was a way of ensuring that the creators of the play, not the scalpers, won a proper share of the royalties. And, they said, it would be a means for high-paying customers to obtain good seats, not the obscured-view seats and nose-bleed balcony perches often peddled by people on the streets..
"The scalper has no risk and no responsibility," said Mr. Viertel. "Scalpers don't offer refunds if our stars aren't in the show. We do." 
Considering the show's runaway success, it's unlikely the higher prices will put any scalpers out of business. 
In fact, the producers' move gives some credence to the scalpers' exorbitant prices. "I'm sure that any number of people are already paying grossly excessive prices," said Mr. Schoenfeld, the Shubert chairman. 
Still, the move marks just the latest price leap for Broadway, an industry that has struggled to find a young audience willing to pay high prices when cheaper fare is available at the multiplex.
It may also be difficult for many in the theater industry to feel too much sympathy for their battles with scalpers. "The Producers," written by Mr. Brooks and Thomas Meehan with songs by Mr. Brooks, is virtually sold out through the end of next year. The show has won 12 Tonys -- a record -- including best musical and best actor in a musical, awarded to Mr. Lane, playing Bialystock. The show nets a weekly profit of about $550,000, and has already recouped about 75 percent of its $10.5 million capitalization, just six months into what is expected to be a very long run. 
Broadway's few previous attempts to offer high-priced amenities for higher-paying customers have met with mixed success. In 1997, for example, the producers of "Ragtime" offered good seats, Champagne, coat check and private lounges for $125 a ticket. While the promotion was popular, the show closed at a $10 million loss. 
In the "Producers" case, the 50 new seats -- in the 11th and 12th rows of the orchestra and the first three rows of the mezzanine -- became available after a promotion the producers had with the American Express company expired on Oct. 1. The $480 ticket will actually have a $400 face value -- an $80 commission will be charged by a new company, Broadway Inner Circle, which handles the sales and marketing of premium seats. 
A new New York State law passed in June allows scalpers to earn up to 20 percent of the ticket's face value in a resale, hence the $80 surcharge on a $400 ticket. But of course the producers of a show can charge whatever they believe the traffic will bear.
Unlike luxury boxes at sporting event, patrons of the Inner Circle seats will have few amenities beyond not having to wait in line. The seats are not separated from other audience members paying $100. Nor will monstrous buffets of food, open bars or video replays be likely. 
Despite that, the producers said they were confident that there was a sizable market of people who would pay almost any price to see their show. 
"We're not selling incidentals," Mr. Viertel said. "We're selling access."

HEADLINE: Twin Towers Job Fair Draws Thousands 

BYLINE:  By EDWARD WYATT 

 BODY:
"Jobs! Jobs! Jobs!" came the call outside Madison Square Garden yesterday, as the city's second Twin Towers Job Expo, conceived to help people who lost jobs as the result of the World Trade Center attacks, attracted 10,000 people seeking one of 13,000 jobs reported to be available from roughly 250 companies represented at the arena.
 Few of those in line needed anyone to tell them how hard it has been to find employment, because the New York economy was weak even before the attacks of Sept. 11. The New York State Department of Labor released statistics yesterday saying that the number of people applying for unemployment insurance last week grew to double the number of a year ago in New York City and New York State. 
 The number of people who have applied for Disaster Unemployment Assistance, a special benefit for city residents who lost job income because of the World Trade Center attack but who are not eligible for regular unemployment benefits, also rose sharply, by 10 percent in the week ended Wednesday, to 24,978 since the disaster. And nationally, a four-week average of unemployment claims rose to its highest level since March 1991, according to the Labor Department in Washington. 
"It's been a slow, painstaking process," one job hunter, David Diamond, 42, said of his four-month search for work since the textile company he worked for closed.
Standing near the end of a line that snaked six times the length of 33rd Street between Seventh and Eighth Avenues, Mr. Diamond said he had heard that more than 4,000 people got jobs at the event last week.
"That can't be right," he said, "but nevertheless I thought I should come and see if a few companies here might interest me."
By the end of the day, city officials reported that the 250 companies taking part in the expo had made 6,217 "prospective hirings" from among the 8,000 people who made it inside. Organizers gave away 2,000 moretickets for priority entry to a third job fair, scheduled for Nov. 15, to people who showed up after the line was cut off at noon.
But both inside and outside the arena, prospects were not all that they seemed. The city reported last week that 4,368 prospective hirings occurred at the first Job Expo, on Oct. 17, from among 6,000 candidates who actually got into the arena. But some participating companies said they probably are going to hire far fewer people than was initially reported.
For example, Buck Consultants, a human resources consulting company that is part of Mellon Financial, was reported by the city last week to have made 30 prospective hires at the first job fair. But Cathy Gushue, director of human resources for the company, said Buck would hire just three candidates -- two administrative assistants and one actuary.
Diane Dooley, a recruiting director for Ernst & Young, said her firm expected to hire five people from last week's Job Expo. Told that city officials said the company reported 10 prospective hires last week, Ms. Dooley replied, "We said we had 10 openings. We did not say we were hiring 10 people to fill those openings."
On the other hand, Duane Reade, the drugstore chain, said it hired 45 people from last week's job fair, twice the number initially reported.
Anthony P. Coles, the deputy mayor whose office planned and oversaw the event, said the numbers of prospective hires reported by the city were compiled from questionnaires filled out by participating companies. Mr. Coles defined a prospective hire as a person to whom a company was likely to make a job offer, but it is not clear how companies defined the term.
Moreover, prospective hires do not directly translate to newly employed individuals, he said. Because each job seeker talked to more than three companies on average, individuals might have gotten multiple offers.
"What the number tells us," Mr. Coles said, "is that there are a lot of candidates coming here who are appealing to employers."
The executives from Ernst & Young and Buck Consultants said the event was well organized. Participating companies, which normally pay $2,000 to $3,500 to take part in events of similar size, were not charged anything. Among those at yesterday's expo were J. Walter Thompson, the advertising agency; New York Life, the insurer; Primerica, the financial services company and Pfizer, the drug maker.
So popular was the first Job Expo that promoters with less than altruistic motives showed up for yesterday's affair.
The sidewalk was thick with people marketing "work at home" schemes, multilevel marketing plans, motivational programs and fee-based job placement services.
Rufus Moody, for example, the man whose cry of "Jobs! Jobs! Jobs!" rang out over Seventh Avenue, actually was seeking candidates for a three- to five-day training program for "professional security guards" that cost applicants $100 to $300 each.

Ridge Deflects Pleas to Help The Cities Pay Security Costs

BYLINE:  By ELIZABETH BECKER 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Oct. 25 

 BODY:
Tom Ridge, director of the Office of Homeland Security, turned away pleas from the nation's mayors today for help in paying millions of dollars in overtime to police and firefighters, even as he praised those same people for guarding the "front line of domestic security."
 In the still-nebulous world of homeland defense, the mayors and Mr. Ridge circled each other, agreeing they needed each other, but they were far from figuring out exactly how they would work together. 
 The mayors completed their emergency two-day meeting here by presenting Mr. Ridge with a list of their urgent needs, including money, cooperation on intelligence and help for urban workers who had lost their jobs since Sept. 11. 
For his part, Mr. Ridge said he would be the mayors' best friend in the White House.
"That's why I'm here," he said, "and that's what I want to be."
"This is the place and this is the group where the homeland security chief should be," he said after receiving a standing ovation when he arrived at the lectern.
But he postponed any talk of new aid for local officials until he completed his enormous plan for reorganizing the nation's homeland defenses. And he demurred on the other points like federal aid to shore up security for waterworks and transportation systems and putting the federal government in charge of airport security.
"I promise to be very open-minded once I present my national strategy," Mr. Ridge said and left to another standing ovation.
Undeterred, the mayors said they would go to Congress for money.
All said they were caught in a double bind of losing tax revenues in the economic downturn, which worsened after Sept. 11, while being asked to spend millions for new security that was not part of their budgets.
"We're going to have to get our money somewhere very quickly simply to ensure the financial integrity of our cities," Mayor Bill Campbell of Atlanta said. "They are calling on our police departments, in essence, to work 24 hours a day protecting mosques, water towers, airports."
Atlanta has already spent $15 million in overtime pay since Sept. 11, Mr. Campbell said.
Mayor John Street of Philadelphia said his budget planners warned him that the cost of all of the new security, including capital improvements, would be roughly $60 million.
The first delegation of mayors went directly from their meeting in downtown Washington to Capitol Hill to deliver what they called their "dispatch from the domestic front line."
"We just need reasonable help," Mayor Susan Savage of Tulsa said. "And we expect Congress will want to work with us and free up some money so we can go back to the front lines, whether that turns out to be the airports again or the post offices or just Main Street."
At another hearing, a number of senators agreed with that assertion, questioning the whole notion that the nation's underpaid and overworked nurses and police officers should be performing the front-line duties meant for the military.
"This was not a crime; it was an attack," Senator Mary L. Landrieu, Democrat of Louisiana, said. "Why are we relying on these 11 million first responders -- people as overworked as we are -- who were never meant for this new paradigm?"
Instead, Senator Landrieu and Senator Max Cleland, Democrat of Georgia, said the Department of Defense should be in charge.
"I start off taking the position that the Department of Defense is the key for defense of the homeland -- that's where we put our money, our time, our energy," Mr. Cleland said.

To the Editor:
Re "Enlightenment on Energy" (editorial, Oct. 22): The 1974 oil shocks led to the first fuel economy standards, resulting in both decreased consumption and imports. But we also saw development of major new domestic sources, including Alaska's North Slope and the Gulf of Mexico. 
 By 2000, those areas supplied 1.7 million barrels of oil a day. Without them (and increased efficiency), imports would have reached 67 percent last year. 
 Fuel economy gains alone cannot control import growth. We need new supplies, including those from the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge's Coastal Plain, believed to contain a mean of 10 billion barrels of technically recoverable oil. 
For the last 24 years, North Slope oil has equaled 20 percent of domestic supply -- and the area's ultimate recovery estimate has more than doubled, to over 20 billion barrels, lending credibility to estimates that Coastal Plain oil can replace Persian Gulf imports for 10 years.

HEADLINE: Port Authority Moves to Enhance Ferry Service 

BYLINE:  By RONALD SMOTHERS 

 BODY:
The Port Authority of New York and New Jersey has moved to bolster ferry service across the Hudson River in an effort to ease congestion on PATH trains and improve commuter access to Lower Manhattan in the wake of the Sept. 11 attack on the World Trade Center.
 The agency announced during a meeting of its board yesterday that it had finished $3 million in work to create a new ferry landing on the west side of Lower Manhattan just west of Battery Park. The landing is expected to start operations next week. Within two months the agency expects to complete $5 million in work on another ferry landing on the New Jersey side of the Hudson, just a short walk from the Pavonia/Newport PATH station in Hoboken. 
 Boats using that landing will drop commuters off at three Lower Manhattan ferry landings. The new ferry service is intended to ease overcrowding on the PATH lines to West 33rd Street, which have had severe overcrowding after the shutdown of the World Trade Center PATH station on Sept. 11. 
Delays and lines of commuters switching at 33rd Street for downtown subways "have reached unacceptable levels," said Christopher O. Ward, chief of planning and external affairs for the agency.
The efforts were applauded by Commissioner David S. Mack and Chairman Lewis M. Eisenberg of the Port Authority. Mr. Eisenberg said that one of the agency's "clear missions is to make sure that Lower Manhattan is an economically healthy area again."
According to agency officials and New York City figures, some 27 million square feet of Lower Manhattan office space was either lost or damaged in the Sept. 11 attack. Of the affected businesses, 55 percent moved to temporary space in Midtown and 30 percent moved to New Jersey and elsewhere, while only 15 percent were able to find temporary space in Lower Manhattan.
"Sept. 11 has created new priorities," said Mr. Mack, a New York representative on the bistate agency's board. "It is very, very important that we restore the credibility to Lower Manhattan."
Other members of the board noted that the emergency expenditure of a total of $8 million for ferry operations was coming from a $22 million capital appropriation that was supposed to help expand ferry service throughout the region and relieve congestion on roads and trains.
Some board members feared that these other efforts would "fall off the table," as one put it, in the face of the needs growing out of the Sept. 11 attack. They all conceded that the agency would have to supplement the proposed ferry spending with new funds and did not know from where the money would be drawn.
But the figures on the need for new ferry services were striking. George L. Cancro, director of Port Authority ferry services, said that average weekday traffic had nearly doubled on the ferry services into the city, to 64,500, from 36,000 before Sept. 11. As the "red zone" around the cleanup and search effort shrinks and more businesses in the area move to resume or expand their operations, adequate ferry services for those who previously used PATH trains and other means of travel will be that much more important, officials said.
Currently, most of the ferry operations are run by New York Waterway, which has 35 boats and operates 15 routes from Weehawken, Hoboken and Jersey City to Midtown and Lower Manhattan. The company will operate out of the planned Pavonia/ Newport location, as well as use the just completed landing just below Battery Park, said Arthur Imperatore Jr., president of the company.
Mr. Imperatore's father, Arthur Imperatore Sr., founded the ferry service in 1986 amid skepticism.

HEADLINE: Changed Panama Banks Root Out Terror Funds 

BYLINE:  By DAVID GONZALEZ 

DATELINE: PANAMA 

 BODY:
When United States officials recently asked Panamanian banks to search for suspicious accounts that might have been used to hide terrorists' funds, responses came quickly. Had the same request been made a year ago, it could have languished for months because of lax banking laws that had landed Panama on an international blacklist.
 A recent overhaul of banking rules has persuaded foreign governments to remove Panama from the list, in time to assure American officials that no accounts linked to Osama bin Laden and his Al Qaeda terrorist network have been found here. Officials continue to investigate several suspicious corporations, but have yet to find anything illegal. 
 The worldwide hunt for funds stashed away by terrorists in offshore banking havens presents Panama with a fresh opportunity to prove it no longer is the freewheeling haven it had been during the government of Gen. Manuel Antonio Noriega. The shared goal of cutting off the terror network's financial lifeblood also gives foreign governments leverage in ensuring that Panama's new rules are applied rigorously.
"They are dogged by a long history of neglect and indifference to the banking system," said one diplomat who spoke on condition of anonymity. "Panama is going to have to prove itself over time that it is building a credible barrier against illegal financial transactions. We are pushing Panama to do as much as possible."
Banking officials said they have adopted stronger guidelines in the last decade and that Panama's quick response after the Sept. 11 attacks was proof of their dedication.
"When the 11th happened, we immediately got in touch with all banks and said terrorist activities are now on the front page," said Mario de Diego, the executive vice president of the Banking Association of Panama. "We always said we were committed to helping in this fight. In the case of money laundering from drugs, and especially the international activities of terrorism, you need international collaboration. We are open to all collaboration."
Last year, however, Panama's failure to exchange information speedily with foreign governments tracking suspicious accounts was among the factors that landed the country on the uncooperative list of the Financial Action Task Force, a consortium established by the major industrialized nations in 1989.
With a dollar economy and more than 65 banks, Panama has been a popular financial center, especially among Latin Americans. But in the 1980's, Colombian drug cartels began using Panama to launder funds through construction, banks and even withdrawals from automated teller machines.
Banking officials insisted at the time that there was no systemwide money laundering, but Panama's reputation suffered badly during the scandal over the Bank of Credit and Commerce International in 1991, which was involved in laundering funds from drug and arms dealing. The bank was based in England but had an office here.
The decision to blacklist Panama as recently as last year came as a jolt to the banking community, which viewed the criticism as unfair because it did not take into account steps to toughen regulations.
In the past, money laundering had only been considered a crime if it involved narcotics trafficking, and cases were difficult to prove. The new rules expanded the list of money laundering crimes. The government also extended investigative power to other areas, like real estate, as well activities within the free trade zone. It also allowed Panamanian officials to exchange information with foreign investigators.
The effects of these changes were clear in the days after the attacks, when Dalys Teran, the head of Panama's financial analysis unit, met with both her American counterparts and local bankers. Compliance officers at banks posted not only names but photographs of suspects, she said. Traces were put on some transactions, too, but they turned up no evidence of illegal activity.
"Panama cannot afford to have a bad reputation," Ms. Teran said. "We are a service economy. You have to give service but with adequate controls. That is what we are doing."
Panama suffers from a lack of expertise in complex financial crimes within its law enforcement ranks, which can be further hindered by a lack of political will in sensitive cases. American officials have been unhappy in the past when the authorities blocked their efforts to investigate some Americans here with close ties to the Panamanian government.
One change involves the government agency that investigates financial crimes. It no longer has to channel its reports through the offices of high-ranking government officials, a requirement that in the past was seen as a means of quashing politically sensitive cases.
Under the new laws, Ms. Teran said, her office has developed 25 money laundering cases, several of which could soon be ready for prosecution. Under the old laws, she said, only two money laundering cases had been prosecuted in the previous 14 years.

HEADLINE: An Economy Keeping Its Guard Up 

BYLINE:  By CLAUDIA H. DEUTSCH 

 BODY:
Weyerhaeuser closed part of its saw mill in Barnesville, Ga., last week when some workers discovered a white powder on some new bandsaws they were unpacking. The men were quarantined for several hours until the saw maker assured Weyerhaeuser that the powder was just a rust preventative, not anthrax spores. Yet "the mill kept working," Frank Mendizabal, a Weyerhaeuser spokesman, said.
 Terror-induced jitters have affected a lot of businesses since the World Trade Center and the Pentagon were attacked and anthrax-laced letters began arriving in the mail. John Mills of MyHealthBank, a company that sells health insurance online, says he spends 10 percent of his week in airport delays and fire drills. Janitors and executives alike fumble for ID's to enter their own buildings. Mail can arrive days late, delayed by gloved workers checking for suspicious envelopes. Some people now call recipients to let them know a letter is coming. 
 "It's added hours of worktime to what used to be simple mailings," said Lynn Rubenson, a senior vice president in the San Diego office of the public relations firm of Fleishman-Hillard. 
Steps like these add significant costs and reduce productivity in an already slowing economy. But economists said the phenomenon was likely to be less of a drag than they had first feared. The reason, perversely, is the slowing economy itself.
"The substantial resources required to improve security are readily available without hindering more productive activities," James Glassman of J. P. Morgan Securities wrote in a report this week. "The use of labor and capital resources that would otherwise be idle will minimize the drag on the economy."
Against all fears and maybe against all odds, few companies are reporting huge bottom-line hits from increased security. Despite border backups and air cargo restrictions, raw materials and finished goods are still arriving close enough to schedules to keep from disrupting production lines. And offices and plants are, for the most part, taking the need for added caution in stride.
"Our employees don't perceive the added security as more oppressive or intrusive," said Jeffrey Simek at Merck-Medco, a subsidiary of Merck, the pharmaceutical company, with offices in Franklin Lakes, N.J. "The fun has been zapped, but the work is still getting done."
Even in New York City, where the preponderance of skyscrapers, the reality of mailed anthrax spores -- and, of course, the continued clean-up efforts downtown -- have added to a sense of vulnerability, most companies complain of inconveniences and sadness, not major dislocations.
For example, the MetLife Building near Grand Central Terminal was evacuated on Sept. 13 and 14 after police learned of a bomb threat to the station. Not surprisingly, billable hours for September were down a tad at Gibson, Dunn & Crutcher, a law firm in the building. But employees worked at home, and the work was done. Randy M. Mastro, a former deputy mayor of New York who is now a Gibson, Dunn partner, said his firm began a trial on Oct. 1, right on schedule. "This just hasn't affected our ability to perform," he said.
There have been costs, of course. "Security traditionally comes at the cost of functionality, and the need to deal with the growing number of threats is certainly causing a loss of function," said Fred J. Rica, a partner in the technology risk services unit of PricewaterhouseCoopers.
A few economists are trying to quantify that loss. Kevin M. Murphy, a professor of economics at the University of Chicago's Graduate School of Business, estimates that the extra costs of stricter security at airports, coupled with the added waiting time at airports, will increase the real cost of air travel by $20 billion.
Still, many superficially unrelated factors have mitigated the impact on business in general. The economic slowdown has cut demand for most items, making it less troublesome if an order takes longer to process, or a product takes longer to make.
Companies are increasingly communicating with customers and suppliers by e-mail and interactive Web pages, so a slowdown in the regular mail is more nuisance than disaster. Many companies were already replacing face-to-face meetings with videoconferences. Personal computers, cellphones and text-messaging pagers have all made it easier for employees to work at home or at airports.
"I turn on my PC at home, and for all practical purposes, I'm sitting at my desk at work," said Richard T. McDermott, chairman of the personnel committee at Clifford Chance Rogers & Wells, another law firm in the MetLife Building.
He is typical, said Samuel B. Bacharach, director of the Institute for Workplace Studies, a New York research center affiliated with Cornell University. "To say that it is inefficient to work at home," he said, "is to give the terrorists more credit for disruption than they deserve."
Nor are antiterrorist measures at companies particularly new. Many businesses long ago installed metal detectors in their lobbies and insisted that employees and visitors alike show identification. Many also routinely scrutinize mail. Weyerhaeuser, for one, has done so for more than five years -- ever since the Unabomber and militant environmental groups like the Earth Liberation Front showed they were willing to use bombs to express their opposition to logging.
Other companies installed security to protect trade secrets. "Fear of corporate espionage has made any number of companies unwilling to have unescorted visitors wandering around," said Andrew McAfee, an assistant professor at the Harvard Business School.
Depressed morale has been harder to tackle. But many companies have deluged employees with e-mails, voice mails and intercom messages to inform them about security and to raise their spirits. At Clifford Chance, eight directors walked down from the 54th floor, the highest of the firm's five floors in the MetLife Building, and reported to all employees that it took them 18 minutes to get out.
No one is certain that bottom lines will remain immune to security issues. Companies are hiring more guards, clerks and consultants.
"You can't burden an economic system with additional overhead and get away scot-free, so productivity will take a systemic long-term hit," said Michael Hammer, a consultant in Cambridge, Mass., whose new book, "The Agenda: What Every Business Must Do to Dominate the Decade" (Crown, 2001), is about managing in tough times.
Others note that any slowdown in operations could erode competitiveness. "American companies pushed ahead of others in the world because of speed and agility, so anything that threatens that could blunt their global edge," said John D. Kasarda, a professor of management at the Kenan-Flagler Business School of the University of North Carolina. Still, most experts expect that the long-term effect will not be severe. Several draw analogies to the oil shocks of the 1970's, when many Americans feared that soaring oil prices would deal a death blow to the United States economy and way of life. Oil prices eventually dropped -- partly because businesses and individuals adopted energy-efficiency measures that many still use today.
"I think businesses will emerge from this period with better ways to invent, make and market their products," said Tom Duesterberg, president of the Manufacturers Alliance, a Washington research group.
Even Mr. Murphy, the economist who quantified the cost of airline delays, is optimistic. "In economics, we assume an ability to adjust," he said. "Airlines will discover it's better to spend $5 more on security than $20 in waiting time. The lines will get shorter, and people will adapt."

HEADLINE: Lead Narrows in Virginia Governor's Race 

BYLINE:  By B. DRUMMOND AYRES Jr. 

DATELINE: RICHMOND, Va., Oct. 25 

 BODY:
With Election Day less than two weeks off, the race for governor of Virginia has tightened as voters preoccupied with the war on terror finally take some time to focus on political personalities and issues.
 The Democratic candidate, Mark R. Warner, a wealthy venture capitalist who took an early lead in the campaign, is still ahead of his Republican opponent, former State Attorney General Mark L. Earley. But most polls show Mr. Earley gaining, mainly by accusing Mr. Warner of favoring tax increases. 
 As he makes his final rounds of the state, Mr. Earley has been telling audiences that the momentum has shifted to him. The latest independent polls indicate that he has whittled Mr. Warner's lead in half, to about three percentage points.
Mr. Warner, who says he favors only those tax increases that are approved in voter referendums, contends that his own polls still have him comfortably ahead.
A number of the state's political experts say that although Mr. Earley is a solid conservative in a solidly conservative state, he faces a difficult task in overcoming his opponent's lead, and a continuing struggle to hold on to his voter base in the face of a relentless conservative pitch from Mr. Warner. Just this week, they note, Mr. Earley began running television advertisements to remind supporters that he opposes abortion, even though abortion has hardly been an issue in the race. 
Mr. Warner has put together a basic message that seems to resonate unusually well in this heavily Republican state: he argues that while he is a Democrat, he is a "Virginia conservative." The analysts say the Warner campaign is as well run and financed as any the state has seen in many years. And they note that Mr. Warner is benefiting from a feud over the state budget that has divided Republican leaders and frustrated many voters.
"Mark Warner's support is a lot more solid than Mark Earley's, so the race is not as close as the numbers indicate," said Larry J. Sabato, a University of Virginia political scientist. "Warner's delivering the kind of reassuring, conservative message Virginians like to hear, and he's delivering it at a time when top Republican leaders have been fighting destructively among themselves over how to run a state facing an economic downturn." 
Both candidates are talking about a need for Virginia to have an experienced leader in the months and years ahead. The 47-year-old Mr. Earley argues that as a former attorney general and also a onetime state legislator, he is well positioned to take the helm.
"Mark Warner," Mr. Earley told a women's breakfast rally here on Tuesday, "is just a liberal Democrat who has never held public office, never had any such experience, period."
Mr. Warner, 46, counters by saying that he could never have become a multimillionaire were he not a good manager and that in a state whose economy is in decline, he knows better than a "professional politician" like Mr. Earley how to turn things around.
Mr. Warner has been able to exploit the bitter divisions between the incumbent Republican governor, James S. Gilmore III, and Republican legislative leaders over how to shape and finance the state's annual budget in the midst of an economic downturn. That feud so alienated some Republican voters that they joined with independents to form a group called Virginians for Warner.
The group further embarrassed Mr. Earley by putting up $1 million to help his opponent. (Mr. Warner, who has a personal fortune estimated at $200 million, has raised about $11.5 million in campaign funds, and added $1.5 million of his own money. Mr. Earley has raised $8 million, almost $2.5 million of it sent his way by national Republicans.)
Mr. Earley was embarrassed, too, by a decision from the National Rifle Association, a staunch ally in earlier campaigns, not to endorse either candidate. Mr. Warner took that Earley loss as his own victory and as ultimate proof that his "I'm a conservative too" message on the stump and on television was hitting home.
The race is one of only two for governor this year -- the other is in New Jersey -- and both are seen as possible harbingers of political things to come in 2002. 
Governor Gilmore can serve only a single term under state law.

A Series Of Hiccups
 The New York theater had a case of the hiccups this week as several planned productions were delayed or otherwise sidetracked. 
 Lincoln Center Theater said yesterday that a possible February production of "The Last Five Years," the new musical by Jason Robert Brown ("Parade"), was being canceled because producers and Mr. Brown's representatives could not come to an agreement. The musical, about a failed relationship, was to play the Mitzi E. Newhouse Theater. 
"It's a lovely show, and we're incredibly disappointed we won't be producing it," said Andre Bishop, the theater's artistic director. Neither Lincoln Center officials nor Mr. Brown's lawyer, Mark Sendroff, would comment on reports that Mr. Brown's ex-wife had objected to the show's subject matter.
The replacement is likely to be "The Carpetbagger's Children," by Horton Foote, and to be directed by Michael Wilson. Mr. Wilson, the artistic director of the Hartford Stage, is currently directing "Necessary Targets," a new play by Eve Ensler, and has just won the Princess Grace Foundation Statue Award for sustained excellence. Expect "The Carpetbagger's Children" in March.
There were also changes for "The Retreat From Moscow" by William Nicholson, which had been considered a possibility for the spring. Mike Nichols, who had previously announced an interest in directing and producing the play, has since passed on the project, a development that has allowed other producers to snap it up.
Susan Quint Gallin and Sandy Gallin, her ex-brother-in-law, are the new producers. The team, currently represented by "The Shape of Things" at the Promenade, is talking to a new director, whom Ms. Gallin would not identify, though theater insiders say Daniel Sullivan may be the man for the job.
"We'd love to do it in the spring, but it depends on casting," Ms. Gallin said. Mr. Nichols had planned to cast Ralph Fiennes, Sir Anthony Hopkins and Sinead Cusack; no word yet on their replacements.

Short of Funds
The current challenges facing the Actors' Fund of America provide a good if somewhat chilling illustration of the ripple effect of last month's terrorist attacks on nonprofit institutions connected to Broadway.
Joseph Benincasa, the fund's executive director, said his offices had been flooded since Sept. 11 with emergency requests from actors and other performing professionals seeking help with rent, utility bills and health insurance.
"We were looking at a hard year to begin with," Mr. Benincasa said, citing the economy and other factors. "Now, since Sept. 11, a lot more people are coming to us for help, and a lot more people are asking for funds."
Beyond jobs lost when shows closed, Mr. Benincasa cited the loss of "survival jobs" -- the traditional day jobs like waiting on tables or typing -- as restaurants, hotels and temporary agencies have laid people off. The fund's career counselors are booked through January.
The fund's own fund-raising has also been hurt. It relies heavily on special benefit performances and its annual gala, which was postponed after the attacks. The gala usually generates $600,000; because of increased need and delayed fund-raisers, the fund anticipates a potential shortfall of anywhere from $1 million to $2 million.
"That was money we'd budgeted, spent and planned for," Mr. Benincasa said. 
The fund is accepting tax-deductible donations at (212) 221-7300.

Oldtimers
Try as they might, Heather Matarazzo and Hallie Kate Eisenberg are not normal. (But really, who wants to be normal?)
The two young actresses, ages 18 and 9 respectively, are appearing in the Roundabout Theater Company's production of "The Women," at the American Airlines Theater. But both are better known for roles they created in their, well, youth.
Ms. Matarazzo, cast as Cynthia Nixon's frustrated maid in "The Women," first caused a stir in 1995 when she played Dawn Weiner, the world's most miserable prepubescent, in Todd Solondz's cult film "Welcome to the Dollhouse."
The role, which Ms. Matarazzo won in a cold audition, jump-started the struggling career of the then-11-year-old.
"At first, they didn't think I was going to be able to be ugly enough," Ms. Matarazzo said. "But then they came back to me." The role won Ms. Matarazzo an Independent Spirit Award for best newcomer and led to a half-dozen more movies, including this year's "Princess Diaries."
Ms. Eisenberg, too, has done a few movies ("Beautiful" and, for television, "The Miracle Worker"). But she is perhaps best known for her appearance as the odd spirit-child in a series of ubiquitous Pepsi commercials, capable of channeling any voice in the universe in service of cola sales.
In "The Women," Ms. Eisenberg plays Little Mary, her first stage role. (Well, there was that preschool show, but it was non-Equity.)
How does she find The Theater?
"I love it," said Ms. Eisenberg, who is remarkably poised and polite. "On a movie, people come and go at different times. On a show, though, people come every day. You get to see them every day."
Indeed, that warmth seems apparent between these two, who hug each other a lot and seem generally sisterly. What will they do after the show closes? Well, Ms. Matarazzo will continue seeking roles; she just dropped out of the School of Visual Arts to pursue acting. Ms. Eisenberg, meanwhile, is writing a screenplay. (No kidding. Seriously. She is.)
"It's about three generations in a family," said the 9-year-old. Its title? "Three Generations."

Along the Way
*Martha Plimpton has joined Brian Murray in "Hobson's Choice," the next show at the Atlantic Theater Company. Previews begin on Dec. 18.

HEADLINE: A Pragmatic Aid Plan 

 BODY:
The costs of recovering from the World Trade Center attacks are so enormous that many officials cannot imagine how New York City and the state will manage unless the federal government comes through with a huge amount of additional aid. Meanwhile the Bush administration, which has already committed nearly $20 billion for the city, is looking with alarm at suggestions that $50 billion or so more might be necessary. If New York is going to get the help it needs, its leaders are going to have to be both restrained and politically canny in what they ask for.
 At a time when almost every city and state is feeling financially threatened, New York's requests must reflect immediate needs. They must also be directly connected to the terrorist attacks. The rest of the country wants to help the city recover from the unprecedented disaster that everyone saw played out on television. Requesting aid for anything else might be seen as demanding more than New York's fair share. 
 The easiest job is getting federal aid to pay rescue workers and clean up the World Trade Center site. The final bill may well exceed the $20 billion set aside by the president and Congress, but New York does not need it all right now, and almost everyone working on the issue in Washington believes the money will be there when it is required -- either from the original appropriation or through the Federal Emergency Management Agency.
The next problem, economic recovery in Lower Manhattan, is a tricker sell in Congress. Gov. George Pataki, while well intentioned, got off the track earlier this month when he proposed a $54 billion package aimed at projects around the region and the state, from the Second Avenue subway to a railroad in Schenectady. It makes more sense to focus on the area below Canal Street in Manhattan. Senators Charles Schumer and Hillary Rodham Clinton are working on a promising $5 billion package that would grant tax credits to businesses and residents that stay in or move into the area, along with tax-exempt bonds for rebuilding. The Schumer-Clinton package is small and tightly focused on one area that everyone agrees needs immediate help, especially as businesses are now making decisions about whether to move away. It takes care of only a small part of New York's needs, but those limits should improve its chances of immediate enactment. Mayor Rudolph Giuliani and Mr. Pataki have proposed similar tax credit schemes, and their support is needed to get the backing of Republicans in Congress.
The biggest challenge is finding money to plug the enormous holes in the state and city budgets that have been caused by the economic consequences of the attack. Mr. Pataki's request that the federal government step in and make up for the lost revenues has met with skepticism, and even some hostility, from the Bush administration and some in Congress. 
The governor was not wrong to advocate a budget aid package, given the fact that the World Trade Center attacks have drained an estimated $9 billion in tax revenues from the city and state over the next 18 months. But the timing of his request seems a little off. The governor and the next mayor will have to work hard to get a consensus in Congress for such aid, perhaps by allying themselves with other mayors and governors whose governments are in the same fiscal straits. More than 40 states have been thrown into deficit because of the economic downturn, and some form of so-called counter-cyclical revenue sharing might be possible if all would support it.
It is most important for all of New York's elected officials to work together and agree on a package rather than squabble among themselves over differing approaches -- a habitual practice in New York's political culture. The tax-credit package being assembled by Senators Schumer and Clinton this week would be a good place to start.

HEADLINE: New York's Senators Outline Plan to Assist Lower Manhattan 

BYLINE:  By RAYMOND HERNANDEZ 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Oct. 25 

 BODY:
New York's senators, Charles E. Schumer and Hillary Rodham Clinton, today released the broad outlines of their plan to spur the redevelopment of Lower Manhattan in the wake of last month's terrorist attacks.
 Mr. Schumer and Mrs. Clinton said the plan was based, in part, on ideas offered by city and state officials as well as business leaders in New York. They said they were still hammering out details but hoped to submit a final package to Congress soon. 
 They said they had not determined the overall cost of the plan. But they estimated that it would provide $2 billion to $5 billion in incentives. 
"Everyone says that downtown is going to need a shot in the arm; otherwise it's not going to recover," Mr. Schumer said.
The plan calls for giving a $3,000 tax credit per employee to any business that agrees to return to Lower Manhattan or set up shop there for the first time. The credit would be offered for up to five years.
The plan also seeks to provide tax-exempt financing to help developers undertake reconstruction of buildings destroyed by the World Trade Center attack. The senators said the plan would allow developers to secure bonds from a government agency that has yet to be identified.
The buyer of the bonds would not be required to pay city, state or federal taxes, a move that would, in turn, result in lower interest rates for the developers. 
The plan would also offer tax credits for up to two years to anyone who maintains a primary residence south of Canal Street. The size of the tax credit, as well as who would qualify for it, has not been determined, according to the senators' aides.
Earlier this week, the Giuliani administration outlined the two main forms of assistance it is seeking from the federal government to help encourage the redevelopment of Lower Manhattan. The plan represents a small portion of the $54 billion that Gov. George E. Pataki has requested. 
Under the city's proposal, businesses that agree to remain or set up shop in Lower Manhattan would receive a $5,000 cash bonus per employee, and developers would have access to tax-free bonds to help replace buildings that were destroyed. The city estimates the cost of reconstruction at $8 billion to $15 billion.
Mr. Schumer said he and Mrs. Clinton had received general commitments of support from the Senate majority leader, Tom Daschle, and Senator Max Baucus, the chairman of the Finance Committee. 
Mr. Schumer also said he and Mrs. Clinton had received general words of support from the White House, but no specific commitments.

U.S. Delays Missile Tests In Light of Possible Talks
The Bush administration, moving to strike a deal on offensive and defensive strategic arms with Russia, has postponed three antimissile tracking tests that Defense Secretary Donald H. Rumsfeld said might have been interpreted as violating the 1972 Antiballistic Missile Treaty. The announcement came four days after President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia, speaking alongside President Bush in Shanghai, said the two nations had an "understanding that we can reach agreements." Mr. Putin is to visit Washington on Nov. 12. A1

Israelis Leave West Bank Town
Israeli forces withdrew after a 22-hour siege of the West Bank village Beit Rima, leaving five Palestinians dead. While Palestinian claims of a massacre appear to be false, a reconstruction of the operation shows how closely the incursions, which Israel described as a police action to round up terrorists, resembled war.

Panama Reviews Bank Rules
The worldwide hunt for funds stashed by terrorists in offshore banking havens has presented Panama with a fresh opportunity to prove it is no longer the freewheeling haven it was under Gen. Manuel Antonio Noriega. The goal of cutting off the terror network's financial lifeblood also gives foreign governments leverage in ensuring that Panama's recent reforms are rigorously applied. A8

Clinton Limits on Mining Are Lifted by Bush
The Bush administration reversed a Clinton-era regulation on mining policy, making it easier for companies to mine for gold, copper, zinc and lead on public lands. It also issued a legal opinion that could clear the way for a Nevada mining company to dig an open-pit gold mine in a part of the California desert considered sacred by an Indian tribe there. A14

An Iraqi-born smuggler, George Tajirian, smuggled Palestinian, Jordanian, Syrian, Iraqi, Yemeni and other immigrants into the United States through Mexico, prosecution documents in a federal conspiracy trial show. Officials have not accused Mr. Tajirian or any of the people he has pleaded guilty to smuggling of having ties to any terror groups. A18

Ex-Officer Ran Theft Ring

The city teachers' union endorsed Mark Green for mayor, having twice passed up the opportunity in the primary and runoff elections.

Microsoft Introduces New Operating System

BYLINE:  By STEVE LOHR 

 BODY:
With a concert by the rock singer Sting and the personal thanks of Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani, Microsoft yesterday introduced its Windows XP operating system, a product that carries the hopes of reviving sales for the beleaguered personal computer industry.
 The new operating system arrives amid fresh signs that the sides in the Microsoft antitrust case remain far apart, even as they are in settlement talks with a court-ordered deadline of Nov. 2. 
 The gap stems from the quite different interpretations that Microsoft, the Justice Department and states that joined the suit have of the federal appeals court ruling in June -- and its implications for what sanctions against the company are appropriate.
The appeals court pared back some of a lower-court decision, but it affirmed that Microsoft was a monopolist that had repeatedly violated antitrust laws. The government regards the appeals court ruling as the basis for forward-looking remedies, not merely addressing the specific infractions in the suit, which are a matter of history in the fast-changing software industry. 
Microsoft views the ruling more narrowly. Any sanctions should "take the specific things and remedy those things," Bill Gates, the Microsoft chairman, said at a dinner Wednesday night.
As he reads the appeals court decision, not only did the ruling sweep aside the allegations that Microsoft illegally tied its Internet browser to Windows, the monopoly product, and that it tried to monopolize the browser market, but also "most of the monopoly maintenance was thrown out -- by far."
Microsoft did win a few challenges to the series of charges that the company's tactics were anticompetitive. But the appeals court also affirmed the lower court's finding that Microsoft violated the antitrust laws in its contracts with personal computer makers and with Internet services providers like America Online, as well as in the tactics that it employed with both partners and rivals, including Intel, Apple Computer and Sun Microsystems.
"The core of the case was monopoly maintenance and the core of the case was upheld," said Andrew I. Gavil, a professor at the Howard University law school. "I don't see how you can objectively read the appeals court decision any other way. I would respectfully disagree with Bill Gates's characterization of the ruling."
At another point in the dinner, Mr. Gates was asked if the fact that his father was a lawyer might have somehow helped him deal with the long-running antitrust case. Yes, Mr. Gates replied, "it helps me understand the injustice and the irony of it."
He then went on to say that what is "supergood" about Microsoft is its innovation and the way it has created a wealth of opportunity for other companies in the PC industry, which build hardware and software that works with Windows.
Mr. Gates, in sum, did not sound like someone ready to voluntarily make significant concessions in the way his company does business. Nor, according to his reading of the court ruling, does he think that he should.
The states involved in the Microsoft case announced yesterday that they had hired Brendan Sullivan, a prominent trial lawyer. The State of California is retaining Mr. Sullivan on behalf of the 18 states in the Microsoft case, according to Bill Lockyear, the attorney general of California.
Mr. Sullivan's hiring is seen variously by legal experts as a sign that the states do not expect a settlement or that if the Bush administration settles with Microsoft on terms that the states regard as too lenient, the states are willing to litigate alone to try to obtain tougher sanctions.
At the Windows XP introduction yesterday morning, Mayor Giuliani appeared on the stage of a Manhattan theater and thanked Mr. Gates for deciding to keep the product's coming-out party in New York after the Sept. 11 attacks.
Events sponsored by PC makers and Microsoft, including the Sting concert, were held throughout the city in the last two days. "It shows tremendous confidence in New York," Mayor Giuliani said.
Backed by a marketing budget of more than $200 million, Windows XP will certainly get a lot of attention. But most analysts expect sales to build slowly this year, held back by the economic downturn. 
Nevertheless, Microsoft holds 95 percent of the market for PC operating systems and there are 400 million Windows-based computers in use worldwide. As they age and users upgrade, they will inevitably move to Windows XP.
Microsoft will sell 70 million copies next year, the International Data Corporation estimates, and 101 million in 2003 and 112 million in 2004.

HEADLINE: U.S., Awaiting Putin, Delays Missile Defense Tests 

BYLINE:  By THOM SHANKER and DAVID E. SANGER 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Oct. 25 

 BODY:
The Bush administration, moving to strike a deal on offensive and defensive strategic arms with Russia, has postponed three antimissile tracking tests that Defense Secretary Donald H. Rumsfeld said today might be interpreted as violating the 1972 Antiballistic Missile Treaty.
 The announcement came only four days after President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia, speaking alongside President Bush in Shanghai, said the two nations had an "understanding that we can reach agreements," a comment widely interpreted to mean that they were headed toward a major amendment of the treaty. 
 President Bush and his senior national security advisers have maintained that the treaty is wildly out of date -- Mr. Bush used the world "dangerous" in Shanghai -- and must be drastically rewritten or scrapped. Mr. Rumsfeld's announcement today appeared to be intended to give Mr. Bush maximum negotiating flexibility in the days leading up to Mr. Putin's arrival here, on Nov. 12, for a three-day meeting that may result in an accord redefining the strategic relationship between the two countries. 
On Wednesday, Mr. Bush met with the Joint Chiefs of Staff and his national security team on the other element of the equation: a review of the nuclear posture of America that may include proposals for large cuts in its arsenal of strategic weapons. 
The White House will most likely describe that proposal to Russia in the next few days, to meet Mr. Putin's demand that missile defense be linked, at least loosely, with cuts in offensive arsenals.
At a Pentagon news briefing today, Mr. Rumsfeld said that three missile defense tracking tests -- two that had been scheduled for Wednesday and one for Nov. 14 -- were postponed while discussions between the two presidents are under way.
"We have said we will not violate the treaty while it remains in force," said Mr. Rumsfeld, regarded as the administration's most unwavering advocate of a policy to "move beyond" the treaty. "In recent days, to keep from having it suggested that we might not be keeping that commitment, we have voluntarily restrained our ballistic missile defense test program."
Two senior White House officials said today that while the idea of delaying the test originated with Mr. Rumsfeld, it was, in the words of one, "heavily coordinated here." 
"There was no need to do something that some in Russia might view as provocative, especially at this delicate moment," one official said.
While a series of meetings with Russia are planned before Mr. Putin's visit, it seems increasingly likely that whatever deal emerges -- if a deal emerges -- will be negotiated by the two presidents next month. 
Mr. Rumsfeld's announcement today may have served two political purposes. It allowed the outspoken defense secretary to put the Defense Department in sync with the White House's clear desire to reach an agreement with Russia next month. But it also served as a caution to advocates of the missile defense system that unless the treaty is abandoned, expanded or neutered, he cannot go ahead with the kind of aggressive testing necessary to deploy an effective system.
Senior administration officials confirmed that Mr. Rumsfeld had written to Mr. Bush in recent days to address his desire for accelerated research into missile defenses.
"The note expressed the opinion that we should make the public aware of the fact that we held back because of the treaty," a senior administration official said. "The note expressed the opinion that we should make the public aware that we continue to be constrained by the A.B.M. Treaty."
One administration official, who would not speak for attribution, said today: "I think there have always been some who just wanted to get out of that treaty -- period. The broader view has been to get relief from it. Not partial relief. Not limited relief. Not constant renegotiations, but substantial relief. If we find a mutually acceptable arrangement with the Russians to move beyond the treaty, fine. It could take a variety of different forms. But if we are unable to get something that is mutually acceptable, we will exercise our right to withdraw."
Mr. Bush, who has called the treaty a "relic of the cold war," did not threaten imminent withdrawal from the pact when he met with Mr. Putin on Sunday in Shanghai, officials said.
Mr. Bush's national security adviser, Condoleezza Rice, said that "no deadlines" were given to Mr. Putin at the meeting. However, Mr. Bush reiterated his dedication to missile defenses, saying that the attacks of Sept. 11 made it all the more important that the United States be protected against a full range of potential threats. Both sides understand that the deadline for reaching a deal is nearing, with a pending schedule of missile tests that would violate the treaty.
Senator Carl Levin, Democrat of Michigan and chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee, said in an interview today that he sensed a significant change in administration policy in favor of a negotiated accommodation with Russia. "I think that the odds are they are going to work out a deal," said Mr. Levin, who favors missile defense testing, but within the limits of the treaty. 
Mr. Levin said the value of the postponed tests was "very, very slight, compared to the negative fallout that would occur if we pull out of an arms control treaty with a country whose support we surely want in Afghanistan and with whom, hopefully, we will have a whole new relationship."
All of the postponed tests would utilize an Aegis radar on a surface ship to track a ballistic missile and interceptor, and collect other data. No previous test has involved such a shipborne component, which is banned by the treaty. A Pentagon panel, the Compliance Review Group, which has to certify that all current work remains within the bounds of the treaty, advised against going ahead with the test.
Even so, Wednesday's test is now scheduled for late November or December, but without using the shipborne radar, said Lt. Col. Richard Lehner, spokesman for the Ballistic Missile Defense Office. 
President Bush's view of the A.B.M. Treaty appears to have evolved since the campaign, when he came out wholly in favor of scrapping the pact. But after meeting Mr. Putin in Genoa in July, Mr. Bush ordered his national security team to link the consultations -- not negotiations -- on missile defenses and a major reduction of both nations' arsenals. Mr. Bush envisions a framework of relations that would dispose of treaties and seek to bind the two countries more broadly and more loosely through trade and economic and military ties.

HEADLINE: In Yet Another Mystery, North Korea Has Suddenly Turned Testy 

BYLINE:  By HOWARD W. FRENCH

DATELINE: TOKYO, Oct. 26 

 BODY:
In an unusual statement even for a country known for frequent rhetorical excesses, the North Korean government said today that it was no longer interested in dialogue or improved relations with the United States.
 The comment in the official North Korean government newspaper was the latest in a string of similar statements that most South Korean analysts have tried to shrug off but that seem to have been prompted by the turn of events since Sept. 11. 
 Early after the attacks, North Korea, one of the most tightly sealed countries in the world, seemed to go out of its way to express sympathy, even showing signs of understanding for American military reprisals. 
Lately, though, the government in Pyongyang has all but halted cooperation with South Korea. It has canceled previously scheduled reunions of families separated by the heavily armed border between the two countries and sharpened its tone toward the Bush administration.
The most common explanation for the recent flush of North Korean hostility has involved comments made by President Bush during the Asian economic summit last week in Shanghai.
There, he called on the North Korean leader, Kim Jong Il, to lead his country toward greater engagement with the United States and South Korea. "This is a moment in history where he can prove his worth," Mr. Bush said.
The president then warned against threats from the North, saying, "We will be prepared to defend and stand side by side with our longtime friend, the South Korean people."
Today, North Korea responded in print by saying its people are determined to make Mr. Bush "pay dearly for his remarks."
But the statement did not seem to raise concerns in South Korea. "We believe the recent North Korean responses are largely rhetoric, rather than a substantive policy response," said Kim Euy Taek, a spokesman for the South Korean foreign ministry. 
"Because of the nature of the North Korean regime," he added, "one has to read between the lines, and we believe that North Korea is still interested in dialogue with the United States."
Analysts of North Korean affairs note that Sept. 11 has changed the context for diplomacy from the North, which Washington still classifies as a terrorist state.
Until the final days of the Clinton administration, North Korea was working feverishly to engineer its removal from Washington's terrorist list, which would help the country qualify for financial aid from organizations like the World Bank.
Condemning the World Trade Center attack may have been a gesture aimed at remaking North Korea's image. Yet the most important clients for North Korea's weapons exports continue to be found in Central Asia and the Middle East and have included Iraq and Pakistan.
For this reason, beyond its strong ideological differences, North Korea is uncomfortable hewing close to American positions. "Right now, North Korea doesn't want to appear to be too inclined toward any party, whether it is the U.S. or the Islamic countries," said Park Young Ho, analyst at the Korea Institute for National Unification Relations, in Seoul.
He urged the United States to ignore today's editorial comment. "Washington must offer North Korea a wide-open door to resume talks at any time, without preconditions," he said. "That is the best hope for improvement in inter-Korean relations, which has benefits for the United States itself."

HEADLINE: Talks Fail to Entice Montenegro to Stay Yugoslav 

BYLINE:  By CARLOTTA GALL

DATELINE: BELGRADE, Serbia, Oct. 26 

 BODY:
Long-awaited talks between the presidents of Yugoslavia and of the tiny independent-minded republic of Montenegro broke off today without agreement on how to run a federal Yugoslav state, and the two leaders said Montenegro must hold a referendum on independence next spring.
 "We have tried today to bring closer our two platforms and we concluded that this is not possible," Vojislav Kostunica, the Yugoslav president, told reporters after meeting with Milo Djukanovic, the Montenegrin president. 
 "The public in Montenegro will give its opinion on this issue," he said. "We have concluded that this should come as soon as possible." 
Mr. Djukanovic said the two sides "agreed that there is no need to develop arguments any more, to waste time."
He said his government would start talks with opposition parties in Montenegro to organize a referendum, "to see what is the mood in Montenegro." The poll should take place in the spring, he added.
Serbia and Montenegro are the only remaining republics in the truncated state of Yugoslavia. Relations between them have long been strained by Montenegro's rejection of current federal arrangements and its push for independence.
Mr. Djukanovic made a strong bid for independence for his coastal republic of 650,000 people immediately after the fall of the former Yugoslav leader, Slobodan Milosevic, just over a year ago. But he has encountered opposition from European powers and the United States, and his plan only managed to win the support of some 50 percent of voters in Montenegrin general elections in April.
Mr. Kostunica and the other leaders of the reformist alliance now in power in Serbia have supported keeping the two republics together in one state but have repeatedly said Serbia will respect the decision of the Montenegrin people.
European states are worried that a change in borders within the Balkans could provide a precedent for others. Kosovo, still formally part of Serbia, wants independence, as do many Serbs living in the Serbian-held part of Bosnia.
Mr. Kostunica said that he and Mr. Djukanovic had agreed in their talks that the people of Serbia would not be consulted on the issue of Montenegrin independence and that it would be a matter only for the Montenegrins. People in Serbia have proved largely indifferent to the fate of Montenegro, and there is even growing impatience on the question, with some arguing that the issue is delaying reforms and economic development.
Although nominally a federal state, Yugoslavia has operated essentially as two separate countries for some time. Two years ago, Montenegro declared the German mark legal currency, and the Yugoslav dinar is now barely accepted in the republic. The Yugoslav Army, commanded from Belgrade, remains the only institution that operates across the two republics.
Mr. Djukanovic has for the last year sought a "union of independent states." He has said he wants Montenegro to have its own seat at the United Nations. After today's talks, Mr. Djukanovic repeated his determination to lead Montenegro on its own path. "It is impossible to establish the harmonious functioning of two disproportionate states like Serbia and Montenegro within the scope of one state," he said.
Montenegro broke with Serbia in 1994 and under the rule of Mr. Djukanovic won enthusiastic support from the West while it was seen as a plucky opponent of Mr. Milosevic's rule. Since Serbia's return to international acceptance, however, Montenegro has lost favor in the West and been criticized as having weak democratic institutions and serving as a haven for corruption and smuggling.

HEADLINE: Confidence Of Consumers Is Up a Bit, Survey Shows 

BYLINE:  By Reuters

 BODY:
Consumer sentiment improved slightly in October, a survey by the University of Michigan showed yesterday, but economists warned that confidence remained fragile. 
 The university's closely watched sentiment barometer rose to 82.7 in October from 81.8 last month, matching analysts' forecasts. But sentiment deteriorated in the last two weeks from the midmonth reading of 83.4, in line with weekly surveys and showing there was a risk consumer optimism could again erode should bioterrorism spread. 
 "Household assessments of economic conditions remain fragile," said Steven Wood, an economist with FinancialOxygen, adding that confidence levels were "sharply below where they were just a year ago."
Evidence that consumers remain wary was provided by a separate report on housing. The Commerce Department said sales of new homes fell 1.4 percent in September, showing that the once-resilient housing industry is beginning to falter.
New-home sales dropped to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 864,000 in September from the revised rate of 876,000 in August, the Commerce Department reported.
Still, the sales pace exceeded the forecasts of many economists.
"Yes, it didn't drop quite as much as expected, but it is a sign that home buyers are more hesitant about purchasing a new or existing home," said Stuart G. Hoffman, chief economist for PNC Financial Services Group in Pittsburgh.
New-home sales rates varied by region. The sales pace tumbled 26.6 percent in the Northeast but rose 21.2 percent in the Midwest. The rate fell 8.2 percent in the West and 1.4 percent in the South.
The University of Michigan consumer sentiment survey is based on roughly 500 telephone interviews with Americans across the country. The midmonth reading captures roughly 250 of that month-end total.
The current conditions index, which gauges views of the present financial situation, fell to 94.0 in October from 94.6 in September. The midmonth reading was 92.1.
The expectations index, which tracks attitudes about the coming year, rose to 75.5 in October from 73.5 in September.

Rally in Shares of Military Companies Lifts Blue Chips

BYLINE:  By Reuters

 BODY:
Blue-chip stocks rose yesterday, helped by a rally in military stocks in expectation of a huge government order for fighter jets, but technology stocks slipped on a dim sales outlook from the fiber optics maker JDS Uniphase.
 Most market indexes, closing out one of the busiest weeks of the third-quarter earnings season, surpassed levels before the Sept. 11 attacks. Wall Street is betting that the tax cuts from the government and the Federal Reserve's rate cuts will bolster the lagging economy and stimulate profit growth for corporate America in the coming months. 
 "The stock market is six months ahead of the economy," said Phil Foreman, who helps oversee $1.3 billion for Evergreen Investment. "There's no doubt we're in a bad recession now, but that's old news. We should focus on the probability of a recovery in 2002." 
Companies have reported the worst earnings in a decade -- down almost 22 percent -- but Wall Street is unfazed. For now, investors are jumping into stocks battered by a slide that has gone for a year and a half.
"We've had tax stimulus, the biggest interest rate cuts in a long time and an 18-month bear market," said Joseph Williams, a portfolio manager with the Commerce Trust Company, which oversees $10 billion. "Looking out a year, things are going to be much better."
The Dow Jones industrial average gained 82.27 points, or 0.9 percent, to close at 9,545.17, bolstered by the fighter jet engine maker United Technologies.
The broader Standard & Poor's 500-stock index rose 4.52 points, or 0.4 percent, to 1,104.61. 
The technology-heavy Nasdaq composite index slipped 6.51 points, or 0.4 percent, to 1,768.96.
For the week, the S.& P. 500 advanced 2.9 percent, the Nasdaq rose 5.8 percent and the Dow gained 3.7 percent.
Military stocks rallied in advance of Washington's selection of the Lockheed Martin Corporation over the Boeing Company to build its next-generation fighter jet in a program that could be worth more than $200 billion, the richest bonanza in military history.
Lockheed rose $1.02, to $49.92, while Boeing gained $1.78, to $37.68. United Technologies, which makes engines for both companies, surged $2.54, to $57.01.
The fiber optics components maker JDS Uniphase posted a steep loss for the quarter and said it expected sales to drop further as it completed a revamping to survive a downturn in the telecommunications industry. JDS fell $1.19, to $8.77.
VeriSign, which provides Web address and security services, fell $10.52, to $42.82, after Bear, Stearns downgraded the stock, saying deterioration in the company's domain name business may hurt profits.
Amgen rose $1.20, to $59.45, after it reported that earnings rose 5 percent. Amgen, a biotechnology company, said it expected double-digit earnings for the year.
Investors paid little heed to the latest economic news. A government report showed new-home sales fell 1.4 percent in September, to their lowest since August 2000 as the weak economy weighed on the housing sector. September's seasonally adjusted annual rate of 864,000, however, exceeded the expectations of analysts polled by Reuters, who had forecast a rate of 856,000.
The University of Michigan's consumer sentiment index rose to 82.7 in October from 81.8 in the previous month, as expected, indicating that consumers shook off the gloom from the terrorist attacks and rising joblessness.
Treasury prices rose yesterday. The 10-year Treasury note gained 5/32, to a price of 103 25/32. The note's yield, which moves in the opposite direction from the price, fell to 4.52 percent from 4.54 percent on Thursday.
The price of the 30-year Treasury bond rose 7/32, to 101 19/32. The bond's yield declined to 5.27 percent from 5.28 percent on Thursday.

HEADLINE: North Bend Journal; 
Seeing Treasure in an Oregon Wreck

BYLINE:  By The New York Times

DATELINE: NORTH BEND, Ore. 

 BODY:
All that remains of the freighter New Carissa is 2,300 tons of rusting steel: a severed engine room leaning heavily to starboard and a crane mired in the breakers near the passage to Coos Bay.
 They are just a shadow of what was for some time the region's most notable tourist attraction. 
 For North Bend, a town of 9,500 suffering from downturns in fishing and logging, the New Carissa was 639 feet of economic stimulus when it ran aground in February 1999 while en route to Coos Bay. Hotels and restaurants in North Bend and nearby filled to capacity with tourists, reporters and salvage experts. 
The townspeople gathered on hills overlooking the bay as the ship was broken by surf, then set on fire with napalm to burn off excess fuel oil.
"Right then it was kind of hot and heavy," one North Bend resident, Rod Baker, recalled.
Now, two and a half years into a stalled salvage operation, the ship is a shadow of its former self. The forward two-thirds of the hull were long ago towed 300 miles to sea and sunk.
Gov. John Kitzhaber sees the remainder as an eyesore on unspoiled public land, and has been adamant that it be removed. Green Atlas Shipping, the Panamanian company that owns the New Carissa, is drafting an environmental impact report for any remaining salvage options. 
But away from the state capital, Salem, and closer to the South Coast communities around the wreck, Oregonians sound increasingly hesitant to dispose of their new landmark.
"My personal opinion on the matter is they should just leave it," said Mr. Baker, who manages a dune-buggy rental company. "This isn't going to hurt anything; if anything it's going to attract more tourists in here. To this day, I get tourists inquiring about it."
Mr. Baker's business boomed after the wreck. He shuttled reporters to and from the site on a winding road of soft sand, in a converted school bus. The bus still makes the same run for large groups.
The sand road, almost impassible in summer, may be the New Carissa's way out. Most agree any salvage operation must go over land, which would require a temporary pier out to the wreck and a more substantial road over the sand. The wreck would be dismantled. The pieces would then have to cross a delicate coastal ecosystem, over land controlled by two state agencies and the federal Bureau of Land Management.
Because of environmental concerns, it will be at least two years before new salvage efforts can begin. That is just fine with Sharon Powell. She still displays four versions of New Carissa shirts in her North Bend silkscreening shop. 
"Can you send another ship and ground it?" she asked. "This town was hopping. It was actually one of the best times I've had in my life."
There is no formal effort to save the New Carissa in North Bend. But, without fail, it comes up at Chamber of Commerce meetings, and someone usually stands up to defend the broken ship's right to rest in peace. Receptionists at the local visitors center direct people there as readily as to a golf course or lighthouse. As one local marketing agent put it, "Everybody associates Coos Bay with the New Carissa."
A July report from Green Atlas Shipping agreed. "Shipwrecks have an appeal about them, as evidenced in local and state publicity material and restaurant menus," the company's salvage consultant wrote in response to lingering concerns over threats to wildlife. The state, dissatisfied, hired its own consultant.
The wreck has caused extensive harm. Clausen Oysters, a locally owned company, sued Green Atlas Shipping over oil-damaged harvesting grounds. Clausen lost most of its customers. And a federal report showed that oil killed 2,358 coastal birds, including 262 marbled murrelets, an endangered species. Green Atlas Shipping has already spent well over $30 million for recovery.
Small amounts of oil are almost certainly still inside the wreck, but no oil has been found on the beaches for more than two months.
Oregon is protective of its beaches, all of which are public property. But the coast is dotted with older wrecks visible at low tide. Alan Hoffmeister, a spokesman for the Bureau of Land Management, thinks the most recent should be folded into the landscape.
Surveying the wreck in the coastal winds, Mr. Hoffmeister, like many in North Bend, was at peace with the ship. "Over time, the sea will reclaim it, bit by bit," he said.

How to Lose a War

BYLINE:  By Frank Rich

 BODY:
Welcome back to Sept. 10.
 The "America Strikes Back" optimism that surged after Sept. 11 has now been stricken by the multitude of ways we're losing the war at home. The F.B.I. has proved more effective in waging turf battles against Rudy Giuliani than waging war on terrorism. Of the more than 900 suspects arrested, exactly zero have been criminally charged in the World Trade Center attack (though one has died of natural causes, we're told, in a New Jersey jail cell). The Bush team didn't fully recognize that a second attack on America had begun until more than a week after the first casualty. The most highly trumpeted breakthrough in the hunt for anthrax terrorists -- Tom Ridge's announcement that "the site where the letters were mailed" had been found in New Jersey -- proved a dead end. And now the president is posing with elementary-school children again. 
 Given that this is the administration that was touted as being run with C.E.O. clockwork, perhaps it should be added to the growing list of Things That Have Changed Forever since Sept. 11. But let's not be so hasty. Not everything changes that fast -- least of all Washington. The White House's home-front failures are not sudden, unpredictable products of wartime confusion but direct products of an ethos that has been in place since Jan. 20. 
This is an administration that will let its special interests -- particularly its high-rolling campaign contributors and its noisiest theocrats of the right -- have veto power over public safety, public health and economic prudence in war, it turns out, no less than in peacetime. When anthrax struck, the administration's first impulse was not to secure as much Cipro as speedily as possible to protect Americans, but to protect the right of pharmaceutical companies to profiteer. The White House's faith in tax cuts as a panacea for all national ills has led to such absurdities as this week's House "stimulus" package showering $254 million on Enron, the reeling Houston energy company (now under S.E.C. investigation) that has served as a Bush campaign cash machine. 
Airport security, which has been enhanced by at best cosmetic tweaks since Sept. 11, is also held hostage by campaign cash: As Salon has reported, ServiceMaster, a supplier of the low-wage employees who ineptly man the gates, is another G.O.P. donor. Not that Republicans stand alone in putting fat cats first. In a display of bipartisanship, Democrats -- lobbied by Linda Hall Daschle, the Senate majority leader's wife -- joined the administration in handing the airlines a $15 billion bailout that enforces no reduction in the salaries of the industry's C.E.O.'s even as they lay off tens of thousands of their employees. 
To see how the religious right has exerted its own distortions on homeland security, you also have to consider an administration pattern that goes back to its creation -- and one that explains the recent trials of poor Tom Ridge.
Mr. Ridge is by all accounts a capable leader -- a successful governor of a large state (Pennsylvania) who won the Bronze Star for heroism in Vietnam. A close friend of George W. Bush, he should have been in the administration from the get-go, and was widely rumored to be a candidate for various jobs, including the vice presidency. But after being pilloried by the right because he supports abortion rights, he got zilch. Instead of Mr. Ridge, the administration signed on the pro-life John Ashcroft and Tommy Thompson -- who have brought us where we are today. 
The farcical failures of these two cabinet secretaries are not merely those of public relations -- though Mr. Thompson often comes across as a Chamber of Commerce glad-hander who doesn't know his pants are on fire, and Mr. Ashcroft often shakes as if he's not just seen great Caesar's ghost but perhaps John Mitchell's as well. Both have a history of letting politics override public policy that dates to the start of the administration. They've seen no reason to reverse their partisan priorities even at a time when the patriotic duty of effectively fighting terror should be their No. 1 concern. 
Pre-Sept. 11, Mr. Thompson, in defiance of science, heartily lent his credibility to the Bush administration's stem cell "compromise" by going along with its overstatement of the viability and diversity of the stem cell lines it would deliver to researchers. Post-Sept. 11, he destroyed his credibility by understating the severity of the anthrax threat, also in defiance of science. Now he maintains that the $1.5 billion the administration is requesting to plug the many holes in our public health system -- almost all of it earmarked for stockpiling pharmaceuticals, not shoring up local hospitals -- is adequate for fighting bioterrorism. This, too, is in defiance of all expert estimates, including that of the one physician in the Senate, the Republican Bill Frist. 
It should also be on Mr. Thompson's conscience that for the first two weeks of the anthrax crisis he kept the federal government's house physician -- David Satcher, the surgeon general and a much-needed honest broker of public health -- locked away, presumably because Dr. Satcher, a Clinton appointee, became persona non grata in the Bush administration for issuing a June report on teenage sexuality that angered the religious right. Only after Mr. Ridge arrived on the scene was the surgeon general liberated from the gulag. 
As for Mr. Ashcroft, he has gone so far as to turn away firsthand information about domestic terrorism for political reasons. Planned Parenthood, which has been on the front lines of anthrax scares for years and has by grim necessity marshaled the medical and security expertise to combat them, has sought a meeting with the attorney general since he took office but has never been granted one. This was true not only before Sept. 11 but, says Ann Glazier, Planned Parenthood's director of security, remains true -- even though her organization, long targeted by such home-grown Talibans as the Army of God, has a decade's worth of leads on "the convergence of international and domestic terrorism." 
Ms. Glazier found the sight of Mr. Ashcroft and other federal Keystone Kops offering a $1 million reward for anthrax terrorists a laughable indication of how little grasp they have of the enemy. "Religious extremists don't respond to money," she points out. Such is the state of the F.B.I., she adds, that one agent told a clinic to hold onto a suspect letter for a couple of days "because we have so many here we're afraid we're going to lose it" (perhaps among the Timothy McVeigh documents). 
If either the attorney general or the secretary of health and human services inspired anything like the confidence that, say, Mayor Giuliani does, there wouldn't have been a need to draft Mr. Ridge. Even so, he's mainly a P.R. gimmick -- a man who should have been in the administration in the first place reduced to serving as a fig leaf for lightweights. As director of homeland security, he's allegedly charged with supervising nearly 50 government agencies -- so far with roughly a dozen staff members. When asked to define Mr. Ridge's responsibilities, Ari Fleischer said on Wednesday that it was "a very busy coordination job," but so far Mr. Ridge is mainly sowing still more confusion. 
The one specific duty that he has claimed -- in an interview with Tom Brokaw -- was that he'd be the one "making the phone call" to the president to shoot down any commercial airliner turned into a flying bomb by hijackers. That presumably comes as news to Donald Rumsfeld, who made no provision for any homeland security czar in the Air Force chain of command he publicly codified days after Mr. Ridge's appointment. 
Since the administration tightly metes out the news from Afghanistan, we can only hope that the war there is being executed more effectively than the war here -- even as Mr. Rumsfeld and his generals now tell us that the Taliban, once expected to implode in days, are proving Viet-Cong-like in their intractability. The Wall Street Journal also reported this week that "instead of a thankful Afghan population, popular support for the Taliban appears to be solidifying and anger with the U.S. growing." 
Maybe we're losing that battle for Afghan hearts and minds in part because the Bush State Department appointee in charge of the propaganda effort is a C.E.O. (from Madison Avenue) chosen not for her expertise in policy or politics but for her salesmanship on behalf of domestic products like Head & Shoulders shampoo. If we can't effectively fight anthrax, I guess it's reassuring to know we can always win the war on dandruff.

HEADLINE: Anthrax Slows the Mail and the Paying of Bills 

BYLINE:  By RIVA D. ATLAS

 BODY:
With the anthrax scare leading to scattered delays in mail delivery, some mortgage, credit card and utility payments are not reaching their destinations on time. 
 The Potomac Electric Power Company, which provides electric service in the Washington area, says it will waive late fees because so much of its mail has been waylaid. 
 Many more utilities and credit card companies with customers on the East Coast waived fees and penalties immediately after the September attacks, in an acknowledgment of how many lives had been disrupted. 
But no longer. 
The United States Postal Service has said that mail delivery is continuing despite the anthrax outbreaks, suggesting that it is time for business to return to normal. 
"We are seeing no trends of mail being delayed," said Charlotte Gilbert-Biro, a spokeswoman for J. P. Morgan Chase, one of the nation's largest mortgage, auto and credit card lenders. "If we do, we will customize our approach as appropriate." 
Like many other banks contacted, J. P. Morgan Chase said that people with specific problems could receive a fee waiver and should contact the bank.
Given the weak economy, credit card companies are already seeing an increase in the number of customers who are unable to pay their bills, said Greg McBride, an analyst with Bankrate.com. 
"The banks were quick to be accommodating for one billing cycle, but if this is a prolonged problem, there is a limit to how accommodating they can be," he said. 
People whose payments for October arrived late may not realize it until they receive next month's bill.
But some small-business owners say the delay in mail delivery has already become apparent.
"We've resorted to asking customers to use Federal Express or wire transfer," said Robert McKinley, chief executive of CardWeb.com, a Web site based in Frederick, Md., with information on the credit card business and related industries. 
Mr. McKinley said he suspected that recent events would encourage more people to pay their credit card bills online, a practice that is growing in popularity but still accounts for only a fraction of the business.
Potomac Electric Power Company, or Pepco, has waived fees because its mail was processed through the Brentwood mail processing center in Washington, which was closed after several workers there were exposed to anthrax.
Along with waiving late fees, Pepco urged customers to sign up for online bill payment.
And its customers responded.
The number of people who logged on to the online payment page on the company's Web site rose nearly 50 percent higher in the first three days of this week, according to Robert Dobkin, a spokesman for the company.

HEADLINE: Goldman Gets More Pieces Of Energy Pie 

BYLINE:  By PATRICK McGEEHAN

 BODY:
Investing in power-generating companies has been a rough ride in the last few months, but the Goldman Sachs Group seems to be making a tidy profit at every turn.
 Yesterday, the Constellation Energy Group said it would cancel a plan to split off its unregulated power-marketing business and break an agreement that called for Goldman to invest $250 million in the new operation. As the price of backing out of the plan, Constellation said it would pay Goldman $355 million -- about $200 million more than it owed Goldman under a contract between the firms. 
 Word of that windfall came just four weeks after Reliant Resources said it would pay $2.9 billion in cash for Orion Power Holdings, a generating company formed three years ago by Goldman and Constellation. Goldman, together with various investment partnerships it manages, owned about 37 percent of Orion, a stake that the Reliant deal values at more than $1 billion. 
If that deal is completed, the total gain from the two transactions for Goldman and other investors in Goldman's funds will exceed $800 million, not counting the advisory and underwriting fees Goldman has received from Orion, Reliant and Constellation. How much of that profit will reach Goldman's bottom line -- and when -- is not yet clear, but the firm is expected to record pretax gains of more than $400 million by early next year.
"The way that Goldman has approached this business has always been on the financial side," said Gerald Keenan, energy strategy partner at PricewaterhouseCoopers in Chicago. "When there's money to be made, they'll make investments, and when there are opportunities to sell, they'll sell.
"In terms of who's had a better sense of timing in getting in and getting out of this business," Mr. Keenan added, "nobody comes to mind right off hand."
With the fading of the energy crisis that roiled California last winter and spring, investors have been getting out of the electric utility sector.
Electricity prices have sunk, and the stock prices of independent power producers, the darlings of utility investors less than a year ago, have sunk along with them. "The days of wine and roses are over in terms of easy money," said Paul Patterson, an analyst at ABN Amro in New York. "It was very easy to make a lot of money when power prices were high. That situation has changed very rapidly."
Since late May, the Dow Jones utility average has dropped about 25 percent. During the same period, the fortunes of companies that sell electricity on the wholesale market have reversed.
Four or five months ago, those companies traded for 20 to 30 times per-share earnings, a considerably higher multiple than investors paid for regulated utilities that distribute power to homes and businesses, Mr. Patterson said. Now, they sell for 8 to 11 times earnings, less than the typical dividend-paying electric utility, he said.
"The enthusiasm has faded tremendously," Mr. Patterson said.
Not at Goldman, according to officials there. Gary Cohn, the managing director who oversees the firm's power marketing and trading operation, said that the ending of the firm's joint venture with Constellation would not alter Goldman's strategy.
"We are still firmly committed to the power markets, and we intend to be a player in power marketing and trading," Mr. Cohn said. "From the trading and power marketing side, I don't think the opportunities are any less than they were a year or two ago."
But it may be a long time before there is another opportunity to make big, fast profits in the power-generating business as Goldman did with Orion. That company was a product of the partnership Goldman struck with Constellation, the parent of Baltimore Gas and Electric, three years ago as the electricity market was being deregulated.
The two companies formed a venture that combined Constellation's experience as a generator and distributor with Goldman's expertise in trading commodities. With $350 million from Goldman and its investment partnerships, Orion strung together a collection of power plants from New York City to Cleveland.
Goldman took the company public in November 2000, selling 27.5 million shares for $20 each. By May, as the power supply waned and the appetite for stocks of power producers surged, Orion sold another 13 million shares for $27.35.
In July, competitors were circling, eager to acquire Orion. The company's directors, influenced by the prospect of a return to tighter government regulation of the industry after the California crisis, decided to auction off the company.
The highest bidder, at $26.80 a share in cash, was Reliant Resources, which Goldman had taken public in April after the company was spun off by Reliant Energy.
Of the $2.9 billion that Reliant agreed to pay, a little more than $1 billion would go to Goldman and its investment funds, leaving them to divide up a profit of more than $650 million. Goldman officials declined to say how much of that gain would go to the firm and how much to the clients and employees who invested in the funds.
In the Constellation breakup, by contrast, Goldman itself will receive the $355 million Constellation has agreed to pay. 
The risk is that its divorce from Constellation will leave Goldman without a power-generating partner to bail it out if its traders become caught in a squeeze caused by a spike in power demand.
"This is a very hard business to be only a financial trader in, because especially on the electricity side, the markets aren't particularly liquid," Mr. Keenan said. "They're reasonably opaque, and there's not enough history in them to serve as a guide." 
For that reason, Mr. Keenan said, Goldman's main rival on Wall Street, Morgan Stanley, has taken and held onto ownership positions in some power plants. He said he expected Goldman might do likewise after the utility market hits bottom.
"If you're Goldman, this is a good time to be patient," he said. "The market's heading down, which means that assets are likely to be cheaper in 12 months."

U.S. Selects Lockheed For Stealth Fighter Contract
Ending a five-year competition, the Pentagon announced that it had awarded a contract to build a new generation of supersonic stealth fighter jets for the Air Force, Navy and Marine Corps to Lockheed Martin over Boeing.
 The contract is expected to be worth more than $200 billion and calls for Lockheed to build more than 3,000 of the aircraft over the coming two decades. Page A1. 

Dow and S.& P. 500 Gain Ground
A rally in military stocks helped propel blue chips, but technology stocks lost ground. The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index rose 4.52 points, or 0.4 percent, to 1,104.61. For the week, the S.& P. 500 advanced 2.9 percent. the Dow Jones industrial average gained 82.27 points, or 0.9 percent, to close at 9,545.17, while the technology-laden Nasdaq composite index slipped 6.51 points, or 0.4 percent, to 1,768.96. For the week, the Dow gained 3.7 percent and the Nasdaq rose 5.8 percent. The yield on the 10-year note was 4.52 percent. C4.

Senate's Insurance Plan Takes Form
The Bush administration and the three senior members of the Senate banking committee reached agreement on a framework for a financial assistance package for the insurance industry. Under the plan, insurers would pay all claims, up to a certain amount, possibly $10 billion, from any terrorist attacks next year and the government would pay most of any additional losses. Officials attending the meeting said that precise contribution formulas of the government remained to be worked out. B1.

Lernout Assets Attract Bidders
Fonix, a tiny, money-losing voice technology company in Salt Lake City, is among those interested in the remains of Lernout & Hauspie, the Belgian software maker declared insolvent and ordered liquidated by a court on Wednesday. And the founders of Dragon Systems plan to bid for Lernout's core businesses. C2.

Anthem Conversion Is Approved
Indiana regulators approved the conversion of Anthem Inc., one of the nation's largest Blue Cross and Blue Shield insurers, to a publicly traded company from a mutual insurance company owned by policyholders. Anthem plans to sell shares valued at about $1.4 billion in an initial public offering next Tuesday. C3.

Liberty Media in Talks in Germany
Liberty Media, the Denver-based cable giant run by John C. Malone, is in talks to buy Tele-Columbus, a large regional cable television system, from Deutsche Bank, people close to the discussions said. Deutsche Bank may sell the entire German company for as much as $1.2 billion or split Tele-Columbus's 2.2 million subscribers between Liberty Media and Callahan Associates of London. C2.

Enron Buys Back $3 Billion of Debt
Enron, trying to reassure investors that it has ample liquidity, began to repurchase all its outstanding commercial paper, using $3.3 billion it had borrowed from banks. C2.

Drug Companies Aim to Please
Pharmaceutical companies have tried in many ways the last several days to show they are good corporate citizens, offering free or discounted drugs to treat anthrax and pledging to supply teams of their best experts to help fight bioterrorism. Critics have denounced some of the steps as inadequate. B8.

Consumer Sentiment Improves a Bit
Consumer sentiment improved slightly in October, a survey by the University of Michigan showed, but economists warned that confidence remained fragile. Separately, the Commerce Department said that sales of new homes fell 1.4 percent, to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 864,000 in September, showing that once-resilient housing industry is beginning to falter.

HEADLINE: A NATION CHALLENGED: CHARITY; 
Disaster Fades Into the Past, But Generosity Does Not

BYLINE:  By AARON DONOVAN

 BODY:
The New York Times 9/11 Neediest Fund has received $42 million for the victims of the attack on the World Trade Center, their families and those who lost jobs as a result of the disaster and the skittish economic climate.
 The pace of giving has declined more slowly than officials at the fund had anticipated. "It's been two weeks since we've stopped publishing stories about the fund, and contributions have continued briskly in spite of that," said Jack Rosenthal, president of the Times Company Foundation, which administers the fund. 
 Meanwhile, people requesting help with rent, utility bills and other expenses have flooded the agencies that the fund supports. 
"It started off rather slow, but over the last two to three weeks, the volume of calls has literally gone through the roof," said David R. Jones, chief executive of the Community Service Society of New York, one of the 10 local charities supported by the fund.
The Community Service Society, which put in a request for $65,000 in reimbursements this week, and expects to request $75,000 next week, has asked retired workers to come back temporarily to help deal with the extra requests for help, and is hiring six social workers, who will counsel and assist those in need.
"In order to get back to our regular work of helping the poor, particularly as the recession begins, we need to make sure we can bring on extra resources to help on the wave of people who came in after Sept. 11," Mr. Jones said.
The Federation of Protestant Welfare Agencies, too, is looking to hire extra staff to take phone calls for help and handle related paperwork. It typically handles fewer than 20 calls for help a day, but has been receiving 40 to 50 calls daily in recent weeks.
"It seems to be increasing gradually to a dramatic flow right now," said Megan E. McLaughlin, executive director of the agency. "Our expectation is that this might continue as people realize that they're in deep trouble and they accept whatever the new realities are, whether it's the loss of a family member or the loss of a job."
The 10 agencies have asked for $3.9 million from the fund. "We're really pleased that our 10 participating agencies have been able to do so much frontline good work from the first day and that applications are now increasing to all of them," Mr. Rosenthal said. "Reader generosity has been so great that it appears we'll be able to meet all of those direct service needs and also address larger structural needs."
For those needs, the fund has made grants and commitments of about $10 million to several initiatives. Those include $2.9 million to help small businesses downtown and $2.6 million to create therapeutic after-school programs for children who attend schools near the trade center site. It also includes $2 million to create counseling groups in the New York metropolitan area and Washington, as well as $2 million for a program run by mental health experts in New York to train psychotherapists and social workers in long-term trauma counseling.
"The experience of Oklahoma City tells us that long-term needs should never be underestimated," Mr. Rosenthal said. "We have a responsibility to victims, short term and long term, and I want to be sure we meet their long-term needs as well."
The increasing needs of city residents are being met by the generosity of tens of thousands of people who gave to the fund. 
"More people have joined the ranks of those who need mental health counseling, emergency cash assistance, jobs and housing," Dr. McLaughlin said. "The need for help has increased in volume and increased in its intensity."

HEADLINE: New York's Olympic Bid 

 BODY:
The United States Olympic Committee gave a vote of confidence in New York when it designated the city yesterday as a finalist among the American sites for the 2012 Olympics. Some committee members no doubt wanted to help the city in its time of trial. But holding the games in New York made sense in many ways before Sept. 11, and continues to be an exciting prospect -- if questions of financing and facilities can be resolved. Unfortunately, the if's still loom very large. 
 New York City's bid for the Olympics, assembled by a team of experts with the support of Gov. George Pataki and Mayor Rudolph Giuliani, has been put together with imagination. It would capitalize on the city's transportation assets and call for more than $1 billion in revenues, ticket sales and sponsorships to pay for new athletic and transport facilities in all five boroughs. The committee wants to put an Olympic stadium on Manhattan's West Side, financed in conjunction with an expansion of the Javits Convention Center. The Javits expansion is more important now than ever in light of the need to go after tourism dollars for New York's economy. A West Side stadium is a much more questionable idea, and the Olympic planners might want to consider other alternatives. 
 The city's drive to get the Olympics is uphill. The other finalists designated yesterday were Washington, D.C., Houston and San Francisco. The United States will designate its choice next year, and the winner will have to compete with Rome, Paris, London and many other cities. 
New York may be an emotional favorite, but by 2012 the city certainly expects to have recovered from the trauma of Sept. 11. The city would provide an exciting venue for the Games, and its ability to provide security for the guests and athletes is as good as or better than any other large metropolis. But the numbers and details still have to make sense. A lot of work remains to be done before New Yorkers can imagine themselves welcoming the high-hurdlers and platform divers of the world.

HEADLINE: A NATION CHALLENGED: THE AID BILL; 
White House and Key Senators Revise Proposal on Aid to Insurers

BYLINE:  By STEPHEN LABATON

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Oct. 26 

 BODY:
The Bush administration and the three senior members of the Senate banking committee reached agreement today on a framework for a financial assistance package for the insurance industry. Under the plan, the government would not provide any assistance until after the industry suffered significant losses, perhaps as high as $10 billion, from any terrorist attacks next year, administration and Congressional officials said.
 Officials attending the meeting said that precise contribution formulas of the government remained to be worked out. The negotiators discussed a plan today under which the government would contribute 70 percent to 90 percent for claims above an initial deductible. The lawmakers would like to set that deductible at $10 billion, while administration officials said that figure was still being negotiated. 
 The plan, which significantly modifies the White House's proposal, was hammered out at an hour-and-a-half-long meeting on Capitol Hill today between Treasury Secretary Paul H. O'Neill and the three top members of the banking committee: Paul S. Sarbanes, Democrat of Maryland and the committee's chairman; Phil Gramm of Texas, the ranking Republican; and Christopher J. Dodd, Democrat of Connecticut and the chairman of the Banking Subcommittee on Securities and Investment.
The administration had originally proposed that the government cover 80 percent of the first $20 billion in losses next year, and 90 percent of any additional losses. Lawmakers have told the administration that they will never be able to adopt legislation that requires the government to pay for most of the losses from the first dollar of claims to protect a financially healthy and well-capitalized industry. 
The Senate meeting considerably improves the odds that Congress will be able to complete its work on an insurance measure before it leaves town for the year, officials said, although some obstacles remain.
Lawmakers in the House have been moving more slowly and are expected to come up with their own package soon. House leaders hastily canceled a meeting that was to have occurred today with Mr. O'Neill and other top administration aides. That meeting is expected to be held next week. 
With time running short on the legislative calendar and many insurance contracts expiring at the end of the year, momentum has been building for an assistance package for the insurers. Administration officials say that legislation is needed to head off a potential economic crisis. They have testified that if adequate terrorist coverage is not offered by insurers, banks and other lenders around the country will stop offering loans, or raise their costs, for construction, manufacturing and other projects in industries like energy and transportation. 
The proposal under discussion today would also impose a new federal requirement on all property and casualty insurers that any of the policies they underwrite must include coverage for any losses from terrorist attacks. It would also move the federal government, which has left regulation of the industry to the states, into a new supervisory role.
The Treasury Department would have the authority to audit insurers and force them to make certain disclosures before they could be reimbursed for claims. 
The proposal would permit Congress to extend the two-year plan by another year if the insurance markets continue to encounter problems with adequate coverage for terrorist attacks. It would achieve the administration's objective of keeping the government out of the business of setting premiums.
Participants at the Senate meeting said it left unresolved several important details. In particular, there remains widespread disagreement about an administration proposal that, as part of the insurance package, would impose limits on punitive damages and force victims to resolve their claims in a single federal court, precluding them from using state courts or moving outside the district of a terrorist attack.
Mr. Sarbanes and other Democrats have been skeptical about efforts to limit the liability of insurers and carry out other changes to the legal system. He was said by several participants to have expressed doubts about the administration's proposal at today's meeting. He has said that any legislation curtailing the existing legal rights of victims of terrorist attacks would be unfair.
Senators Dodd and Gramm are more sympathetic to the administration's position. Mr. O'Neill and other aides to President Bush maintain that the court system has too many avenues for abuses and that because the government may wind up paying many billions of dollars in losses, it needs to be protected from what officials say are "frivolous" claims and punitive damages.
Officials expect that legislation embodying the framework discussed today will be drafted shortly and filed as early as next week.

HEADLINE: RUNNING; 
A Freshman Has Learned to Go the Distance

BYLINE:  By MARC BLOOM

 BODY:
On the University of Michigan campus in Ann Arbor, Mich., Ron Warhurst, the men's cross-country coach, has a new role this fall. He has to get his athletes accustomed to reporters, big crowds, autograph hounds and all sorts of attention -- an unprecedented fuss in the low-key world of collegiate cross-country.
 "When we walk out there to run, people are going to look at you," Warhurst told his team before a home meet last week. "They'll be looking for Alan. Enjoy the attention. This is what it's like to have a big-time sport." 
 Alan is Alan Webb, who as a high school senior ran the mile in 3 minutes 53.43 seconds last May, breaking Jim Ryun's 36-year-old scholastic record by nearly two seconds. Webb, now a freshman at Michigan, is causing such a stir as a member of the cross-country team that one might think he was the football team's prize recruit.
At the Wolverines' home meet on Oct. 14, the Michigan Interregional, 2,000 fans turned out in the rain to watch Webb run. They got what they came for. Webb powered through the muddy eight-kilometer course (about five miles) in 25:12 for a 32-second victory, as Michigan defeated five other schools for the team title. Afterward, Webb met with fans in a scheduled appearance that was listed this way on the meet program: "Autographs, 12:45 p.m."
Three weeks earlier, on Sept. 22, Webb sparked the same excitement when he ran his first college race, the Great American Festival in Rock Hill, S.C. After trailing in 25th place through two miles, Webb put on a three-mile kick, as the announcer called it, and won with a sprint finish in 24:06 for eight kilometers.
Afterward, high school competitors and their coaches and parents lined up to meet Webb, take pictures with him, and have him autograph their T-shirts, hats, duffel bags and water bottles. Webb obliged with the same blend of modesty and charisma he displayed in June when he joked on "Late Night With David Letterman."
Webb shrugged off the commotion, saying he was pleased to get a college race under his belt. "I wanted to play it conservatively," he said. "It was my first 8K. I'm just trying to find my zone."
By that, he meant how hard he could push himself in long-distance running. Few milers are great cross-country runners. They run distance in the fall to acquire strength for shorter-track racing in the spring and summer. That is Webb's goal as well, but so far he has taken so naturally to long-distance running that Warhurst thinks he could exceed even the loftiest expectations.
"I don't want to put limits on the kid," Warhurst said.
Webb's 3:53 mile last spring has had track fans drooling over a possible sub-3:50 in 2002. Now, some people think a time closer to 3:48 or even 3:47 is not beyond reason. The American record for the mile is 3:47.69, set by Steve Scott in 1982. The world record is 3:43.13, set by Hicham El Guerrouj of Morocco in 1999.
Could Webb start to approach these times as soon as next summer?
Webb, 18, would only say that his current goal is preparing to run 10,000 meters (6.2 miles), which will be the men's distance at the N.C.A.A. cross-country championships next month at Furman University in Greenville, S.C. Webb's next race is the Big Ten cross-country meet tomorrow in Champaign, Ill.
Webb, who attended South Lakes High School in Reston, Va., returned to his birthplace when he decided to attend Michigan. His father, Steven, was once an economics professor at the university. His mother, Katherine, a speech therapist, also worked there.
Last season, Webb's sensational time at the Prefontaine Classic in Eugene, Ore., broke the high school record set by Ryun, who became America's greatest miler. At 18, Ryun defeated Peter Snell of New Zealand, an Olympic champion. At 19, he set his first world mile record. At 20, he outran Kip Keino of Kenya, an Olympic champion.
Comparisons between Webb and Ryun are inevitable. "His toughest challenge now may be the burden of high expectations," Ryun, a third-term United States representative from Kansas, recently wrote in Time magazine about Webb.
So far, Webb seems quite unburdened. He is a practical joker who is apt to take the coach's car when he is not looking. He works so hard in training that whatever Warhurst dishes out, Webb wants more.
In a recent workout, Webb did eight 1,000-meter runs at a fast pace, with only a one-minute rest between runs. He did his last two hard runs in 2:30, which is four-minute-mile pace. On the sideline, the world-class miler Kevin Sullivan of Canada, a Michigan graduate who assists Warhurst, shook his head in awe.
"Don't be easy on me," Webb said.

HEADLINE: COLLEGE FOOTBALL; 
Sooners and Huskers: Two Originals in a Sequel

BYLINE:  By JOE LAPOINTE

DATELINE: LINCOLN, Neb., Oct. 26 

 BODY:
In the Game of the Century, Johnny Rodgers made the play of the day. Less than four minutes into the game between Nebraska and Oklahoma on Nov. 25, 1971, in Norman, Okla., Rodgers produced a weaving, 72-yard punt return for a touchdown that helped Nebraska to a 35-31 victory. The game 30 years ago between two great teams from nearby states in search of a national championship was a shifting struggle until the final moments. Will there ever be another like it?
 Perhaps yes, Rodgers said, maybe as soon as Saturday, when the Cornhuskers and the Sooners meet again. "We're billing this one now as the game of this century," Rodgers said. "We have the makings. Our football team is in a position to make history. They have a great team at Oklahoma. They are No. 1 and the national champions, just as we were in 1971. We can take their throne away." 
 How big is the game? Oklahoma (7-0) is rated third in the New York Times computer ranking, second in the two major polls and first in the Bowl Championship Series, which will determine the participants in the title game. Nebraska (8-0) is first in the Times ranking, second in the B.C.S. and third in the two major polls. Visiting Oklahoma has won its last 20 games. Nebraska has won its last 19 games at home. Saturday's winner will have the inside track in the B.C.S. 
"Games like this, you've been dreaming of since you were little," DeJuan Groce, a Nebraska cornerback, said.
Eric Crouch, Nebraska's senior quarterback and Heisman trophy candidate, said of the matchup: "It's almost like a mini-national championship. There's a tremendous history between the two teams. When you mention these two teams together, a lot of eyes get a little bit wider. It's something very exciting for this team, for this state and probably for this country."
The game could be significant for Crouch's Heisman hopes. Crouch, who runs the option offense, leads Division I-A in rushing touchdowns with 14 and has carried the ball 136 times for 777 yards; he has completed 65 of 112 passes for 986 yards, 7 touchdowns and 5 interceptions. It could also be difficult for him and his surgically repaired throwing shoulder. Several Nebraska stars, including tight end Tracey Wistrom, offensive tackle David Volk and cornerback Keyuo Craver, are recovering from recent injuries. Their availability is uncertain. 
Crouch will face Oklahoma's great defense, which is led by linebacker Rocky Calmus and strong safety Roy Williams. The Sooner stars are experienced, skilled, aggressive and ready for Crouch. "It's no secret Crouch is the go-to guy," Calmus said. "That's our goal: stop Crouch. You've got to swarm him."
Williams, second on the team behind Calmus in tackles, said: "Crouch is a game-breaker. We can't miss tackles on him. We can't overrun Crouch. He's a deadly weapon."
A fifth-year senior who is 32-5 as a starter, Crouch stands in contrast to Jason White, the Oklahoma sophomore who has started only one game at quarterback since replacing Nate Hybl. He completed 32 of 44 passes for 343 yards and a touchdown last Saturday in a 33-17 victory over Baylor, and was sacked eight times.
"It makes us feel a little better knowing it's possible," Nebraska defensive tackle Jeremy Slechta said of the sacks.
The sack problem can be fixed, White said. "I'm going to have to get my reads a lot faster, learn to throw the ball away."
When asked whether he gets nervous before games, White replied, "I get jitters more now than I ever have." He has never played in Lincoln, where spectators wear Husker scarlet as opposed to Sooner crimson. "I just heard it's outrageous up there," White said.
While the outcome of the game will have major consequences, it might not be the teams' only meeting this season. Nebraska and Oklahoma play in different divisions of the Big 12 Conference, and they could meet again on Dec. 1 in Dallas in the league championship game. It is also conceivable, although unlikely, that they could split those two games and play a third time for the national championship at the Rose Bowl in Pasadena, Calif., on Jan. 3.
Along with the colors red and white worn by players and fans of both teams, another similarity is the importance of college football in both states. Neither has a major league professional franchise in any sport. "We're their National Football League out here," Williams said.
The teams present other mirror images as they prepare for their 80th meeting since 1912. Both schools have histories of national championships and Heisman winners. Both are based in stadiums called Memorial Stadium. They are located in the middle of the country, bordering Kansas on opposite sides. Both coaches come from northern Ohio: Bob Stoops for the Sooners, Frank Solich for the Huskers.
Unlike some college rivalries, there is an air of mutual respect. Rodgers, who won the Heisman in 1972, said some of his best friends are Sooners. He mentioned three: Billy Sims, Steve Owens and Greg Pruitt. Sims and Owens happened to have won the Heisman. Pruitt placed third and second in different years. In national championships, Oklahoma has a 7-5 lead. In Heismans, Oklahoma leads, 3-2. In the overall series, Oklahoma leads, 40-36-3. They played every year from 1928 through 1997, but the formation of the Big 12 and its two divisions meant no games in 1998 and 1999. Oklahoma won last year, 31-14, on the way to an unbeaten season.
But Nebraska had won nine of the previous 10 games after scandals involving players' behavior and a carousel of coaches plunged the Oklahoma program into recession. The Sooners returned to prominence under Stoops, a disciple of Florida Coach Steve Spurrier. He employs Steve Spurrier Jr. on his staff. The senior Spurrier, Stoops said, "has been the biggest influence on me outside of my father." Stoops's father was a high school coach.
Stoops has been criticized this week for not suspending two players, the starting linebacker Teddy Lehman and the backup tight end Lance Donley, who were arrested last Sunday morning after an alcohol-fueled incident. "I'm very aware of what is right and wrong," Stoops said. "They will be disciplined. Sometimes, people feel suspension is the only way you can discipline players. That's not true." 
Aside from the 1971 classic, the best-remembered games of the series include a 24-0 Nebraska victory in the stadium opening in Lincoln in 1923; a 0-0 tie in 1937 in the mud at Lincoln; and a 49-35 victory for Oklahoma at Norman in 1950 when Billy Vessels of the Sooners, the eventual Heisman winner, rushed for 208 yards and 3 touchdowns, and passed for another to help his team to its first national championship.
Then, in 1978, there was a 17-14 victory for Nebraska in which Sims of Oklahoma fumbled and turned the ball over at the Nebraska 3-yard line near the end of the game. A few weeks later, Oklahoma avenged the defeat with a 31-24 victory in the Orange Bowl in Miami.
Solich, the Nebraska coach, has been showing his players highlights of past games and amusing them with pop quizzes about historic moments. When Rodgers gets together with his buddies from Oklahoma, he said they might remind him that his punt return in 1971 should have been called back by a clipping penalty that officials did not to see. Rodgers recalled the play differently.
"I couldn't have got to where I was going without the other 10 players on my team and some great blocks," Rodgers said. "The only thing I asked of them was to meet me at the end zone." It was one of several key moments in the game. Although Nebraska took a 7-0 lead on Rodgers's return, Oklahoma led by 14-10 at halftime. Nebraska led by 11 in the third quarter, but Oklahoma pulled ahead by 31-28 in the fourth quarter.
On Nebraska's winning drive, on third-and-8, Rodgers gained 11 yards and a first down after catching a pass the Sooners still claim hit the ground. Six plays later, Jeff Kinney scored the winning touchdown on a 2-yard run. But everyone talks mostly of the punt return. "It was the only play of the game that was outside the norm," Rodgers said. "We really stung them."
Was it really the best college game of the 20th century? An impartial observer, Bernie Kish, the executive director of the college football Hall of Fame, said it was. The other contenders, Kish said, are Notre Dame's 18-13 victory over Ohio State in 1935, Notre Dame's 0-0 tie with Army in 1946 and Notre Dame's 10-10 tie with Michigan State in 1966.
The ties cannot be the best, Kish said, because they lacked the "gangbusters luster" of the 1971 Nebraska-Oklahoma game, "which was a great football game because it went back and forth."
Speaking of the Nebraska-Oklahoma tradition, Rodgers said: "It was such a great rivalry, it made each team go to a higher level. It made us be that much better. We never had malicious feelings or tried to play dirty football. It was just: Who was the best?"
Of the best game, played three decades ago, Rodgers added: "There are people at Oklahoma who talk about that football game as much as we do at Nebraska. And they lost."

PHELPS DODGE, COPPER PRODUCER, SEES QUARTERLY LOSS

BYLINE:  Bloomberg News

 BODY:
 The Phelps Dodge Corporation, the second-largest copper producer, will lose $1.20 to $1.35 a share in the fourth quarter as the price of the metal fell, its chief executive, J. Steven Whisler, said yesterday. 
Three months ago, Mr. Whisler said he expected a loss of $3.10 to $3.30 a share. Copper prices are close to a two-year low in New York and a 14-year low in London as weakening economies erode demand for wire and pipes.

HEADLINE: Lockheed Wins $200 Billion Deal for Fighter Jet 

BYLINE:  By JAMES DAO with LAURA M. HOLSON

DATELINE: WASHINGTON Oct. 26

 BODY:
Ending a fevered five-year competition, the Pentagon announced today that it had awarded what is expected to become the largest military contract in American history to Lockheed Martin to build a new generation of supersonic stealth fighter jets for the Air Force, Navy and Marine Corps.
 The contract, which was announced after markets closed today, is expected to be worth more than $200 billion and calls for Lockheed to build more than 3,000 of the relatively low-cost aircraft over the next two decades. Anticipated overseas sales and maintenance contracts could double Lockheed's revenues, industry analysts say. 
 "The Lockheed Martin team was a clear winner," said James Roche, the secretary of the Air Force, who was in charge of the selection process. 
The decision was a blow to the losing bidder, Boeing, the nation's second largest military contractor after Lockheed. Boeing was already facing 30,000 layoffs in its commercial aircraft division and many industry experts had said that it could quit the fighter jet business if it lost this competition.
Immediately after the announcement, Boeing's allies on Capitol Hill said they would offer legislation requiring that production on the jet be split between the two companies. They also vowed to push the Pentagon to increase its purchases of other Boeing aircraft, including cargo planes and refueling tankers, to mitigate the company's economic woes.
"The Joint Strike Fighter decision today is obviously a real disappointment to us," Phil Condit, Boeing's chairman, said in a news conference where he also expressed the hope the contract would be split. "We are ready to bring our capabilities and skills to Lockheed Martin's team."
Edward C. Aldridge, the undersecretary of defense for acquisition, technology and logistics, said at a news conference that the Pentagon would oppose legislation requiring Lockheed to share business with Boeing, arguing that the winner-take-all approach would keep costs down. But he said the government would not object to Lockheed and Boeing negotiating a voluntary deal. 
"We'll do what the government would like us to do," said Dain M. Hancock, Lockheed's president.
More Chevrolet than Porsche, the Joint Strike Fighter, which will be known as the F-35, is intended to attack ground targets rather than engage in aerial dogfights, a mission that will go to the more nimble F-22 Raptor also being developed by Lockheed. As the Pentagon moves increasingly to unmanned aircraft, the F-35 could be the last piloted fighter to be built in the United States, experts say.
Despite Boeing's problems, Lockheed Martin needed the contract more, analysts said. Based in Bethesda, Md., Lockheed makes the Air Force's F-16 and F-22 fighter jets, both of which are expected to end production in the next decade. Boeing, based in Chicago, makes an array of military transport and refueling aircraft, and is also a leader in developing pilotless military aircraft -- all in addition to its commercial aircraft line.
With so much money and so many jobs at stake, lobbying by the companies and their Congressional patrons was intense. Both companies spent millions on marketing, advertising and campaign contributions in the past year. And members of the Missouri Congressional delegation, where Boeing makes military aircraft, aggressively warned the administration that President Bush would lose votes in their state if Lockheed won. 
Until recently, the Joint Strike Fighter had been viewed as one of the Pentagon's more endangered programs, and the decision to award the contract underscored the prominent role air power has come to play in American military planning, one being reaffirmed by the war in Afghanistan.
The Pentagon is now moving ahead with three fighter programs: the Joint Strike Fighter, the F-22 air-to-air combat fighter for the Air Force and F/A-18 E/F carrier-based jet for the Navy. Those programs together could cost more than $400 billion over the coming two decades.
The Joint Strike Fighter contract alone is so large that it could force the Pentagon to delay, trim or cancel other programs, like the Navy's stealth destroyer and the Army's Crusader mobile artillery system.
While today's decision is a major step forward for the Joint Strike Fighter, it does not ensure smooth sailing to the program's end. Lockheed must pass a series of Pentagon tests before it can begin full production later this decade.
And there is no guarantee the program will receive full financing from Congress, where its support is narrowly centered on lawmakers from Texas, Lockheed's manufacturing base. Lockheed has said the contract will provide as many as 9,000 jobs, mostly at its plant in Fort Worth.
In a sign of some of the opposition the program could face, the General Accounting Office, a research division of Congress, released a report last week concluding that the Joint Strike Fighter was likely to suffer cost overruns, performance failures and production delays unless an array of technological problems were resolved.
The Joint Strike Fighter is the first Pentagon program in which a foreign country, the United Kingdom, is a partner, having invested $1.4 billion with the intention of buying 150 of the jets. Denmark, Norway, the Netherlands, Canada, Italy, Singapore, Turkey and Israel have also expressed strong interest in buying the planes.
The program also represents a departure in the way the Pentagon procures weapons. In the past, each of the armed services has bought its own individually designed and manufactured jets. But the Joint Strike Fighter will essentially be the same plane, modified to fit each service's needs.
The Navy version will be heavier and have longer wings, for landing on carriers. The Marine Corps version will be able to take off on shortened runways, hover and land vertically. The Air Force version will be faster and more maneuverable. All three will be capable of flying at supersonic speeds.
By sharing 80 percent of their parts, the new planes will be less costly to build and repair, and will allow the services to share spare parts and maintenance crews, the Pentagon says. It will also allow United States fighter pilots to operate more easily in tandem with forces from other nations.
The first of the new planes, which will cost $40 million to $50 million each, are scheduled to come off the production line in 2008 and be available for military operations by 2010. They will replace Air Force F-16's and A-10's, Navy F-14's and Marine Corps AV-8B Harriers and F/A-18C/D's. The initial contract calls for the Air Force to buy 1,763, the Marine Corps 609, the Navy 480 and the Royal Air Force and Royal Navy 150.
Because of its sheer size, the Joint Strike Fighter program has already reshaped the fighter jet industry. When the McDonnell Douglas Corporation was eliminated from the competition in 1996, it merged with Boeing.
The Lockheed teams includes Northrop Grumman, which will build the central fuselage and design the plane's radar and stealth systems, and BAE Systems, which will fabricate parts of the fuselage.

HEADLINE: Deutsche Bank May Sell Cable TV Unit to Liberty Media 

BYLINE:  By SUZANNE KAPNER

DATELINE: LONDON, Oct. 26 

 BODY:
Furthering a push into the German cable television market, Liberty Media is in talks to buy a large regional system from Deutsche Bank, people close to the discussions said today.
 The talks were described as being at an advanced stage, although an announcement is not imminent, these people said. 
 Deutsche Bank may sell the entire company, Tele-Columbus, to Liberty Media, the Denver-based cable giant run by John C. Malone; or it might split Tele-Columbus's 2.2 million subscribers between Liberty Media and Callahan Associates, a London-based company run by Richard Callahan, a former executive at U S West and a cable entrepreneur from Denver. 
Executives from Deutsche Bank, Liberty Media and Callahan Associates declined to comment.
A battle is expected over the price, which could total 1.2 billion to 1.4 billion euros ($1 billion to $1.2 billion), but could also be less given the slump in telephone and cable stocks.
Deutsche Bank is looking to sell assets amid a global economic slowdown that has sharply cut its investment banking fees and raised lending risks. Today, Moody's Investors Service lowered the bank's credit rating to stable from positive. Deutsche Bank is expected to report weak third-quarter results next week, as it sets aside more money to cover bad loans.
Mr. Malone and Mr. Callahan drove hard bargains in negotiations with Deutsche Telekom earlier this year, essentially forcing that phone company to forfeit a considerable amount of control. 
The back-to-back deals, announced in September, gave Liberty Media and Callahan control of 80 percent of the cable television systems in Germany. Liberty bought six systems, including ones that serve Berlin, Hamburg and the affluent state of Bavaria, for 5.5 billion ($5 billion) euros. Callahan paid $2.7 billion for a big system, consolidating its positions in the North Rhine and Baden-Wurttemberg regions.
As is common in the convoluted German cable television market, Deutsche Telekom directly served only about a third of its customers. For the rest, it supplied a basic package of services to local distributors and housing associations, which controlled the cables that reach homes.
Because supplying basic packages to local distributors is less profitable than selling services to customers directly, regional players like Tele-Columbus, which control the cables into homes, are attractive targets, analysts said.
"It's the next wave of consolidation," said Nick Renwick, an analyst with Merrill Lynch in London.
Unlike many other European nations, Germany has a dense population that is willing to pay for television and that has made it a fruitful marketplace for cable TV operators. But many German cable networks are more than 20 years old and offer little more than about 30 channels. Modernizing them will be expensive, analysts said.

HEADLINE: An Economic Stimulus Bill With Corporations in Mind 

BYLINE:  By GRETCHEN MORGENSON 

 BODY:
Late last winter, when President Bush was shaping his $1.35 trillion tax cut, corporate lobbyists were told to wait, their turn would come. And now, their turn is here. 
 The $100 billion tax-cut bill narrowly passed by the House this week and sent to the Senate has been lauded by the White House as a broad stimulus package that will pull the United States economy out of a stall made worse by the terrorist attacks. But it also allows the Bush administration to deliver on its promise to corporate lobbyists. 
 Just 30 percent of the proposed tax relief would go to individuals, with the rest helping corporations, including large, prosperous ones like I.B.M. and General Electric, which have done well even in the economic downturn. And though one of the bill's costliest provisions is intended to produce a rebound in capital spending by businesses, such a recovery is far from certain. 
Charles Gabriel, the senior Washington analyst at Prudential Securities, said it was no surprise that the House bill heaped the biggest rewards on corporations. "It's political payback of sorts," he said. "To get his tax cut through earlier this year, Bush had to sedate the K street lobbyists, telling them, 'Don't worry, there will be another bill coming through.' Now you've got another green light for a tax bill, and there's a presumption that it will be skewed toward corporate tax cuts."
Corporate pleading for tax cuts is nothing new, of course, particularly if a bill is viewed as the last gravy train pulling out of the Washington station for a while. What emerges from the Senate is almost certain to be a less generous proposal. Still, the administration's argument that the bill is broad-based is weakened when so much goes to a handful of wealthy corporations.
Furthermore, the effort to stimulate the economy could be belied by the immense pressure the bill would put on state governments -- which by law must maintain balanced budgets. Under one of the bill's major provisions, concerning the depreciation of equipment, states would experience significant declines in tax revenues even as they face surging unemployment and other costs.
Conservatives say giving tax breaks to business is not a payoff to campaign contributors, but a vital and efficient way of stimulating new investment, protecting jobs and shoring up corporate earnings and stock prices.
"You can't restore a dysfunctional economy without helping business stabilize and recover," said Representative Bill Thomas of California, the Republican chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee and the main author of the bill.
"The creative range of tax adjustments in this bill will free up money that businesses would otherwise have to send to the I.R.S. so they can channel it back into the economy through salaries, training and investments like equipment instead."
The depreciation provision -- at a cost of $39 billion in the first year -- would allow companies to accelerate the amount they write off against income for new equipment bought in the next three years. The allowance for such write-offs, which reduce corporate taxes, has been 15 percent. Under the bill, it would rise to 30 percent in the year of purchase.
The idea of accelerating depreciation was backed by the National Association of Manufacturers, a lobbying group. Still, its inclusion in the bill surprised some analysts. Tom Gallagher, a political economist at International Strategy and Investment, said: "This has been kicked around in the fairly small tax policy community. Nobody really thought it had much of a chance until now." 
Proponents of the plan, many of whom are technology companies that either hope to sell more equipment because of the change or want to pay less for the gear they need to buy, say that it will encourage companies to increase capital spending, which has plummeted this year.
Chris Edwards, director of fiscal policy at the Cato Institute, argued that the new economy requires a new depreciation schedule. "Computers are written off over five years, but they often become obsolete much earlier than that," he said. Allowing a 30 percent write-off in the first year lowers costs and raises returns on new investment. "The core of the economic slowdown has been business investment," he said, "so it makes a lot of sense to aim a lot of tax stimulus at investment."
But some analysts question whether such a stimulus will have the desired effect given that inventories of equipment remain high and manufacturers still have excess capacity -- idle plants. Jack Ciesielski, an accounting authority and editor of The Analyst's Accounting Observer, said: "The increase in depreciation would stimulate capital spending. But the problem is, if the consumer's not buying, what's more capital spending going to produce?" 
The three-year term of the accelerated write-off plan mystifies some tax specialists. Robert Greenstein, executive director of the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, a liberal research group in Washington, pointed out that a one-year plan would provide a much more immediate economic boost, because companies would rush to take advantage of it. Under the current proposal, the urgency to invest would not occur until 2003 or 2004, presumably when the economy is healthy again.
The effect of the increased depreciation on states is what really worries Mr. Greenstein, who noted that most states follow federal rules on write-offs to calculate their own corporate income taxes. By his reckoning, 44 states and the District of Columbia would lose an average $5 billion each in corporate and individual income tax revenues in each of the three years the plan is in effect.
"Since they have to balance their budgets in recession, nearly every dollar that states lose as a result of this federal tax cut would have to be made up as either tax increases or program cuts," Mr. Greenstein said. "If a depreciation is in the package, it ought to include an offsetting relief to the states."
Given the slim margin with which the House bill passed, the aggressive depreciation plan could be toned down in the Senate. Max Baucus, the Montana Democrat who is chairman of the Senate Finance and Appropriations Committee, has proposed giving companies a bonus depreciation of 10 percent for just one year. Senator Baucus's bill would cost $70 billion in the first year.
Perhaps the biggest boon for businesses would be the repeal of the alternative minimum tax on companies since 1986 and refunds to cover what the companies have paid in those taxes during that time. All in all, the House bill would dispense about $25 billion in tax rebates to large corporations, one-quarter of the bill's first-year cost.
According to Citizens for Tax Justice, an advocacy group that is critical of corporate tax breaks, I.B.M.'s rebate check would top $1.4 billion, while General Electric would receive $671 million. Last week, I.B.M. said it could meet investors expectations for fourth-quarter results. G.E. earned $9.8 billion in the first nine months of the year, a 6.8 percent increase from the comparable period in 2000.
Sending $25 billion in checks to profitable corporations may not pass the Senate. But the repeal of the minimum tax, which became law in 1986 to make sure that profitable corporations pay some taxes regardless of the breaks they receive, could survive. That is because in recent years, while more individuals, even those with modest incomes, have been skewered by the minimum tax, corporations have found ways to pay less of the tax, according to Robert McIntyre, director of Citizens for Tax Justice. In 1998, for example, corporations paid $3.3 billion under the law, down from $8.1 billion in 1990. Individuals, on the other hand, paid $5 billion in 1998, up from $830 million in 1990.
The number of taxpayers qualifying for the minimum tax numbered 132,000 in 1990, and Mr. McIntyre estimates that 2.3 million people will pay the tax this year. The surge makes a repeal expensive, of course.
"Repealing the corporate A.M.T. and eliminating taxes on some of our wealthiest corporations would be both unfair and grossly insulting to America's hardworking taxpaying families," Mr. McIntyre said.
Another aspect of the House bill that aids a small but powerful group of large multinational corporations is the plan to make a temporary tax break for companies with financial operations permanent. The tax break lets companies shield income earned in those businesses from taxes by shifting money to offshore subsidiaries. 
Last year, the tax break, known as the exception for active financing income, cost the government $3.8 billion in taxes. If it became permanent, it would cost $21 billion over the next decade, Mr. McIntyre said. It works this way: companies that lend money to customers buying their goods -- G.E. or the Ford Motor Credit Corporation, for example -- can offset the income tax they owe on the interest payments they receive by putting enough money in an offshore entity to generate the same amount of income tax-free.
One lobbyist, who spoke about this tax break on the condition of anonymity, said, "It wasn't industry specific, but it certainly was big multinationals that would benefit, while domestic companies would not."
Even though the House bill has White House support, lawmakers in the Senate are sure to examine whether these proposals will provide the stimulus that the economy needs, or if they are a way for corporations to get their tax-cut wishes in the name of economic growth.
"We're seeing very creative efforts to take a longstanding agenda of corporate tax cuts that had never been presented before as stimulus measures and dress them up as though they somehow had significant stimulative effects," said Mr. Greenstein of the Center on Budget and Policy Priorites. "And most of them don't."

 CORRECTION:
A news analysis article in Business Day on Saturday about the stimulus package passed by the House of Representatives misstated a tax specialist's estimate of how much money states would lose in revenue if, as the bill proposes, companies were allowed to accelerate write-offs for purchases of new equipment in the next three years. Robert Greenstein, executive director of the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, estimated that the provision would cost 44 states and the District of Columbia a total of $5 billion a year, not $5 billion apiece.

HEADLINE: A NATION CHALLENGED: THE REWARD; 
U.S. Is Planning an Aid Package for Pakistan That Is Worth Billions

BYLINE:  By JOSEPH KAHN

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Oct. 26 

 BODY:
The Bush administration has put together an aid package for Pakistan that is likely to total several billion dollars and includes sweeping debt rescheduling, grants stretching over many years and trade benefits as a reward for its support against terrorism.
 The package, which is encountering some resistance in Washington and abroad, would represent a departure from the often glacial process of aiding poor countries in recent years. Through the 1990's, American aid to many developing nations fell, and the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund set up elaborate mechanisms to determine which poor nations should receive debt relief. Pakistan, with an average per capita annual income of $500 but with access to world capital markets, was not among them. 
 While Pakistan is unlikely to receive all the concessions it now seeks, the administration's package amounts to the largest mobilization of low-interest loans and debt relief since allies showered benefits on Egypt during the Persian Gulf War.
The aid envisaged by Washington would make Pakistan the largest recipient of American aid after Israel and Egypt. 
Pockets of opposition are already becoming visible in Washington, among nongovernmental organizations and, more quietly, in Japan.
Japan recently rejected Pakistan's request to forgive the entire $5 billion owed Tokyo and is moving more slowly than the Bush administration to ease sanctions on that country imposed after Pakistan tested a nuclear weapon in response to India's similar test in 1998. Tokyo has agreed, however, to delay payments on about $500 million in Pakistani debt.
While the support may reward President Pervez Musharraf for his backing of the American-led coalition, critics worry that politically inspired aid could be misdirected.
Some American lawmakers say the Bush administration may have too readily agreed to give Pakistan about $600 million in cash this year and next without a reliable way of ensuring that the money would be used to improve health and education rather than to underwrite the military or the Islamic militants that Pakistan backs in the disputed territory of Kashmir.
"If you just write a blank check it will end up in the pockets of the wrong people," said Representative Jim McDermott, a Washington Democrat on the House Ways and Means Committee. 
While Mr. McDermott supports helping Pakistan with its floundering economy, he said the Bush administration had "been a little cavalier" about wiping away sanctions on Pakistan imposed after General Musharraf took power in a military coup in 1999.
Representative Jim Kolbe, an Arizona Republican who chairs the foreign operations subcommittee of the House Committee on Appropriations, criticized the administration for granting valuable but vaguely defined "budgetary support," rather than financing well-supervised individual projects.
"I have not gotten sufficient reassurances at this point," Mr. Kolbe said.
The aid the United States provided to Pakistan and Afghan rebels during the Soviet occupation of Afghanistan in the 1980's is widely seen as having helped finance the rise of the Taliban, which now controls most of Afghanistan.
Talks between officials of the State and Treasury departments and Shaukat Aziz, Pakistan's finance minister, have resulted in an agreement that the administration will work to secure four types of aid for Pakistan, administration officials said. 
These include grants from the United States and other allies. In addition, the Bush administration is using its influence to support new loan programs by the I.M.F. and the World Bank, including an anti-poverty loan worth about $500 million from the I.M.F. and possibly a line of credit, at higher rates, of some $1 billion.
The United States has already begun calculating how to reschedule payments on the $3 billion Pakistan owes Washington. It has urged allies to do the same, and Britain has already followed suit. Bilateral loans total about $12 billion out of the country's $38 billion foreign debt.
Pakistan may also secure a higher quota or lower tariffs for its textile exports to the United States.
Pakistan estimates that the war in Afghanistan will cost it some $2.5 billion this year alone, including lost trade and tourism and the expense of caring for Afghan refugees.
One senior administration official said the United States will monitor closely how the money is used. The official said Mr. Aziz had improved financial management enough to warrant more aid even if the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks had not happened.
But the official also acknowledged that Washington would support Pakistan's bid to get some extraordinary benefits.
"The reality is that this is a country that has behaved in a stalwart fashion during this crisis, and that is going to be recognized," he said. "We are going to find a unique approach for Pakistan."
The World Bank and I.M.F. have denied any debt relief to almost half of the eligible poor countries because they are embroiled in wars, fearing that money would diverted to the military. Pakistan now has conflicts on two of its borders.
"I absolutely support debt relief for Pakistan," said Ann Pettifor, who heads Jubilee Plus, a British group that advocates canceling the debts of all poor countries. "But it's hypocritical to just dole out the money to Pakistan while denying help to others that are really even more in need."

KRAFT FOODS IS OFFERING EARLY RETIREMENT

BYLINE:  Bloomberg News

 BODY:
 Kraft Foods, which is integrating Nabisco Holdings into its business, is offering some workers in the United States early retirement in a program that is expected to eliminate 1,000 jobs. 
Kraft, which trails Nestle in sales, has been shedding some plants, businesses and administrative staff to reduce costs. Kraft's parent, the Philip Morris Companies, bought Nabisco last December for $18.9 billion. The plan will save the company $80 million a year and will cost $160 million pretax in the first quarter, Kraft said. On Oct. 12, Kraft announced plans to close three Nabisco plants in Latin America and lay off 500 workers as it moves operations to other countries. The company employs 117,000 workers worldwide.

HEADLINE: In Love With a Good Joke, an Energized City and With Each Other

BYLINE: These profiles were written by Al Baker, Dan Barry, Lynette Holloway, Sarah Kershaw, N. R. Kleinfield, Charlie LeDuff, David Leonhardt, Andy Newman, Melody Petersen and Yilu Zhao.

 BODY:

Here are glimpses of some of the victims of the Sept. 11 attack on the World Trade Center.

SUSAN L. BLAIR
Big Laugh, Big Heart
 Susan L. Blair had a work-stopping, what's-that-noise kind of laugh. Wherever she has worked, co-workers have asked her to pipe down. ''It was high-pitched and loud,'' said her sister Leslie Blair.
 If she was telling a joke, forget it. The laugh and a joke were just too much because she was funny. For example, the day before the World Trade Center attack, she interviewed a prospective hire for Aon, where she was a team leader. ''She commented to a co-worker that the person had a fear of heights,'' Leslie Blair said. ''She said to the co-worker, 'I'm thinking to myself that we're on the 92nd floor of the World Trade Center; you might want to rethink this job.' ''
 Though some of her jokes were laced with sarcasm, they were not aimed as darts, Ms. Blair's sister said.
 In fact, Ms. Blair, 35, from East Brunswick, N.J., had a big heart. She liked getting laughs out of cranky tollbooth workers.
 ''I would ask her why she cared whether that guy smiled and she would say, 'I just do.' She thought life was too short to go around with our shields up.''

BOJAN KOSTIC
All Set for Citizenship
It was Grand Army Plaza, in front of the Plaza Hotel, that hooked Bojan Kostic on New York. He had grown up in Belgrade in Yugoslavia, and moved to Iowa in the mid-1980's for college. During his first semester, on a school trip to New York, he stepped off the bus in Grand Army Plaza.
 ''That's when he decided to move here,'' said his fiance, Susanna Ferm. ''He loved it -- the energy, the excitement, everything about the city.''
 He soon dropped out of school and took a job painting houses in Connecticut, and he eventually enrolled in Baruch College. That was typical of Bo, as people called him. He was straightforward, honest and reliable. He knew what he wanted.
 An example: on his first date with Ms. Ferm, in 1998, he asked her to move in with him. ''I held off for three weeks,'' she said.
 He liked to arrive at his office at Cantor Fitzgerald by 6 a.m. In early September, Mr. Kostic, 34, went home to his West Side apartment each day and eagerly sorted through the mail, looking for the letter telling him that he was eligible to become a United States citizen. On the night of Sept. 10, Ms. Ferm quizzed him for his citizenship test, asking him to name the original 13 states. ''He got them all,'' she said. ''He was ready.''

JOHN RESTA
and SYLVIA SAN PIO RESTA
A Fancy Proposal
The marriage proposal was famous in the Resta family. John Resta already had a reputation as a hopeless romantic, relatives said, but on this one he outdid even himself. 
 Mr. Resta and his wife, Sylvia SanPio Resta, had traveled to Florida several times, and there she found a seafood restaurant that she adored. So on the day he was to propose, he took the day off work. He had a meal -- lobster and other dishes -- and menus flown into New York City from the restaurant. He rented a tuxedo, a top hat and a cane, and spent the day setting up their apartment in Bayside, Queens, with candles, a fancy tablecloth and flowers.
 Needless to say, the answer was yes, and they were married in the summer of 2000. When the two -- both traders for Carr Futures -- were killed in the Sept. 11 terrorist attack, she was seven months pregnant with their first child.
 Mr. Resta, 40, adored children, said his sister Chris Mazzeo, and he was obsessed with his wife's pregnancy, voraciously reading every childbirth book he could get his hands on and doting on her constantly. Mr. Resta's cousin Kenneth Bynoe said that as soon as Mr. Resta met Ms. SanPio Resta, 26, he was so smitten that he could not stop talking about her, especially about her habit of reading cookbooks on the train, from cover to cover, as if they were novels.
 Ms. SanPio Resta was artistic, yet she had a mind for numbers, said her sister Martiza Mure. In college, she majored in both mathematics and ceramics, and she had recently inspired her husband to take up oil painting. 
 Ms. Mazzeo said: ''My brother was an angel on earth. Now, he's an angel in heaven. Now he has wings.''
 Ms. SanPio Resta's sisters, who were planning her baby shower when she was killed, said that when they planned her memorial service, they chose the theme song ''In the Arms of an Angel.''

JOSHUA VITALE
Love With No Regrets
Joshua Vitale and Ina Weintraub had been best friends since they were seventh graders in Syosset, on Long Island. Two years ago, when they were 26, Mr. Vitale made a confession as they left the movies. ''He said he'd been in love with me for many years and that if he didn't tell me this now he would always regret it,'' Ms. Weintraub said. ''I was so blown away I didn't talk to him for three months.''
 When the dust settled, the couple's life together quickly fell into place. They got engaged and moved into an apartment in Great Neck, N.Y. Mr. Vitale, who had been a wanderer, a party animal and something of a lost soul for much of his 20's, got a job at Cantor Fitzgerald's trading desk.
 ''Once we got together it was like we were shooting for the stars,'' Ms. Weintraub said. ''We were so happy.''
 Two days before Sept. 11, the couple tried to get tickets to the United States Open tennis tournament, without success. ''Josh said: 'Forget the Open. Why don't we go to the zoo?' '' Ms. Weintraub said. The couple communed with the gorillas at the Bronx Zoo, and then Mr. Vitale, his wandering instincts intact, found a path where they had a picnic together. ''There was nothing left unsaid between us,'' Ms. Weintraub said. ''He knew how much I loved him and I will always know how much he loved me.''

JANE ELLEN BAESZLER
Staten Island Tapestry
Jane Ellen Baeszler grew up in the shadow of the Verrazano-Narrows Bridge in the Randall Manor neighborhood in Staten Island. She went to Catholic schools and earned an associate's degree in business from the College of Staten Island. She never left Randall Manor, even after she got a job as a municipal bond broker at Cantor Fitzgerald. 
 Her mother, Rita, lived close by and said Ms. Baeszler was attentive to her nephew, Patrick, 10, and nieces, Annie-Laurie, 13, and Molly, 12, who were the perfect age to share secrets with an aunt that they would not tell their mother.
 Ms. Baeszler, 43, relaxed by doing needlepoint. She had perfected it. She gave a needlepoint tapestry of a horse's head to a childhood friend, who is an equestrian. She made a cocoa pot for an aunt who collects them. She liked Americana. She made a tapestry of a Harper's Bazaar cover, with a woman in a long coat with a fur collar reminiscent of the Roaring 20's. On Sept. 10, she attended a class to work on a tapestry of a teapot for her sister-in-law's 40th birthday on Oct. 10.

STEVEN JACOBSON
A Transmitter Marvel
He worked up top. He liked it up there, with his transmitter.
 Steven Jacobson was an engineer for WPIX-TV and worked in a room on the 110th floor of 1 World Trade Center, usually by himself, tending to the station's transmitter. 
 Mr. Jacobson, 53, had a deep fidelity to that transmitter. He cared for it like a sick baby the occasional time it would ''dump'' and take the station off the air. Once he used his shoelaces to get it going.
 During the 1993 trade center bombing, he stayed until midnight, to make sure the transmitter operated properly once power was restored. When the bomb exploded, Victor Arnone, a WPIX maintenance engineer and a close friend, went to the concourse to get lunch for him. He called Mr. Jacobson and yelled: ''Steve! Explosion! Smoke! People are running out!'' Mr. Jacobson said, ''Does this mean I don't get my egg roll?''
 Mr. Jacobson had a dry humor. It was a routine for him to invite Jewish friends to lunch at his Manhattan home on Yom Kippur, when, of course, they were fasting. He loved to prowl through ham radio flea markets. Unfailingly, he would ask a vendor, ''Do you have a used logbook and a big eraser?'' He had a habit of not using turn signals when he drove. When questioned, he would respond, ''It's nobody's business which way I'm turning.''

JORGE VELAZQUEZ
Feeding the Hungry
Jorge Velazquez was always looking for one more hungry soul to feed.
 This was in the mid-1990's. Mr. Velazquez, a deeply religious man from Puerto Rico, had founded a program to feed the homeless at his Seventh-day Adventist church, and commuting home to Spanish Harlem from a shipping job in a shoulder-pad factory, he would keep an eye out for the down and out, recalled his longtime friend Anthony Salcedo.
 Mr. Velazquez and his wife, Consuelo, would cook big pots of rice and beans and stew, and on Saturdays, they would pile their four kids into the car, make the rounds of some of Manhattan's saddest spots and ladle out hot dinners. ''I'd ask him where he found these people and he'd say, 'Coming home from work I saw someone walking around and I got out of my car and followed them to where they were,' '' Mr. Salcedo said. ''He was a very determined man.''
 Determined to make things better for his family, Mr. Velazquez, 47, landed a job as a security guard for Morgan Stanley Dean Witter in the trade center in 1999, and he quickly worked his way up to security specialist. He had just bought a house in Passaic, N.J., and was moonlighting as a security guard to help pay for it. Now his family members are starting a program to feed the homeless at their local church.

WILLIAM LUM JR.
Partying Heartily
Organizing surprise parties was William Lum Jr.'s specialty. For the 60th birthday of his mother, Grace Lum, for instance, he surprised her with a big dinner party at Windows on the World, the restaurant at the top of the north tower of the trade center. ''It was exhilarating,'' remembers his father, William Sr. ''The view was just incredible.''
 Mr. Lum wanted to introduce the city to his septuagenarian parents, who are both of Chinese descent. ''Whenever he got a chance, he would call us and take us to the nice restaurants, Broadway shows and Central Park,'' Mrs. Lum said. His parents live at his childhood home in Rockland County, and William Jr., 45, had an apartment on the Upper West Side.
 Normally at this time of the year, he would start making plans to take his parents to Rockefeller Center to window-shop and see the big tree. ''There are times when I walk around and I see things that remind me of Billy,'' William Sr. said. ''My eyes would be filled with tears.''
 And the World Trade Center, where Mr. Lum worked for Marsh & McLennan, was his favorite building in the city -- every time friends would visit from out of town, he would take them to the observation deck.

ROB PERAZA
A Run to Glory
The number is 18416. That is the number that Rob Peraza was to wear while competing in the New York City Marathon next week. It was to have been his first marathon, and family members say that his diligent long-distance training -- often accompanied by his dog, Otis, through Central Park -- spoke to the determination and future plans of a man only 30 years old.
 This year seemed to bring a certain maturity to Mr. Peraza, who had been living the 20-something life on the Upper West Side. His job as a bond trader with Cantor Fitzgerald was going well. His relationship with Megan Cressy, his girlfriend of nine months, was getting serious. And his mind, more accustomed to anticipating hits on a rugby field, was focused on completing that marathon. ''A lot of things were falling in place for Rob,'' said his younger brother, Neil Peraza. ''He was just starting to, I think, come into his own as a person.''
 Mr. Peraza's parents live in Ohio, his sister lives in North Carolina and his brother lives in Florida. But they are still planning to attend the marathon, and to see Rob's uncle from Virginia, Steve Comber, cross the finish line -- wearing No. 18416.

PETE CARROLL
A Painter Who Cared
They called him Pete the Painter. Pete Carroll was really a firefighter, but he painted apartments to make ends meet. He walked into ToniAnn's life eight years ago and laid two coats of beige paint.
 He had 19 years in the Fire Department. One more, and they were off to retire in California. They depended on each other, but last January, Ms. Carroll came to depend on him in very profound ways. She fell ill with a neurological disorder with no cure. It is a rapid, ravaging affliction that attacks the soft tissues.
 Mr. Carroll, 42, started to cook for his wife. He carried her to bed. Sometimes he washed her back. This summer, on the hottest day of the year, he came home to Staten Island from the Squad 1 firehouse in Brooklyn to see her in the backyard, frozen in a chair in the blazing sun. He saw that and wept. ''I had a beautiful fireman to rescue me,'' Ms. Carroll said. ''Now I don't want to move at all.''
 In a contorted way, Mr. Carroll's wife is one of the lucky survivors. She has his ashes and his wedding band.

DONALD H. GREGORY
A Family Man's Gifts
Amanda Gregory had her father's sense of commitment. Her sister, Sara, had his creativity. And their brother, James, had his love of sports.
 Donald H. Gregory, 62, gave many gifts to his children, one of which was loving their mother. He kissed her at the start and end of each day. ''He was just a man of quiet faith,'' said his wife, Maureen. ''He had a generosity of spirit that extended to all in our family. Most importantly, he taught to believe in yourself.'' He believed in Amanda, 20, who wants to work for NASA; Sara, 19, who loves art; and James, 14, who plays soccer, basketball and baseball with a passion.
 Since the trade center fell with him in the 104th-floor office of Cantor Fitzgerald, in the north tower, people have sent notes to Mr. Gregory's family in Ramsey, N.J. 
 ''Because I was not with him during the day, I didn't know the extent to which he raved about the children,'' his wife said. ''That is the essence of a family man to me.''

DOUGLAS B. GURIAN
Simple Things Matter
Douglas B. Gurian, 38, found pleasure in simple things like two-inch thick steaks, the ocean, his two young children. He would call his friends out of the blue, put the receiver up to the stereo speaker, say, ''Listen to this riff, man,'' and just as abruptly hang up. He went to West Point, but he was anything but straight-laced.
 In the summers, when he took his family to Fire Island, Mr. Gurian would take his shoes off before they reached the shore and not put them on again for days. Each morning started with a jump into the ocean. ''He was the most quirky, fun-loving guy,'' said Susan Gurian, his wife of almost 10 years.
 Mr. Gurian worked at Radianz, a financial services technology company. On the morning of Sept. 11, he was at Windows on the World, at a technology conference.
 Mr. Gurian loved his children -- Tyler, 7, and Eva, 4 -- most of all, his wife said. Eva is too young to understand what happened to her dad, but Tyler told his mom, ''I just don't feel I'll be happy again.''

BERNARD FAVUZZA
Model Trains a Passion
Each time his wife, Vincenza, got pregnant, Dominick Favuzza would buy a Lionel train set: engine, box cars, caboose and tracks. This was postwar New York in the 1950's.
 He did this a month before Bernard's birth. And he did it before his daughters, Janice and Anna, were born. Around Christmas, the shiny trains would clack around the tree.
 Bernard Favuzza, who was 52 on Sept. 11, had taken to the hobby. He built a miniature model of Ridgewood, Queens, in his house in Suffern, N.Y. -- with a train that whistled through his childhood neighborhood complete with Dietz Coal.
 And he took over his dad's tradition of buying the trains for those soon to be born. He bought them for his nephew Kevin, 12, and his grandson Dominick, who is 2 today.
 ''They were relaxing,'' Anna Favuzza said of her brother's train hobby. ''It's stressful, right? The market. Wall Street. This was a way for him to unwind.''
 Mr. Favuzza was at Cantor Fitzgerald, above where one of the planes went in. Now his daughters, Donna Posta, 32, and Laura Favuzza, 24, will take care of his trains.

GARTH E. FEENEY
An Engineer's Shortcut
Earning an engineering degree from the University of Pennsylvania typically takes five years. But it was not the fact that Garth E. Feeney did it in four years while also majoring in business. It was everything else he did at the same time that amazed his family.
 Mr. Feeney, 28, who was at a conference at Windows on the World on Sept. 11, tutored an illiterate adult, established a program for poor children, worked for campus security, was a dorm counselor, a representative on the university's board of trustees and worked for Habitat for Humanity. ''He was one of these people who did everything and anything,'' said his mother, Judy Feeney.
 Even after he moved to New York, where he was director of corporate development for Data Synapse in Manhattan, he kept up the pace of activities. He was a rock climber, a scuba diver, a kayaker and an avid in-line skater. He loved gliding through Central Park whenever he got the chance.
 One thing his parents did not know, until they heard tales from friends at his memorial service, was that Mr. Feeney was exceptionally frugal. Even as he earned a decent income, he refused to take a taxi anywhere -- not even to the airport -- and loved using coupons, including ones for the fast-food spot Subway, where he would buy one sandwich (lunch) and get one free (dinner). ''We weren't aware that he was quite that economical,'' his mother said.

The Confirmed Dead

 THE BEST OF TIMES
America in the Clinton Years.
By Haynes Johnson.
610 pp. New York:
A James H. Silberman Book/
Harcourt. $27.
 There are few voices more haunting in Haynes Johnson's history of the Clinton years than those of the young. He calls them the "millennials," the generation entering adulthood in the year 2000 with an expectation of peace and prosperity and a boundless belief in the private marketplace.
They were, in short, exemplars of their age. A survey of American college students in 1997 found that 77 percent believed they would become millionaires someday. Four years later, with the New Economy in tatters and the nation reeling from the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks, it is almost painful to read of the innocence -- or is it hubris? -- of the millennials, like peeking in on the English in the spring of 1914. They had no idea what was coming. For that matter, neither did most of their elders.
"The Best of Times: America in the Clinton Years" is a portrait of the booming, self-indulgent, technologically stunning and culturally brutish 1990's. It is, in turn, an earnest, angry, poignant, foreboding book that tells its story through a parade of characters that seem to embody the age, for better and worse: J. Craig Venter, the cocky scientist-entrepreneur racing the government to map the genome; David Geffen, the entertainment mogul seemingly dismayed at much of what Hollywood now produces; New Economy gurus from Microsoft and Silicon Valley, extolling the revolutionary potential of the Internet and the difficulties of managing a work force that got so rich so young; and, above all, the full cast of characters from the O. J. Simpson trial and the Clinton-Lewinsky scandal, along with their Greek chorus of "commentators" and "legal analysts."
These are, of course, familiar stories and familiar characters. That is one burden of writing history so soon; we still remember it. Another problem for Johnson's timing is that events kept moving, trends that dominated the decade were shifting, changing, at the end of the 1990's. Suddenly, the tech bubble burst, layoffs were hitting Silicon Valley, the warnings of "irrational exuberance" in the stock market proved prescient. Johnson clearly tried to tie up what loose ends he could -- he ends with the contested presidential election and George W. Bush's inauguration -- but a decade, as a political and cultural concept, rarely ends neatly or on time, and settled judgments are hard to reach one year out.
Still, it is testimony to Johnson's insights that this history often seems on point, even when read, as it inevitably will be, in the sad afterlight of Sept. 11. Describing a country "entranced" with the "undeniable successes of the private sector," he asks: "How will they deal with the aftermath of the already sharp decline -- or worse -- that America was experiencing as the Clinton age ended? What will their response be to a crisis, global or domestic, that suddenly erupts and requires mobilization of public and private resources of the nation?" He notes that the nation faced a growing terrorist threat and heightened tensions between "fundamentalist and Western industrial societies."
Throughout, Johnson is consumed with missed opportunities, with a nation "at a moment of peak power and influence" that spent so much time, so much political energy and so much talent on "self-destructive squabbles, petty political assaults, growing inattention and the diversions of the electronic entertainment and scandal culture." He acknowledges the scientific and technological achievements of the age -- in fact, he sounds a little too awed in conversations with men like Venter or Microsoft's Nathan Myhrvold.
But he seems utterly mystified that the nation that produced such technological and economic progress could, at the very same moment, become so obsessed with O. J., JonBenet Ramsey, the Menendez brothers trial or the rest of the sensationalist stories that prepared the way for the Clinton-Lewinsky scandal. He is scathing about the role of the broadcast media and the entertainment industry, arguing they essentially made a business decision to appeal to the lowest common denominator. But he does not excuse the American people, plopping down for their dose of the scandal du jour, telling reporters how much they hated the excesses even as they lapped them up. One obvious explanation is that they had the luxury to do so, no real crises on their horizons, or so it seemed, although he notes that their world was changing while they were following O. J.
Johnson is at his best dissecting some of the reigning myths of the times -- for example, the belief that the Internet and the technological revolution of the 1990's were a triumph of the private sector and rugged dot-com individualism. In fact, he argues, the groundwork was laid by government investment in scientific research, the kind of farsighted planning for the public good that was so lacking in the 1990's.
But his basic reportorial technique -- essentially, long interviews with thoughtful people at the center of big events -- has its shortcomings. Most of these people are bound to have an interest or an ax to grind; often, you can only wonder how different the view can be from another quarter. This technique also contributes to the occasionally mystifying, at best loosely thematic, organization of the book. 
About half of "The Best of Times" is devoted to the Clinton scandal, the president's impeachment by the House and his acquittal in the Senate. This, of course, is very familiar material, but it gains power from its place in the narrative. It all seems inevitable: the machinery to market the scandal was already in place; the commentators, talk shows and pundits were ready for the next show, "just another O. J. moment, on a grander scale." Add to the mix the poisonous partisanship that had developed in Washington, with a conservative movement that simply would not accept Bill Clinton as a legitimate president and an investigatory culture that has dragged on so long that White House aides no longer take notes in meetings, anticipating the next subpoena. Finally, add the character of Clinton himself, who suits "an age that simultaneously offers such promise and such degrading scandal," the contradictions of a nation that both mapped the genome and made Jerry Springer a star.
The Clinton scandal was the last cultural bonfire of the 1990's. Looking back, even now, is like trying to reconstruct a vast drunken brawl. The question is the same: "What were we thinking?"
The millennial generation that Johnson describes toward the end of "The Best of Times" was remarkably uninterested in government. One Stanford senior told Johnson, "A lot of our generation feels we're doing so well now, and America's succeeding in so many ways, that there's not anything you feel charged to change at this point." It was a belief that was almost certainly not confined to the young: the sense that government was, in the end, pretty irrelevant, just another show. It now sounds like the most self-indulgent myth from the 90's.

HEADLINE: Aaron Sorkin Works His Way Through the Crisis 

BYLINE:  By Peter de Jonge; Peter de Jonge is a regular contributor to the magazine. His last article was about the arrival of television in Bhutan.

 BODY:
Exactly two weeks after terrorists ambushed New York and Washington, killed more than 5,000 of us and changed everything, and nothing, Aaron Sorkin, creator of "The West Wing," leans anxiously against a long table filled with actors and production assistants. This is the high-tech briefing area where the show's main character, President Josiah Bartlet, huddles with the military brass when make-believe blips on the radar grow alarming. In the conspicuously insider patois of the show, the space is called "the Sit Room," and this is roughly the Situation: for the last two years, "West Wing" has become one of the most popular shows in America because, among other things, Sorkin has been able to give his kinder, gentler, nobler White House enough verisimilitude to seem tantalizingly possible. "The only reason it's not 'Touched by an Angel,"' Sorkin says, "is that it imitates just enough the sounds and appearance of reality. And the way I do it is by saying words you don't normally hear on television shows, like 'Democrat' and 'Republican,' and having the place look real and the hardware look real and abbreviations be right. If I can do just enough of that, then hopefully we're on board." 
 To maintain his elusive parallel universe, one that feels contemporary but is also impossible to pin down in time, Sorkin employs a half-dozen former high-ranking politicos and keeps a close watch "on the dials and gauges." To come up with the four or five story lines the show burns through each episode, the staff reheats old issues from the archives or imagines something plausible enough to have actually happened. What they do not do, however, is dramatize recent headlines. They try to never mention any president after Eisenhower, and according to a co-executive producer, Kevin Falls, who runs the writers' room, "When we talk about the Kennedy Center on 'West Wing,' we're referring to George Kennedy." 
 But on Sept. 11, the world lurched violently in one very particular direction, and producers, who had already shot the first five episodes of their third season, were in a quandary. Sorkin became convinced that his show's subtle connection to reality had been severed and that unless he could find a way to let viewers know that his characters had suffered the same trauma as everyone else, the show would forever clink hollow. 
"We have these eight characters who have been our friends for two years, and we want them to live," Sorkin says. "And in order to do that, they have to bow their heads for a moment to what concerns the rest of the world. Once we've done that, it will give us permission to go back to telling the kind of relatively trivial stories I like about the N.E.A. and soft money and big tobacco." 
Less than a week before the scheduled broadcast of the splashy two-part season premiere, Sorkin began writing a new episode that for the first time directly addressed the news. And he insisted that the premiere be delayed so that this new stand-alone episode could run first as a back story for the whole season. Because of all the time and money that had already gone into promoting the original premiere and the fact that NBC could only charge advertisers half price for time on the rerun they had to air instead, the network's decision to accommodate Sorkin was a $10 million act of largess, proffered to a man who barely four months before had been arrested at the Burbank airport with a carry-on bag containing marijuana, hallucinogenic mushrooms and crack cocaine. And Sorkin, who was in rehab six years before, admitted that this was not the first time he had fallen off the wagon.
Sorkin listens through headphones as Richard Schiff, who plays Toby Ziegler, White House director of communications, struggles with his speech about the history of terrorism, trying to explain how teenagers in the 11th century were tricked into committing heinous acts of violence by being drugged with hashish and taken to a staged paradise stocked with concubines. As the speech is ending, Ziegler's deputy, played by Rob Lowe, enters and caps the scene with one of Sorkin's characteristic over-the-top verbal flourishes: "Ahhh, temptation I have seen thee and thy name is woman." As he listens and watches, Sorkin displays a level of anxiety appropriate to the occasion, although it is no higher or lower than what he radiates every waking moment. 
Sorkin, 40, is rabidly unhip, and not just in the way he dresses, which today is like a middle-school student. He talks too fast and too urgently, as if he is on trial and every moment might be his last chance to testify in his defense. He eats too voraciously. He tries too hard. And while all these things make him likable, his saving grace is that he listens hard too.
As Sorkin strains to compare Lowe's delivery with the beats he heard in his head when he wrote the words, he taps one foot spastically and works the muscles around his mouth as if he is trying to dislodge a bit of food. His cheeks are shaded with stubble, and his eyes are sunk deep in his head behind graying Stephanopoulos-like bangs. He says he has the flu. He feels clammy. 
There is a break in the shooting, and Lowe, whose character is addressing a group of brainy high-school students who have won a visit to the White House and find themselves stuck in the kitchen when there is a security "crash," steps off the set to confer with Sorkin. Lowe wears a white dress shirt and dark slacks and seems to have been painted in black and white with just a touch of red in the cheeks. According to Bradley Whitford, who plays Josh Lyman, the deputy chief of staff, considered by show insiders to be the voice of Sorkin, "I think Aaron would like to have my character's job and look like Rob."
Sorkin gives Lowe a couple of notes: "You don't have to be so somber and funereal. It's not a wake." He snaps his fingers to demonstrate the brisker delivery he has in mind and adds: "You're smart. You know these things. Here they are."
Soon after Lowe leaves the set, there is a stir as two real-life Hollywood generals -- Jeff Zucker, the president of NBC Entertainment, and Peter Roth, the president of Warner Brothers Television, both clad in black -- step into the Sit Room. In defiance of the current Hollywood dictate that people act as though everything they do is suddenly irrelevant, the baldheaded Zucker, who was in his dermatologist's office in the Empire State Building on the morning of Sept. 11 -- When the second plane hit the tower, I was out of there" -- is openly jazzed. 
Squeezing his tiny palms together and shaking them loosely at the wrist as if rattling lucky dice, he extends to Sorkin that particularly hospitable strain of Jewish anxiety that says, "Isn't it a privilege and a joy and a disease to be doing something that makes us so uptight?"
Sorkin, bobbing his head and smiling maniacally at the floor, confesses to Zucker that he is sure the episode will be a colossal disaster. (When it is broadcast eight days later, the critics will essentially concur.) But Zucker, who never thought the episode was even remotely necessary, with all the numbers showing that Americans were flocking back with relief to the safety of their belovedly familiar TV worlds, and yet obliged him anyway, shushes him. 
"You're crazy -- it's going to be great," Zucker says. "It's going to be landmark television." 
Then Zucker purses his lips and makes another giddy little move with his hand, sending it diving off his right shoulder. The gesture manages to simultaneously convey someone heroically taking off into the stratosphere and stepping blindly off the edge of a cliff. 
Fifteen years ago in a small Manhattan apartment, Sorkin, an underemployed actor whose closest thing to steady work was occasionally touring small Southern towns with the Traveling Playhouse and who had never considered writing anything other than "a chore to be gotten through for some class," fed a blank sheet into a friend's throbbing I.B.M. Selectric. Four and a half pages later, he had a journalist named Shepherd throw down in disgust the script he had been given by his actor friend Danny and launch into a wordy speech about "why you can't write about a bunch of actors in the South playing poker on a hot summer night just because it really happened."
As he tapped out the dialogue, Sorkin, whose older sister and brother are both lawyers like their father and who, growing up, always considered himself the dumbest person in the room, says that he "felt a phenomenal confidence and a kind of joy that I had never experienced before in my life." 
Around that time, maybe a year later but it might as well have been the end of the same night, Sorkin started experimenting with marijuana and cocaine. Later, a friend instructed Sorkin how to cook cocaine powder with baking soda and water, stick it in a pipe and smoke it. The result, he says, "was that I found a drug I absolutely love and that gave me a real break from a certain nervous tension that I kind of carry with me moment to moment." 
Both writing and freebasing have proved devastatingly addictive to Sorkin, and since those fateful nights, Sorkin has never stopped doing either for very long. 
It took Sorkin four and a half pages to find his voice and three plays to find his commercial groove. His third play, "A Few Good Men," whose percussive courtroom exchange ("I want the truth." "You can't handle the truth.") has left a stubborn ding in the culture, was bought for the movies by the director Rob Reiner before it reached Broadway. Leftover bits from "The American President," the second script he wrote for Reiner, became "The West Wing," a show that won nine Emmys last year and attracts upward of 20 million viewers a night. If Sorkin can keep it going for a couple of more years, the series will earn him hundreds of millions dollars in syndication fees. In the last three years, he has written every buffed and burnished word of dialogue for 98 episodes of network television (including "West Wing" and the critically praised, though short-lived, "Sports Night"). It may well be some kind of record. 
Through all of it, Sorkin has strained to maintain some kind of coherent personal life. When he first moved to Los Angeles in 1993, he lived in the Four Seasons Hotel, where he worked on the screenplay for "The American President." When his drug use became increasingly hard to manage, his girlfriend, Julia Bingham, an entertainment lawyer he met through work, helped him into rehab. Shortly after, they were married at the Four Seasons, and less than a year ago had their first child, a girl they named Roxy. 
The drugs, however, never vanished from Sorkin's life, as was made clear this spring when his $4 pipe was discovered in the X-ray machine at the Burbank airport. For Sorkin, freebasing is as solitary a pursuit as writing. He says that he never does drugs with friends and that he is most vulnerable after completing a long stretch of work. When he was arrested, he was on his way to Las Vegas, where he went every six weeks or so, usually alone.
"Sometimes I like to go with friends," he says. "But honestly, I just like the feeling of being myself in a very crowded place with that kind of energy." He would take about $2,000 in cash and play craps and blackjack. "It wasn't Bruce Willis stakes. I'd play at the $50 table."
He would leave on a Friday night and return the next morning. "I kind of have a hotel fetish," he says. "I love walking into a new hotel room. But then I realized every hotel room in Vegas is exactly the same, so after a while, I just stayed at the Bellagio, which is the closest to the airport." 
Sorkin says that the most humiliating aspect of his arrest was that it reinforced the exact sense of himself he has been trying to write away for 15 years. When he recalls the moments at the metal detector, his memories have a compressed hyperreality, as if the metal detector hadn't just detected the pipe but had also found him out. 
"In my head, I was calm -- I wasn't shaken," he says. "But my body had completely lapped my brain. I was saying to myself: This is happening. This has just happened, and now the important thing is not do anything stupid. Don't lie. Don't bolt. Don't go, 'Oh, my God, how did that get there?' But as I was saying this, this thing just started rising up from my feet. It's difficult to describe. So I just started talking to myself in my head louder. This is fine. Relax. The worst just happened, and you're still here. So I was sort of talking to my legs, but it just kept rising up and rising up to the extent that I had no choice but to lean against the metal table. The last thing I remember was hearing one of the bag-search people saying, 'Please don't lean against the table."' 
Then he fainted. The police picked him off the ground and put him in handcuffs. 
Soon after his arrest, Sorkin and his wife separated. Since June, he has been back where he started, alone in his room at the Four Seasons. "It's not the identical room," he says. "But it's the identical room on a different floor."
When I ask him why he doesn't rent a house, he says that after a couple of weeks he called a real-estate broker, who took him around to look at some rentals. "I looked at five," he says. "They were all great, and I could afford them. But I didn't want any of them. I'm just not ready."
While Sorkin seems to derive a very similar kind of relief from writing hyperarticulate dialogue and from inhaling crack, he keeps his two worlds separate. That is not to say that he never writes about drugs. His teleplays are sprinkled with roach clips and bong pipes, and all the references are slyly appreciative. Five minutes into the "West Wing" pilot, a high-priced call girl, whom we will soon come to appreciate for her intelligence and strength of character, greets the day by lighting up a joint and saying: "It's not like I'm a drug person. I just love pot." And in one of the best bits in two years, Bartlet, after accidentally treating his bad back with a Percodan and a Vicodin, meanders back into the Oval Office and informs his assembled staff, "I've been seriously thinking of getting a dog."
But the overwhelming thrust of "West Wing," and of Sorkin's work in general, has nothing do with the darkness so apparent in his life or what he calls "the whole black world of addiction." His show is a tour de force of Hollywood professionalism. Every piece of dialogue is spit-polished within an inch of its life. The story lines, worked over by a roomful of Ivy League graduates, land softly with just that right little narrative twist. The acting is gracefully understated, and the lighting and direction are all far better than in most movies. With references to Shakespeare and Graham Greene, visits to rare-book stores and oblique Latin episode titles like "Post Hoc Ergo Propter Hoc," the show is so achingly high end that you almost expect the warning "Quality Television" to start flashing below the picture.
The characters themselves are just as highly produced. From the pot-smoking hooker who soon graduates from law school to President Bartlet with his Nobel in economics, everyone is brilliant -- and they're even better people. In an episode that won an Emmy last year, Toby, the communications director, arranges a military honor guard funeral for a homeless war veteran who happens to die in a coat the White House aide had given to Goodwill, one act of kindness begetting another. But that is nothing compared with what they will do for one another. When they huddle in offices or convene in hallways, Josh looks at Sam, Toby looks at C.J. and Leo looks at Josiah as if they are each other's newborns.
In fact, the only time they go slightly astray is when their Talmudic sense of right and wrong is blinded by that awful failing: loyalty. When that happens, they burn with shame, then march right back and apologize, and you can tell by the lump in your throat as you watch that they will never, ever, do it again. 
It is well done, and someone has to do it, but why Sorkin? Why is this twisted, second-generation Portnoy, who has apparently seen things in his head that might have made William Burroughs wince, the one to be offering America such a glittering lie about itself? It would be one thing if Sorkin were indulging a private fascination with the corridors of power. But he has never worked on a campaign or ever felt a desire to do so. Left to his own devices, he would rather watch "Sports Reporters" than "Crossfire." 
For Sorkin, subject matter is beside the point. When he started writing "A Few Good Men," with its trumpeting speeches about "code reds" and honor and the hard choices facing battle-scarred men, he was a 26-year-old slouch who had never spent a day in fatigues and who, at Scarsdale High School, hung out in the drama club.
"Early on, like after 'A Few Good Men,' people were very surprised when they met me," Sorkin says. "Their assumption was that I was a 50-year-old ex-marine who had decided to write about his experiences. And I didn't like that. I understood what they were saying : 'Boy, you've done a great imitation. You're a guy who has obviously spent a lot of time in theater and read a lot of plays and has absorbed how to sort of craft a flashy product with some snap and you can make drama happen. But it doesn't seem to have anything to do with a guy who is living in New York and is about to start a life of drugs and God knows what else and who had a strange first 18 years."'
When I circle back, it becomes clear that the same question vexes Sorkin himself. "Yeah, I often wonder to myself why the things I write about are pretty much disconnected from the things I think about," he says. "I will think about politics, but it's only because I enjoy writing about it so much." Most of his real life, including all the time he has spent "sitting alone in a room being high," as well as the "other darker things that I'm not going to talk about," don't come out on the page -- not because he willfully suppresses them but because he lacks the capacity to express them. "I can't connect with those things to the extent that I can write about them," he says. 
When I ask others involved in the show about this apparent gulf between Sorkin's experience and his work, they quickly get defensive and object to the media's radical-chic bias for vicarious darkness. "Ooh, violence -- I went to prep school but I'm down with that," mocks Bradley Whitford. "Aaron is pushing the envelope of intelligence and hope, and that's so much more radical than the envelope of violence and sex. A mobster going to a shrink, that's not a fantasy?"
Thomas Schlamme, an executive producer of "West Wing," wonders whether, if Frank Capra were making movies now, he would have to endure the same condescending assumptions that exploring the darkness in people is better art than celebrating the good in them. 
Sorkin protests far less. "I'm telling you, I get the difference," he says. "I would love to throw myself into a project that is dark. I just don't think I know how." 
The connection between his life and his work, to the extent there is one, may in fact be inverse -- the bleaker his moods, the brighter and more upbeat his scripts. From 1993 to 1995, when he was at the depth of his addiction and would sometimes go six weeks before letting the maids at the Four Seasons into his room, he wrote "The American President," a White House fairy tale that makes "The West Wing" seem like "Notes From the Underground." 
The week I visit Sorkin in Los Angeles, a fierce late-September sun pushes the temperature into the mid-90's. Sorkin sits in his large, shades-drawn office on the second floor of a low-slung, unmarked stucco building. The vast, hushed studio lot has the feel of a military complex, with the guards at the gate peering into every car. But the wariness around Building 146, which houses the "West Wing" writers, is caused less by fear of terrorists than by the bad press that has dogged the show all summer. 
Much of it was brought on by Sorkin's arrest, but a good deal also came from ex-writers of the show who claimed that even by the spotlight-hogging standards of Hollywood, Sorkin has been exceptionally ungenerous in his sharing of writing credit. "You know when you go to your uncle's for Thanksgiving and the kids are kept at one table," says a former staff member. "For the writers on 'West Wing,' every day is Thanksgiving."
One of them, Rick Cleveland, was livid about not being able to make any remarks at last year's Emmy ceremony at which an episode he wrote with Sorkin (the one about the homeless war veteran) was honored. What made the exclusion all the more galling to Cleveland was that the story was based on his father, a Korean war veteran who spent the last years of his life on the street.
Characteristically, Sorkin couldn't leave the matter alone. Immediately after the dispute was reported in The New York Times, he trashed Cleveland online in a "West Wing" chat room. (He habitually visits such Web sites after a show airs.) In a signed tirade, he insisted that Cleveland's contributions were so minor that he should have counted himself lucky to have won an Emmy at all. But as Cleveland points out, the co-writing credit was not offered by Sorkin but dictated by the Writer's Guild.
Sorkin's intense reluctance to share writing credit and his need to create such uniformly positive characters seem to come from the same place. If the reason that you are writing scripts in the first place is to undo the terrible impression you believe others have of you, you would want to make sure that people know exactly who wrote them. "I don't want to analyze myself or anything, but I think, in fact I know this to be true, that I enter the world through what I write. I grew up believing, and continue to believe, that I am a screw-up, that growing up with my family and friends, I had nothing to offer in any conversation. But when I started writing, suddenly there was something that I brought to the party that was at a high-enough level."
When I ask about the heinous crimes of his Scarsdale youth, they turn out to be heartbreakingly minor. As a kid, he left his coat at the playground a lot and his room was a mess. In high school, he got his diploma a few months late because he didn't go to phys. ed. At Syracuse, where he received a degree in theater, he once accumulated $237 in parking tickets. 
Sorkin doesn't criticize his parents, at least not in my company, but it is obvious that those misdemeanors were, at the time they were committed, held up as evidence of much deeper failings. "I used to think that I could never be a writer because my childhood was just too normal," he says. "I realize now it wasn't normal at all." 
Sorkin grabs a Merit, sticks it between his lips, then throws it back on the table without lighting it. "In other words," he says, "it isn't enough for me to write something that people like. It's helpful for me personally for people to get their sense of me from what I write. I think the young men in my scripts have to be in some shape or form the husbands and boyfriends that women want. I think the fathers have to be the fathers that sons and daughters want. I think the bosses have to be the bosses employees want. And believe me, I don't do this on a conscious level." 
Mainstream television, the sitcom particularly, has often served up idealized surrogate families, but Sorkin's illusion is much more compulsive and personal. He is singing for his supper every line. 
Sorkin's insecurities influence the show in other fundamental ways. Unlike "The Sopranos," which takes shape in the off-season when David Chase, the hit show's creator, lays out the destinies of each of his major characters, "West Wing" is never plotted out for more than a few weeks ahead and has no major story lines. With characters who have no flaws, it is impossible to give them significant arcs, and so as engaging as "West Wing" is minute to minute, it has no cumulative power. "Aaron doesn't trust the idea that he's writing a play in 23 acts," Schlamme says. 
What limits it dramatically makes it all the more commercial. Because there is no arc or any concern for sequence, a viewer can stumble onto the show at any point in the season, or even in the middle of a show, and get hooked. To Zucker, all this makes Sorkin more, not less, of a genius. "Aaron makes you laugh," Zucker says when I talk to him in his office the day after his visit to the set. "He makes you cry. He makes you think. And he makes you want to come back." 
As acclaimed and watched as "West Wing" is, it has spent its life in the shadow of the far more critically acclaimed and fervently watched "Sopranos." For those involved with the show, it has been a little like being Patrick Ewing in the era of Michael Jordan. Kevin Falls says that every Monday, staff writers spend a good part of the morning dissecting the "Sopranos" episode of the night before. And although Sorkin and others have often praised their Emmy rival, there is no evidence on record that the respect is mutual. "The silence is deafening," Falls says. 
Zucker is the only person I talk to associated with "West Wing" who isn't the slightest bit defensive about the "The Sopranos." "You want me to stoke the rivalry?" Zucker says a week before the postponed Emmys are canceled for the second time. "I'll stoke it."
For him, the difference between the shows is the difference between the work of a bona fide pro and that of an inspired amateur. "Look, Aaron gives us 22 episodes a year, not 13, and he gives it to us at a schedule that we set." (This is a reference to the creative delays that have pushed back the next batch of "Sopranos" shows until at least next September.) As much as Zucker might dread that call from the lawyer or the cops, it is not nearly as scary as the one that could come from Sorkin's agent informing him that Aaron just isn't feeling it at the moment and needs another six months. 
As Sorkin puts it himself in one of his less self-flagellating moments: "I never missed a day of work. I never missed a single meeting. The work has won every award. So sometimes I'm not so sure how I let the whole world down." 
Sorkin's commercial instincts will be tested in the months ahead as "West Wing" adapts to the changing political environment. For the first two years of its life, the show's depiction of an executive branch truly populated by the best and brightest was a balm to the millions of viewers weary of the endless frustrations and scandals of the Clinton era. The political operatives that Sorkin summoned from his imagination were so smart and scrupulous and impassioned that they were irresistible in a moment when real-life politics seemed trivial. 
That moment, however, has passed, and it is not at all clear whether the fantasy will be as alluring now that events have brought the actual White House closer to the imagined one on "West Wing." Washington is a serious, meaningful place again. The week before I visited Sorkin in Los Angeles, he told me over the phone that he is not certain the show will have to permanently change. He has "a sense that our perception will return to normal" and that the real government will "go back to being annoying." 
Sorkin described to me the episode that they were about to film when the terrorists struck. A foreign correspondent, deeply disappointed about being reassigned to the White House, goes off with typically Sorkinian bombast about about how "with the Larry King-ization of everything from Monica to Gary Condit to shark attacks, television has abandoned the notion of reporting altogether. He talks about a mother taking her kids to school in Bosnia, and the implication is that real news is something that happens somewhere else, not here." Sorkin pauses. "Well, now Bosnia has come to our front yard."
Still, after shoehorning in that one episode, Sorkin is not planning on overhauling the formula for "West Wing." Zucker would not want him to. The NBC executive slipped Sorkin that $10 million tip because he knows that Sorkin is the real deal, a Hollywood money-minting freak of nature. Marines, sports reporters, White House staffers, small pet veterinarians, you could pick the subject of his next workplace drama with a ouija board and Sorkin will churn out 22 episodes a year that will make you laugh and make you cry and make you want to come back. And he will do it year after year until the billion-dollar residual check is in the mail. Not because he wants to, but because he can't help himself.

HEADLINE: Practical Traveler; 
Car Rental Deals For Tough Times

BYLINE:  By MICHELINE MAYNARD; MICHELINE MAYNARD writes about the automobile business for The Times.

 BODY:
WITH car rentals down as much as 35 percent in the wake of the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks, according to the rental companies, discounts are proliferating. 
 Rates have been as cheap as a penny a day -- if you were a firefighter or a police officer who happened to need a truck on a Wednesday. But almost anyone can easily find vehicles for $25 or less a day. Some of the deals are half or more off the typical walk-in rate. 
 "You can find rates like you can't believe," said Mike Taylor, director of travel services for the consumer research firm J. D. Power & Associates, in Westport, Conn. 
Many rental car companies are extending their offers well into December, hoping that once travelers get over their unease, they will get back on the road.
The major rental companies do up to 90 percent of their business at airports, so the drop in air travel has led a number of them, particularly Hertz, Budget and the ANC Rental Corporation, the parent of National and Alamo, to reduce their fleets.
Car rental companies, which generally keep cars about four months, cut back on vehicles at the end of summer, the peak travel season. But this fall, fleets are being cut about 25 percent, compared with the normal 15 percent.
At Hertz, Rich Broome, vice president for corporate affairs, said that for now, his company planned to order 25 percent fewer vehicles. Travelers won't face shortages of cars and trucks, though, he added, because like most other rental companies, Hertz monitors inventory, and if it appears that an airport or city location will run low on vehicles, it will send more cars and trucks there.
Companies already had too many vehicles on hand before the Sept. 11 attacks, according to Betsy Snyder, a director at Standard & Poor's, the New York investment ratings agency. Now, she said, they must drum up business or risk being stuck for the cost of insurance and maintenance for them. 
It costs about $10 a day to insure and service a vehicle, according to Mr. Taylor of J. D. Power.

For Truck Lovers
 Among the deals, the most symbolic was Budget's 1-cent-a-day rate on Wednesdays in October for police officers and firefighters. "It's our way of saying thanks to those folks," said Jennifer Sullivan, Budget's director of public relations.
A more typical offer from Budget is a Ford Ranger pickup for $19.99 a day, or $99.99 a week with unlimited mileage (usually it is $31.99 a day), plus taxes and optional insurance. While it might not be a conventional vacation vehicle, Ms. Sullivan said that the Ranger comes with a locking bed cover that can hold luggage, and that it is popular among younger travelers who like to load it with gear. 
For those who'd rather have a car, Budget is offering an economy or compact, like a Hyundai Accent or a Ford Focus, for $24.99 a day. More information: (800) 527-0700 or www.budget.com. 
Hertz, (800) 654-3131 and www.hertz.com, has a $20-a-day Freedom Rate for a subcompact like a Hyundai Accent, if the vehicle is rented for at least three days, including a weekend day. A midsize car, like a Mazda 626, rents for $30 a day under the program, which runs for the rest of this year, while a Ford Explorer or other S.U.V. costs $40.
But Hertz offers better rates on weekends, depending on the car -- a Hyundai Accent, rented over a weekend in Detroit, for example, costs $16.99 a day with unlimited mileage -- so it's best to compare prices.
AAA members can rent a midsize car from Hertz for $29 a day, with a three-day minimum, and receive a free tank of gas. There is also a $199 weekly deal on a midsize for AAA members that includes a free tank of gasoline, through Dec. 15. 
Avis, (800) 230-4898 and www.avis .com, has a series of Fall Getaway rates, good through Dec. 15, that require rental on at least one weekend day. These are $20 a day or $109 a week for a compact, $30 day or $140 a week for a midsize and $40 a day or $179 a week for an S.U.V., minivan or premium car. The offers include unlimited mileage and are available in the United States and Canada, but not in the New York City area.
Alamo, (800) 402-5266 and www .alamo.com, has a Great American rates promotion. These are $20 a day for a subcompact, $30 for a compact and $40 for an S.U.V. or minivan, with unlimited mileage. That's a saving over the normal $34.89, $39.89 or $57.89 a day, with 150 miles. Reservations are required. The rates run through Dec. 15.

A Limited Offer
In most of the country, Enterprise offers a subcompact car, like a Dodge Neon, for $9.95 a day. That might seem very attractive, but it is not applicable in major cities, including San Francisco, Chicago, Boston, and New York City and its near suburbs. In New York, for example, its cheapest rate is $19.95 a day. Enterprise also does not rent at many airports.
The company has not decided when the offer will end, said Christy Conrad, a spokeswoman for Enterprise, (800) 736-8222 or www .enterprise.com.
The Internet is a bountiful source for last-minute, and destination-specific deals. But these are governed by a host of restrictions, so it's important to check the specials against rates normally in effect. 
Alamo has special rates on its Web site for travelers to Hawaii from as low as $25 a day or $133 a week for a midsize car with unlimited mileage. There is a five-day minimum, and customers will be charged extra if they pick up a car in town and return it to an airport. The deal is good through Dec. 15.
Hertz is offering last-minute Internet deals at many airports that are good through Nov. 15, but only if customers book by noon Eastern time tomorrow. Rates for a compact car with unlimited mileage are as low as $14.99 a day in San Francisco. The deals require a Saturday night rental and can be booked online or over the phone. They are not available in the metropolitan New York area, and in some cases, are only for airline passengers. 
Through Dec. 15, Budget is offering an online $19.99-a-day weekend rate, with a three-day miminum, on a compact car with unlimited mileage at a variety of locations, but not airports in the New York area. Reservations must be made online and at least three days in advance. Cars must be reserved all day Friday and be returned by Monday night. 
The real indicator of how much rental-car traffic has been affected will come at Thanksgiving, one of the travel industry's two boom times, along with Christmas. So far, the companies say demand is off from previous years. 
Mr. Taylor at J. D. Power said that if business remained depressed over Thanksgiving, the companies would be forced to offer even more attractive deals.
"They're doing everything they possibly can to get people into cars," Mr. Taylor said. "They have all these vehicles sitting on the lots, and somebody has to fill them."

HEADLINE: WINTER IN THE SUN; 
The Islands Feel an Autumn Chill

BYLINE:  By TERRY TRUCCO; TERRY TRUCCO writes frequently for the Travel section.

 BODY:
IT did not take long for Caribbean resorts to feel the aftershocks of Sept. 11. At the seven island properties managed by Wyndham Hotels and Resorts, which include the 488-room Wyndham Rose Hall Resort in Jamaica and 300-room Wyndham Sugar Bay Resort in St. Thomas, occupancy levels plunged. They dropped to between 20 and 30 percent the week of Sept. 16, half the normal rate for the slow autumn season.
 In the United States Virgin Islands, cancellations the first two weeks after the attack "felt like a run on a bank," said Richard Doumeng, an owner of the Bolongo Bay Beach Club in St. Thomas and president of the St. Thomas-St. John Hotel and Tourism Association. 
 Indeed, when a group of divers from Long Island arrived in early October for their annual stay at the Divi Flamingo Beach Resort and Casino on Bonaire, "it made my week," said Stevo Schwartz, the hotel's former general manager. "If the attack had happened in February, we'd be in real trouble." 
Even Martinique, where 3 percent of the visitors are American, felt an immediate impact. "Europeans aren't as willing to travel as before," said Muriel Wiltord, director of the Martinique Promotion Bureau in New York. "This is a global situation."
With the approach of high season beginning Dec. 22 and running through mid-April, resorts throughout the Caribbean are bracing for an uncertain winter, possibly their most difficult since the Persian Gulf war in 1991. John Bell, chief executive officer of the Caribbean Hotel Association, foresees two scenarios for the season. "If the acts of 11 September are not repeated, and the public feel secure traveling, the season won't be great but will probably be respectable," he said, but if terrorist activity accelerates and people are afraid to leave home or fly, the season will be "pretty bleak." A number of Club Meds are closing for the winter season or longer.
Yet at resorts that attract large numbers of repeat guests, full or nearly full houses are expected at Christmas, the season's first big-profit period. Holiday bookings are particularly strong at luxury resorts, in part because guests, required to book far before Sept. 11, would have lost sizable deposits had they canceled.
But while reservations look solid for Presidents' Week in February, those for the season's other peak -- the first three months of 2002 -- are below normal, leaving travel agents and resorts, already reeling from losses during September and October, anxious about the season ahead. The United States military strikes against Afghanistan did not cause the flood of cancellations or postponements set off by the events of Sept. 11, Mr. Bell said. But bookings for space in March, often snapped up in October, are slow, with a sharp drop in reservations from first-time visitors. "We're getting calls of interest and hits on our Web site, but new people just aren't booking," said David Flack, general manager of the Cuisinart Resort and Spa on Anguilla.
To coax visitors, the resorts are awash in deals, from deep cuts in room prices to free air fares. Though most incentives are available through mid-December, a few continue through January. At Bolongo Bay Beach Club, a small midprice resort on St. Thomas, double rooms normally $165 cost $75 a night, double occupancy, until Dec. 15. In Puerto Rico, the Wyndham El Conquistador Resort and Country Club is offering rooms for $125 (usually $225) through Dec. 22. And La Samanna, a luxury resort on St. Martin, where high-season rooms and suites cost $740 to $1,450, is offering a free seventh night this winter. 
In addition, island governments, including those of the United States Virgin Islands, Jamaica and Puerto Rico, have stepped in to help finance deals to lure visitors.
Three- and four-star hotels on Martinique will offer a 20 percent discount this winter, with blackout days at Christmas and Easter. Available to Americans only, the rates will apply to reservations made through travel agents and directly at the hotels. 
Some resorts and rental villas have waived the two-week minimum stay normally required at Christmas. But many resorts have refrained from drastically cutting high-season prices or adding incentives. "If somebody is afraid to fly or worried about their safety, they're not going to come, regardless of the price," said Heinz Simonitsch, general manager of Half Moon Golf Resort and Beach Club in Montego Bay, Jamaica. 
Eager to be perceived as a safe haven, the islands claim to have tightened airport security. After Sept. 11, airports in the French West Indies, which follow French government guidelines, instituted frequent patrols by police and dogs, Ms. Wiltord said, and bags left unattended for 10 minutes are confiscated. At the airports on St. Thomas and St. Croix, cars can no longer park by the curb, and all cars are searched, said Pam Richard, chief executive officer for the Port Authority of the United States Virgin Islands. The Coast Guard patrols the waters around the Virgin Islands and Puerto Rico, she added. At hotels, visitors come and go easily, though most resorts have upgraded security, Mr. Bell said. 
The hope throughout the Caribbean is that visitors will look to the islands as a warm, familiar escape from a troubled world. Travel industry experts believe that, should people decide to travel, the Caribbean is attractively situated, a short hop by plane from the East Coast and a considerable distance from trouble spots like the Middle East. "I think as the cold weather sets in, people will want to be someplace where it's safe, it's sunny, and they can feel closer to nature," said Sylvia Delvaille-Jones, the owner of Villas and Apartments Abroad, an agency that rents villas in the Caribbean.
Even before Sept. 11, worries about the economy in the United States and elsewhere had dampened hopes that winter 2001-2 would be a record breaker. "We'd already seen a slowdown in reservations before the attacks because of stock market concerns," said Peg Walsh, whose company, St. Barth Properties, rents villas on St. Barthelemy. Though visitors from other countries often fill the void when Americans stay home, poor exchange rates are expected to discourage vacationers from Europe and Canada. 
In addition, hotels in the Caribbean, as elsewhere, are struggling with high energy costs and, in many cases, steep payments for renovation and expansion. In this atmosphere, the dramatic drop in visitors so far has prompted speculation that not all Caribbean resorts will survive the season. "Cash flows at a lot of hotels are as delicate as in the airline industry," Mr. Doumeng said. "When business is slow in the fall, you live off deposits for winter. But when small hotels have to refund those checks, or the checks just don't arrive, and you've still got to light your coconut trees, it's tough."
On Oct. 19, Club Med announced that it would temporarily close for the winter season or the entire year 15 villages, including the one in St. Lucia and Columbus Isle in the Bahamas, because of forecasts of low occupancy. 
"Everyone is holding their breaths, but I would not expect mass closings in the Caribbean," said Scott Berman, a consultant at PricewaterhouseCoopers. "But destinations that rely on North American visitors, like Jamaica, the Cayman Islands, the Bahamas, the U.S. Virgin Islands and Puerto Rico, will be impacted more than those with more European business."
In another reflection of this fall's financial difficulties, more workers than usual were laid off or had hours cut. As a temporary measure following Sept. 11, Wyndham laid off about 5 percent of its Caribbean workforce and shortened staff hours by 25 percent. 
In a region so dependent on tourism, many governments plan to help hotels withstand losses. In Puerto Rico, lodging establishments will receive a 30 percent discount on energy bills and can keep half the government room tax for 90 days, beginning Nov. 1. 
Indeed, the Caribbean has a renewed appreciation for its visitors. Anguilla, for example, has instructed customs officials to be friendly when guests arrive. 
"The islands have learned you can't take your market for granted," said Mr. Flack, of the Cuisinart Resort. "I think once people get here, the islanders are going to be very happy to have them."

HEADLINE: The Way We Live Now: 10-28-01: Expert Opinion; 
The Con Game

BYLINE:  By Robb Mandelbaum

 BODY:
The surprising economic news in the weeks since Sept. 11? Consumer confidence has been holding steady -- and even improved in October. The bad news: it was already dropping beforehand -- in September, it fell more sharply than at any time since Iraq invaded Kuwait in 1990. And when the numbers, which come from surveys conducted by the University of Michigan and the Conference Board, drop and stay below a certain level, economists expect a recession. This happened in September. That's why, nine times this year, the Fed has lowered interest rates -- at least partly to counter weakening confidence. But when we asked several economists to clear up a couple of points about consumer confidence, perhaps as many doubts were raised as answers.

How could Sept. 11 not depress consumer confidence?
According to Jason Bram, a Federal Reserve Bank of New York economist: "You're not asking people if they're depressed or not, you're asking specific questions about the economy. Back in the late 1960's, a time we think of as tumultuous, consumer confidence was very high, because the economy was strong."
 Robert J. Shiller, a Yale economics professor and the author of "Irrational Exuberance," says: "The first month is kind of a patriotic time, and nobody wants to be dismal when they answer these questions. I think if the war wears on, confidence could fall." 

So are consumer confidence numbers predictive?
"Consumer confidence does predict somewhat -- and 'somewhat' is all you can expect in macroeconomics," Shiller says.

How useful is it to turn "confidence" into a number?
Stephen S. Roach, the chief economist at Morgan Stanley, says: "Using statistical tools to get inside people's feelings -- I mean, give me a break. I will tell you categorically that there are comparisons that should not be made, and the statistical basis for those comparisons is phony." Robb Mandelbaum

HEADLINE: Theater; 
An Art for the Ailing; That Is, for Everyone

BYLINE:  By JOHN FREEDMAN; John Freedman is the theater critic of The Moscow Times.

DATELINE: MOSCOW 

 BODY:
WHEN the renowned Japanese stage director Tadashi Suzuki talked about his challenging brand of art this summer in an interview here, he was anticipating November performances by his company in New York, the first stop on a monthlong tour of the United States. 
 But the words he used then sound prophetic today: "The world that surrounds us is filled with conflict -- war, religious strife, economic problems. In my productions, I want to give people hope." 
 In the aftermath of Sept. 11, the hope that Mr. Suzuki spoke of is, perhaps, more elusive and more necessary than ever. No one knows that better than the director himself. In a recent e-mail reply to follow-up questions, he said: "The terrible events of Sept. 11 confirm my belief that the world is a hospital, where no one is immune from the risk of becoming atrocious and mad. It is the urgent duty of theater art to make a deep analysis of the spiritual illness in which humankind is trapped, generally and eternally, but with particularly scathing desperateness now." (Though he understands English, Mr. Suzuki prefers to speak and write in Japanese; an assistant translated his reply.) 
Sickness, both in terms of the human psyche and of the social organism, is a major theme for Mr. Suzuki. So much so that he often sets his productions in hospitals, insane asylums or prisons. With a playful nod to Shakespeare, he defines his approach as: "All the world's a hospital, and all the men and women merely patients."
This is true of his brief and intense interpretation of "Electra," derived from an adaptation of the Greek myth by the Austrian dramatist and poet Hugo von Hofmannsthal. The 80-minute piece, produced by the Shizuoka Performing Arts Center (Shizuoka is a city 110 miles west of Tokyo), where the Suzuki Company is in residence, opens at the Japan Society on Thursday for four performances. 
As part of the company's first appearance in the United States in 10 years, it will also present an adaptation of Sophocles' "Oedipus Rex." The 70-minute production by the Shizuoka center will be performed twice at the Japan Society beginning on Friday. Both productions are in Japanese with English-language subtitles. The Friday performance of "Oedipus Rex" will be preceded by a conversation between Mr. Suzuki and Mel Gussow, a cultural reporter for The New York Times.
"Electra" is set in a mental hospital with a chorus of nurses and orderlies observing the main characters' every move as they push them onstage and off in wheelchairs. While the concept reduces the traditional theatrical elements of action and words to a minimum, it replaces them with an enormous concentration of energy that is manifested in the sparest movements and the actors' rhythmic, often explosive, delivery of their lines. When Mr. Suzuki's actors speak, they express primal emotions emanating from the viscera rather than ideas originating in the mind.
The story of "Electra" is that of a daughter plotting revenge for the murder of her father, Agamemnon, and the exiling of her brother, Orestes, by her mother, Clytemnestra. But plot is minimal in this "Electra" and is even less evident in "Oedipus Rex," where the tale of a man who unwittingly murders his father and marries his mother essentially dissolves in a concentration of static acting energy. Virtually nothing happens in "Oedipus Rex." Movements are sparse and mannered, and the performers speak in starkly conventional rhythms that communicate more through modes of pronunciation than through semantic meaning. 
Mr. Suzuki's work shows the influence of the Kabuki and Noh theaters, whose ritualized methods he applies to classical Western dramatic texts. He also incorporates music with rhythms and wind instruments that are recognizably Japanese, though not necessarily traditional in form. His lavish costumes, echoing Oriental styles in their bright colorings and flowing drapery, are in contrast to the stark, minimalist stage settings that consist primarily of organized empty space.
In Mr. Suzuki's hands, the bloody Greek tales of power struggles and vengeance acquire an ascetic bent and can strike audiences with the power of metaphor and mysticism. His theater is ultimately not about themes, psychology or character.
The director, an energetic 62, spent several weeks in Moscow during the Third International Theater Olympics in June, presenting productions and conducting master classes, like those that have brought him worldwide fame at the Shizuoka center and others, including his own well-known Suzuki Company of Toga, in the mountains about 250 miles northwest of Tokyo. In the United States he is a founder, with the American experimental director Anne Bogart, of an international theater institute and actor training program in Saratoga, N.Y., known as S.I.T.I. These centers conduct rigorous training exercises in the Suzuki method of acting, which puts a premium on actors' control of their bodies and energy.
During a break in his Moscow schedule, Mr. Suzuki expounded on his manner of art. "One way of communicating is talk," he said through a translator. "But sometimes we must communicate without words and do it with energy." The aim of his method is to tap into what he calls "animal energy," a notion that he further divides into the spheres of "private" and "public." 
Private animal energy, he said, is best demonstrated in sexual relations, where people communicate through their bodies and actions rather than words. The main public manifestations of animal energy, he continued, are sports and politics (where human energy is expressed "arrogantly" or "aggressively") and the performing arts (where energy is employed and expended through "peaceful" means). 
Mr. Suzuki's art, then, seeks to reach audiences not through the intellect but through the senses and instincts. One of its most distinctive, nonlingual methods of communication is the manner in which Mr. Suzuki's actors walk. Many of the performers slowly push their feet forward, barely lifting them from the stage, sensing the texture of the floor beneath them as they slide across it. Only as each step comes to an end do the toes rise up suddenly and then come back down quickly, as if to make contact with, and grab hold of, the earth again.
In one of his books, "The Way of Acting," Mr. Suzuki notes that "an actor's basic sense of his physicality comes from his feet." In Moscow, he expanded on that notion, describing how individuals in the modern world have lost touch with the world they inhabit. "Television and movies made us lose our sight," Mr. Suzuki said. "Microphones and amplifiers made us lose our ears. We no longer walk with bare feet and so our soles have lost the sense of touch." His mission, as a maker of theater, he said, is to "show what is wrong" with the world, for "the goal of the performing arts is to discover hope."
The Suzuki Company's tour, in which a third production, Euripides' "Dionysus," will occasionally replace "Electra" and/or "Oedipus Rex," continues to Pittsburgh (Nov. 9 and 10 at the Byham Theater); Newark, Del. (Nov. 13 and 14, Hartshorn Theater); the University of Iowa, Iowa City (Nov. 17 and 18, Mabie Theater); and Berkeley, Calif. (Nov. 30 and Dec. 1 and 2, Zellerbach Playhouse).

HEADLINE: Art/Architecture; 
Power, Imagination And New York's Future

BYLINE:  By HERBERT MUSCHAMP 

 BODY:
HOW great is New York. Even amid uncertainty, a stroller in midtown can walk through the door of, say, the Royal Athena Galleries on East 57th Street and fall back into the mythology of the ancient Mediterranean world.
 They call the merchandise here ancient art, but in fact it is ancient religion. Freud, who collected statuettes like those displayed at Royal Athena, called them "my dirty gods." The phrase was a double entendre. Some of the miniatures had been unearthed on archaeological digs and were stained by age and filth. For Freud, they also represented society's capacity to manage the most primitive human drives by incorporating them into daily cultural practice. Psychoanalysis aimed to be a new management system -- a new religion, if you like -- for modern, scientific times. Society had buffed up the little gods and called them classical antiquities. Freud showed how the tiny terrors keep popping up in our psyches. 
 It's shocking to be reminded how new modern times are. Power goes down, phones are cut out, elevators stop running, music stops and the rescue of a modern city begins to resemble the excavation of an ancient one. One half expects figures of Persephone, Osiris and Dionysus to be uncovered with the remains of the terrorists' victims. Actually, they're already here. Now called death, regeneration, separation and continuity, they're circulating inside grief-stricken minds. 
Power, power, who's got the power. Since the terrorist attack, groups of architects and planners have been working on concepts for rebuilding Lower Manhattan and for other projects, like improved regional transportation, from which the financial district would benefit. But the groups have been operating in a void. At this writing, no city or state agency has been named to oversee a rebuilding effort. The groups hope to be ready when the politics are sorted out.
Even if their efforts come to nothing, they are already an important part of cultural history. The last six weeks have witnessed the rapid formation of an archaeological record: this is how some New York architects responded to a local and global crisis. If the desire to rebuild the financial district becomes a political reality, this record should be taken into account.
Less than two weeks after the disaster, a coalition was formed by three private professional organizations: the New York City Partnership, the Real Estate Board of New York and the New York chapter of the American Institute of Architects. Now called the NYC Infrastructure Task Force, the coalition is directed by a committee that includes executives from leading real estate companies and corporate architecture firms familiar to readers of real estate news.
The Infrastructure Task Force can be reached at www.nycrebuild.org. It has been fascinating to follow the evolution of this Web site. Public relations filters have been in heavy use since the site went up. "Infrastructure" is an addition, and possibly a diversion. Nobody doesn't love infrastructure. There is also a new disclaimer: "It is not the intention of the task force to propose specific designs." Perhaps the intention is to be seated at the table later, when design commissions are passed around? 
The composition of the group's executive committee is a drastically shortened version of the list that appeared only a week ago. At that time, the committee was a Who's Who of major real estate developers and corporate architecture firms. The architecture firms included Fox & Fowle, Hellmuth, Okata & Kassabaum, Skidmore Owings & Merrill, and Kohn Pederson Fox. Even in its pared-down form, the committee recalls an Egyptian tomb painting. It is a hierarchical power structure whose members anticipate the arrival of the Ka or other magical intervention -- some turn of political and economic events -- that will throw the switch and allow the current to flow. 
JEAN GARDNER, a historian and theorist at Parsons School of Design, has lately been urging students and colleagues to go back to the history of medieval Florence, when the city's population had been decimated by plague. Survivors didn't know where to turn for authority. They had to make things up as they went along. They were very good at making things up. Before long, they made up the Renaissance.
"They" were mainly two groups of people: artists and politicians. I urge upon readers Lauro Martines's book "Power and the Imagination." If you can't obtain the book, just keep the title in mind. The interaction between these two groups establishes a good framework for evaluating the Infrastructure Task Force.
The original Web site revealed that the imagination has no place in this power structure. The group's executive committee, for example, broke down into two groups: developers and architects. Superficially, these groups might be taken to represent, respectively, power and the imagination. If you set our imagineers next to Florence's, however, the New York lineup was pure stand-up tragedy. 
Florence team: Brunelleschi (the Duomo, Spedale degli Innocenti; Santo Spirito), Vasari (the Uffizi), Michelozzo (San Marco); Michelangelo (Laurentian Library), Alberti (Palazzo Rucellai), etc., etc.
New York team: Skidmore Owings & Merrill (Worldwide Plaza); Fox & Fowle (Conde Nast Building); Kohn Pedersen Fox (U.S. Courthouse, Foley Square ); Hellmuth, Obata & Kassabaum (Federal Office Building, Foley Square), etc., etc.
It would be cruel to tax the New York team with a 21st-century renaissance. 
Initially, the task force Web site spoke of the need for "the city's architecture and planning community to speak with one voice." This has been rephrased. The revised goal of the task force is to "establish the framework that will allow planning, design and construction to move forward while allowing concerned constituencies to have a voice." (An early, unposted Statement of Purpose recommends "pragmatic implementation strategies that engage concerned parties before they coalesce into opposition.") These are political, not cultural, concepts. People of creative temperament don't think this way.
There is no such thing as an architecture and planning community in New York. There are some leading architecture schools here. There are museums that regularly present architecture exhibitions; nonprofit groups that sponsor shows, lectures and panels; hundreds of small architecture studios where good work is being done; and major outlets of the design press. Not least, there is a large public audience for contemporary architecture that has grown in size and sophistication in recent years. The architectural culture centered in New York has begun to rival that of many other cities around the world.
Yet the corporate firms who want to speak for the city's architecture and planning community are not part of that culture. They belong to corporate culture. In business terms, they are "professional service producers." With an average 300 to 450 employees, a corporate firm typically provides planning, design and construction documents, and in some cases engineering and interiors, for large-scale office buildings. None of these firms can claim credit for enlarging the public's interest in contemporary design. At best their work is out of touch. Architecture has moved light years away from the retrogressive focus-group sensibility embraced by corporate firms. 
The Sept. 11 attack threw into stark relief the chasm that exists between contemporary architecture and the corporate firms listed at the top of the task force hierarchy. Over here, we've got this messy, fragmented, all-over-the-place architectural culture. Over there, we've got these folks who want to speak, in one voice, for New York's architecture and planning community. Over here, Imagination. Over there, Power. Never in the city's history have these forces been so far apart. This is the crisis the city's architects now face.
In the past, it was possible to defend retrogressive architecture by asserting that the public found it pleasing. Architects should try harder to accommodate popular taste, it was believed. People were bored with International-style glass boxes. This line of thinking was exhausted some time ago. There is a growing public appetite for work with the energy to lead popular taste, not meekly follow it. Last summer, people were not breaking down doors to get into the Congress for the New Urbanism's weekend gathering in New York. They were lining up to see the show on Frank Gehry's work at the Guggenheim Museum. They were aroused by work that, like Wright's, or Brunelleschi's, found a way out of the box.
Why should this public, which takes pride in New York's image as the world's cultural beacon, be compelled to settle for cast-stone boxes? Because developers are comfortable with them? Because politicians, who depend on developers' financial support, are comfortable with them? Because corporate architects, who are dependent on developers' good graces, have fooled themselves into thinking that their work is not inferior to products of the imagination but simply different from them? Over here, developers, politicians, corporate architects and their clients. Over there, the public. That's another way to state the crisis.
We mustn't let fundamentalists scare us away from the metaphysics of urban space. They're not the only people who are entitled to talk about protective forces, angels, saints, benign interventions, duendes, dirty gods and clean ones. These entities are our neighbors. They're familiar faces to all of us who live down in Lower Manhattan.
The best thing about the financial district is that the New York Stock Exchange is housed in a pagan temple. Look up. The skyline is as packed as Freud's cabinet with ancient religious icons. There, atop the J. P. Morgan building, at 23 Wall Street, is a reproduction of the Mausoleum in Halicarnassus (what is now Bodrum in southwest Turkey), one of the Wonders of the Ancient World. The Cities Service building, at 70 Pine Street, bears aloft a quartz crystal cube. A gold pyramid caps the summit of 40 Wall, the former Bank of the Manhattan Company. A Roman brazier once flamed atop the Standard Oil Building, at 26 Broadway. The Gothic arches of the Brooklyn Bridge rival those of Chartres. If we want to talk about rebuilding downtown, let's start by putting the golden Spirit of Communication back atop the old AT&T Building, at 195 Broadway.
There are totems down here on the street, too: Palm Pilots, laptops, reflections in shop windows, ticker-tape parades, press conferences on City Hall steps, eyeglass frames at Lenscrafters, factory-fresh digital cameras, still in the box, designer suits at Century 21. Why come here if not in search of glamour, glory and gold? There is nothing shameful about such fantasies. In ancient times, temples were built to them. The contemporary imagination can barely function without them.
In certain fields, like product design and advertising, corporations can be as imaginative as you like. Corporate architecture, however, is seldom one of those areas. This has not always been the case. In 1954, Gordon Bunshaft and Henry Dreyfuss stuck a safe in the window of Manufacturer's Bank. The result was one of the most striking images in 20th-century architecture: a glass temple dedicated not to money but to the desire for whatever lies just out of reach. It has been a long time, however, since corporate architects were capable of such brilliant gestures.
This is what we're reminded of when we look at the lineup of firms on the Infrastructure Task Force Web site. It's a class portrait of architects who've put corporate marketing strategy where imagination ought to be. They are at most a production system waiting for the idea people to show up.
Just thinking about architecture in relation to the events of Sept. 11 is a major imaginative challenge. People died on that site. Even if their bodies are removed to Staten Island, this is where 6,000 people lost their lives. Corporate culture has no way of dealing with this. In corporate culture, no one ever dies. Everyone is young and glowing. The older we get, the younger we look. The fear of death is thus forestalled. Yet here is death.
Corporate America has encountered similar problems in the past: product recalls; class action suits; structural failures; hazardous wastes. It will find ways to deal with this, too. Time and space will be found to organize a competition to design a memorial. The making of memorials, in fact, has lately become an industry itself. Consultants will be enlisted from Hiroshima, Vienna and Oklahoma City. The memorial and new office towers will be artfully combined. There will be something for everyone. Everything will have been thought about, except thought itself.
There is something comforting, therapeutic, perhaps even divine about the determination to carry on. Only maniacs want the economy to fall apart. Only nut cases want cities to crumble, modernity to shrivel up, dreams to die. Even with the smoke still heavy in the air, it's desirable to live inside the world's most powerful economic engine. That desire is intrinsically healthy.
But the terrorist attack did not just create a crisis; it also exposed one. There is a cultural contradiction between the aims of corporate architects and the needs of the city they claim to represent. Here is money, here is death. Carrying on can be traumatic, even violent, as well as healing. The imagination thrives on such contradictions. The inclination of the status quo is to deny their existence, or to trivialize them into problems of design. 
The Florentines embraced the contradictions of their day. The result was humanism. Through learning, the powerful undertook to support the imaginative. Arts formerly considered satanic were allowed free expression. Creativity was back. Life was affirmed. Princes didn't pretend to be artists. They hired artists. And artists didn't have to wear suits. To paraphrase Iris Murdoch, artists had the dirty, Orphic job of venturing down into the dark, hellish regions where ideas and images are formed. They came back with flawless beauty.
A sophisticated local and international audience is prepared to see how a great modern city could possibly wrap its imagination around money and death, ice cream and fate, success and terror. That audience is willing to wait. There is no rush to satisfy its expectations, certainly not while the world is still at war. The city is not a video game. Eros and Thanatos are in the air, along with heroism, connection to others, sacrifice, self-deception, grandiosity, paranoia and greed. At this early date, why should we think that any of these drives are ready to be contained?

To the Editor:
 Herbert Muschamp's excellent "fantasy" on how civic groups compile development design proposals is a painfully real description of discussions about rebuilding the World Trade Center site "A Rush to Complete Plans for Downtown," Oct. 14 . 
 Our collective strength as a nation and as New Yorkers is rooted not in power or tower, but in the love evidenced in the rescue efforts. 
Community breeds such devotion. Neighborhoods, not architectural statements, create bonds among people. Neighborhood residents, workers and visitors share needs, pleasures, adversities, celebrations and commemorations.
Instead of replacement, we can and should expand on a trend well underway in lower Manhattan, where an influx of residential development is transforming the area from a nighttime desert to a vibrant neighborhood of around-the-clock activity. To design a multipurpose locale with community creation as its driving force presents a far more arduous architectural challenge than that of attempting to scrape the sky.

The SandwichGeneration Takes a New Gulp

BYLINE:  By JAMES SCHEMBARI; James Schembari is an editor at The Times. His column on the prime earning, spending and striving years appears the fourth Sunday of each month. E-mail: jimschem@nytimes.com.

 BODY:
MY generation is one of labels. Around my parents' house, we were called brats, then baby boomers. A few years ago, we became the sandwich generation, because we took care of our young children while assisting our elderly parents. Well, now it's time for another label, because our adult children, out of work and broke, are moving back home.
 How about the Dagwood sandwich generation? 
 "A lot of my clients are taking care of their parents and taking care of their kids," said Larry P. Ginsburg, a financial planner at Associated Planners Investment Advisory in Oakland, Calif. "Many of them who thought they would be empty nesters are finding out that their kids have not been able to establish a career as fast as they had hoped."
A close look at the last census shows that older children have been clicking their ruby slippers together for a while. Some 10.5 percent of young adults aged 25 to 34 were living at home last year. If you look only at the 25-to-29 group, the percentage rises to 12.1.
And the numbers could grow. Companies have announced hundreds of thousands of layoffs this year; more than a half-million people have filed unemployment claims since Sept. 11 alone. Steven W. Kaye, president of the American Economic Planning Group in Watchung, N.J., says young people who are just starting out may be hit especially hard. "The children don't have the euphoria of their job prospects that they had a year ago," Mr. Kaye said. "That tide has changed dramatically."
Even my wife, Christine, who worked a few blocks from the World Trade Center, was laid off less than two weeks after the attacks. Christine is welcome to live with me as long as she wants, but the children should not take seriously my fatherly lament that I never want them to leave. I don't mean it. The day the last of my four leaves home, probably around 2018, when I'm 66, I plan to celebrate if my doctor lets me. The thought of one of them or, yikes, all of them coming back because they can't find jobs is frightening. But plenty of parents are letting their children return.
"This has been happening over the last 10 years and we didn't notice it," said Benjamin Schlesinger, the co-author, with Suzanne Kingsmill, of "The Family Squeeze: Surviving the Sandwich Generation" (University of Toronto Press, 1998). "The major reasons are economic. It costs so much for a single person to have their own housing that it is much cheaper to stay at home. Parents say 'Why not stay home?' Parents are encouraging it, not discouraging it.
"People are being laid off by the thousands," he said. "Where are they going to go? The nice thing about family is that they will take you back."
Diane Hall, 54, of Pleasanton, Calif., has taken her adult daughters back several times for economic reasons. Now she has gone a generation further: she is now helping one daughter by caring for her 13-year-old. "I have been part of the sandwich generation for years," Ms. Hall said with resignation. "I thought at this age I'd be living the same wonderful life my family had led: have three wonderful children who would bring me babies to enjoy, that I would be able to stay home and bake cookies and have lunch with my friends. Just what I saw my mother doing. But my life has taken me another way."
A 52-year-old father in New Jersey, who asked that his name not be used, has both of his adult children living at home. Housing costs are the main reason. His son, 24, who has used his time at home to save his paychecks toward a condominium, is scheduled to move into it this week. His daughter, 22, is working part time.
"The economy stinks," the father said. "It is not the kind of position she had envisioned."
He is not complaining about having them around. Sure, there's a lack of privacy for everyone, but he said he enjoyed having his children there. "They do chores," he said. "My daughter goes grocery shopping; my son cuts the lawn. It's really nice. They're grown-ups now and fun to talk to. I will miss them when they're gone."
While adult children are at home, Mr. Kaye said, they should be working, "even if it is not the child's chosen career path."
"I don't care if it is baby-sitting or house-cleaning, it sends a message to the child that the clock is running and they do have the need to produce some income," he said.
Setting ground rules is important, Mr. Schlesinger said: Will they pay rent? How much? Will they be allowed to use the family car? Should they pay for groceries? He cautioned parents not to become "serving parents"-- cleaning their children's rooms or doing their laundry. The children should do those things, and other chores, too, he said, "so they feel part of the house."
He has another caution. Don't dump all the rules on them right away. "You have to realize that this young adult has different needs than when he left," he said. "Remember, they are embarrassed they are living at home."
Indeed. The New Jersey dad, for example, wanted his name withheld because his children had requested it. They were, he said, uncomfortable about the whole thing.

HEADLINE: The Relentless Urge to Refinance 

BYLINE:  By EDWIN McDOWELL 

 BODY:
NOT since 1990 have home owners been saddled with mortgage interest rates in double digits, although a couple of times the rates crept back within sight of that alpine territory. But for the last month 30-year, fixed-rate mortgages have carried rates below 7 percent in New York state, and they are among the lowest in a generation. 
 "Lots of adults today were born, raised, graduated from college, are parents of 5-year-olds and they never saw such rates," said Keith T. Gumbinger, vice president of HSH Associates in Butler, N.J., which publishes information on the mortgage market. 
 If current mortgage rates remain this low through the end of the year, as expected, said Robert Van Order, chief economist of the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation (Freddie Mac), annual average interest rates in 2001 will be the lowest in the 30 years that Freddie Mac has been surveying them. 
The inevitable upshot has been a break-neck rush to refinance -- that is, to pay off mortgages and replace them with loans carrying lower interest rates. With a majority of American homeowners paying down home loans carrying interest rates of 7 percent or more, Americans by the thousands have lined up to apply for low-mortgage home loans, much the way eager settlers lined up for free land during the the Oklahoma Land Rush of 1899. 
Last week, for example, applications to refinance existing mortgages rose 11.5 percent above the previous week, according to the Mortgage Bankers Association, and refinancing accounted for 73.8 percent of the total. That refinancing rate was not only 7.1 percentage points higher than a week earlier but the highest percentage since 1992. 
For the week ended Oct. 12, the 30-year fixed-rate mortgage dropped to 6.58 percent, the lowest since October 9, 1998 when it stood at 6.49, and the ninth consecutive week that it has been below 7 percent. The average for the fixed-rate 15-year mortgage dropped to 6.06 percent, down 7.52 from last year and the lowest since Freddie Mac began tracking it a decade ago. The one year adjustable mortgage rate declined to 5.26 from last year's 7.23 average, the lowest since the week that ended Feb. 16, 1996 when it averaged 5.19 percent.
Some homeowners have been so eager to take advantage of the lower rates that they financed several times in the past decade, during which mortgage rates fell every three years or so. Mortgage brokers say that it is not unusual for homeowners to have refinanced more than once this year alone.
Until recent years, mortgage specialists say, it was uncommon for rates to vary sufficiently to make it worthwhile for homeowners to refinance more than once a decade or so, A big reason for this, Mr. Gumbinger said, is that refinancing back then usually meant having to pay 2 points (each point is one percent of the loan) and hefty fees at the closing that could easily take up to five years to recoup. Points are still around, but the competition among mortgage brokers and online lenders has rendered them comparatively rare.
In addition, according to Joseph L. Romano, Jr., president of A. J. Romano Mortgage Company in Stratford, Conn. the size of mortgages rarely came anywhere near the high six- and seven-figures that are not uncommon today, so homeowners stood to save only small sums by refinancing, not the four- and five-figures a month they often save today. 
One couple who refinanced twice this year is Lev Verbitsky and Katharina Guel, a husband and wife from Hamden, Conn. They refinanced this February and their new refinance, already approved, was scheduled to close Oct. 24. After buying a $160,000 three-bedroom house in Hamden in January 2000 with a $148,500 30-year, 8 percent mortgage, they noticed early this year that rates had fallen below 7 percent. So they consulted with Mr. Romano and found they could save a bundle by refinancing, whereupon they took out a 15-year, $148,500 mortgage with a fixed rate of 6.875 percent. Because of the shorter term of the loan, their monthly mortgage payment increased to $1,324.40 from $1,089.64. But also because of that shorter term, they stand to save $153,000 in interest over the life of the loan.
Last month, seeing that mortgage rates had fallen again, the couple contacted Mr. Romano again. This time they wanted a 'no-cost' loan, for which borrowers are not required to pay closing costs at settlement -- costs that, depending on where one lives, usually run between $1,500 and $2,500. The term "no-cost" is something of a misnomer, since the closing costs are simply added to the loan and repaid over time. 
This time Mr. Romano found a "no cost" 15-year fixed rate mortgage with an interest rate of 6.25 percent. Had they paid the closing costs at settlement, their rate would have been a quarter of a percentage point less.
In this case, a 6 percent rate over the same 15 year term, coupled with the borrowers paying the closing costs at settlement, would have reduced their mortgage payments by $12.66 a month, or $1,219.37. As it is, their 6.25 loan, which includes closing costs, will require a monthly payment of $1,232.03. Mr. Verbitsky and Ms. Guel were aware of that, but neverthelsss preferred it that way. "If we had to pay $2,000 to $2,500 out of pocket, we'd have to think about refinancing again," Mr. Verbitsky said. As it is, their new loan will lower their monthly payment by $81.14, and with additional equity in their house, they will save an additional $61 a month from no longer having to pay the private mortgage insurance that lenders require of borrowers whose equity is below 20 percent. Moreover, their new loan will save them $11,000 in interest, in addition to the $153,000 they saved in their first refinancing. 
Their refinance loans not only put more money in the couple's pockets, it added to the further debunking of the traditional advice not to refinance unless the spread between the old and new loans is at least 2 percentage points. And it is why Mr. Verbitsky said without hesitation, "We think we did the right thing."
Adjustable-rate mortgages have waxed and waned in popularity, depending on their rate of interest during the initial three, five, seven or other number of years agreed upon. While ARM's rates typically start out lower than those for fixed rate mortgages, after their initial fixed term they can be changed annually for the remainder of the loan. But with fixed-rate mortgages currently as low as they are, Frank Nothaft, deputy chief economist for Freddie Mac, said there is little interest in ARM's, which are expected to command no more than 14 percent of morgage loans during this fourth quarter. Moreover, "we don't forsee ARM's being more than about 15 percent of the market next year," Mr. Nothaft added, "because the 30-year fixed rate is expected to be almost as low and affordable in 2002 as it has been in 2001."
"I did a mailing to 600 clients and acquaintances over a month ago saying this is the time to refinance, with interest rates near a 34-year low," said Richard J. Russell, president of Richland Equity Reserve, a Manhattan mortgage broker. "We got a 10 percent response, which is good for such mailings," and which he added led to "many refinances." 
What attracted most respondents, Mr. Russell added, was telling owners of expensive condos that if they had a mortgage greater than 8 percent a year they could save as much as $1,000 a month on a refinance, and telling owners of less expensive homes that they could save as much as $500 a month. A $200,000 loan over 30 years at 8.25 percent would require monthly payments of $1,502.66, while refinancing to pay back the same amount over the same term at 6.5 percent would result in payments of $1,264.32, a savings of $238.34 a month.
It should come as no surprise that most people, regardless of income or where they live, want to save money. "It's just been crazy," said Joseph L. Romano, president of A. J. Romano Mortgage Company, which has an office on Main Street in Stratford, Conn., and a Web site (www.ajromano.com) that has proven handy for applicants who do not have time to stop by. With barely enough time in the day to handle all the recent inquiries, Mr. Romano said that it is not uncommon in these hectic times to be filling out paperwork until 2 a.m. But he does not seem to mind. "In our business you also have slow periods," he added, "so when it's busy we don't mind working long hours." 
The pace is much the same almost everywhere. John P. Brady, senior executive vice president of S. I. Bank and Trust, said its 33 branches in Staten Island, Brooklyn and North Jersey have all been busy with mortgage applications. And the Ivy Mortage Corporation in Branchburg, N.J., which is owned by S. I. Bank and Trust and which operates in 42 states, "has also been very, very busy," Mr. Brady said, adding that more than 70 percent of its loan volume has been for refinancing.
While predatory lenders still abound, it is far easier than ever for borrowers to know for certain whether they did the "right thing" in refinancing their mortgage loan. In addition to the many reputable lenders who take the time to explain how a particular loan will result in lower monthly payments, shorter durations or lower interest costs, that information is also widely available to the public from the mortgage calculators on the Web sites of numerous financial institutions, realtors, mortgage lenders and brokers, as well as on the Web sites of newspapers, magazines and television networks. (Mortgage calculators can, of course, just as easily calculate the cost of first mortgages as of refinances.) 
Like the more reputable lenders and mortgage brokers, the better mortgage calculators can also explain why it makes more sense for a borrower to take this loan or that. For choosing the right mortgage involves more than merely crunching numbers, it also depends on the borrower's income, expectations, aspirations and approach to financial planning. 
They can explain, for instance, why a 30-year mortgages might be preferable for younger borrowers, who may not be able to afford the higher monthly payments that would be required to repay a 15-year loan for the same amount. Conversely, the 15-year term might be preferable for middle-aged or older borrowers who can afford the higher monthly repayments. 
Mr. Russell of Richland Equity advocates that borrowers with 30-year mortgages pay an additional monthly payment each year, which he said has the effect of shortening a 30-year loan by seven years, thereby saving many thousands of dollars. 
Many mortgage analysts and economists are of the opinion that, as Mr. Gumbinger put it, "mortgage interest rates and Fed cuts don't march in lockstep." Mortgage rates had been dwindling over the past month, Mr. Gumbinger said, and the economy had not recovered much if at all on news of the series of short term interest rates. 
But neither do they discount the likelihood that the nine Federal Reserve rate cuts this year, with another one widely predicted by the end of this month, have some effect on mortgages. On the contrary, many think that the Fed's half-point rate reduction on the morning of Sept. 17 -- just hours before the New York Stock Exchange re-opened after having closed for six days after the terrorist attacks six days previously -- helped unlock a lot of pentup demand for refinancing. Two weeks ago, Phil Colling, an economist with the Mortgage Bankers Association, attributed some of the spurt in refinancing to "continued low interest rates" together with "new uncertainty in the economy."
At the same time borrowing for refinancing has soared, applications to buy houses have slumped to their lowest level this year. And at a time when the National Association of Realtors has calculated that the value of existing single-family homes in the United States has risen an average of 6.3 percent each year since 1968 (from $20,100 to $139,000), it is little surprise that many refinances are taken for the purpose of "cashing out" -- that is, taking a loan based on the increased value of the house and paying off the existing mortgage while using the remainder of the cash to pay off medical bills, credit card debt, tuition, home equity loans or to remodel their house.
Some people who are worried they may be laid off are apparently taking the cash while they are still employed, according to Doug Duncan, chief economist of the Mortgage Bankers Association. Saying that the only evidence of this trend is anecdotal, he cited the example of a friend who owns a travel-related business, and every two- to-four years sells his house and plows the equity into his business. 
Mr. Romano told of a client who was recently laid off by a Connecticut-based marketing research company, who when he saw it coming cashed out -- not for debt consolidation but because he had since started his own business, and, Mr. Romano said, "Once you're unemployed, lenders want to see your track record for at least two years before they'll give you a mortgage."
Dolores and Oscar Ruiz bought their three-bedroom Cape Cod house in New Milford, N.J. five years ago with a 30-year loan at 7.75 percent interest. Nine days ago the couple -- she works in public relations for Weber Shandwick Worldwide in Manhattan, Mr. Ruiz is a news director for WNJU-TV, the Spanish-language station in Teterboro, N.J., which is owned by the Telemundo Communications Group -- refinanced a $205,000 mortgage with a 30-year term at a rate of 6.85 percent.
The new mortgage will cost the couple a lot more over the term of the loan, compared with that of a 15-year term, but the lower interest rate for the new 30-year term will result in Mr. & Mrs. Ruiz paying $1,815.40 a month, $400 more than before. But they have paid their credit card debt of $57,000, for which they were repaying about $3,500 a month. Now they expect to save enough to eventually expand their house, which suddenly became smaller 16 months ago with the birth of their son Daniel.
"Had we taken a 15-year loan, we'd be laying out the same just for the mortgage as we'll now lay out for the mortgage and the credit card debt," Mrs. Ruiz said. Besides, she added, "Daniel wants a little brother or sister, so we have to think about saving for that every possible way."

HEADLINE: L.I. @ WORK; 
Unions Rethink Links to Undocumented Labor

BYLINE:  By WARREN STRUGATCH 

 BODY:
SHOULD organized labor reach out to the undocumented worker, even when met with suspicion or hostility? Or should labor view illegal immigration as a force that depresses wages and threatens to reverse the movement's hard-won gains in higher wages, greater benefits and improved work conditions? 
 On a sparkling day in early October, a group called the Coalition to Save Long Island Jobs held its third annual conference at the de Seversky Conference Center in Old Westbury. Where Alfred I. duPont once entertained guests in gilded Jazz Age luxury, the coalition devoted a morning to discussing some of the significant issues facing the labor movement. 
 Among the most important, and often the most divisive, is the issue of labor's proper position on the undocumented worker. 
"A number of unions are changing their position, and now are supportive of undocumented workers and are trying to organize them," said Tony Macagnone, a Town of Oyster Bay councilman as well as council representative of Local 7 of the Empire State Council of Carpenters.
The old guard, however, views the workers' willingness to work at far lessthan union rates as threatening the union's bargaining position.
For the Coalition to Save Long Island Jobs, a movement organized by the Long Island Progressive Coalition during a strike by King Kullen workers in 1997, the topic is emerging as a hot-button issue.
Judy Pannullo, director of the Progressive Coalition, said the King Kullen strike achieved a breakthrough in terms of public support for the Long Island labor cause. Since then, she said, it has been noticeably easier to raise labor issues among Long Islanders and find supportive responses.
"Take globalization," said Ms. Pannullo, who doubles as executive director of Save Long Island Jobs. "That threatens Long Island workers. A company can take away your job and move it somewhere cheaper. We're against that." She said she got more sympathy for that position now.
Still, it was not globalization that was the focus of this conference. On Long Island the issue of undocumented workers made headlines last year when community opposition to illegal aliens in Farmingville culminated in violence and angry denunciations of the workers and their supporters. Active community opposition to the immigrants, who gathered mornings at curbside locations to meet potential employers, made Farmingville a flash point in the national debate over America's immigration policy.
For labor, the issue is no less divisive. While some old-school unionists resent spending union funds to help undocumented workers, a number of national and local leaders are initiating recruitment drives and other outreach efforts. Often these efforts are accompanied by free social programs, like English conversation classes. Historically, such programs have improved relations between the newcomers and the established work force, and are often a precursor to successful union recruitment.
Mr. Macagnone moderated the hourlong panel, called "The Problems of Undocumented Workers on Long Island," and was optimistically subtitled "A Constructive Dialogue." According to Ms. Pannullo, the more strident voices that have been heard on the issue were intentionally excluded. She said the reason was to keep the meeting from getting ugly.
Those who deal honestly with the issue, Mr. Macagnone said, are walking on a razor's edge.
"You oppose these guys as being here illegally and you're called a racist," he said. "But if you try to bring them into the union, where they'll be paying taxes like everyone else, you're criticized for helping people who are breaking the law."
Mr. Macagnone said his union was nevertheless on the side of offering services to workers, regardless of legal status or union affiliation. In Glen Cove, the city arranged to build a hiring site that reduced public visibility and inconvenience; the carpenters' union supported the effort, and the city's policy was commended by several speakers that morning.
"Undocumented workers have become an essential part of the work force," he said. "It's the duty of organized labor to represent all working people, whether they're union or not."
Mr. Macagnone's views are not universally shared among union leaders. John Kennedy, president of the 60,000-member Building and Construction Trades Council of Nassau and Suffolk Counties, warned against providing help to workers before resolving their legal status. 
"Something has to be done to help these people in terms of getting them the housing, benefits and safe working conditions they need," Mr. Kennedy said. "But first things first. They have to become documented. Then we will organize them, if we have to."
He said his union took no position on how undocumented workers could obtain legal residency status. "That isn't our problem, that's the federal government's problem," Mr. Kennedy said. He blamed federal immigration authorities for failing to keep American borders secure.
The panel discussion on undocumented workers got underway with a presentation by John Brock, representing an organization called the Tristate Immigration Moratorium. He mentioned his Slovak roots on his mother's side before launching into an anti-immigration argument. He cited several books opposing immigration and attempted to win the audience over by repeating the standard economic justification that large numbers of new workers depress wages for established ones.
"Big business loves mass immigration, because it rationalizes the labor market," he declared. "From the free-market point of view, the American worker is vastly overpaid. Open borders bring immigrants here who are happy to do your work for far less money. In the past, they've put entire industries out of business. Meatpacking used to be a good job; now, it's all done by immigrants and pays miserably. Why do you think that The Wall Street Journal editorializes in favor of open borders?"
John Scaffetta, a member of Mr. Macagnone's carpenters' union, spoke next. "We find a tremendous influx of Hispanic workers in construction," he said. "Whether we like it or not, we believe they're the work force of the future."
Acknowledging that in the past the union "has practiced the politics of exclusion," he said that today his union was attempting to recruit Hispanic workers and was doing some things differently, including hiring a Hispanic organizer. He said it was too soon to talk about the new organizer's results.
Another speaker, John Bingham, a Catholic Charities social worker, sought to make the point that being an undocumented worker was a legal condition, not a moral one. Laws, he noted, can be amended.
"Laws ought to reflect reality," he said. "Businesses need workers. And workers need jobs."

HEADLINE: Latino Laborers Turn a Camera on Themselves 

BYLINE:  By SHANDRAY GABBAY 

DATELINE: STONY BROOK 

 BODY:
UNTIL recently, Luis Bernal-Estrada of Farmingville did not know how to use a camera. But the 26-year-old carpenter by day and rookie photographer in his free time has taken more snapshots in the past year than he can count. And now he has two photographs on display at an exhibition at the State University of New York at Stony Brook.
 For Mr. Bernal-Estrada, who left Mexico less than two years ago and has since been living on Long Island, the camera has become a tool and photography the means to share his life as a Latino laborer with a society that does not seem interested. 
 His introduction to photography began a year ago. That was when he and nearly a dozen other Latino workers on the Island were offered spots in a photography class at Stony Brook in exchange for shooting a roll of pictures each week that would capture everyday moments on the job or at play. The workers were participants in programs sponsored by the Workplace Project, a Hempstead organization founded in 1992 to address problems of low-wage immigrant workers on the Island.
"Everyone only knows us as workers," said Mr. Bernal-Estrada, who was interviewed through a translator from the Hempstead group. "They only know what other people tell them about us, and they're not able to go any further."
Some of the snapshots are part of the exhibition at Stony Brook, which is at the Union Art Gallery until Oct. 31. The show also includes dozens of other images taken by workers from Local 32BJ of the Service Employees International Union, the country's largest building service union and Local 23-25 of the Union of Needle Trades, Industrial and Textile Employees, which is comprised mostly of Chinese garment workers.
The show is part of a larger project, "Unseen America," organized by Bread and Roses, the nonprofit cultural arm of Local 1199, the National Health and Human Services Employees Union, which represents health care workers in New York City. The project aims to document the lives of the working class through photography.
Carlos Canales, a staff member of the Hempstead group, said the purpose of the photography classes, and the Stony Brook exhibition, was "to show the community that these people have art and expression inside -- a soul, a spirit -- even though most can't read or write."
The images of workers on the Island were mostly shot in black-and-white. They are of friends, family or fellow Latinos engaged in everyday activities. There are photographs of friends enjoying a game of cards, a weary worker sleeping on an uncovered mattress, three men grilling tortillas on a barbecue, and a group of men standing around on a cold, snowy day awaiting work.
Mr. Bernal-Estrada has two pictures in the show, including one taken at the house in Farmingville where he lived when he first moved to the United States. It shows his former housemate, Pedro, dancing with a woman, Ouri, who cooked for them.
"I think that this is a picture that would help everyone else know that we come to this country not to do bad things like people say," he said, holding back tears. "But we come here to work and have fun."
Some pictures have a more serious undertone, like one of a protest by Latinos in Melville, objecting to the decision of Joseph M. Trudden, mayor of Farmingdale, to shut down a site in that village where day laborers were hired.
The photography classes were financed by Bread and Roses and several other organizations. An interdisciplinary campus group founded by an economics professor, Michael Zweig, provided darkroom and class space.
"Unseen America" is one of dozens of Bread and Roses projects, and is scheduled to travel to 40 sites across the nation, including Chicago and Washington. Some of the pictures will also be on display through December at Stony Brook's Latin-American and Caribbean Studies Center.
"It's another way of reaching out about work and the lives of working people to encourage them by using photography," said Moe Foener, the 86-year-old founder of Bread and Roses. "It is an unusually effective way of projecting their needs and interests through to large audiences."
For some of the participants, the experience was far more than just learning the basics of how to load batteries into a camera or process film in the darkroom.
"It always interested me to take pictures," said Aaron Cruz, 23. "But I never had the opportunity. For many of us it was a dream come true to have a class like this."
Even the instructors walked away with something to remember. 
"To show, to tell, to humanize people who have sometimes been demonized," said Jim Cassidy, a teacher. "To me, that is one of the best uses of photography."
Rodolfo Sorto, a 30-year-old maintenance worker from El Salvador, described the darkroom as "a garden."
"With each picture I feel like a gardener," he said. "When you take the film, each roll is like a seed and when you see your creation, it is a flower."

Other photographs in the project include views of workers preparing a meal, left, grilling tortillas, below, and in a church.

HEADLINE: University Develops Housing in Chicago 

BYLINE:  By ROBERT SHAROFF

DATELINE: CHICAGO 

 BODY:
In an effort to both expand and enhance its downtown campus, the University of Illinois has teamed up with a consortium of private developers to transform a formerly blighted Near South Side neighborhood into a community with almost 1,000 new homes. About 80 percent of the homes will be sold at market rates, the remainder at lower prices with income ceilings for buyers.
 The project, called University Village, also encompasses new and renovated buildings for the university, including two dormitories with rooms for 750 students and a new home for the campus security force in a historic police station. In addition, the university is developing 120,000 square feet of new retail space, and it has tentative plans for two new academic buildings on the 85-acre site, including a possible new home for the business school. 
Over all, the project is to cost about $750 million, with the housing component accounting for about $300 million. 
"For most of our history," said Ellen M. Hamilton, the university's director of real estate, "we've been considered a commuter university. There's long been a desire on campus to create a 24-hour neighborhood, where everyone doesn't leave at night."
The project, which has been in the planning stages for more than a decade and which broke ground last year, is the latest step in the growth of a campus that began after World War II as an offshoot of the main University of Illinois campus in the downstate cities of Champaign and Urbana.
The Chicago campus was originally at Navy Pier, a onetime steamship wharf just north of downtown, and moved to its current location just southwest of the Loop in 1965. The campus grew considerably after merging with the University of Illinois Medical Center in 1982 and today has about 200 acres within a larger zone bounded roughly by Eisenhower Expressway on the north, 16th Street on the south, Halsted Street on the east and Damen Avenue on the west. 
The institution's involvement in a commercial development aimed at revitalizing its neighborhood is not unique. According to a study being done by the Lincoln Institute of Land Policy in Cambridge, Mass., at least 60 such projects are under way at urban universities around the country.
"There's no question that there's an element of enlightened self-interest on the part of universities in these projects," said Terry Foegler, president of Campus Partners, a nonprofit real estate company set up by Ohio State University in Columbus to do neighborhood development in that city. "Unlike businesses, it's tough for universities to relocate when neighborhoods start deteriorating, so it makes sense for them to partner with various entities to try and revitalize these areas."
One of the most extensive programs of this type in recent years is in Philadelphia, where the University of Pennsylvania has spearheaded the redevelopment of a 63-block area. Among the projects it has undertaken is the construction of more than 1 million square feet of new commercial space, including a hotel, a grocery store and a multiplex movie theater. "We brought a lot of private capital as well as university investment to the table," said Dr. Judith Rodin, the university's president. "The neighborhood has been truly transformed." 
The University of Illinois has similar aims in Chicago. University Village is at the southeast corner of the campus, a neighborhood with both a lot of history and a lot of problems. A century ago, the area teemed with Jewish immigrants, who founded the Maxwell Street Market, a colorful market and bazaar that endured in its original site until the early 1990's. "It was like Orchard Street on the Lower East Side of New York," said Eve Kronen, managing broker of a Coldwell Banker office in the area.
By the end of the 20th century, however, the neighborhood had deteriorated into a ramshackle area of largely one- and two-story flats and stores punctuated by a large number of vacant lots.
The developers who have teamed up with the university are the Chicago-based Mesirow Stein Real Estate Inc., the Harlem Irving Companies in suburban Norridge and the New Frontier Companies in Springfield, Ill. They have formed a partnership known as the South Campus Development Team.
"We're wearing two hats," said Larry D. Justice, project executive of the consortium. "We're the developer of the private housing component and the program manager for the university's part of the development." 
The consortium is constructing 930 new housing units on 26 acres at the southern end of the site. About 186 of the apartments will be contained in two old concrete warehouse buildings, while the rest will be a mix of new town houses and apartment buildings. Prices range between $165,000 for a 671-square-foot loft to $696,000 for a 3,000-square-foot town house. About 366 apartments have already been sold, and the first residents will move in early next year.
About 196 units are classified as affordable, meaning they are priced for buyers who make 80 to 120 percent of the median income for the metro area. Median income for a two-person household in Chicago, for example, is $56,400 and for a four-person household, $70,500. The affordable units are priced between $143,000 and $228,000. 
"The location is very good," Ms. Kronen said. "Neighborhoods become successful when they are attached to other successful neighborhoods, and this one is in close proximity both to the West Loop and the Near South Side."
The project itself is what attracted Rafi Arbel, an attorney with West Group, a legal research firm. "What we liked about it is that the developers are building an entire community from the ground up right next to the university," said Mr. Arbel, who with his wife, Jennifer, recently purchased a 2,800-square-foot town house in the the project. "I like being near the university."
The university's part of the project is also well under way. The first of the two dormitory buildings opened this fall, while the second will be ready in 2003. "We're currently about 10 percent residential and 90 percent commuter," said Mark Rosati, the university's associate chancellor. "We want to increase residential to 25 percent by 2012. This project is a big step in that direction."
Work is also progressing on the construction of a retail district at Halsted and Maxwell Streets. Like the housing, the district combines new and old space. After a bruising fight with a neighborhood group determined to save what was left of the Maxwell Street Market, the university agreed to preserve eight buildings on Halsted Street and the facades of another 13 buildings in the area. The facades are being applied to the exterior of several large new structures that combine retail and parking space.
In addition, an old brick Chicago police station at the western edge of the site is being renovated as the new home for the university's campus security force. The station, a two-story red-brick affair that dates from 1889, will be familiar to many television viewers. During the 1980's, the facade served as the exterior of the police station that was the focus of the long-running series "Hill Street Blues." The station was vacated by the police in the late 1990's.
The new academic buildings will follow in 2004 and 2006 but must be preceded by additional fund raising.
"We feel we're a rising academic powerhouse," Mr. Rosati said. "But to service the city and state as we would like, we need facilities. University Village will benefit the campus on many levels. It will address some of our needs for academic space, enhance the teaching and research environment, alleviate the campus housing crunch and make the university a more attractive destination for students."

HEADLINE: In the Region/New Jersey; 
Home Sales Have Been Generally Strong in October

BYLINE:  By ANTOINETTE MARTIN

 BODY:
CONTRADICTORY, complex, as hard to analyze as Tony Soprano on or off Prozac, the New Jersey residential market stumbled hard immediately after the Sept. 11 attack, but has since revived. At least in some towns. At least for now. 
 "Your ball is as good as my ball," Jean Olcott of Burgdorff ERA, who has been a sales agent in Bergen County for 29 years, said with a laugh. It is hard to be a swami in never-before-seen circumstances, she pointed out. 
 The Sept. 11 attack in Manhattan did have an immediate measurable impact in New Jersey. The number of sales contracts signed for homes was off 16 percent in September, compared with September 2000, according to the Garden State Multiple Listing Service, which has 555 member companies in eight counties. 
Coldwell Banker, a brokerage that does business in those eight counties and four others, experienced a 13 percent drop in contracts signed in September compared with last year. The number of canceled contracts was up 14 percent for the month, said Coldwell Banker's president and chief operating officer, Maureen Passerini.
"But for October so far," Mrs. Passerini said, speaking during the fourth week of the month, "we've been quite busy." Coldwell Banker held a Meet the Builder program in New Jersey last Sunday, showing 400 new-home sites, and had 40 signed contracts by Wednesday. The prices of homes under contract ranges from $200,000 to $1 million or more, she said.
In the top price range, Mrs. Passerini said, the market sputtered but is now spurting. Coldwell Banker sold only one home worth $1 million or more in September in New Jersey, she said. In October so far, it has sold 10.
The situation is "patchy," several brokers observed. Certain sectors of the market, notably starter homes, and certain sought-after towns with a perennially tight inventory of homes for sale -- Ridgewood, Montclair, Millburn-Short Hills, Mountain Lakes -- seem immune to jitters in consumer confidence since Sept. 11. 
Before the terrorist attacks, a Montclair real estate broker, Jay Schweppe, was publicly predicting a slowdown in the residential market, because he believes homes are routinely overpriced in Essex County. Then, September turned out to be the "best month ever" for Schweppe & Company, Mr. Schweppe said.
Worries about worsening economic times appear to be nearly universal, though -- along with relief that so far the impact has been relatively minor.
A slide from record high sales prices in northern New Jersey had begun by late August. Ms. Olcott of Burgdorff said, "We already knew before the tragedy in New York we were not going to see those numbers again." 
Prices have been climbing about 5 percent a year across the Northeast, according to the National Association of Realtors. In much of New Jersey, prices were climbing faster than that. In Bergen County earlier this year, the median sales price for existing homes ranked in the nation's top 20.
Still, New Jersey residential prices do not approach those in Manhattan. This may help buoy the market here despite an economic downtown, realtors said, especially if there is a wave of New Yorkers relocating in the wake of the attack.
"I was showing a couple from Manhattan a $1.8 million home in Mendham earlier this month," said Lindy Peteet, a luxury property specialist with Weichert. "Her eyes got so big. I wasn't sure what she was thinking, so I asked her: 'Are you pleased with what you're looking at?' "
"It turned out she was amazed at the value," Ms. Peteet said. "They live in a brownstone, and this was 6,500 square feet on three acres." 
IN the days after Sept. 11, realtors and brokers reported, the generally robust sales activity abruptly diminished to nearly nil.
"There was a dramatic drop-off, for about 10 days," said Gary J. Stefanoni, sales and marketing manager for Pulte Homes, a builder of upscale town house communities in Paramus, Holmdel and Warren.
Jacelyn Botti, Weichert Realtors' senior vice president for the tristate area, said, 
"The first week, everybody was traumatized, and very little at all went on.
"But as we began to move away from that," Ms. Botti said, "the same thing happened with real estate as with the stock market. We gradually got in the back-to-work mode, the buying cycle mode."
Average attendance of prospective buyers at Weichert Sunday open houses in New Jersey continues at seven or eight, Ms. Botti said, and the pace of sales has rebounded. Weichert's rate of sales for the first half of October was virtually even with October 2000 in New Jersey. Ms. Botti said she computed monthly "revenue units" (a measure of the value of properties put under sales contract) as being 2,508 at mid-October 2001 compared with 2,515 a year earlier.
"Certain offices have had a flurry of sales activity," Ms. Botti said. She cited Fort Lee, across the George Washington Bridge from Manhattan. Ms. Botti said there had also been spurts of activity in towns farther away from New York City, like Rumson, which lies south of Red Bank, more than a hour from New York City. Generally, though, residential sales have been strongest in areas closest to New York, she said.
Ms. Botti's company deals mainly with sale of existing homes. Mr. Stefanoni of Pulte described roughly the same pattern of recovery in the market for newly constructed housing. "After a huge slowdown, people are coming back and making purchases," he said, noting that the second week in October set a record for sales at Pulte's three town house developments. "Buying a home is a big decision, not a frivolous decision. People who were in the midst of selling, downsizing or adding to their families -- their lives can't stop, even though the tragedy will never be forgotten."
Mr. Stefanoni and other real estate experts said the state's tight inventory of available housing remains the dominant factor affecting the market. "The fact that interest rates keep going down is a good thing, emotionally," Mr. Stefanoni said. "It makes people think: What better time?"
But he said that at luxury communities like Brettonwoods in Paramus, where the average sales price is in the mid-$500,000's, interest rates do not determine whether a home is affordable. "It's more a question of how much more people will buy, or what luxury items can they install?" 
Ms. Botti, the Weichert vice president, said she was startled by a sudden jump in the number of homes listed with the company in the first half of October. "We're tracking 11 percent more listings than the same period a year ago -- and we've been tracking below the previous year for two and a half years," Ms. Botti said.
She said she could report only that some sellers were confiding that they thought they should put homes on the market now while New Yorkers may be actively considering relocating from the wounded city. "They say, 'I don't know where this is going, but I'm going to get in the market now and see,' " she said.
Of course, even an 11 percent increase in listings won't change the picture much, Ms. Botti observed. "That's equivalent to about two months' standing inventory. At normal levels, a marketplace has about four or five months inventory," but New Jersey has been much tighter than that for some time.
Hundreds of New Jersey residents were killed in the World Trade Center, and Ms. Olcott of Burgdorff noted -- "horrible, but true" -- this may lead to house sales. Ridgewood, like other towns that have traditionally attracted those who commute to Manhattan's financial district, has had a number of terror victims and is expected see such sales, she said. 
But tragedy and encroaching recession are not the only factors at play, Mr. Schweppe asserted. For example, in Montclair, new nonstop rail service to New York City begins operation in January. "New transit options for commuters always provide a boost to a community, and this will certainly provide a buffer against price drops," Mr. Schweppe said.
"The tie to New York is crucial," Mr. Schweppe added, "in ways that are double-edged right now, I guess."

Sharing the Wealth, for Capitalism's Sake

BYLINE:  By WILLIAM J. HOLSTEIN 

 BODY:
 LIKE most people, Diane Coyle was shocked by the terrorist attacks of Sept. 11. But in her new book, "Paradoxes of Prosperity: Why the New Capitalism Benefits All," she describes conditions that, in retrospect, could have invited violence. In a recent telephone interview, Ms. Coyle discussed the implications of the attacks and their aftermath. Following are excerpts from the conversation.
 WILLIAM J. HOLSTEIN

Q. Were the terrorists motivated by more than anti-American ideology?

A. Perhaps we should not have been surprised that the success of capitalism should have also created violent hostility among those who've been left out -- people with no power in the world of international diplomacy. They feel that the squalor and poverty of their lives is something being done to them by those who do have the power.

Q. Do the attacks mean that the West must retreat from open flows of people and goods -- important pieces of globalization?

A. The terrorist attacks make it now a matter of urgency to ensure that as many countries as possible thrive from globalization, and that the top international policy priorities are the reduction of poverty, improvements in health in developing countries, access for poor traders to rich markets and so on. This adds up to more globalization, not a retreat from it.

Q. So somehow the affluent West must do more to extend economic gains?

A. If the benefits are not seen to be spread increasingly fairly, it will not be possible to win a war on terror or isolate nations like Afghanistan and Iraq that breed it. None of us will reap the fruits of prosperity unless all of us do.

Q. Do you think the way the Western nations broadcast their culture helps fuel resentment?

A. There are countries where almost everybody lives in poverty. They can see what is going on in America because of global television. I think it must make people feel powerless. I saw a picture in a magazine recently of an African man who had just bought a pair of beat-up used shoes. He painted the Nike symbol on them. He had seen it somewhere on television. He wanted the same lifestyle and comfort that he'd seen.
At the same time, we put our deepest fears on display in Hollywood movies. The terrorists seem to understand very well how easy it is to make people afraid. It is fear itself that could do the most damage.

Q. Millions of people from those lands have emigrated to the West. Does it now seem like the West will tighten up?

A. It would be damaging and sad. America's fantastic economic strength has been built on drawing in immigrants, with their energy and determination to make a new life. I firmly and passionately believe that diversity of experience is a really important element of economic success. That's why New York and London have been thriving.

Q.. You say the power of governments will wane. Why is the United States assuming more power?

A. I still think there will be a decline in the way governments influence economies. The security issues are separate. It's quite natural that governments should be taking on those responsibilities. I think our concern for our liberties won't allow it to go too far.

Q. Do you feel that the "new economy" can keep moving ahead?

A. The technology is there. The trends toward greater globalization are not going to be put into reverse.

Canadian Company Moves Workers to Purchase

BYLINE:  By Elsa Brenner 

 BODY:
A Canadian company is relocating 90 employees who were displaced on Sept. 11 from 1 Liberty Plaza near the World Trade Center to Purchase.
 The company, RBC Dominion Securities, the investment banking division of RBC Financial Group, formerly Royal Bank of Canada, has taken a long-term lease on space in RiverView at Purchase, said Frank Boccanfuso, the managing partner for FMB Real Estate Services. 
 As many as 200 of the company's employees could move into building at 287 Bowman Avenue until they can return to the bank's New York City offices.
Salvatore J. Carrera, director of economic development and real estate for the county, said other displaced companies have signed leases in Westchester, but he would not identify them. "They don't want any publicity," Mr. Carrerra said.
The Toronto-based company lost four floors of space in New York City. Elsa Brenner

HEADLINE: NEIGHBORHOOD REPORT: ORCHARD BEACH; 
An Aging Beauty Could Get a Needed Nip and a Tuck

BYLINE:  By SETH KUGEL 

 BODY:
Orchard Beach, once famously known as the Riviera of the Bronx, is shrinking. Acres have been lost to erosion since the 1930's, when Robert Moses oversaw the creation of the crescent-shaped beach that gave Bronx residents an accessible summertime retreat. No new sand has been added since 1964. 
 But now, steps are being taken to reverse that loss. The Army Corps of Engineers has completed a plan to bring in 300,000 cubic yards of sand by barge, probably from South Amboy, N.J., to restore the beach. The additional sand would add 12 acres of beach to the current 25 acres at high tide, and eliminate dangerous underwater drop-offs that have also been caused by erosion. 
 The restoration is crucial, said Parks Commissioner Henry J. Stern, because the beach has become more popular in recent years. On summer weekends, the place is so packed that some beachgoers have to set up chairs on the promenade instead of the sand. 
"It's blanket to blanket," said Olga Quintana, describing the summer scene. She should know: a retiree who lives in Soundview, Ms. Quintana visits the beach with friends almost every day, year round. (As temperatures approached 80 degrees on Wednesday, she wore an orange bikini and sported a stellar late-October tan.)
In February, the Army Corps of Engineers will present its plan to rebuild the beach, including economic and environmental impact assessments, to state and local officials. The plan would be submitted for public review in the spring.
Money for the next step, design of the rebuilt beach, is already set aside. The total cost would be $7 million or $8 million, said Anthony Ciorra, project manager for the Corps of Engineers. Some $2 million in federal funds has already been set aside for the construction phase. 
Financing is complicated because the Corps of Engineers cannot use its own money for projects that are mainly recreational, and federal funds must be matched by state and local agencies. 
"This is not a done deal, but I am optimistic," Mr. Ciorra said. Restoration of the beach could begin by September 2003. 
"We want to make it a normal, pretty beach again, the way it was when it was a youngster," Mr. Stern said. "It's certainly showing signs of age, and it's been subject to the ravages of the wind and the waves for two-thirds of a century."
Ms. Quintana and her friends like the plan, although Leo Vazquez, who lives in the north Bronx, and who refers to the beach as the Puerto Rican Riviera, had a few additional suggestions. "It needs some palm trees, and a bar called the Hungry Soldier," said Mr. Vazquez, 75. "That would make you feel like you were in Puerto Rico." SETH KUGEL

HEADLINE: MARKET INSIGHT; 
Anthrax Aside, A Postal Play On Growth

BYLINE:  By KENNETH N. GILPIN 

 BODY:
NINE million jobs. A $900 billion market, representing roughly 8 percent of gross domestic product. 
 Those numbers describe the mailing industry, a business that anthrax in envelopes has suddenly jeopardized. 
 Edward M. Wolfe, a transportation, logistics and supply chain software analyst at Bear, Stearns, talked last week about changing conditions at the United States Postal Service and its competitors. Following are excerpts from the conversation.

Q. What future do you see for the Postal Service?

A. Postal rates will go up some and there will be a major restructuring. Last December, the Postal Board, a group of appointed officials, produced a memo stating for the first time ever that they favored postal deregulation. It needs to be privatized.

Q. Which national postal services have been privatized?

A. The Dutch post office, TPG N.V., which trades as an A.D.R. in this country, and Deutsche Post, which trades on the London and German exchanges. Both were privatized and to some degree deregulated.
And the European Union is considering liberalizing all member post offices. Initially, they plan to open up competition for mail weighing over 150 grams and plan to reduce that figure over time.

Q. Has traffic shifted from the Postal Service toward its competitors?

A. Right now, volumes are extremely weak. That has been the case since December of last year. Since Sept. 11, it has gotten even worse. The service sector, which had held up well before then, was impacted by that event. But we are not seeing a major uptick because people are afraid of using the United States Postal Service. But if the post office shut down, there would be some shifts.
U.P.S. just reported third-quarter air and ground volumes that were down about 3 percent. They are a pretty good indicator of overall economic activity, and because of that I wouldn't be surprised if we saw the economy contract by about that amount.

Q. Do United Parcel Service and Federal Express offer greater security?

A. U.P.S. and FedEx have terrific technology to track their packages. They have tight information and generally know their customers. I don't think FedEx or U.P.S. want to do regular mail, but they do want to do priority or express mail. Both are probably safer than the Postal Service because they have terrific information flow from when the product gets picked up. The Postal Service doesn't always have control over its own product. Historically, they have put it in the belly of a commercial aircraft.

Q. Is a U.P.S. or FedEx jet less susceptible to hijacking than a commercial airliner?

A. They have increased safety regulations since Sept. 11. There is more paperwork, more locking up aircraft on the ground. And there are now major restrictions on who can ride in jump seats in the aircraft. Generally, there are only two or three people on those planes. And they control the freight that goes on the planes. When you are on an airliner, the airliner controls the passengers, but most of the freight comes from other people.
Going forward, there are going to be much greater restrictions on freight moving in the cargo of passenger planes, like 24-hour holdover periods. That will benefit companies like FedEx and U.P.S.

Q. How have transportation companies done since the attacks?

A. They are about where they were before Sept. 11. But I think the stocks are a little bit ahead of themselves because of the weakness in the economy.

Q. How do you see the business evolving?

A. There are a handful of infrastructures for moving parcels and mail: Deutsche Post, which has a majority stake in DHL and many freight forwarders; Federal Express; U.P.S.; TPG; the United States Postal Service, which is a $70-billion-a-year revenue company; and some form of cooperation between other major postal services. Out of this there will be some consolidation.

Q. Who might want to make a purchase?

A. A rumor that has been heating up recently is that DHL is going to buy Airborne Express. That may face some difficulty, because there are regulations preventing foreign ownership of more than 25 percent of an airline. Since it went public, U.P.S. has made a number of small acquisitions. Within the next couple of years, I think they will use their stock or cash to make a large overseas acquisition.

Q. You aren't recommending these stocks now, but which do you like long term?

A. U.P.S. generates the most free cash, followed by TPG and then Federal Express. Long term, I think these are terrific names. They are a play on world trade, which I believe will continue to grow.

HEADLINE: THE AGE OF DISSONANCE; 
Our Town

BYLINE:  By BOB MORRIS 

 BODY:
SOMETIMES, when I get really tired of being concerned and vigilant, or supportive of political leaders whom I otherwise might not support in times of less import, I think back to the good old days in New York before Sept. 11. 
 That was a time when nothing seemed inappropriate in this city. Halloween was a time for giddy satirization of silly current events, and if the holiday was at all threatening, it was because you might get hit with an egg or covered in shaving cream. It doesn't seem fun or threatening now. 
 And the reality TV shows that were such a big deal last year don't seem so gripping. What's the point of "Survivor" and "The Fear Factor" exactly? Isn't making someone eat bugs or lie with rats kind of silly in the context of now? In a new show, "The Amazing Race," perky Americans on a global trek face their scariest moments when their flights are canceled. 
Oh, for the days of the old kind of air rage.
Back then, we lived in a world when no frivolity was too frivolous. We could whine freely about having too many parties to attend. No scandal was too arcane to warrant a line in the gossip columns. In those days we didn't have to apologize for obsessing over celebrity and other silly things. Silly things, after all, like the glossy-magazine industry, awards ceremonies, lavish movie premieres, boutique hotel design and competitive dining were a serious part of the economic life of New York. 
They still are, but we can't quite take them so seriously anymore. 
If you were to go back to the days before, what day would you choose? 
I would choose Sept. 10. It was Fashion Week -- remember? -- and I was more than a little pleased with myself for getting my niece, Madeleine, into the Betsey Johnson show at Tavern on the Green. I have to say, there couldn't have been a prettier venue. The outdoor restaurant was a Seurat-like dapple of light under big trees, and the greenhouse-like room where the show was taking place was a souffle of pretty people.
"Did I tell you how lucky you are to be here?" I asked.
"Yes, two times," said Madeleine, who is 9.
The theme of the collection was La Munequita, which means "little doll" in Spanish, the perfect atmosphere for a 9-year-old's first runway experience. She took in the crowd -- the phalanx of anxious photographers, the department store executives and top editors who cultivate looks that seem to want you to know that looking at clothes is important and serious work.
When the show began, taking things seriously became difficult. As the models strode past in diaphanous skirts and frothy little chiffon tops, Madeleine asked, "Why are they showing their underwear?"
I had taken her to her first fashion show expecting her to be swept up by the whimsy, the glamour, the privilege. All she saw was underwear. I was so miffed I didn't hear her thank me for bringing her.
That night, I went to a fourth-anniversary party for Rocco DiSpirito's restaurant Union Pacific. I talked to a nice, fresh-faced guy from northern Michigan named Bing Brown. It was his very first day living in New York. He had spent it opening a checking account at Citibank and riding his scooter around. Then he found himself at a celebrity chef's party. 
"Wow, is this what New York is going to be like?" Mr. Brown asked. "Are there parties like this all the time?"
I told him yes.
In Thornton Wilder's "Our Town," Emily, a young woman who has died, is given the chance to return to the world for one day, and it ends up being too heartbreaking to bear, the wonder of daily life. "So all that was going on and we never noticed," she says. "Do human beings ever realize life while they live -- every, every minute?"
The last I remember of my former life in our town on Sept. 10, I was leaving the party, mad at myself for drinking too much and eating too many hors d'oeuvres. 
I look back and pine for such meaningless anxieties.
I long for the times when underwear issues mattered, when we could skim the newspapers with the carelessness of the invincible, care about our Halloween plans, and be scared only by what we saw in the movies.
I long for the days when we could take things for granted.
Now we are more aware of everything. Consciousness has a steep price.

The Company Was Downsized. Now You're Upsized.

BYLINE:  By MELINDA LIGOS 

 BODY:
FROM the day he joined UGO Networks nearly three years ago, Alexander Loucopoulos relied on the company's sales director for guidance on moving ahead in his career. 
 Mr. Loucopoulos moved up the corporate ladder, all right -- into the position of his mentor, who was one of 40 employees laid off early this month in a third round of job cuts since last year by UGO, an online entertainment company. Actually, Mr. Loucopoulos, who was hired to help raise venture capital, took over two jobs; he is now a senior director in charge of both sales and strategic planning. 
 Although his friend found another job quickly, the incident was emotionally draining. "This guy and I were, and still are, very close," said Mr. Loucopoulos, 27, of Manhattan. 
Career experts say his experience reflects a trend: as the economy weakens, more employers will tighten their work forces, and many of the remaining employees will find themselves catapulted into the jobs of their bosses, or even their bosses' bosses.
"When you cut so many people, somebody's got to step in and pick up some of the slack," said Barry Lawrence, senior career adviser at CareerBuilders, a Web site for job seekers that is based in Reston, Va. Nearly 60 percent of the 1,200 full-time workers it surveyed in August said their workloads had increased within the last six months because of layoffs.
While those who survive the corporate ax may find career opportunities, they may also face potential problems.
First is the issue of money. Even though they may receive fancy new titles, some people promoted during these tough times may not receive fatter paychecks. Mr. Loucopoulos, for one, said he did not get a raise after his promotion, although he was given stock.
Danielle Rampino, 23, was promoted recently to account manager from customer service representative at a New England manufacturing company that she declined to identify. She said she did not dare to ask for more money. "Salaries have been cut, so a raise is out of the question," she said. Her promotion came after the company laid off 11 percent of its workers in a third wave of cuts last month.
SUCH situations are all too common, said Bill Coleman, vice president for compensation at Salary.com in Wellesley, Mass., which tracks pay. "It's very awkward for companies to hand out raises after they've just canned people or handed out pay cuts," he said. "So people are getting lots of new responsibilities but taking home the same money."
Although the newly promoted may not care to seek more money now, they may want to revisit the subject with their superiors later, as financial conditions improve, career experts say. They recommend keeping a record of accomplishments -- listing sales totals, for example, or new business brought in. 
They also suggest that instead of requesting raises, employees can initially seek other perks and benefits -- perhaps an extra week of vacation or partial tuition reimbursement, if outside training is needed for their future work.
Even more unsettling for some promoted workers are the reactions of others. "If the person you're replacing was well liked and seen as more experienced, you're going to have a huge challenge on your hands," said Emory Mulling, chairman of the Mulling Companies, an outplacement firm in Atlanta. "People won't feel like you deserve the job."
Peggy Klaus, a career coach in Berkeley, Calif., said that one of her clients, a bank executive, had that experience after her recent promotion to vice president. The woman's 30 new subordinates were not only furious that their old boss had been fired but also skeptical about their new boss's ability to handle the job.
"Pretty soon, they were undermining her authority every chance they could get," Ms. Klaus said. Some subordinates made important decisions without consulting her, while others were downright rude, she said.
Ms. Klaus advised her client to call her new team together for a frank conversation. "I call it 'acknowledging the pink elephant in the room,' " Ms. Klaus said. "If you don't let people air their grievances and fears, then you give them license to go around spending an inordinate time whining about it at the water cooler."
Once the new vice president allowed her employees to open up about why they felt resentful, Ms. Klaus said, they became more comfortable with her.
Mr. Loucopoulos used a similar strategy to win over his five employees after his promotion. "I took the tack of overcommunication," said Mr. Loucopoulos, who has watched his company shrink to 35 employees from 240. "I let them know I felt bad, too, about these people leaving. I think my openness resonated with them."
Perhaps the biggest problem for layoff survivors who are promoted is that many do not receive the training or resources needed to succeed in their new positions. After all, the people most equipped to train them, their predecessors, are gone.
Ms. Rampino said that when she recently asked her superiors for help in figuring out what prices to quote her customers, her request fell on deaf ears. Her manager was too overloaded with work to help. One associate said he could not assist her, but offered the name of his golf pro in the event she wanted to play a few rounds with clients. "That was real helpful," she said.
Because she has received so little training, she has had to learn her new job through trial and error, she said. For example, she said she did not know that it was customary for account managers to pad the shipping deadline by several days. "I had no idea that the production floor was accustomed to completing the product later than the due date shown in the system," she said.
As a result, Ms. Rampino said, she stayed at work on one recent night until after 10 p.m. to ensure that an order was completed, then delivered it to the customer the next morning. "I am trying to pretend as best as I can that this is my job," she said.
Ms. Rampino said she was considering leaving the company and enrolling in an M.B.A. program so she could develop the skills to become an account manager. "I just don't have the resources I need to be good at this job," she said.
Of course, not all promoted employees have to fend for themselves. At HighPoint Solutions, a World Wide Web development company in Tacoma, Wash., three people who were promoted recently, after a hiring freeze, were paired with mentors to help them learn their new jobs. One such worker was Nicole Fritts, 20, of Lakewood, Wash., who joined the company in June 2000 as a receptionist. In June 2001, she became an associate producer.
"Being a producer was a future goal, but I never expected to be promoted this quickly," said Ms. Fritts, who handled client billing and other administrative tasks before tackling the new job. Now she works side by side with clients daily, helping them to develop strategies for new Web sites.
To smooth the transition, Steven Brock, the chief executive, first let Ms. Fritts sit in on client team meetings. After a few weeks, she began participating in brainstorming sessions to help clients work out new marketing plans. "I just kept my eyes and ears open and really paid attention to how our producers interacted with clients," she said. She also made a habit of reading industry trade publications. Eventually, Mr. Brock gave Ms. Fritts her own clients, although he continued to pair her with more senior producers to hone her skills.
"Everyone here has made it clear I can come to them with any question," she said. "That's helped a lot."
ANYONE without a mentor should find one, career experts say. "Take company executives out to lunch and ask them as many questions as possible," Ms. Klaus said. "Grill them about their successes and failures, as well as company politics that you might not be aware of."
If there is no one available at work, consider joining a local trade organization, she added. "Get coaching from as many people as you can," she said.
The payoff can be significant. Although his promotion was bittersweet, Mr. Loucopoulos said he thought it had helped his career. In addition to managing a sales team, he works directly with the chief executive to explore new business partnerships and strategies. "I've gained more confidence and all kinds of managerial skills," he said. "And I'm helping create a vision for this company. This is big, big stuff."

HEADLINE: URBAN TACTICS; 
A Lost City, Reborn for Now

BYLINE:  By ERIKA KINETZ 

 BODY:
NEW YORK is forever disappearing. We live amid many lost cities: F. Scott Fitzgerald's glittering, white boomtown. E. B. White's hot, haunting August of 1948. The small society of the midcentury eccentric Joe Gould. Dan Wakefield's Greenwich Village of the 50's.
 There's also that perennial vision of a livable place with quiet museum galleries and uncrowded sidewalks, where it's easy to get a good seat at the movies. That city always seems just out of reach. 
 It's hard to say exactly when it disappeared, or whether it ever really existed. Certainly, the advent of the blockbuster art exhibition in the 1970's forever altered the museum experience. With the decrease in crime of the last decade, and a booming economy, the world came rushing into New York, especially tourists, both domestic and foreign. According to NYC & Company, the convention and visitors bureau, more than 37 million people visited the city last year, up from about 23 million in 1991. 
But, now, at certain moments -- not always and not everywhere -- it is possible to find that lost, livable place.
At first the darkened theaters, the shuttered museums and hushed streets brought about by the events of Sept. 11 came as a rebuke. Now, the emptiness is not quite so stark. It seems, instead, like a sudden expanse. The crowds are escapable. The noise sometimes disappears. For a brief interlude, the city has returned to roughly habitable dimensions. It comes in flashes, this more nimble city, which has been relieved -- at horrible cost -- of the weight of tourism.
There is room once again for wonder, especially at art museums. Last Wednesday, 8,600 people visited the Metropolitan Museum of Art, down from 12,000 a year ago. In the previous fiscal year, nearly 1.3 million people visited the Museum of Modern Art, an average of 3,530 a day. Since Sept. 11, average daily attendance has fallen by 40 percent (although the new Giacometti exhibition has buoyed the numbers). At the Frick Collection, which drew 290,000 visitors last year, attendance has dropped by 30 to 40 percent.
Since the observation deck at the Empire State Building reopened on Sept. 29, weekend attendance has been off 30 percent.
Last weekend, the Pieter Bruegel exhibit at the Met was packed, but the European galleries weren't. No one was looking at the Fragonards. Caravaggio's ripe young musicians played in an empty room. The climate-control system hummed. It was so quiet that a woman could be heard clearing her throat.
In the museum's Robert Lehman wing, the strange elation of silence grew. Seven lonely chairs sat before a wall lined with paintings by Bonnard, Braque, Chagall, van Gogh, Gauguin and Vuillard. No one looked on Degas's rooftops or Cezanne's naked trees lining the road to Tholonet. The Renoirs had been abandoned.
Outside, there was not much pedestrian traffic in Central Park, despite the magnificence of the day. An occasional horse-drawn carriage clopped by. Sheep Meadow was dotted with sparse clusters of people, which only seemed to highlight the vastness of the green expanse. Sounds seemed to come as if from a distance: the merry-go-round, the children, the radios, the laughter and recriminations of strangers.
Downtown, at the Museum of Jewish Heritage, at 1 Battery Park Plaza, visitors were greeted by a passage from Deuteronomy: "Remember. Never Forget." Voices from the past bounced around the deserted galleries.
"It's eerie," said Thomas Vinson, a photographer who lives on the Upper West Side and visited the museum one day last week. "When you walk out of a little room into a hallway and all you see is a security guard, it reinforces the solemnity. It's double-edged. It's good, but the reason it's like that is bad."
Nearby, Battery Park was heavy with history but otherwise empty. Beneath an enormous Apple Computer advertisement featuring images of Churchill, Martin Luther King Jr., Gandhi and Franklin D. Roosevelt, visitors could look on the Statue of Liberty in solitude. Ellis Island was dark. All that could be heard was the slow traffic of boats and the even slap of the sea.
Last week, a person could also hear the ticking of the 18th-century mantle clock in the library of the Frick Collection.
"We've been wanting to come here for a long time," said Joe Pantigoso, who was at the museum with his wife, Jane King. The couple, who live on the Upper West Side, had recently visited the American Museum of Natural History, which normally throbs with children.
"It was empty," Ms. King said. "We were with our daughter, and she could run around."
Her husband, a marketing executive, added: "It's better for New Yorkers. Every place has become more like the Frick. You can take your time without having to fight for space in front of a painting."
On Monday evening, a thin stream of people could be seen heading east over the Brooklyn Bridge. Among them was Leslie Farrar, wearing business clothes and sneakers, who first had walked the three miles from her job in Lower Manhattan to her home in Cobble Hill on Sept. 11. "I felt like a refugee," she said of that first trip. "Then I realized it wasn't such a bad commute."
The bike lane was, miraculously, free of people taking photographs. "There's less tourists, less gawking," said Albert Stern, an editor who has been walking over the bridge from his Water Street office to his Boerum Hill home for three and a half years.
 NEW YORK has become a place where it is possible to simply show up, buy a ticket and walk into a theater. On Tuesday, 20 minutes before curtain, only two-thirds of the tickets to New York City Opera's production of "Macbeth," with the soprano Lauren Flanigan as Lady Macbeth, had been sold. The night before, it was possible to arrive at 7:42 for a 7:45 showing of "Bread and Tulips," a gentle Italian comedy at the little Quad Cinema on West 13th Street, buy some Jujyfruits and get an excellent seat. With only 18 people, the audience was small enough for camaraderie. A slow night in the old world might have drawn at least 25 people.
There was also camaraderie in the elevator of the Empire State Building, which reopened its observatory full time on Monday. "Let's not talk about scary," a woman said. At the 50th floor, ears began to pop. A man extolled the benefits of skyscrapers in Minnesota. "They're three stories tall," he said, laughing.
The wind on the observation deck was vicious. Beneath the night sky, the city spread out her jewels.
Conversation hummed along in German, French, Spanish, English and Japanese: Where's Brooklyn? Is that Times Square? Is that Broadway? Remember Godzilla? Look, they're still smoking.
The sky was big. Airplanes passed nearly at eye level. After Pearl Harbor, volunteer "spotters" were stationed on the observation deck of the Empire State Building, part of a network that tracked airplanes as they flew over the city's blacked-out streets. Watching the planes fly past the moon, it was hard not to think of the spotters and even harder not to envy them. They knew what they were looking for.

HEADLINE: New Yorkers on Welfare 

 BODY:
To the Editor:
Since we are currently witnessing the greatest outpouring of altruism in our country's history, it strikes us as tragic that 50,000 of New York State's poorest residents will have their cash welfare benefits terminated in December (editorial, Oct. 25).
 A hundred thousand jobs have been lost, and the economy is facing a serious recession. 
Are we to expect that moving people off welfare now will have a benign effect on their lives? 
 We fear that terminating benefits will result in destabilizing families, increasing homelessness and adding to the foster care rolls. Given the cooperation between the city, the state and the federal government in light of the disaster, it is reasonable to expect our elected leaders to find a way to put a moratorium on welfare time limits. Calling for a smoother transition to a so-called safety-net program is simply not adequate.

HEADLINE: PORTFOLIOS, ETC.; 
Looking for Hints in the Treasury's Next Move

BYLINE:  By JONATHAN FUERBRINGER 

 BODY:
ON Wednesday, when the details of the next quarterly auction of government securities are announced, the Treasury should offer some hints about how it will handle the swing from huge government budget surpluses to none at all. But the Treasury is not expected to make any drastic changes in the way it does business.
 For one thing, the Treasury is assuming that any budget deficits will be temporary. If surpluses return in future years, the need for increased borrowing wouldn't last long. 
 That assumption is partly political. But it is too soon for the Treasury to decide otherwise, with forecasters expecting the economy to recover sometime next year. The Treasury also does not want to do anything that might send longer-term interest rates higher and thus hinder the prospects foreconomic recovery.
Peter R. Fisher, the undersecretary of the Treasury for domestic finance, noted happily last week that the threat of additional borrowing by the Treasury had not yet pushed longer-term rates higher.
"My own reading of the yield curve gives me cause for optimism, not pessimism," he said in a speech in New York. "Ten-year yields are lower now than they were in August, so we have not seen any backup in long-term rates that might suggest anxiety about our long-run fiscal prospects." He also said the additional borrowing would "easily be absorbed by our capital markets."
Treasury officials are not talking on the record about their thinking before the announcement, scheduled for Wednesday, on the quarterly auction of 5-year and 10-year notes on Nov. 6 and 7. But it appears that the announcement will set in motion a plan to cover as much as $300 billion in extra borrowing by selling additional Treasury bills and short-term notes, like the two-year note.
The size of the monthly two-year note auction has already been increased to $19 billion from $10 billion in May. And the weekly auctions of six-month Treasury bills have jumped to $17.8 billion from $13.6 billion during that time. The Treasury has also begun selling a new four-week bill -- $8 billion of them last week.
Because of this additional short-term borrowing, the size of the five-year note auction will rise just $1 billion or $2 billion above the $13 billion in May. The 10-year note auction will be around $5 billion, less than the expected $10 billion because of the unscheduled auction on Oct. 4 of $6 billion of additional 10-year notes. That was done to relieve distortions in the Treasury market in the wake of the terrorist attacks on Sept. 11.
In addition, the Treasury is expected to continue buying back longer-term debt, although the total may decline each year. Those buybacks, suspended in September because of the disruption in bond market trading, resumed on Oct. 18.
Concentrating its borrowing in shorter-term securities fits well with two Treasury goals. One is to try to move the average maturity of the government debt back toward five years. As government deficits declined and became surpluses, the Treasury reduced its borrowing, and many of those cutbacks were in short-term securities. So the average maturity of government debt is now six years.
Another goal is to reduce the cost of borrowing for the taxpayer over time. Issuing Treasury bills with yields just over 2 percent and two-year notes with yields of 2.6 percent should do that. Selling two-year notes now also fills a void in 2003 and 2004, when the amount of maturing government debt is due to decline.
The yield on the 10-year note, now 4.52 percent, is near its 1998 low of 4.16 percent, and some people may say that such low longer-term interest rates should be locked in for future savings. But Louis Crandall, chief economist at Wrightson Associates, said greater long-term savings could be achieved using lower-yielding maturities, especially if the return to government deficits is brief.
James R. Capra, president of Capra Asset Management and chairman of the Treasury's debt advisory committee, agreed. "The short-term debt is cheaper and there is no urgency to make major adjustments," he said.

HEADLINE: Magazines Fly the Flag Offering Upbeat Chic 

BYLINE:  By RUTH LA FERLA 

 BODY:
IN the editor's letter she plans to put in the December issue of Harper's Bazaar, which will appear on newsstands the middle of next month, Glenda Bailey, the new editor in chief, asks pointedly, "What is it we're supposed to feel for fashion right now?"
 It's a question she and her peers in magazine publishing are asking, along with designers, retailers and readers: what is the appropriate response of fashion when world events seem to render its normal concerns petty or escapist? Putting it bluntly, how can one think of being chic at such a time? 
 For Ms. Bailey, the issue is even more pressing than for others, since she arrived at Bazaar only in June, charged with making over the magazine at a difficult moment for it and many of its competitors. Hit hard by a faltering economy and a growing disenchantment among readers, Bazaar has had a significant drop in circulation and newsstand sales. 
Now many consumers, anxious and vulnerable at a time of national crisis, are placing fashion ever lower on their roster of priorities. Industry watchers point out that even the most devout readers of America's scented style bibles may find themselves wondering whether the magazines bear relevance to their lives. "The magazines have been living on borrowed time," said Simon Doonan, the creative director of Barneys New York. "The consumer wants to be intrigued, and she hasn't been a bit."
The response to Ms. Bailey's question is evident in the November fashion magazines now on newsstands and in the plans of editors for future issues. It is nearly unanimous: this is no time for sackcloth and ashes. Readers are being served a large helping of upbeat escapism, wrapped in red, white and blue, its visual content bearing no more relation to their lives than Bali does to Queens.
"The most important part of my job," Ms. Bailey said last week, "is to reflect what the reader wants. My vision of giving her what she wants is to send her the very best fashion and beauty that addresses the need for pure fantasy. What she wants, now more than ever, is to live in the moment."
For her December issue she plans a cover with Meg Ryan posed against an American flag. An article titled "Rock Stars," photographed by Hiro, will lavishly showcase what Ms. Bailey called "diamonds to desire -- very fantasy-inducing, very luxurious and very beautiful."
In the November Vogue, meanwhile, models cavort gamely, their smiles cheerily vacant as they show off clothes that only a well-dressed sylph might wear. Rather than being dressed in black, the chic color this fall even before it became a season of mourning, the models are vividly decked out in red, white and blue -- designers' hopeful colors for spring, accessorized with American flags pinned to sleeves and lapels.
The magazine seems intent on helping readers rationalize a lust for over-the-knee calfskin boots, envelope bags and gilt charm bracelets. Even in moments of great stress, Anna Wintour, the editor in chief, writes in the issue, "fashion is essential in these difficult times, paradoxically, to keep us in touch with our dreamy, fanciful, self-pleasing natures."
Last week, in an interview, Ms. Wintour said, "I don't think any of us can pretend we are feeling it's business as usual." And the November issue, adroitly revamped in the days after Sept. 11, includes an obituary of Berry Berenson, the fashion icon who perished on American Airlines Flight 11, and a profile of Dr. Bernadine Healy, the president of the American Red Cross, who is photographed at ground zero, a grieved expression on her face.
But tellingly, the new fashion features hurriedly conceived to capture the moment all strike a resolutely upbeat chord. On the Vogue cover Britney Spears stretches languorously atop the Stars and Stripes, a pose that Ms. Wintour said is meant to evoke Betty Grable rallying the troops in World War II. "We acted on pure instinct and decided to jump in as fast as we could," she said.
Inside, Vogue's fashion pages promote Americana. A portfolio featuring the Seventh Avenue spring collections includes an image of a model encased in a Calvin Klein corset, posed against a Manhattan skyline and robustly waving a flag. Future issues, Ms. Wintour said, will continue to replace dour gray and black with clothes that are colorful and fanciful.
Similarly, the editors of W pulled together a 12-page portfolio, a portrait of Manhattan viewed through the lenses of its fashion photographers, some reflecting patriotic themes, like an American flag draped over a pickup truck. "We wanted to respond to the moment in a manner that was provocative but not sentimental or false," said Dennis Freedman, the magazine's creative director.
Gilles Bensimon, the publication director of Elle, professed a reluctance to tug at readers' hearts in an obvious or calculated manner. "Who is editing these magazines, Norman Rockwell?" he said.
Readers, he cautioned, are quick to see though such ploys, the reason he said Elle prefers a more subtle approach. All the same, its current cover includes a postage-stamp-size American flag above the legend "United We Stand," an echo of Vogue's cover from July 1942, which had the same slogan.
Fashion magazines have traditionally operated in a hothouse climate, one in which staff members meet covenlike in posh conference rooms, debating such arcana as the shape of a sleeve, the width of a cuff or the optimum height for a Cossack hat. In her November editor's letter, the first Ms. Bailey wrote at Bazaar, where she in the process of a months-long retinkering of the magazine, she declared, "Our aim is to share the thrill of finding the ultimate handbag, or the perfect shoe."
It's an open question whether, in the current world, that thrill can still make women's hearts race. Fashion magazines have been been "talking mostly to themselves," said Mr. Doonan of Barney's, offering consumers little more than a parade of models -- "Jane Birkin wannabes, who look hit on the head with a frying pan."
"That vacant approach has lost its resonance completely," he said.
Ms. Bailey, who arrived at Bazaar after a successful run as editor of the more populist Marie Claire, began putting her stamp on her new magazine in the November issue, with such signature features as a detailed peek into the closets of four real women, under the headline "What Does Your Style Reveal About You?"
For the December issue she assigned an essay, "Getting On With It," on how to live with fear. But the visual content, she promised, will offer readers flights of fancy. "That's what you come to Bazaar for," she said. "Beautiful images which really are inspiring."
"If I were editing a fashion magazine now," said Marian McEvoy, the editor in chief of House Beautiful, "I would keep away from kitsch, camp and vulgarity and humanize the way fashions are shown." Ms. McEvoy, a former editor at Elle and W, envisions articles that take readers into the homes of fashion designers, affording intimate glimpses of their lives. "I want to see Ralph Lauren in his bedroom slippers before a fire," she said, "and Miuccia Prada and her husband cooking penne in their kitchen in Milan."
As for fashion, "it has to be more comfortable, that's for sure," Ms. McEvoy said, "but that doesn't mean more casual or sad."
"Once people get over the shock and the feeling that they have to sacrifice something," she said, "they will want to give themselves a treat. Women don't like to suffer too much or too long." 
She might have been describing Helen Schifter, a New York social figure. "Fashion magazines make a good break from other, intense, reading," Ms. Schifter said. "A good antidote to bitter times, and in some strange way a reminder that life goes on."

HEADLINE: MARKET WATCH; 
The Risk Of Not Weighing Risk

BYLINE:  By GRETCHEN MORGENSON 

 BODY:
CERTAIN that government stimulus and multiple interest rate cuts will put the steel back into stock prices, bullish strategists are advising investors to buy now so that they won't miss the inevitable and imminent turn. Never mind that many of these brokerage-firm carnival barkers have been predicting the end of the bear market since the Federal Reserve began its easing action in January.
 Typically, stocks do begin to recover well before an impaired economy does. Since 1960, according to statisticians at Standard & Poor's, the stock market has bottomed, on average, seven months after a recession has begun. But averages can be deceiving. While the market bottomed just three months after the 1990 recession started, it took 13 months of recession before stocks started their recovery from the 1980-81 downturn. 
 Like Leo Tolstoy's unhappy families, every slump is different. And the terror attacks will give this recession a nature all its own. That's because corporate earnings, already in decline, will be further stunted by the increased costs associated with life among the terrorists. 
Investors do not yet seem focused on how much higher the costs of doing business will be in the harrowing new world. Soon, they will have to be.
Even before Sept. 11, insurance costs were on the rise. The business is extremely cyclical: prices fall when insurers try to gain market share and rise when they try to bolster their profits. Add to this the not-yet-measurable costs of increased security and you have a big drag on earnings. 
Alice Cornish, an analyst at Prudential Securities in Boston, has done a thorough analysis of the higher costs to cover risk that American companies will face in coming months. Those costs will not be clear until the government decides how much of the bill for Sept. 11 it will pay and how much it will make insurance companies cover. Still, Ms. Cornish expects pretax profits for the companies in the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index will drop by an average 2.5 percent in 2002 because of higher insurance prices.
"There is a very high probability that the insurance market next year will be the most difficult ever for finding affordable coverage," Ms. Cornish said. Why? Corporations will not only find insurance more expensive to secure, they will also have to agree to higher deductibles.
FOR years, companies have enjoyed low insurance costs. In 1999, premiums were lower than they were in 1984, Ms. Cornish pointed out. Earlier this year, they began to rise. Technology companies, for example, started experiencing large jumps in professional liability insurance, like directors' and officers' insurance, which is used to cover the costs of shareholder lawsuits.
Ms. Cornish has assessed the likely rise in several industries' cost of covering risk next year. Costs include business interruption and property insurance, workers' compensation premiums and payments for consulting services. 
The results vary widely. While Ms. Cornish estimates that such costs will rise 36.6 percent at communications services concerns, pretax earnings should decline, at most, by only 2.3 percent. But at health care companies, whose risk costs are already high, costs may jump 35.5 percent, causing an 11.5 percent hit to pretax earnings. 
Increased costs will also drag down earnings at cyclical consumer companies, like car makers and appliance manufacturers, where earnings could decline as much as 8.2 percent, and makers of consumer staples -- food companies -- which could see their pretax profits fall 5.4 percent.
Although Ms. Cornish reckons that technology companies' costs of risk will rise 44.1 percent next year, they are starting from a very low base and will have a muted impact on profits. Financial companies are in similar circumstances, she said. 
Some companies will be hurt more than others, because risks vary. But Ms. Cornish said: "Insurance premiums now need to return to a level more commensurate with the risk. Sept. 11 has influenced this perception."

HEADLINE: INVESTING WITH/Peter J. Quinn; 
UAM Clipper Focus Portfolio

BYLINE:  By CAROLE GOULD 

 BODY:
PETER J. QUINN, co-manager of the $250 million UAM Clipper Focus Portfolio, calls himself a contrarian investor.
 "We look for companies that are out of favor for what we believe are temporary reasons," Mr. Quinn, 40, said from his office in Beverly Hills, Calif. 
 The strategy has helped the fund return 14.3 percent a year, on average, for the three years through Thursday, compared with 4.1 percent for its peers in the large value category and 2.2 percent for the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index, according to Morningstar Inc. For the last 12 months, the fund ranked No. 1 among 785 large value funds by returning 20.1 percent, versus an average loss of 4.9 percent for the group and a decline of 18.4 percent for the S.& P. 500. 
Mr. Quinn also manages about $3 billion in institutional accounts for Pacific Financial Research, the fund's investment adviser. Pacific Financial Research was acquired in 1997 by United Asset Management, which in turn was acquired last year by Old Mutual P.L.C., a financial services group based in London. 
He works with four other co-managers and two equity analysts to pick the fund's 25 to 40 stocks from among 800 or so companies with market capitalization of $2 billion or more.
In one computer screen, he looks for companies that have repurchased 3 percent or more of their shares in the last 12 months.
"This is a way that management can demonstrate its willingness to invest in the current infrastructure," he said.
Another screen seeks low ratios of price to free cash flow, going back as far as 10 years. Free cash flow measures how much a company can earn after it reinvests what is needed to expand its business, he said. "We look beyond accounting earnings to determine the real profitability of a business," he added.
Still other screens measure debt levels and revenue streams. He hopes to find companies whose operating earnings may be temporarily depressed because of new product introductions, for example, or capital investments.
Two of the fund's co-managers research companies that emerge from the screens. One aims to prove that a stock is worth buying, Mr. Quinn said; the other tries to discredit the idea. Then they average their estimates of the stock's intrinsic value, based on the company's cash flow over five years. If the shares sell for a discount of at least 30 percent to that figure, the fund buys the stock. Shares are sold if they rise to the intrinsic value.
Falling stock prices after Sept. 11 led Mr. Quinn to buy shares in United Technologies, whose units include Pratt & Whitney, the jet engine manufacturer; Otis, the elevator company; and Carrier, the air-conditioner maker.
"We're very comfortable with how management allocates capital," he said. It makes significant share repurchases, he added, and reinvests to enhance the company's dominant market positions.
The fund paid an average of $46.30 a share for the stock; it closed on Friday at $57.01. He calculates its intrinsic value at $65.
Mr. Quinn began buying shares of American Express, the financial, banking and travel services giant, at an average of $34.78 in March and has been adding to the stake. "This is a company with a very strong global franchise and an extremely valuable brand name," he said.
Because the company is somewhat dependent on travel, he added, valuations became attractive as the economy slowed.
On Friday, the shares closed at $30.72; he says their intrinsic value is $50.
He also likes Pitney Bowes, which offers mailing products and services.
"The company has done reasonably well in past economic times because it has high recurring revenue streams," he said, partly because many of its products are leased rather than sold outright. Management controls costs aggressively, he said, and is benefiting from lower interest rates.
The fund bought shares in October 2000 at an average of $27.64; they closed on Friday at $34.91. He puts their intrinsic value at $45.

With Aircraft Idle, Income Reads Zero

BYLINE:  By MICHELINE MAYNARD 

 BODY:
THE roar of propellers and the whir of chopper blades have returned to airfields, heliports and landing pads across much of the country as the federal government has gradually eased a blanket ban on small aircraft enforced in the weeks immediately after Sept. 11. "Much," however, is the operative word.
 In 30 major cities, a wide range of small aircraft, from blimps to traffic-monitoring helicopters, remain grounded. And in New York, Boston and Washington, no-flight zones remain in force for all small private aircraft. Some restrictions may be made permanent, to help minimize the chance of airborne terrorism. 
 Most people, especially in congested parts of the Northeast, may not have noticed far fewer small aircraft buzzing about, save for police, military and medical emergency helicopters. But the small-aircraft segment of the aviation industry has taken a terrific blow. 
From Maine to the Washington suburbs of Virginia, the no-fly order has cost private pilots and companies hundreds of millions of dollars in lost business. And it has rendered largely useless the helicopters that many big companies keep for ferrying executives from urban meetings to suburban outposts and back.
No longer can Donald Trump's helicopter whisk him from one of Manhattan's three heliports to his Atlantic City casinos; instead, Mr. Trump, along with hundreds of other executives, must now deal with clogged streets and highways like everyone else. Trips from Manhattan to suburbs in New Jersey or Westchester County, which took 15 minutes or less by helicopter, can now take two hours or more.
"You have a whole lot of irritated C.E.O.'s," said the vice president of finance for a Fortune 500 corporation based in New Jersey, who asked that neither his name nor that of his firm be used. "It really brings the great ones down to the level of the rest of us."
Manhattan's downtown heliport, now basically idle, reported 28,692 takeoffs and landings last year, an average of 78 a day, according to the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey. Companies with helicopters based at the heliport include DHL and Dow Jones; dozens of others rented helicopter services at the site.
From there, Washington is less than an hour away by helicopter, said Phillip M. Ozenick Jr., chief executive of Heliflite Inc. of Fort Worth, a seller of fractional helicopter ownerships, similar to the time-share deals for business jets. Prices for a big, twin-engine Bell helicopter with a pilot and co-pilot start at just under $500,000 a year for a one-sixteenth share, including maintenance and 50 flying hours a year -- enough for 25 round trips between Manhattan and Washington.
Before the attacks, Mr. Ozenick's company did 95 percent of its East Coast business in and out of Manhattan. His corporate customers, whom he declined to identify, travel not only for business, but to weekend homes in the Hamptons, New England and Virginia. "They've been greatly inconvenienced," Mr. Ozenick said. But he said he had not heard whining about it. "These are pretty extenuating circumstances. Everybody has been pretty patient."
THE Manhattan heliports contribute $140 million to the New York economy each year, according to the Port Authority. In the five days immediately after Sept. 11, helicopter operators around the country lost $30 million, said the Helicopter Association International, a trade association representing 3,000 corporate helicopter operators worldwide. The group did not have an estimate for total losses since the attacks, but said New York helicopter operators lost about $6 million.
"One thing that's been brought out from this terrible tragedy is how much the country depends on general aviation," including helicopters, said Roy D. Resavage, the association's president. He expressed frustration at the continued restrictions.
"There's been a lot of aircraft left on the ground for a long time, and we don't understand how it increases security and safety," he said. 
Continued appeals by lobbying groups to the Federal Aviation Administration, Congress and the Transportation Department have achieved some results. The F.A.A. was working Friday on a proposal that would lift most small-aircraft restrictions in cities except for New York, Washington and Boston. If security officials approved, a phase-in could begin as early as this week.
The decisions in these cases, federal officials say, are up to the National Security Council and federal law enforcement agencies. And with new anthrax scares spreading, war in Afghanistan and other national concerns, restrictions on private aviation are hardly considered an issue of vital importance.
"My sense is that it's not the No. 1, 2, 3 or 4 priority," said Kevin Mitchell, president of the Business Travel Coalition, which represents corporate travelers, including those on private planes.
Bruce McNeely, senior vice president of aircraft management services at Jet Service International, said, "The N.S.C. and the other agencies don't really understand general aviation." His company operates at Teterboro Airport in New Jersey, 15 miles from Manhattan.
The restrictions have prompted Steven P. Bussmann, of Manassas, Va., to consider abandoning his fledgling aviation business. During the summer, Mr. Bussmann, 44, spent $500,000 on a used helicopter and put it into service flying aerial photographers over Washington. He had hoped to clear $10,000 a month this fall, when skies are generally clear and the autumn colors spectacular.
But he has not flown since Sept. 9, the date of his last job. And with no sense of when officials may lift the restrictions, he said, "It would make better sense to cut my losses, sell my aircraft and shut down."
THE restrictions obviously have the biggest impact in the Northeast, where more than 10,000 private plane and helicopter flights originated from the Boston, New York and Washington airports in August, or one-seventh of the national total. But pilots elsewhere are hurting, too.
The plane that Wade Goetz rents to Denver broadcasters for traffic reports has been grounded since the attacks, costing him $10,000 a month in income. Mr. Goetz, the owner of Altitudes Flight Training in Englewood, Colo., also trains pilots for the Air Force Academy. Commanders there interceded with the government, obtaining an exemption for him so the training could continue.
Before the attacks, Mr. Goetz had been thinking of expanding his fleet by 25 to 35 planes, from his current 48, so that he could pick up more Air Force business. But given the restrictions still in place on other types of aircraft, he fears even tighter limits if there is another terrorist attack.
"I'm 40 years old, I've finally made a few dollars, and now I'm looking at it and doubting myself," he said. If his aircraft were grounded again for a lengthy period, he said, "I'd go bankrupt."
Even pilots whose aircraft have not been grounded are worried about the possible long-term economic impact of the restrictions. 
The limits at various East Coast airports have forced Jack Roush, an automobile racing executive based in Plymouth, Mich., to divert to locations he would not normally use for his fleet, which includes three Boeing 727 jets and a half-dozen smaller aircraft. For Mr. Roush, his drivers and crew, using the highways is too impractical and time-consuming to reach the Nascar, truck and other races in which his business, Roush Racing, competes. In his opinion, the limits must be lifted at all airports, and on all types of craft, if the country is to rebound.
"As a practical matter, we have to have the airways open to make our economy work," he said. "If we don't have people like myself and businesses like mine moving our people around, we stop spending money and then we stop being competitive."

HEADLINE: This Mr. Sunshine Sees More Rain 

BYLINE:  By ALEX BERENSON 

 BODY:
DOUGLAS R. CLIGGOTT, the senior stock market strategist at J. P. Morgan Securities, is a born optimist.
 At 44, Mr. Cliggott, peppers his conversations with "Cool!" and "O.K.," and when he ends a call with "Great to talk to you," he sounds as if he means it. Asked what part of the workweek he likes best, he replies: "Fridays are my favorite. I shouldn't say that. No, I like all the days" -- without self-consciousness. 
 But Mr. Cliggott, who forecasts the equity market's direction for J. P. Morgan Securities, the investment banking arm of J. P. Morgan Chase, is anything but cheery about stocks. Since the spring of 2000, he has been more pessimistic about corporate earnings and the stock market than just about any other strategist. With the average stock in the Standard & Poor's 500 down about 30 percent over that span, his worries have proved all too real. 
Now, with stocks trying to rally for the third time this year, Mr. Cliggott is again warning his clients to be cautious. The market's recovery in the last month puzzles him. He believes that investors are underestimating how far corporate earnings will fall in the next few months and overestimating the speed at which they will recover.
His concerns increased on Sept. 11, though he has not tried to quantify the effect that further terrorist violence might have on the economy or on stocks -- the risk of more attacks is simply unknowable, he said. But by forcing businesses and the government to spend more money on security and defense, the attacks will probably slow economic growth and increase inflation for several years.
"The strength of the bounce in the market has certainly been a surprise for me," he said in an interview earlier this month in his modest office in Midtown Manhattan. As earnings plunge over the next few months, the market will follow, he said.
The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index, which includes most big American stocks, could fall to 800 by next spring, Mr. Cliggott said. At that level, the S.& P. would be TK percent below its Friday close of T,KTK, and almost 50 percent below its apex of March 2000.
His view is hardly common on Wall Street. Most strategists at other big securities firms say earnings could recover as early as the first quarter of 2002 and that a full-bore economic recovery will be evident by spring. The average strategist expects the S.& P. 500 to stand at 1,330 by the end of next year, 21 percent above Mr. Cliggott's forecast of 1,100. 
But for the last two years, the consensus has been wrong. As a result, Mr. Cliggott is catching the ears of investors who once listened closely to more bullish strategists like Abby Joseph Cohen, the chief United States stock strategist at Goldman, Sachs, and Jeffrey Applegate, the chief investment strategist at Lehman Brothers. At her peak, Ms. Cohen, the star strategist of the late 1990's, moved markets with a few words. 
Mr. Cliggott is not nearly that influential -- at least not yet. But when Institutional Investor magazine listed its All-America Research Team on Oct. 17, based on a survey of professional money managers, Mr. Cliggott was ranked among the top strategists for the first time. He placed No. 3, behind Michael L. Goldstein of Sanford C. Bernstein and Edward M. Kerschner of UBS Warburg.
Mr. Cliggott was not the only bear on Wall Street during the last two years. But many of the others are dismissed by professional investors as "perma-bears," pessimists who have called stocks overvalued for a half-decade or more. Mr. Cliggott has been both bullish and bearish over that span.
"He's a great strategist," said Scott B. Schermerhorn, who manages $3 billion for Liberty Funds in Boston. Some strategists make up their minds about the market's direction, then search for data to support their views, Mr. Schermerhorn said, "but Doug just looks at data and interprets what the data seems to be telling him."
That strategy served Mr. Cliggott well in January, when the Federal Reserve made the first of nine cuts in short-term interest rates. Most of his rivals predicted that the cuts would prompt a strong recovery in the economy and in corporate earnings, which began to fall in the last months of 2000. But based on trends in corporate investment and commodities prices, Mr. Cliggott correctly said that earnings would remain weak and that the rally would not hold. His prediction that a late spring rally would fizzle also proved correct.
"He's been out there, in a bearish position, and he's been correct," said Jon D. Brorson, director of equities for Northern Trust, which manages $100 billion in United States stocks.
Mr. Cliggott says the secret to his accuracy over the last 18 months has been his focus on the direction of short-term corporate earnings. Predicting earnings more than a few months away is extremely difficult; most investors do not look more than two quarters ahead, he said. Other strategists also think corporate earnings are a vital indicator of the direction of stock prices, but they spend more time trying to determine what earnings may be in a year or two. Mr. Cliggott says that exercise is largely wasted. "Everyone wants to believe the market trades off earnings 18 months from now," he said. "It doesn't."
SO while other strategists, like Ms. Cohen, look at a broad basket of indicators, Mr. Cliggott has lately focused on corporate investment in the United States and commodity prices worldwide, the two statistics that J. P. Morgan has found are most closely correlated with short-term earnings trends.
Higher commodity prices are a sign that business activity is quickening, Mr. Cliggott said, while investment in computers, new plants and other equipment helps to increase productivity, driving the long-run growth of the economy.
Thanks to a quirk in accounting rules, rising business investment also gives a strong short-term boost to corporate profits. If Compaq sells new computers to Exxon Mobil, for example, Compaq can book the entire sale immediately as revenue. But because the computers are an investment that will lose value over time, Exxon Mobil can write off their cost gradually over several years.
As a result of the difference in the ways that the seller and the buyer treat the deal, periods of rising business investment are very good for corporate profits, Mr. Cliggott said.
The process works in reverse if business investment falls, as it has in recent months. Then companies like Compaq may see their sales fall, while companies such as Exxon Mobil will still be writing off investments they made in previous years.
Together, the direction of commodity prices and business investment accounts for about 65 percent of the short-term swings in corporate profits, Mr. Cliggott figures.
Unfortunately for investors, both commodity prices and business investment are still falling, and there is no sign that a turn is imminent. So Mr. Cliggott expects earnings to skid at least until the spring of 2002, and to recover only moderately for the remainder of that year.
He predicts earnings in the next 12 months will sink as low as $37 per share of the S.& P. 500, compared with a high of $55 a share in 2000. Using a price-to-earnings ratio of 22, which he considers fair, given the current long-term interest rate of 4.6TK percent on 10-year Treasury notes, he calculates that the S.& P.'s fair value now is only about 800.
Of course, stocks do not always trade at fair value, and Mr. Cliggott could be wrong for any number of reasons. Interest rates could fall, enabling stocks to trade at higher price-to-earnings ratios. The market could move sideways while investors wait to see how 2002 unfolds. Or earnings could recover quickly.
Mr. Cliggott says he is aware of all those possibilities. But for now, he says, stocks are so overvalued that he is not worried that he will miss a big rally. "It's far more likely that the market could be down 20 or 25 percent than up 20 or 25 percent."
And that, Mr. Cliggott said, does not factor in the risk of more terrorist attacks, though Sept. 11 has raised risk for the economy and stocks.
Those risks include too much government interference in the economy, he said. He grew up in a Boston suburb and is a Democrat -- he jokes that anyone from Massachusetts is born a Democrat and a Red Sox fan -- but like most people on Wall Street, he thinks the federal government should usually stay out of the way of private business: "The risk is that government starts taking on a bigger role in America, or a bigger share of the economy, rather than a smaller share."
Spending on security and the military may cause inflation to rise, Mr. Cliggott said. Businesses buy computers, or add to their sales forces, because they think the spending will increase their revenue or profits. But improving security is a strictly defensive measure that forces businesses to spend more to produce the same product or service they previously did. That is inflationary, and higher inflation is typically a drag on stock prices, he said.
To divine longer-term trends in interest rates, the economy and stocks, Mr. Cliggott reads the Journal of Economic Literature, the Journal of Economic Perspectives and the Journal of Portfolio Management. But he says his most important feedback comes from investors, and he spends most of his time talking to customers. "Clients won't let you stay on the wrong side of things for too long," he said. "The key is to listen to your clients."
TO make sure that he does not repeat what other strategists say, he does not read his competitors' reports. He said he figures that if another strategist unearths an important new statistic or trend, his clients will tell him. In a typical week, Mr. Cliggott will lead a dozen or more hourlong conference calls or presentations with big investors, and spend much of the remainder of his time responding to questions from other clients. His list of business contacts is almost 300 names long.
On Fridays, he works at home, writing a pair of weekly research reports that are distributed to clients each weekend. One report covers specific industry sectors, while the other offers a broader picture of the market.
In the wake of Sept. 11, Mr. Cliggott has changed a few of his own habits. With his wife, Annemette, and his three children, aged 6 to 11, ensconced in Larchmont, N.Y., he has curtailed his travels in the last month -- because he wants to remain close to home and fears that further attacks could snarl air transportation. "I was never envious of people with their own Gulfstreams until last month," Mr. Cliggott said.
With his outlook, he is again advancing an opinion that is well outside the Wall Street consensus. If the market holds its recent gains or rallies further, his view will be proved very publicly wrong.
Mr. Cliggott says that standing alone does not bother him. "I got hugged a lot as a kid," he said, only half-joking. If his indicators show that earnings are turning higher, he said, he will not be afraid to turn more bullish. Otherwise, he does not plan to change his outlook.
His biggest risk is that the indicators on which he relies will lose their effectiveness as earnings predictors -- or that he will become so focused on them that he misses other important changes in the market. But he has shown that he can be both bullish and bearish, so if he finds that he is out of sync with the market for more than a few months, he will rethink his strategy, his fans say.
"Doug's the first person to doubt himself and his analysis, which is helpful," said Jeff Rose, who manages $2 billion invested in large United States growth stocks for Credit Suisse First Boston. "He's just a very calm guy. That humility and that aw-shucks personality will serve him well over time."
For now, Mr. Cliggott plans to stick to his guns.

CORRECTION-DATE: October 30, 2001

 CORRECTION:
An article in Money & Business on Sunday about Douglas R. Cliggott, senior stock market strategist at J. P. Morgan Securities, omitted two figures in citing the percentage change that would result in the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index by next spring if it were to fall to 800, a development that he believes possible. The index would be nearly 28 percent below its close of 1,104.61 on Friday. 
The article also misstated the yield on 10-year Treasury notes. It was 4.52 percent on Friday, not 4.6.

For Coffee Traders, Disaster Comes in Pairs

BYLINE:  By ANTHONY DePALMA 

 BODY:
ONLY days after the World Trade Center collapsed on top of the evacuated New York Coffee Exchange, obliterating the most important coffee auction in the Western Hemisphere, traders moved into backup office space across the East River and quickly put the exchange back in business. 
 At first, all was not well. Trading was limited to just 90 minutes, and the low ceilings in the building that is the exchange's temporary headquarters make the trading pits as noisy as the elevated subway that rumbles overhead in Long Island City, Queens. But order was restored with impressive speed, and contracts for most of the $18 billion of coffee consumed annually in the United States were bought and sold at the same volume as before. 
 Trying as it was, responding to the crisis in the coffee exchange may have been the easy part of handling the crisis in coffee. 
The price of raw coffee -- in decline for several years -- plummeted to a record low last week. The fall has been dizzying. Futures contracts on the coffee exchange, the benchmark for prices around the world, had been as high as $3.05 a pound, in May 1997. But last Monday, they bottomed out at 42.5 cents a pound, then rose slightly. And the future looks no brighter. 
Bountiful rainfall in coffee-growing regions of South America is expected to help produce a record coffee harvest of more than 44 million bags next year in Brazil, the largest coffee-growing country in the world. Each bag weighs 132 pounds. 
The emergence of Vietnam as a major coffee producer contributes to the oversupply. The Vietnamese government has helped farmers in the central highlands plant coffee trees by the thousands. A minor coffee exporter just a decade ago, Vietnam will swamp the market with 12 million bags of generally low-quality coffee this year, which could drive prices to new lows.
"Coffee is dead," said Dov Blumenthal, a trader whose pit name on the trading floor of the coffee exchange is Bear. He said the absence of frost, floods or other natural disasters in South America, good news for the people there, spells disaster for the oversupplied coffee industry. "I've never seen things as bad as this," he said. 
And the glut could prolong the boom-bust cycle that has haunted coffee for decades. As prices fall, farmers stop fertilizing and pruning trees. Eventually, they may yank out trees, reducing future supply. An unexpected frost or hurricane could wipe out the crop, causing shortages that would push prices sharply higher. 
FOR now though, crumbling prices are causing havoc in the coffee-producing countries, which are on the verge of shutting down the cartel they formed a few years ago to control supplies and support prices. The impact on countries like Nicaragua and Ivory Coast has been devastating, as many farmers sell coffee at less than the cost of production. Some have to choose between starvation and switching to other crops, including illicit harvests like coca.
To the dismay of American consumers, the price collapse has not made its way to supermarket shelves. Prices for the most familiar brands -- including Folgers, Maxwell House, Chock Full O' Nuts and Nescafe -- which account for more than 65 percent of the retail market in the United States, have dropped only slightly. According to Information Resources, a market research company based in Chicago that tracks sales nationwide, the cost of a can of one brand, Yuban, is selling for $3.77 a pound, only 16 cents, or 4 percent, less than it was in January 2000. But the price of green coffee has been slashed by about 50 percent during that time. 
"If the income of coffee producers is less than half of what it was a year ago, why hasn't any of that been passed on to consumers?" asked Deborah James, a director at Global Exchange, an organization that supports better treatment for coffee farmers and other agricultural workers. "We're in the midst of a profit bonanza right now." 
Although they often cite sharp increases in the cost of green coffee supplies when they raise prices, the big coffee-roasting companies refuse to discuss their pricing now that unroasted coffee is cheaper than at any time in the last 30 years. "We never discuss our pricing," said MaryJane Kinkade, a spokeswoman for Kraft Foods, which produces Maxwell House and Yuban coffees.
Margaret Swallow, a spokeswoman for Procter & Gamble, which produces the Folgers brand, said the company had cut prices to retail chains seven times since March, 2000, but she declined to say what those decreases were. According to Information Resources, the supermarket price of Folgers ground coffee has declined about 16 percent in that time and most recently has sold for $2.80 a pound. 
The price disparity between producers and consumers is nowhere greater than at the gourmet coffee level. Starbucks, the largest specialty coffee chain with 2,900 company-owned stores in the United States, actually raised its prices 5 to 10 cents since January 2000 and does not plan to lower prices this year. 
"Pricing takes into account many elements, not just the cost of coffee beans," said Audrey Lincoff, a Starbucks spokeswoman. Labor costs, rent for high-traffic locations and even the cost of milk and sugar must be factored into the total package, she said. 
Starbucks still charges $11.45 a pound for coffee in its stores, although the company has acknowledged the plight of farmers who receive less than 50 cents a pound for their crops. The company promised this month to provide $1 million in financial support to coffee farmers. Starbucks also plans to buy one million pounds of coffee under Fair Trade, an international program that sets a minimum price of $1.26 a pound.
Starting next spring, Starbucks plans to increase its use of Fair Trade coffee by making it the "Coffee of the Day" one day each month.
Amid the coffee industry's problems, Americans are showing no sign of surrendering their claim to being the world's biggest coffee consumers. They spend $9.2 billion a year on retail coffee in supermarkets and specialty stores and an additional $8.7 billion for brewed coffee, espresso and cappuccino in restaurants and coffee bars. According to the American Coffee Association, a trade organization based in New York, orders for roasted coffee beans -- an indication of coffee consumption -- took a fall immediately after the terrorist attacks but have recovered.
As for the New York Coffee Exchange, its trading floor was at 4 World Trade Center, a nine-story building at the foot of the twin towers. When the towers came crashing down, tons of debris fell on the building, which had already been evacuated. Cocoa, sugar, cotton and some other commodities also were traded there. Mark Fichtel, chief executive of the New York Board of Trade, which oversees the trading for coffee and all the other commodities, said it would have been technically possible to resume trading on Sept. 12, because a duplicate trading floor had been built in Long Island City five years ago in response to the 1993 bombing of the trade center. The delay of four trading days was caused by logistics, Mr. Fichtel said.
The cost of keeping that backup system equipped and ready to go, with duplicate files and computer systems, was about $300,000 a year. Mr. Fichtel said there was some resistance to the concept "especially around the time the bills had to be paid." But having such a detailed contingency plan meant the exchanges could resume trading soon after the disaster, and did not have to fear losing business to competing exchanges like the London Coffee Exchange. 
RIGHT now, the two 300-square-foot carpeted trading pits are used in rapid-fire 90-minute sessions by traders buying and selling futures and options on coffee and all the other commodities. Before Sept. 11, each crop was traded for five hours a day in its own trading pit. Now there are only two pits for all of the commodities. Mr. Fichtel said that by the middle of November, two additional pits would be opened, increasing daily trading time to two hours for each commodity. By the end of January, two more pits will be added, lengthening the daily trading sessions to three hours. 
While that will help restore the trading process to normal in New York, it will not help resolve the serious problems in the world coffee market, which is of vital importance to 50 developing countries. "There's definitely a temporary glut that's driven prices so low it's become a crisis," said John M. Talbot, an assistant professor of sociology at Colby College in Maine, who is writing a book on coffee. "Chances are that after a few years, supply will be brought back into balance with demand. But the devastation that will happen in the meantime is morally unacceptable."
Mr. Talbot said the instability in coffee prices had been caused in large part by the cancellation of the International Coffee Agreement in 1989. The agreement was an attempt by the United States and other democracies in the cold war to support the economies of developing countries and prevent the Communists from making political inroads. The agreement kept prices high and established production quotas to balance supply and demand. 
By 1989, with the cold war almost over, the United States pulled out of the agreement. Free global competition was introduced, and prices began to fall. But a 1994 freeze in Brazil reduced the supply and sent prices soaring. The higher prices encouraged impoverished farmers to plant more coffee trees. 
It takes three to five years for a coffee tree, sometimes called a bush, to start producing fruit. With the aid of good weather, and demand for coffee growing at only 3.5 percent a year, coffee soon started backing up in warehouses. As prices slid, supply continued to grow, further depressing prices. An attempt this year by the Association of Coffee Producing Countries to stabilize prices failed when members refused to withhold one-fifth of their harvest from the market. The head of the organization said recently that the fledgling cartel would shut its doors in January, the victim of selfishness, born of desperation, among the coffee-producing nations.

Honoring,And Paying, All Those Who Serve

BYLINE:  By TOM REDBURN 

 BODY:
GRAB a copy of Vanity Fair on the newsstand, and instead of facing the usual glamorous movie star, you first will see four soot-stained New York City firefighters gracing the striking black-and-white cover of a supplement to the November issue.
 These days, even as wealthy sports idols like Tiger Woods and Venus Williams have declined to compete overseas merely to avoid flying on airplanes, poorly paid firefighters, police officers, soldiers and postal workers are risking their lives by simply doing their jobs. 
 Does the post-Sept. 11 thirst for genuine heroes, not just those who play them, mean an end to the celebration of "success" and the culture of celebrity?
Not a chance. They are too deeply ingrained. But maybe the newfound respect for real work and the sacrifices of regular workers will finally lead to profound misgivings about just how far the rewards of the American economy have tilted in recent years toward the favored few. 
In a recent issue of The Milken Institute Review, Edward N. Wolff, an economist at New York University, reports on his latest findings concerning the striking contrast in the last two decades between the fortunes of the upper tier of the wealth rankings and the broad middle class.
Mr. Wolff looked at the most recent available data from the Federal Reserve on the wealth of American households, which goes through 1998. Not surprisingly, he found 1983 through 1998 -- when the economy prospered and the stock market boomed -- produced many millionaires.
The number of households with a net worth of more than $1 million nearly doubled, to 4.78 million from 2.41 million. At the same time, the ranks of the truly rich exploded even more, with those worth more than $10 million nearly quadrupling, to 239,000 from about 67,000.
That's great. A rich society like the United States should have plenty of rich people -- and the more the merrier. But what is disturbing is what happened to just about everybody else.
"The richest 1 percent accumulated 53 percent of the total gain in marketable wealth over the 1983-1998 period," Mr. Wolff wrote. "The next 19 percent received another 39 percent, so that the top quintile accounted for 91 percent of the total growth in wealth, while the bottom 80 percent accounted for a mere 9 percent."
"The results indicate rather dramatically," he added, "that the fruits from economic growth in the last few decades were enjoyed by a surprisingly small part of the population -- the top 20 percent, and particularly the richest 1 percent."
WHO'S in that 20 percent? Well, it may well include people like you. The line dividing the top fifth from everybody else fell somewhere around $250,000 in 1998, meaning that anybody with solid home equity of say, $100,000, modest savings and investments of at least $50,000 and a retirement account of more than $100,000 belongs to the winning upper crust.
And who's not? Many of the firefighters and rescue workers, of course, who rushed into the World Trade Center inferno. But it also includes millions inside government and out -- teachers and nurses, social workers and telephone repair people -- whose worth has been steadily devalued in the nation's excessive pursuit of private gain over public service.
"There's been an enormous rush of recognition that working people are immensely more valuable than the rewards they've received in recent years," said Robert H. Frank, an economics professor at Cornell University, whose book, "The Winner-Take-All Society," (The Free Press, 1995) written with Philip J. Cook, explored why cultural and technological trends have lately concentrated so much more wealth and influence in the economy's top positions.
"But unless the change in attitudes kindled by the assault is translated into a change in public policy, nothing will be different," Mr. Frank said. "We need to pay our public servants more and treat them with better respect. We have to recognize the impoverished level of many basic public services and confront our nation's big inventory of unmet needs. That's where our politics have failed us." 
Judging by the current debate over how best to put together an economic stimulus package, our politics still have a long way to go. The House of Representatives just passed a bill that includes a host of tax breaks for business and speeds up individual tax cuts -- but only for families with incomes of at least $65,000.
That seems backward. Not only is the war demanding real sacrifices from the working Americans who will be fighting it, but the recession will invariably hit hardest at the most vulnerable in society. Shouldn't those who already have the most be called on to sacrifice something, too?

To the Editor:
Re "Enlightenment on Energy" (editorial, Oct. 22):
 A Union of Concerned Scientists study released last week found that establishing a national standard of 20 percent of American electricity coming from non-hydropower renewable energy by 2020, if combined with energy efficiency programs, would save consumers at least $70 billion, stimulate the economy, reduce the vulnerability of our energy infrastructure to terrorist attack, and greatly reduce air pollution and greenhouse gas emissions. 
A bill to achieve this has been introduced by Senator James M. Jeffords, and should be adopted as part of the Senate's overall energy package. 
 Developing wind, solar, biomass, geothermal and other home-grown energy sources, along with increasing energy efficiency, is the best way to diversify America's energy supply.

HEADLINE: For Trade Protesters, 'Slower, Sadder Songs' 

BYLINE:  By LESLIE WAYNE 

 BODY:
NEXT month, international financial and trade officials will gather in two important meetings -- one in Doha, Qatar, and the other in Ottawa -- to resume a series of talks that were scheduled before, but questioned after, the attacks on Sept. 11. As they meet, anti-globalization groups will be holding some type of protests, perhaps candle vigils, perhaps marches, in cities around the world.
 Their message, protesters say, warns about the ill effects of globalism, capitalism and world trade on poor nations. But how they express that message, even some leaders of the movement say, will probably bear little resemblance to the marches -- often erupting in violence -- that put them on the map in recent years. 
 Strident demonstrations against globalization may occur in Europe, but protesters in the United States are scrambling to see if they can hold together a movement now that their most effective way of getting attention is out of sync with the national mood. 
"I don't think we are going to be in the spotlight as much as before," said John Sellers, director of the Ruckus Society, a human rights group based in San Francisco that has organized marches against global trade. "There's a strong concern about marches since Sept. 11. What would happen if 10,000 people turned out for a peaceful march and then 4 of them burned a flag?"
That is the quandary facing the anti-globalization movement -- which has gained its strength as a confederation of environmental groups and trade unions, anarchists and respected advocacy groups. Many of these organizations remain highly committed to their causes, especially those that have criticized the lending policies of the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank. But the terrorist attacks have forced them to regroup and, they say, they are not sure how, or if, they can be as effective as before.
"A lot of us are in a retreat-and-reflection mode," said Tim Atwater, national organizer for Jubilee USA Network, which advocates the canceling of debt to developing countries. "We are having to walk on tiptoes and communicate very, very carefully. Things are coming back slowly. But we will be singing slower, sadder songs."
Yet for all the difficulties facing the movement, it is hard to imagine that it will fade away. The movement has been too long in the building, and it is too well financed and organized. And many of the issues it has raised about global inequities between rich and poor appear to have become more relevant in recent weeks. Even the Bush administration in the last few days has made the link between poverty and the roots of terrorism.
"We will definitely be there in Ottawa," said Stephen Kretzmann, an analyst at the Institute for Policy Studies, an advocacy group in Washington. Mr. Kretzmann was arrested at the demonstrations in Seattle in 1999 that thrust the movement into America's consciousness. "We have to be very Ghandian in our approach." 
To many, the anti-globalization movement has been a bit of a puzzle since it first appeared, seemingly out of nowhere. Who are these people? Where did they come from? How are they financed? How are they organized? What do they want?
If the perception of the movement is of angry faces and police clashes, the reality is different, members say. The movement has been building quietly for more than 20 years, they said, promoting a message about global economic inequities that does not lend itself to quick sound bites. Some leading foundations -- including the Ford Foundation and one at Unilever -- have supported the movement's efforts financially, along with church groups, organized labor and celebrities like the rock music group U2. 
THE movement's success in gaining a following, especially since the Seattle demonstrations, has come from a combination of grass-roots organizing, plentiful position papers and clever self-promotion. In the wake of Sept. 11, protesters say that there are still many issues to resolve and that they are more at odds than ever with the Bush administration.
While the administration says one way to fight terrorism is by promoting a global policy that is pro-business, protesters say this approach will only make the world less stable. In addition, the administration has used the attacks to justify a new push for "fast track" authority, which would allow trade agreements to be enacted with little Congressional oversight -- another measure long opposed by protesters and organized labor because it allows little debate.
This month, at an economic forum in Shanghai, President Bush told business executives that more free trade and greater unrestricted commerce were crucial to fighting terrorism. The chairman of the Federal Reserve, Alan Greenspan, echoed those thoughts last week, when he said the terrorist attacks have given new urgency to the trade negotiations in Qatar.
Mr. Greenspan called the protesters misguided and said they offered no solutions to the "alleged failures" of globalization.
The activists say they are upset with the administration's effort to use the terrorist attacks as a way to push a pro-business agenda and fast-track negotiating authority.
John Cavanagh, director of the Institute for Policy Studies, said that while Sept. 11 "stopped our movement," it was beginning to come back. "The fight has come back in the form of fast track," he said. "Groups are already gearing up for a big fight."
The movement blossomed in the mid-1990's as more multinational corporations, aided by loan policies of the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank, went in search of less-costly places to make goods and new markets for their cars, hamburgers and basic commodities like sugar and rice. A catalyst in the United States was the fight against the North American Free Trade Agreement. 
At the same time, a parallel movement was emerging in Europe. Protest groups there -- with names like Attac and Black Bloc -- shared many of the same views as their American counterparts, but with more militancy.
Although demonstrators on both sides of the ocean may look ragtag, they are anything but. European groups are financed in part by the European Union and grants from charitable trusts; American groups receive money from wealthy individuals and foundations that run the gamut from small church-related foundations to the Ford Foundation and the Rockefeller Foundation. 
One unusual benefactor was the Unilever Corporation, the consumer packaged goods company, which recently gave $5 million to the foundation run by its Ben & Jerry's ice cream subsidiary, a major donor to these groups. "We like to call it caring capitalism" said Liz Bankowski, a trustee of the Ben & Jerry's Foundation.
U2 and its lead singer, Bono, are also prominent donors, and they allow groups like Jubilee USA, a church-related group, to set up information tables at concerts. The band also plans to donate part of the proceeds of a new single it has recorded with Destiny's Child and Britney Spears.
WHAT gave the movement its strength was this panoply of different groups that came together in a sort of alliance of convenience. Labor unions joined, looking for allies in the fight against Nafta and low-paying jobs overseas; in return, they provided respectability and foot soldiers. Groups like the Center for Economic Policy Research in Washington churn out studies that are the movement's intellectual backbone. And organizations like Jubilee USA, 50 Years Is Enough and Global Exchange spread the message through pamphlets and meetings on campuses and in church basements and union halls to religious groups and students. 
Global Exchange, a human rights group based in San Francisco, has even offered "reality" tours to countries like Cuba, Haiti and Iran and runs a store selling goods from developing nations -- as a way to raise both awareness and cash. 
Finally, there are those who train the troops, like the Ruckus Society, which teaches nonviolent and creative confrontation techniques at camps held before demonstrations. One had been scheduled at the Virginia estate of a wealthy supporter but was canceled after the terrorist attacks. More recently, the Ruckus camps have been replaced by classes on computer-based organizing skills. 
"We are all working against the same" corporate establishment, said Kevin Danaher, a founder of Global Exchange, which has a $4 million annual budget, a staff of 50 and a membership list of 12,000. 
"There is unity in diversity, and diversity is the magic of this movement," Mr. Danaher said. "It's fine to be focused on sea turtles or dolphins or to be a steelworker or a tree hugger. But you are isolated unless you team up."
But can this coalition hold? Already, some foot soldiers have fallen away and joined antiwar groups. It is possible that organized labor, which always was uncomfortable with the movement's militancy, will have less tolerance if loud protests break out. Still, some Washington groups continue to meet and are optimistic. 
"We feel very committed to the issues," said Thea M. Lee, associate director for international economics at the A.F.L.-C.I.O. "I think most folks are committed to keeping the coalition together. But it will be put to the test."
If there is a unifying theme behind the groups, it is their message -- one that both the I.M.F. and World Bank say they have been hearing and, depending on the concern, responding to. To the protesters, large nations led by the United States have turned globalism into a form of economic colonialism through the lending policies of the I.M.F. and the World Bank, which make loans to troubled countries. 
The protesters say poor countries become hurt because, in order to pay off the loans, they lure multinational companies with low wages and relaxed environmental standards. As a result, instead of becoming self-sustaining, these countries become economic captives, making products on the cheap for export, while importing basic goods and necessities from companies in the United States and Europe.
More specifically, they object to the fact that many I.M.F. and World Bank meetings are held behind closed doors -- although both institutions have said they are bringing more of their activities into the open.
BUT more fundamentally, demonstrators say that the debt facing many countries -- $220 billion by the 40 poorest -- means that many nations spend more on debt service than on education or health care, leading to high mortality rates and rampant disease. One poster shows smiling faces of children in developing countries and says: "Today 19,000 children will DIE as a result of international debt." 
On its Web site, the World Bank has a section devoted to responding to protesters' demands -- some of which it rejects, others of which it says it is taking steps to address. Merrell Tuck, deputy media director for the bank, says the institution meets often with advocacy groups, so long as they do not espouse violence.
"We think we have a lot of areas of common concern with the activist groups," Ms. Tuck said.
Thomas Dawson, an I.M.F. spokesman, said the I.M.F. has always had an "open door" policy to many groups. 
"There are no doubt winners and losers in globalization," Mr. Dawson said. "But we still think that global economic integration offers the best route to lift the poor out of poverty."
Still, the movement would not be what it is without its core groups, like 50 Years Is Enough, which was founded in 1994 to oppose I.M.F. and World Bank policies. It serves as the clearinghouse for a coalition of more than 200 other organizations -- and is so named because it was founded on the 50th anniversary of the I.M.F. and World Bank.
The group's director, Njoki Njoroge Njehu, was born in the central highlands of Kenya to a family active in the Kenyan struggle for independence. She earned scholarships to come to the United States to study communications and then stayed to work with environmental groups. 
Fifty Years Is Enough is based in in a low-rent space in Washington, above a neighborhood law office with signs offering "divorce specials" and "walk-in deals on car wrecks." Ms. Njehu runs the group with about $250,000 a year in donations, mostly from foundations, with her husband, Soren Ambrose. After growing up in a middle-class family in Chicago, Mr. Ambrose became interested in the issues facing developing countries when he went to study in Nigeria and found that his counterparts there could not afford to pay for their school books.
"We are in an unprecedented place in time," said Mr. Ambrose, the group's senior policy analyst, whose office is at the top of a rickety staircase and decorated in brown paneling. "If the I.M.F. and World Bank are going to hold meetings and do their business, we will be there to go around and expose what they are doing. It will not be confrontational in character." 
For all the talk of demonstrations, most of the work that Ms. Njehu and Mr. Ambrose do is quiet and behind the scenes -- a constant schedule of travel to enlist support in small groups on campuses and at churches. "We will continue to do the quiet work we have always done," Ms. Njehu said. "It just won't be in front of the cameras," 
For all the discussion of poverty, the movement is supported by well-endowed foundations, which are concerned about the gap between rich and poor nations. The foundations also view themselves as bulwarks against the excesses of violence, financing only those groups that support nonviolent demonstrations.
The Ben & Jerry's Foundation, which has made grants to the Ruckus Society ($100,000 for a year) and Global Exchange ($150,000 for a year), felt so strongly about its liberal brand of philanthropy that when Uniliver acquired the Ben & Jerry's company, it insisted on a provision that Unilever provide the foundation with a one-time, $5 million grant and $1.1 million a year for 10 years.
"Unilever gave the gift in the spirit of the founding values of the company," Ms. Bankowski of Ben & Jerry's said. "It's what happens when a large multinational merges with a small, quirky company. I'm sure it's a pain in the neck for them to read stories about our donations. But they are aware of our history and that our business was founded as a way to do social change."
The Solidago Foundation, which was founded six years ago from money from the sale of radio and cable properties, gives $3 million from its $48 million endowment to many liberal programs, including anti-globalization efforts like Jobs With Justice and 50 Years Is Enough.
Diana Cohn, a spokeswoman for the foundation, said that Solidago's strategy is to give small grants -- $10,000 to $50,000 -- to many groups and to bring advocacy groups and research organizations together to offer new voices in debates about trade and globalization. 
"Grants are pivotal in terms of this movement," Ms. Cohn said. "Our focus is on groups working on a corporate-driven mode of globalization. We even provide travel grants just so that these groups can meet. There has been a wellspring of activity and groups working together and realizing that the whole is greater than the sum of its parts."
Even the Ford Foundation, which has given money to the Institute for Policy Studies and the Center for Economic and Policy Research, is motivated by the same concerns that many demonstrators have.
"Globalization has undeniable benefits," said Bradford K. Smith, vice president for the peace and social justice program at the foundation. "But there are also real and perceived costs. Our grant-making seeks to better understand these costs. The goal is to ensure that economic integration and development proceeds in a way that reduces inequities and increases the shares of benefits going to the poor."
The foundations share the view that Sept. 11 will only lead to a pause, not a halt, in the movement. Anannya Bhattacharjee, program officer at the Veatch Program at Shelter Rock, a Unitarian Universalist Foundation in Manhassat, N.Y., said the movement had displayed remarkable creativity in adjusting its tactics. 
"Everyone is adjusting," Ms. Bhattacharjee said. "One thing social movements are extremely good at is figuring out creative and imaginative ways under extremely difficult circumstances. These movements have faced some of the greatest odds, and no one knows yet what tactics will emerge. But if history has taught us anything, it is that this work will not stop."
THE effects of Sept. 11 are being felt in Europe, to a lesser degree. Bernard Cassen, president of Attac, a French group, said the terrorism in the United States had not slowed his movement. "We will continue to fight against globalization," he said. In England, Ashok Sinha, national coordinator of the Jubilee Debt Campaign U.K., said the attacks "have made it difficult to get our voices heard." 
For now, Mr. Sinha said, he is trying to keep "the issue of debt cancellation on the political agenda, given that most other things are being squeezed out by war." 
While trade officials are meeting in Qatar, anti-globalization protesters are planning demonstrations in Britain including pamphlet distribution, seminars and work stoppages.
Guy Taylor of Globalise Resistance, another British group, said, "We need to say now more than ever that we need a world that is for the people and not for profit."

HEADLINE: The Nation: Irresolute; 
Congress's Economic Dithering

BYLINE:  By DAVID LEONHARDT 

 BODY:
IN the first weeks after Sept. 11, Democrats and Republicans both spoke of coming to a quick agreement about lifting the nation out of its economic downturn. Passing a bill rapidly was crucial, they said, because distributing government money takes time and because the most dangerous months for the economy were likely to come toward the end of 2001.
 But almost seven weeks after the terrorist attacks, the two parties are still arguing over details, and companies are still announcing layoffs. Even more worrisome to many economists -- who, like Alan Greenspan, believe it is "far more important to be right than quick" -- both the Democratic and Republican bills contain items that owe more to traditional party wish lists than generally accepted theories about effective ways to kick-start the economy. 
 The Democrats are insisting that the government send billions of dollars of new tax rebate checks, although people who received similar checks this summer spent very little of them. The Republicans, as part of a $100 billion bill passed by the House of Representatives, included billions of dollars of retroactive tax cuts for businesses, although economists say such cuts provide little incentive to spend money now.
Even some of the combatants are concerned. "There are proposals on both sides that have no immediate stimulative effect," Senator Rick Santorum, the Pennsylvania Republican, said recently. "Putting things in a package for economic stimulus that does not stimulate the economy is simply a luxury that we can't afford."
The result, economists say, could be a compromise bill that leaves the country with bigger deficits down the road while failing to provide much of its stimulative lift until next year. "The economy is most desperate in October and November and December," said Richard J. DeKaser, the chief economist at the National City Corporation, a large bank based in Cleveland. "When we need all that dough is right now."
It may seem odd that the timing of economic activity is considered so important. After all, a few million dollars spent six months from now could help create just as many jobs as a few million dollars spent tomorrow. 
But recessions -- and few analysts doubt that the United States is now in one -- tend to feed off of themselves, as layoffs lead to cuts in consumer spending that lead in turn to new layoffs. Borrowing from tomorrow's growth can halt that vicious cycle.
In the current political climate, there is another reason to prime the pump, economists say. Buffeted by the attacks themselves, the recent anthrax letters and the prospect of a long war, Americans say they are considerably less confident about the future than they were before Sept. 11. When a nation is less confident, it tends to spend less money and have less resolve.
"This is not a time the economy should be weak," said Peter L. Bernstein, a consultant to large investors and the author of "Against the Gods: The Remarkable Story of Risk." "We're moving into a situation that's very scary," Mr. Bernstein said. "We have to give people a sense that this is going to be turned around." 
The bills now in Congress, however, may not achieve that end. If low-income families deserve government money for reasons of economic fairness, for example, then sending them rebate checks of up to $600 seems to make sense. At a cost of about $14 billion, both the Republican-written House bill and a proposal made by Senate Democrats would send such checks to families who did not pay enough income tax to receive the full rebate already.
And if corporate tax burdens are so high as to make the economy inefficient, then cutting those taxes also makes sense. The House bill would spend about $30 billion giving companies various tax breaks based mostly on past profits and investments.
But economists have arrived at an unusual degree of consensus, based on how much stimulus the bills might provide, that this legislation is too timid.
Take the rebate checks. According to a study by the University of Michigan, Americans have spent about 20 percent of the $38 billion in rebates that the Treasury Department sent out this summer, in the government's first attempt to hasten a recovery this year. 
That's a much worse response than the first President Bush got from his modest stimulus program, almost a decade ago. In March of 1992, he reduced the amount of money the federal government took from people's regular paychecks, giving many families nearly 60 extra dollars each month.
EVEN though the extra money would later come out of their tax refunds, or be added to their tax bills, people spent more than 40 percent of it, according to a study by the same Michigan professors, Matthew D. Shapiro and Joel Slemrod. A similar payment method could work now, Mr. Slemrod said, because people seem less likely to save money that appears in their regular paycheck rather than as a lump sum.
Even more popular among economists are new incentives for consumers and businesses to spend money immediately. The corporate tax cuts in the bills could be skewed more heavily toward incentives for future investment, rather than refunds of past tax payments. The House bill contains $40 billion worth of such incentives, and the Senate plan has $15 billion. 
In addition, the federal government could reimburse states for temporary cuts in their sales taxes, as Alan Blinder, the former vice chairman of the Federal Reserve, has suggested. Almost every item in the country would effectively be on sale, presumably causing people to make immediate purchases they would otherwise not. 
That, say economists straining to be heard, is stimulus.

It's Been Dark Before

BYLINE:  By DAVID M. KENNEDY; David M. Kennedy is a historian whose most recent book, "Freedom From Fear: The American People in Depression and War, 1929-1945," won a Pulitzer Prize last year.

 BODY:
ADRIFT in a sea of troubles, the United States seems in danger of coming unmoored from its own historical identity. Americans have been pounded by the surprise attacks of Sept. 11, beset by anxieties about anthrax and cowed out of airports, shopping malls and even the halls of Congress. Their righteous anger is not matched by conviction of eventual victory. They are little comforted by the still-inconclusive raids against Afghanistan, nor are they fully assured that their leaders are up to the job of protecting them from whatever unnameable horrors the future might hold. They are unaccustomedly edgy and off balance. For history's most secure, self-confident and forward-looking people, these are disquietingly unfamiliar feelings.
 Yet at least some Americans can still remember the teeming anxieties that plagued the United States after the assault on Pearl Harbor. Popular culture recollects a people resolute and energized in the wake of the Japanese surprise attack. But in fact the mood of America in the weeks after Dec. 7, 1941, was baffled, frightened and grim. 
 The Nazis had already conquered most of Western Europe. They seemed all but certain to bring the Soviet Union to its knees within weeks, even days. Like Tony Blair today, Winston Churchill throbbed with bravura defiance, but Britain in fact had markedly fewer resources to bring to bear against its foes than Mr. Blair does now. 
The sober reality was that Churchill faced the galling prospect of acquiescing in German mastery over Europe and Japanese hegemony in Asia, as most of the senior American military command gloomily and not unreasonably predicted. Hitler compelled the British army to retreat from Norway and Dunkirk in 1940, and from Crete in May 1941. Britain suffered the most humiliating military defeat in its long history when its huge garrison at Singapore dipped its colors to an inferior Japanese force in February 1942, followed just months later by the surrender of the British stronghold at Tobruk in North Africa. 
Hitler's blitzkrieg (lightning war) tactics had caught the world flat-footed. The Wehrmacht's mechanized attack had forced a supposedly formidable France to capitulate within a few inglorious weeks in the spring of 1940. Japan's huge prewar investment in aircraft carriers had meanwhile revolutionized naval warfare, as Pearl Harbor demonstrated. The warlords in Tokyo appeared ready to make good on their promise to turn the Pacific into a Japanese lake. What was left of the American fleet after Pearl Harbor was no match for the seemingly invincible Imperial Japanese Navy, which boasted more and better ships, as well as vastly superior weaponry and aircraft.
Small wonder that panic seized the West Coast in late 1941 in expectation of imminent Japanese bombardment and even invasion. Radio stations went off the air, lest their signals serve as navigational beacons to enemy aircraft. Jumpy officials moved the Rose Bowl game out of harm's way, from Pasadena to North Carolina. Supposedly disloyal Japanese-Americans were accused of hatching diabolical plots to poison water supplies and blow up electrical generating plants. A prominent newspaper columnist demanded the incarceration of the entire Japanese-American community in California, "and to hell with habeas corpus" -- a dark wish that soon came true.
APPREHENSION gripped the Eastern Seaboard as well, as German U-boats in early 1942 began the wholesale sinking of American ships off the Atlantic coast before the eyes of horrified spectators on shore. Submarine predation in subsequent months nearly choked off the convoys of food and war materiel to Britain. Teams of German saboteurs came ashore in Florida and New York.
In the face of these threats, a deeply isolationist and unprepared United States could muster only the resources of an economy badly blighted by the decade-long Depression, a skeletal Navy gutted at Pearl Harbor and a poorly equipped, untrained Army of barely a million men. Smelling the sour odor of defeatism, President Roosevelt devoted his entire "fireside chat" radio broadcast on Feb. 23, 1942, to dispelling the rumors that "the British are finished, that the Russians and the Chinese are about to quit." With a pointed reminder of the Continental Army's travails at Valley Forge, he also felt it necessary to disabuse his countrymen of the demoralizing notion that they were "soft and decadent, that they cannot and will not unite and work and fight."
A bleaker, more hopeless, picture is difficult to imagine. Yet we know how that story ended. Less than four years after Pearl Harbor the United States had utterly vanquished its foes. Its presumably enfeebled industries disgorged a monstrous avalanche of weaponry. Americans developed doctrines of aerial warfare infinitely more novel than blitzkrieg. They invented nuclear weapons immeasurably more powerful than the aircraft carrier. They robustly revived their flagging factories and in the process transformed their country from a peripheral, isolationist state into the solar plexus of the international system and the undisputed engine of the global economy. As Churchill memorably put it, America in 1945 stood "at the summit of the world," a position that it has continued to occupy ever since. Though it has become commonplace to think of that outcome as inevitable, none but the vainglorious or the foolhary could have predicted it in 1941.
Memory may be short, but history is long, and American history abounds with comparable trials of incertitude, trepidation and consequence. The ragtag revolutionaries of 1776 had scant guarantee of victory when they rose against what was then the world's most formidable empire, and they had every reason to tremble over the possibility, even the likelihood, of defeat. Nor could Abraham Lincoln count on inevitable success when he set out to rally a perplexed and reluctant people to wage war to preserve the Union. 
History, of course, is remembered backward, with at least some clarity, but lived forward with unavoidable uncertainty. Peering into their futures, Americans in 1776, 1861 or 1941 could not foresee their fates with any more clarity than their descendants can today. 
While such comparisons are invariably tricky, some historical lessons seem clear. Despite frequent claims to the contrary, it is highly unlikely that the struggle against terrorism will prove as pervasively transformative as World War II, which remains the defining event of the modern era. But it is not outlandish to suggest that the nation's response to Pearl Harbor demonstrated the enduring truth that while Americans can surely be flummoxed and discouraged, they remain in the end a people prodigiously resourceful, resilient and creative.

Taking Care of Business

BYLINE:  By PAUL KRUGMAN 

 BODY:
Cynics tell us that money has completely corrupted our politics, that in the last election big corporations basically bought themselves a government that will serve their interests. Several related events last week suggest that the cynics have a point.
Consider, for starters, the airport security issue. On Thursday morning this newspaper reported that London-based Securicor -- the biggest of the three companies that provide almost all airport security in the United States -- was threatening to sue for damages if baggage screening is taken over by federal employees. This just two weeks after we learned that Securicor's U.S. subsidiary -- which had already been fined for employing convicted felons -- continued to hire employees without checking their background after Sept. 11, and then lied about it to regulators. 
 Under the circumstances, to claim that federalizing the business would represent a "taking" showed remarkable chutzpah. (Chutzpah, according to the classic definition, is when you kill your parents, then plead for mercy because you're an orphan.) 
 But the company evidently has friends in high places. Later that day the Bush administration endorsed the proposals of House Republican leaders, who have refused to allow an airline security bill to come to a vote unless it leaves baggage screening in private hands. The rhetoric behind this position emphasizes the supposed advantages of the private sector -- competition, accountability, etc. But there is little real competition in this industry, and -- as we've just seen -- not much accountability for companies with the right connections.
Then there was the House "stimulus" bill. The remarkable thing we learned from that bill was that conservative politicians -- who used to claim that they were improving incentives by reducing marginal tax rates, and that it was just an incidental side effect that big corporations and wealthy individuals were so richly rewarded -- no longer feel the need to disguise their payoffs. The core of the bill was a repeal of the corporate alternative minimum tax retroactive to 1986, which means that selected companies would immediately receive huge lump sum payments from the government, totaling around $25 billion, with no incentive effect at all. 
The bill's sponsors claim that the money would be invested and used to create jobs, but it's hard to see why: a potential investment that Texas Utilities or ChevronTexaco wouldn't have made a week ago, because the project won't yield a sufficiently high return, will seem no more profitable after each company gets its $600 million thank-you gift. And there are no strings attached to those gifts: if the companies want to, say, pay huge bonuses to top executives, they can. Republicans have always depended on the kindness of corporations, but this bill takes that faith to extremes.
True, defenders of the House bill remind us that "business" doesn't just mean giant corporations -- it also means the mom-and-pop shop around the corner. Indeed -- but the tax refund wouldn't be going to mom-and-pop shops. Where it would go, disproportionately, is to energy and mining companies. Why? Because they already receive so many special tax breaks that in the absence of the alternative minimum tax many would pay little or no taxes. Now the House proposes not only to remove that little inconvenience, but to refund the taxes they've paid for the past 15 years.
Just to cap off a great week for the mining interests, the Bush administration also announced on Thursday that the Interior Department would no longer be able to veto mining projects on public land. You might think that extracting minerals from public land, without even paying a royalty, was a privilege rather than an entitlement; but in today's Washington, financial might apparently makes right. 
I'm sure I'll be accused of being unpatriotic for suggesting that the administration and its Congressional allies are pandering to special interests at a time like this. That, of course, is what they are counting on -- that and the difficulty of getting people's attention when the news is all anthrax, all the time.
But the truth must be spoken. Lately our government has not exactly inspired confidence; its response to terrorism is starting to look a bit scatterbrained. But on some subjects our leaders are quite clearheaded: whatever else may be going on, they make sure that they are taking care of business.

For This Mariner, a Payoff Pitch

BYLINE:  By Ken Belson (COMPILED BY RICK GLADSTONE) 

 BODY:
The record-breaking season of the Seattle Mariners may have ended in disappointment because of the New York Yankees, but one player is likely to go home happy: Ichiro Suzuki, 28, the star right fielder who appears a shoo-in for rookie of the year. He is racking up endorsements and will make more in the off months than during the season. 
 He is already the pitchman for the Mizuno Corporation, Japan's largest sporting goods maker; the Nikko Cordial Corporation, its third-largest brokerage firm; and Sumitomo Ringyo Ltd., a home builder. His agent said he had turned down other offers worth $14 million, about three times his annual salary with the Mariners. 
 Once back in Japan, though, he is likely to be bombarded with offers from companies selling everything from cars to sports drinks. His stoicism, work ethic and skills -- he led the American League in batting -- resonate with Japanese who yearn for strong symbols. "He has what people want to see in the Japanese economy -- energy and success," said Tatsuo Sekine, chairman of the Institute for the Study of Television Commercials. Ken Belson

A RallyBehind Bonds, A Reluctant Treasury

BYLINE:  Compiled by Jeff Sommer 

 BODY:
The House of Representatives last week approved the sale of war bonds for the first time since World War II, but the Treasury was lukewarm about the measure.
 Shortly after reconvening on Tuesday, the House, which had been in recess because of an anthrax scare, passed legislation authorizing the sale of the bonds, called Freedom Bonds. 
The Senate has approved an identical measure as part of the Treasury's annual appropriations bill. 
 Under the legislation, the Treasury would issue a new class of savings bonds, or rename its existing Series EE bonds as war bonds. 
Representative John E. Sweeney, a Republican from upstate New York, said, "These war bonds serve as an ideal vehicle for Americans to support efforts to bring those responsible for these attacks to justice."
Treasury officials said they would, of course, respect the will of Congress. But Brian Roseboro, the assistant Treasury secretary for financial markets, said on Tuesday in New York, "We would first recommend Americans continue to contribute to charities, as they have been doing." He also said it would help if the "American consumer regains confidence, goes out and helps stimulate the economy." 
Robin Francis, a Treasury spokeswoman in New York, said, "My stance is, we should do what is best for the customer," the small investor. "If investors want to buy bonds," she said, "they should buy inflation-adjusted bonds," offered by the Treasury at a core interest rate of 3 percent, plus an inflation adjustment.

 BODY:
To the Editor:
 I applaud your Oct. 25 editorial "Time Runs Out on Welfare." 
It is unconscionable to put people already under stress through an unnecessary recertification process, particularly in the post-Sept. 11 economic climate. 
 New York City should stop mandating punitive waiting times for services like food stamps, Medicaid and cash assistance. Given the increasing number of people displaced because of the attacks, it is only humane to provide services in a timely manner.

HEADLINE: Charity Fund for Investors Moves Higher on Philanthropy List 

BYLINE:  By TAMAR LEWIN 

 BODY:
Fidelity Investments, the financial services company based in Boston, now operates the nation's second-largest public charity, according to the annual survey by The Chronicle of Philanthropy. 
 The Fidelity Charitable Gift Fund, the first of its kind when it was started in 1992, helps donors tie their philanthropy into their financial planning. To start a fund, donors put at least $10,000 into the Fidelity charity, take an immediate tax deduction, and direct Fidelity to pay out the money to whichever nonprofit groups they choose. 
 If the Fidelity charity keeps growing at the same pace -- the fund took in $1.1 billion last year, nearly double the $573 million it raised in 1999 -- it will take over the top slot next year, ousting the Salvation Army, which has been the largest charity for the last nine years. 
"It's an astonishing rate of growth, and it raises some interesting questions," said Eugene Tempel, executive director of the University of Indiana's Center on Philanthropy. "On the negative side, it means that we have new intermediaries, that if the money goes through Fidelity, the donors and the not-for-profits are not interacting directly, so we lose that involvement. But on the positive side, it may extend philanthropy, bringing in people who would not have made gifts if it hadn't been suggested by a trusted financial adviser."
Last year, about 5,000 donor-advised funds were established at Fidelity, which now has about 30,000 funds. This year, about 1,500 new donors have created accounts, said Cynthia Egan, president of the Fidelity fund. But, she said, it is too soon to say how strong the year's growth will be. 
"We had a very good year last year," she said. "Fund-raising is a bit tougher this year, and the economy is making it hard for everyone. Since a very significant percentage of our fund-raising is always in the last months of the year, it's hard to estimate what the total year will bring in." 
Many of Fidelity's donors take stock that has risen in value in another Fidelity account and transfer it into the charity fund, where it is sold. They then get a deduction for the full amount of the proceeds, without incurring any capital-gains tax on the stock appreciation. While the money put into the Fidelity fund cannot be retrieved for personal use, donors can decide how it should be invested, when they want to contribute some or all of it to a nonprofit group and which groups they will donate to. 
"Right now, Fidelity's just passing through the money, on the donor's advice," Mr. Tempel said. "But you have to wonder, if down the road Fidelity is managing $10 billion, what role will they play in guiding where it goes? The growth of donor-advised funds creates a tension for not-for-profits, whose greatest needs are for unrestricted funds to deal with infrastructure and changing needs. Gifts from the donor-advised funds are usually more restricted than that." 
Other financial companies have been quick to copy Fidelity's concept -- and last year, for the first time, three other commercial companies that offer donor-advised funds made The Chronicle's list of the top 400 charities: the Vanguard Charitable Endowment Program, with $111 million in contributions; the Schwab Fund for Charitable Giving, with $75 million; and the Ayco Charitable Foundation, with $64 million. And just last week, American Express announced that it, too, would begin offering donor-advised funds. 
Fidelity and the other financial companies are in direct competition with the nation's nearly 600 community foundations, which offer the same kind of donor-advised funds -- but also have program officers to help donors stay in touch with local needs and local nonprofit groups. 
Among the community foundations, The Chronicle rankings show, both the Peninsula Community Foundation, in San Mateo, Calif., and the California Community Foundation, in Los Angeles, last year outpaced the New York Community Trust for the first time -- a reflection of a continuing westward drift in American philanthropy. 
"One of the things that's fascinating is that of the top eight community foundations, five are now located in California, because of the astonishing growth of wealth out here, which isn't over, even though the lights have dimmed in the dot-coms," said Jack Shakely, president of the California Community Foundation. "But it's also true that we're all taking a hit." 
Mr. Shakely acknowledged that he was a little worried about the rise of the financial companies' donor-advised funds. 
"We haven't felt their impact because it's been such an era of abundance," he said. "When you're hip deep in fruit and you look over at someone who has more fruit than you do, it doesn't seem to matter. But when there's less all around, there will come a point when we feel it." 
Over all, donations to the top 400 charities rose 13 percent from 1999 to 2000, the same rate of increase reported the previous year. Together, those charities raised more than $43 billion last year, about one-fifth of the nation's total charitable giving.

HEADLINE: A NATION CHALLENGED: THE FOOD CHAIN; 
Farmers and Processors Act To Close Holes in Security

BYLINE:  By DAVID BARBOZA and JULIAN E. BARNES 

 BODY:
Increasingly worried that they are vulnerable to sabotage, the nation's biggest food companies are scrambling to tighten security to protect against an attack on the food system.
 To counter the terrorist threat, some food companies have increased the microbiological testing they conduct at processing plants. They are also checking for a wider array of pathogens and paying closer attention to imported ingredients. 
 The companies say they are restricting access to their processing plants and are adding cameras and undercover patrols in areas where ingredients are mixed or packaged. Food processors have also become more selective about suppliers. 
"We're reviewing all our procedures," said Karen Lynn, a spokeswoman at Conagra. "We're going to do whatever it takes to ensure the safety and security of our food."
The industry's moves come as Congress and government officials, already tense over the mailing of anthrax, assess the extent to which the nation's food supply is at risk.
Food security specialists and agriculture experts are calling for new measures to prevent terrorists from slipping biological or chemical poisons into packaged foods, or easier targets like produce and unpasteurized juices. They are also warning that terrorists could attempt to cripple the farm economy by spreading contagious livestock diseases.
"We're vulnerable to a terrorist attack," said Neil E. Harl, a professor of agriculture and economics at Iowa State University. "The terrorists know the surest way to bring a country to its knees is to attack the food and water systems. It may not be as visually dramatic as flying two planes into the twin towers, but it can strike at the heart of a nation."
Major food companies are reluctant to talk about plans to beef up security operations.
"We're not about to give a blueprint of all our vulnerabilities to the bad guys," said Gene Grabowski of the Grocery Manufacturers of America, a trade group in Washington that represents big food companies. "But we all recognize acutely that we're in a new world now."
Big food and agriculture companies have been on alert for several years because of worries about everything from mad cow and foot-and-mouth diseases to genetically modified foods. Those problems have forced many food and agriculture giants to tighten security and overhaul testing and transport systems.
Some food industry officials, however, say it is impossible to test all ingredients entering a plant or all the food that leaves. Instead, the food industry is emphasizing security measures to prevent attacks rather than detect them after the fact.
"Can they test every single chemical or every single agent that is a hazard?" said Dr. Rhona Applebaum, executive vice president for scientific and regulatory affairs at the National Food Processors Association. "They can't. There aren't enough labs, enough people to test for everything that can do harm."
The problem, experts say, is that the food chain is nearly impossible to secure fully because of its massive scale. There are more than 900 million acres of open-air farmland in the United States, and a vast network of storage and transportation depots, packing and processing plants. Ingredients are commingled throughout the food chain. And there is little or no bacterial or chemical testing done at later stages in the process, just before food reaches consumers.
While grain and livestock farmers are being asked to watch for suspicious activity, government officials and security experts say they believe the most serious threats are to processing and packaging facilities, the tail end of the food chain.
Food security concerns are also heightened because of the massive consolidation that has taken place in the food industry in recent years. Today, for instance, about half of all American meat is processed by three companies, Tyson, Smithfield Foods and Conagra. That means disease and contagion can spread faster, experts say, because animals are concentrated in fewer places.
Regulators believe the industry must act fast. A week ago, the Agriculture Department asked grain storage facilities and veterinarians around the country to be prepared for bioterrorism.
"No sector of society is immune from this brand of terror," said Floyd P. Horn, administrator at the U.S.D.A.
The Bush administration has proposed spending $61 million in 2002 to add inspectors. And the White House and Congress are considering how to expand the inspectors' powers to trace and recall contaminated food.
Security experts are also encouraging food companies to more closely scrutinize their work forces, something they have not always been willing to do. Many of the jobs at meat processing plants are filled by transient workers. Because of low pay and harsh conditions, job turnover in food processing is among the highest in the nation.
"I am pretty emphatic: you are pretty stupid not to know who are your employees," said Joseph R. Rosetti, a senior vice president at IPSA International, a security firm with which the industry is consulting. "Times have changed. To knowingly have illegal aliens is downright negligent."
And that means certain workers are bound to get closer scrutiny. "We are not discriminating, but we are being cautious," said Dr. Applebaum at the food processors group. "It is like an airport. The necessary security means a person who is an 83-year-old grandmother wouldn't get the same focus as a young man."
Meat processors say they have less to do to improve their security because their plants are already closely monitored. They also insist that food-borne pathogens can be destroyed by heating or cooking. 
That can not be done for produce, an area that some food safety specialists see as particularly vulnerable. The only known case of a food-borne bioterrorist attack in the United States occurred in Oregon in 1984 when members of a cult spread salmonella in salad bars, sickening about 750 people.
"The supermarket is an open target," said Frank Busta, a professor emeritus of food microbiology at the University of Minnesota. "It could be tampered with so easily, it's unnerving."

HEADLINE: Bad Blood in Battle Over Casinos; 
Issue Divides Tribes and Families as Expansion Looms

BYLINE:  By DAVID W. CHEN and CHARLIE LeDUFF 

 BODY:
When New York State legislators agreed last week to authorize six new Indian casinos, state leaders hailed the move as an important way to compensate for lost revenues from a woozy economy and the financial impact of the terrorist attacks.
 But whether the casinos will benefit the Indians themselves is a much more complicated and delicate question. 
 Inside Indian territories, which are considered sovereign entities, a battle is raging over whether casinos represent genuine salvation or false temptation. It is a clash between those with a reverence for the old ways and those with a thirst for a revenue stream. It is an argument over who will control the receipts and whether exchanging vows with state governments is worth selling a piece of autonomy. 
More than anything, the conflict over gambling has caused rifts in countless families.
In Michigan, the Saginaw Chippewas have expelled tribal members who have questioned the leadership's management of the tribe's casino. Those dissidents are no longer entitled to the annual $52,000 dividend check that each adult member receives. Within the Navajo Nation in the Southwest, a satellite territory that defied the leadership by voting for a casino is contemplating secession.
Roughly one-third of the country's 560 federally recognized Indian tribes now run some sort of gambling venture as part of a $10-billion-a-year industry. Yet the wealth is uneven: the two Indian casinos in Connecticut -- Foxwoods, run by the Mashantucket Pequots, and Mohegan Sun, run by the Mohegans -- account for 20 percent of the $10 billion.
In New York, three Indian nations have had three disparate experiences with casinos -- a flop, a success and a proposal that is pending. But they share two things: bad blood and a lack of consensus.
In western New York, the Senecas are contemplating two casinos near Buffalo and Niagara Falls and another on their own territory. In the remote northeastern corner, the Mohawks run a struggling casino on the St. Lawrence River, but are now considering one of three planned casinos in the Catskills.
But the foundation for all things casino is in central New York near Syracuse, where the Oneidas have managed to become both paradigm and pariah for their Emerald City-like casino. The root of the Oneida story is a bitter dispute between the traditionalist aunt who resuscitated the Oneidas and her modernist nephew who built the casino.

The Oneidas
Economic Success, But Little Harmony
Maisie Shenandoah once presided as the Wolf Clan mother of her tribe, the matriarchal Oneida. But since being ousted by her nephew, Ray Halbritter, she has lived in virtual exile in a trailer home. She calls Mr. Halbritter an overfed despot with a taste for Italian suits, ruling from a white palace near the New York State Thruway.
"He's a petty tyrant," she said.
Mr. Halbritter, a Harvard-educated lawyer, prefers the modern Indian title of chief executive. From a windowed office overlooking his casino's championship-caliber golf course, he makes no apology for creating an economic juggernaut that has helped to build housing and a clinic and paid for other programs.
He says his aunt remains chained to a past that may be rich with tradition, but little else. "Sometimes, people are sort of imprisoned in poverty so long that they begin to believe that the bars are there for their own protection," he said.
The rise of the Halbritter empire is an intriguing tale that began in the early 1970's, when he moved from the Syracuse suburbs into the trailers of the 32-acre Oneida territory with his mother, Gloria, who is Mrs. Shenandoah's younger sister.
After a decade-long power struggle marked by occasional violence, he ultimately prevailed, and in 1987 was endorsed by Maisie Shenandoah as Wolf Clan representative. By the early 1990's, the Oneida leaders representing the two other clans had died, leaving Mr. Halbritter as the sole representative. In 1993, he signed a casino compact with Gov. Mario M. Cuomo without formal consent from his people. By then, he and his aunt had had a falling out.
Like most Indian nations with casinos, the Oneidas do not release detailed financial information. But according to Christiansen Capital Advisors, a consulting company in Manhattan that maintains a database of gambling statistics, the Turning Stone Casino Resort in Verona takes in an estimated $167 million in annual revenue, with a profit margin of as much as 50 percent. Each enrolled Oneida member receives a quarterly check of $1,100.
"Our nation is run like a corporation," said Vicky Shenandoah, one of Mrs. Shenandoah's daughters. "But I would not trade my Indianness for money wealth. That won't be here tomorrow."
The Oneidas belong to the Iroquois Confederacy, which is at least 1,000 years old. The other five members are the Mohawks; the Senecas; the Cayugas, who have no reservation and live mostly on Seneca land; and two groups near Buffalo that oppose gambling, the Onondagas and the Tuscaroras.
Iroquois nations have drawn recent attention for their court claims to hundreds of thousands of acres based on 18th-century treaties. But it is gambling that has most inflamed Indians' passions. Last week, those passions were further stoked when the Oneidas expressed interest in running one of the Catskills casinos, and Senator Charles E. Schumer suggested that any new casino be linked to a deal on the land claims.
Throughout the Iroquois Confederacy, traditionalists regard Mr. Halbritter as a rogue leader who is defying the 18th-century teachings of Handsome Lake, a Seneca who warned that four things would doom the Iroquois: whiskey, the Bible, the fiddle and gambling.
Rick Hill Sr., a Tuscarora leader, has warned that gambling has translated into the three G's -- greed, guns and grief -- and that young Iroquois are being seduced. "They all want to be the next Halbritter," he said derisively.
Mr. Halbritter said he still respected the confederacy. But he regards it as the toothless equivalent of the United Nations. "Our revenue has enabled us to take control of our own destiny more than any political or theoretical speech can make," he said. "While people meet and make speeches, we're actually doing things."

The Mohawks
A Shaky Venture, A Chaotic Territory
Most Mohawks agree that gambling has brought little to their struggling community beyond death and division. And yet, even the self-described warriors who once pointed guns at one another over casinos now believe that the hope of something is better than the reality of nothing.
"I've grown wiser," said John Boots, the former spokesman for the Mohawk Warrior Society; his opinion of gambling on Mohawk territory has shifted several times.
In 1989, he took up arms in support of the illegal gambling parlors on the reservation when state troopers tried to make arrests there. The conflict crested in 1990 with the unsolved murders of two men from the antigambling faction. In the mid-1990's, Mr. Boots changed course when word of a secret compact between the tribal government and the state spread across the 28,000-acre territory. Then he denounced gambling on moral grounds.
Now, as the tribe negotiates for a casino in the Catskills, Mr. Boots has changed his mind again. "The point here is people need to wake up," he said. "You can't live off the land on the reservation. It's polluted."
Akwesasne, as the Mohawk people have named their land, is a haphazard and sometimes dangerous place, half in Canada and half in the United States. The border confusion has created what many of the 8,000 Mohawks see as their sovereign right to smuggle, whether it be cocaine, alcohol, tobacco, weapons or illegal immigrants.
The chaos is compounded by the existence of three rival governments. New York State supports the St. Regis Mohawk Tribal Council, which comprises three elected chiefs but has always been under suspicion because of the absence of a written constitution. The Canadian side is governed by a similarly elected body. The traditional Mohawk Nation Council of Chiefs is governed by clan-appointed chiefs.
Two years ago, the St. Regis council opened a casino that allows for a state police ministation on the territory. But the casino has been a dud, with a tepid $33 million in estimated annual revenues, much less than expected, according to experts.
"The tribal council made promises, but the promises never materialized," said Joyce Mitchell, the administrator for the Mohawk Nation Council of Chiefs. "I say, look at the Oneida people. What has money brought them?"
Wealth: that is the answer that the St. Regis council gives.
Wealth for a few: that is the reply of the antigambling people.
One of the leading casino opponents is Doug George, an Mohawk lawyer. His wife is Joanne Shenandoah, an acclaimed American Indian singer. His mother-in-law is Maisie Shenandoah, the Oneida clan mother.
"The compacts could lead to the extinguishing of the Iroquois as a distinct people and political entity," Mr. George said. "Not to mention the corrupting influence of fast money and tourists wandering willy-nilly on your territory."

The Senecas
Preserving Morals Vs. Paying the Bills
During the bitter 1995 election for Seneca Nation president, Myron Kettle so ardently supported the building of a casino that when his candidate lost by only three votes, he became involved in the illegal occupation of tribal government buildings.
The occupation ended months later with an alcohol-fueled gunfight. Three men died, including Mr. Kettle. A grand jury determined that Mr. Kettle had been shot accidentally by a political opponent acting in self-defense: his son, Richard.
Gambling remains a volatile issue, especially after last week's announcement. Already, tires have been burned, the rhetoric cranked up. The younger Mr. Kettle, now 42, remains so opposed to gambling that he no longer speaks to his pro-casino aunt and older sister. "They have no concept of traditional values," he said. "My aunt, my family -- they all went to college, and they follow the white man's way. They know too much for their own good."
The Seneca Nation encompasses three reservations totaling 50,000 acres of mostly rugged land in Erie and Cattaraugus Counties. Its anemic economy relies mostly on two bingo halls and several businesses selling gas and cigarettes, tax-free. Unemployment is perhaps 40 percent during the best months.
"You always hear, 'I want. I need. I wish we had,' " said Rick Jemison, a tribal council member who supports casinos. "Well, we've got to pull ourselves up by the bootstraps. This is like a third world country in the growth stage."
Casino opponents, however, do not trust the current administration. They worry that a casino may result in ceded sovereignty, corruption and little gain for most Senecas.
"It's really dollar signs in exchange for our culture," said Susan Abrams, a former tribal council member. "This is a battle for lifestyle. If and when this nation accepts casinos, what morals, principles and values will be taught to our children? That everything is for sale?"
Age seems to be a dividing factor. Many older Senecas have harsh words for Mr. Halbritter; they talk more about the primacy of the Iroquois Confederacy. The younger ones, unaware of Mr. Halbritter's lightning-rod reputation, dwell on their bleak economic surroundings.
Greg Miller, a young man who works at the Seneca Smoke Shop on the Allegany reservation, may best embody the conflicting feelings. While he is undecided and his family is split over the issue, most of his friends support a casino "because they're looking for easy money," he said. "They just got bills to pay."

 CORRECTION:
An article on Oct. 28 about divisions in the Indian nations of New York over gambling misstated the location of the reservation of the Onondagas, who oppose gambling. It is near Syracuse, not Buffalo.
