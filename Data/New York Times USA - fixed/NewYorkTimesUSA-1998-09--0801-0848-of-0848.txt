HEADLINE: Gillette to Cut Jobs by 11% As Results Lag

BYLINE: By DANA CANEDY 

 BODY:
Warning that its third-quarter results would be dismal, the Gillette Company said yesterday that it would cut 4,700 jobs, or 11 percent of its worldwide work force, as it reorganized its business.
The company, the world's largest maker of blades and razors, said earnings for the quarter would be down 20 percent from the quarter a year ago, largely as a result of a $535 million charge against earnings to pay for the cutbacks and reorganization. 
 Analysts said they were surprised by how bleak the earnings outlook was. Gillette was expected to earn 40 cents a share in the third quarter ended Sept. 30, based on a consensus of analysts polled by First Call, an investment research company, compared with 38 cents a share, adjusted for a stock split, a year earlier. Gillette also said it expected to report a decline of 6 percent to 7 percent in revenue for the quarter, from $2.4 billion a year ago.
Gillette plans to close 14 plants and 12 warehouses and eliminate or consolidate about 30 office facilities worldwide. The company, which is based in Boston, did not say which plants and offices would be closed. The cost cuts, which are part of the company's second reorganization in five years, will result in annual savings of more than $200 million, with a third of that coming next year and the balance by 2001.
The company also said its earnings would grow by the "low double digits" in the fourth quarter, but it had expected to earn 41 cents a share, based on the First Call consensus.
Gillette announced the profit warning and the cutbacks after the stock market closed. Earlier, its shares rose $1.6875, to $40, on the New York Stock Exchange. Third-quarter results are scheduled to be released on Oct. 15.
Calling it a "very poor quarter we'd like to forget," Alfred M. Zeien, the chairman and chief executive officer of the company, said the results could be attributed to several factors. First, the company's strategy to accelerate the introduction its new Mach 3 shaving system resulted in huge one-time costs. At the same time, Mr. Zeien said, consumers have been stocking up on the new razor, which was sold with at least a month's worth of blades, and many have not yet had to purchase replacements. In addition, economic instability in some countries has hurt wholesale demand overseas.
In a conference call with financial analysts yesterday, Mr. Zeien sought to assure investors that the fundamentals of Gillette's business remained strong and that the Mach 3 shaver was meeting sales expectations. He also assured analysts that the reorganization would bring about a more competitive company.
The changes, Mr. Zeien said, "will allow Gillette to become a more cost-effective competitor, help Gillette to achieve its aggressive strategic plans, recapture the sales and earnings growth momentum and enhance the company's ability to improve shareholder return."
But the assurances did little to pacify analysts, who said they had not been expecting an earnings drop of as much as 20 percent and had little warning from Gillette's management that estimates were so far off target.
"There has been a lack of information over the last quarter," said William Steele, who follows the company for Buckingham Research. "Basically I think investors have been too optimistic based upon the company's guidance."
In addition to the job cuts and factory closings, Gillette said it was realigning its management. The company, which manufactures the best-selling Sensor razor line as well as Duracell batteries and Oral B dental products, said its six global business management units would be organized under two executive vice presidents. In addition, the consolidation of the commercial operations will result in five geographic groups organized under two additional executive vice presidents.
The groups will sell the company's entire product line within their geographic territories instead of having distinct selling organizations with separate administrative functions in one territory. The four executive vice presidents will report to Michael C. Hawley, president and chief operating officer.
"Under the new organization structure, there will be one Gillette Company in each of the major geographic regions," Mr. Hawley said.

HEADLINE: THE MARKETS: MARKET PLACE -- COMPANY REPORTS;
S.E.C. Crackdown on Technology Write-Offs

BYLINE: By SAUL HANSELL 

 BODY:
It is upgrade time at America Online.
Never mind the noise about its new 4.0 browser software version. The Securities and Exchange Commission has ordered the on-line service, and the rest of the technology industry, to improve the way they account for mergers and acquisitions.
The issue is how technology companies have seized on a footnote in the accounting rules related to research expenses to write off most of the purchase price of companies as soon as they acquire them. This prevents a continuing drag on profits that would result from writing off the purchase price over several years. 
 The S.E.C.'s move comes as it is cracking down on a number of accounting practices it finds abusive. In comments at New York University, Arthur Levitt, the chairman of the commission, said his staff would immediately increase its scrutiny of companies that use certain aggressive accounting techniques to inflate their quarterly earnings.
In choosing to make an example of America Online, the biggest Internet company, the commission took the extreme step of blocking it from publishing its fiscal fourth-quarter earnings for nearly two months.
America Online finally reached an agreement with the S.E.C. and published its earnings yesterday. It wrote off $70.5 million related to research at two companies it acquired, representing 22 percent of the $316 million it had paid for them. Previously the company had said it planned to write off a vast majority of the purchase price, though it gave no specific figures.
Separately, Lynn E. Turner, the S.E.C.'s chief accountant, called on the accounting industry to tighten its rules related to writing off the cost of research. In a letter to the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants, he said that a study by the S.E.C. had found "significant problems in the recognition and valuation" of the research write-offs. The letter outlined a proposed standard for such write-offs that is much stricter than accountants have been using. And the commission threatened to make companies take the embarrassing step of restating published earnings in cases where it deemed their research write-offs to be "materially misleading."
Analysts said that the change could inhibit acquisitions, especially by smaller technology companies.
"It has more significance for other companies besides AOL," said Keith Benjamin, an analyst at BancBoston Robertson Stephens. "You will see more young Internet companies forced to take lower write-offs." America Online is less affected, he said, because it has become big enough to absorb the additional charges.
At issue is how companies account for the value of "in-process research and development" -- research that has yet to be turned into a marketable product -- at companies they buy. In an acquisition, companies estimate the value of all of the assets they are buying, both tangible ones like buildings and intangible assets like brand names and customer lists. If the purchase price is higher than the value of all of these assets -- and it usually is -- the remainder is added to an item known as good will.
Companies are forced to write off the value of all of these assets over a period of from 3 to 40 years, depending on the useful life of the asset. The one exception is in-process research, which is written off immediately.
Since technology companies are especially interested in showing investors accelerating earnings growth, many have started attributing the bulk of their acquisition costs to in-process research.
The S.E.C. letter listed a number of what it described as "abuses" in this practice. In one case, for example, a company that the commission did not name wrote off nearly all the purchase price of an acquisition as in-process research, even though the target company had not spent a significant amount of money on research or development.
"If a company didn't spend significant amounts on R&D, it would raise questions in my mind," said Baruch Lev, a professor of accounting at New York University. He conducted a study of 400 acquisitions, mostly of technology companies, and found that the buyers wrote off 75 percent of the purchase price as in-process research.
America Online said that it would not be deterred from buying more companies because of the change in rules.
"When we look at acquisitions we will look for those that have the right strategic value and the right economic value," said J. Michael Kelly, the company's chief financial officer.
Because the allowed write-off was less than analysts had expected, America Online posted an unexpected profit for its fourth quarter. It earned $7.1 million, or 3 cents a fully diluted share. That compares with a loss of $11.8 million, or 6 cents a fully diluted share, a year earlier.
America Online said it would write off the rest of the cost of its acquisitions over 5 to 10 years. That will mean a deduction of between $25 million and $50 million a year from its reported profits. The company told analysts yesterday that its core business continued to do better than expected and that as a result, it predicted it would meet their previous earnings estimates.
Shares of America Online increased $2.375 each yesterday, to $117.125.
Jonathan Cohen, an analyst with Merrill Lynch, said that the market was not concerned with the deductions from profits.
"Reported earnings is one small piece of a larger picture at technology companies that includes revenue growth, market position, audience size and brand equity," he said.
Yet even if investors are ignoring the good will charges now, Jack Ciesielski, a money manager and the publisher of the Analyst's Accounting Observer, argues that it provides a useful reminder of how much companies are spending on acquisitions, especially if the good times end.
"If there is a big blob of good will and they aren't earning a return on it, investors can see it and start asking questions," Mr. Ciesielski said. "If you have an immediate write-off, the trail is destroyed."

HEADLINE: Mayor Calls Bronx Stadium Plan a Rerun

BYLINE: By ABBY GOODNOUGH 

 BODY:
Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani scoffed yesterday at a proposal by the Bronx Borough President to renovate Yankee Stadium, calling it a "warmed over" version of a plan drawn up for the city four years ago.
The criticism came hours after the Borough President, Fernando Ferrer, held a news conference at the Bronx Overall Economic Development Corporation to introduce his proposal, which would modernize the stadium, add 120 luxury boxes, ease traffic congestion and redevelop the surrounding neighborhood. While acknowledging that he had not carefully examined the proposal, Mr. Giuliani said it appeared similar to a plan that the city commissioned in 1994 to dissuade the Yankees from leaving the Bronx. 
 The Giuliani administration never officially released that plan, because the Yankees' principal owner, George M. Steinbrenner 3d, rejected it. But yesterday, Mr. Giuliani said the older plan was "much more comprehensive" than Mr. Ferrer's proposal, which he said included only a "sketchy" cost estimate. Mr. Ferrer put the cost of his plan, which combines elements of several previous stadium proposals, at $535 million.
"I happen to know that this plan is a watered-down version and a not very well thought-out version of a much more comprehensive plan," Mr. Giuliani said at an afternoon news conference on Rikers Island. He added that the city was ready "to do not only the things indicated in Freddy Ferrer's press release, but many more things that are a lot more comprehensive."
"I'm saying that it's a warmed-over plan," he said.
Mr. Steinbrenner has threatened to move his team to New Jersey or Manhattan for years, complaining that the Bronx stadium has too few luxury boxes and parking spaces and that the neighborhood frightens fans. The team's lease with the city expires in 2002.
Mr. Steinbrenner's wavering has created tension between city politicians, with Mayor Giuliani pushing for a publicly financed stadium on the West Side of Manhattan and the City Council Speaker, Peter F. Vallone, the Democratic gubernatorial candidate, pushing for a referendum on that plan.
Mr. Steinbrenner is expected to announce later this fall where the team will play after 2002. Mr. Ferrer said yesterday that his plan, called Yankee Village, was meant to bring the focus of the negotiations back to the Bronx. The plan differs from previous ones, he said, because it proposes that the city condemn the dilapidated Bronx Terminal Market, a 32-acre site on the south side of the stadium, to build a waterfront park along the Harlem River and 450,000 square feet of commercial space.
It is also the first proposal to include conceptual drawings, Mr. Ferrer said.
"This plan substantively addresses every area of concern ever addressed by the Yankees and neighborhood residents," Mr. Ferrer said in an interview. "The Mayor has this unfortunate habit of reflexively criticizing ideas that are not his own."
A spokesman for Mr. Steinbrenner would not comment on Mr. Ferrer's plan yesterday, saying that Mr. Steinbrenner was focusing on his team's performance in the playoffs, which begin tonight against the Texas Rangers at Yankee Stadium. "Until the season is over, he's not going to comment on anything except baseball," said the spokesman, Howard J. Rubenstein.
Gov. George E. Pataki, who added fuel to the debate last week by saying that the Yankees "belong in the Bronx, period," also declined to comment on Mr. Ferrer's proposal yesterday, saying he needed to study it.
"We'll have to take a look," said Michael McKeon, a spokesman for Mr. Pataki. "The Governor wants the team to stay in New York, and his clear preference is that they remain in the Bronx."
Mr. Giuliani has also said that he wanted the Yankees to stay in the Bronx, but that the city should offer alternatives.
The Mayor chided Mr. Ferrer for unveiling his proposal at a news conference, saying he should have discussed it with city officials and the Yankees first. But Mr. Ferrer said that he had copies delivered to Mr. Giuliani and Mr. Steinbrenner early yesterday, and that his main priority was making it public. Mr. Ferrer was joined at his news conference by Linda Ruth Tosetti, Babe Ruth's granddaughter, who proclaimed the plan "a fabulous idea" as nine television cameras rolled.
"The whole Ruth family was horrified, aghast, to learn that the Yankees might be leaving the Bronx," Mrs. Tosetti said. "I hope Mr. Steinbrenner and the Mayor listen."
But Mr. Giuliani, who trades frequent barbs with Mr. Ferrer, said he could not take seriously a proposal that reporters had seen before he had.
"Whenever a politician takes their report and gives it to the press first rather than the governmental agencies that would work with it," Mr. Giuliani said, "by and large the politician is looking for some cheap publicity. I have to assume it's a press release and not really a plan."

HEADLINE: CALIFORNIA JOINING EARLY-BIRD STATES FOR CAMPAIGN 2000

BYLINE: By TODD S. PURDUM 

DATELINE: LOS ANGELES, Sept. 28

 BODY:
In a bid to give the nation's most populous state more clout in selecting Presidential nominees, Gov. Pete Wilson today signed a bill that moves all statewide primaries here to the first Tuesday in March, putting California in the company of New York and at least four other Eastern states for what would amount to a giant national primary on a single day.
California has not helped choose a major party's nominee since 1972, but along with its Eastern counterparts, the Golden State will be among a bicoastal handful of states whose elections are now scheduled to immediately follow the February New Hampshire primary and Iowa caucuses as the first Presidential contests of 2000. That could reduce the nominating process to about four weeks. 
 The new date, March 7, will be three weeks ahead of the late-March date California adopted in 1996, and three months earlier than the June date that prevailed for decades, mirroring a national trend toward early primaries in which states scramble to maximize their electoral influence.
Sponsors of the measure here have urged Oregon and Washington to move their primaries to the same date to create a giant West Coast primary that would account for nearly a quarter of the votes needed to select the Democratic Party nominee and just over a fifth of those needed to choose a Republican.
Political professionals said the new date would put an even greater premium on early organization and fund-raising efforts, and would almost certainly favor the best-financed, best-known candidates, like Vice President Al Gore for the Democrats. Just a week after March 7 comes "Super Tuesday," with primaries in 11 states, including the electoral powerhouses of Florida, Texas, Ohio, Michigan and Illinois, by the end of which a nomination could be locked up.
If the current dates stand, all that will make it much harder for a dark-horse candidate to buy time based on a surprising showing in Iowa or New Hampshire, and then regroup to compete in later contests. Instead, political consultants said, there will be pressure to race coast-to-coast to compete everywhere at once.
"You can't wait for the tide to rise after New Hampshire," said Ken Khachigian, a veteran Republican consultant here. "In California alone you're going to have to have a couple million dollars for media. There's a lot less room for somebody who surprises the conventional wisdom."
On the other hand, it is conceivable that each of several candidates, unable to afford a coast-to-coast campaign, would concentrate in a particular region, with the result that each could win a sizable chunk of votes that would then have to be brokered at an old-fashioned convention.
In 1996, some Republicans complained that the trend toward earlier primaries left their party with an establishment candidate, Bob Dole, while stacking the deck against fresher faces that might have run a stronger campaign against President Clinton.
For their part, Californians, including Mr. Wilson -- who could benefit from the new date if he chose to run as a favorite son -- made no bones about their parochial motives.
"If voters were home runs, California would be Mark McGwire and Sammy Sosa put together," Mr. Wilson, a Republican who is barred from seeking a third term this year, said in signing the bill at a ceremony in Sacramento. "But the current primary process treats us like we can't hit our weight."
At the same time, Mr. Wilson's spokesman, Sean Walsh, said that having diverse, populous states like California and New York vote early in the process would force candidates in both parties to appeal to broader, national concerns instead of narrower local issues or the extremes in each party.
In 1995, Oregon moved its primary from May to the second Tuesday in March, but election officials there said today they knew of no plan to move the primary to an even earlier date. In 1996, Washington moved its primary to March 26, also from May, and now its Secretary of State, Ralph Munro, has asked the official commission that sets the primary date to make it coincide with California's.
"Our underlying goal is to have a system that will act as a magnet that will bring candidates to the Pacific Northwest to learn about our issues and concerns," said David Brine, a spokesman for the Secretary of State's office.
One reason the move to an early primary could help Mr. Wilson is that his support for abortion rights makes him an anathema to many of the conservative Republican voters who dominate the primary process around the nation. With California at the front end of the process, along with Massachusetts, Maine, Connecticut and Maryland, states where Mr. Wilson's advisers believe he might have appeal, he could stand a stronger chance. Even so, he could face stiff competition here in California -- especially among Hispanic voters who are angry at him over his past stances on immigration and affirmative action -- from Gov. George W. Bush of Texas, who has strongly hinted that he might run.
Mr. Wilson's brief run for the Presidency in 1996 collapsed for lack of financing and support, and he even lost his voice temporarily following throat surgery. He has said he would run again only if he decided he could raise enough money, but he has made no secret of his desire to do so. A recent Los Angeles Times poll found that the state's economic recovery has lifted the Governor's popularity to record levels, but two-thirds of voters still say Mr. Wilson should not seek the Presidency.
This is not the first time that California has tried to increase its standing in the Presidential sweepstakes. In 1996, it moved its primary from June to the end of March, but even then found itself an afterthought in the race for the Republican nomination because other states also moved up their primaries. To curtail efforts at leapfrogging, both national parties have adopted rules to discourage primaries earlier than the first week of March, except for New Hampshire's, which has long been first.
At the insistence of Democrats in the State Assembly, the new measure here moves not only the Presidential primary, but all statewide primaries, allowing challengers in races for governor and United States senator considerably more time to undertake campaigns than the current five-month general election cycle.
In a separate but related move this year, Mr. Wilson signed legislation that exempts Presidential primaries in the state from a ballot measure passed two years ago requiring primary election ballots to list all candidates together, regardless of party, in a so-called blanket primary. National party rules bar selecting delegates to nominating conventions in that way, so voters will be asked to approve the exemption in a ballot measure this fall. Otherwise, the state parties here would have to devise some kind of closed caucus or state convention system in which actual delegates would be selected, after a primary that would be a mere beauty contest.

HEADLINE: Former Basketball Star Is Convicted in the Slaying of a Teen-Age Girl

BYLINE: By DAVID M. HALBFINGER 

 BODY:
Richie Adams, a former high school, playground and college basketball star whose repeated declines into drug use and crime cost him his chances for a professional career, was convicted on Saturday of killing a 15-year-old girl in a South Bronx housing project in 1996.
Mr. Adams, 35, who was convicted of manslaughter but acquitted on a second-degree murder charge, could be sentenced to life in prison on Oct. 26 by Acting Justice Gerald Sheindlin of State Supreme Court. 
 The victim, Norma Rodriguez, a student at Morris High School in the Bronx, was found beaten and stomped to death on the morning of Oct. 15, 1996. Her body was in a 15th-floor hallway, one floor below the apartment of Mr. Adams's mother at 3050 Park Avenue in the Melrose section. Mr. Adams turned himself in eight days later and pleaded not guilty.
He had prior convictions for two purse snatchings and holding up a woman at gunpoint at a bank machine.
After the killing, Miss Rodriguez's family and friends said he had been stalking her. Numerous imprints on the girl's neck came from the treads of a pair of size 13 1/2 Adidas hightop sneakers, an assistant District Attorney, William B. Flack, said after the trial. The left sneaker, covered with the victim's blood, was found on the street below the window of his mother's apartment, and the police found the right shoe in his bedroom, prosecutors said.
A witness, Carmen Santos, testified that she saw part of the attack through the peephole of her front door on the 15th floor of the building, in the Jackson Houses. Ms. Santos, 49, said she heard Miss Rodriguez scream, then saw the 6-foot-9-inch Mr. Adams grab her by her bandanna and by the neck. Ms. Santos testified that she ran to her window then to call for help.
Mr. Adams's lawyer, Jerry M. Vasquez, said the bloody sneaker did not belong to his client, and introduced evidence that when Mr. Adams had signed up for a basketball tournament two months before the killing, he had requested size 15 1/2 sneakers.
Mr. Adams took the stand during the two-week trial, saying he had been inside his mother's apartment at the time of the attack, talking on the phone and sleeping.
The jury of eight men and four women deliberated for three and a half days before reaching its verdict.
The first-degree manslaughter conviction alone carries a minimum sentence of 10 years and a maximum of 25 years, Mr. Vasquez said. But Mr. Flack, the chief trial lawyer in the Bronx District Attorney's office, said he would ask Justice Sheindlin to declare Mr. Adams a persistent felony offender, a designation that allows a maximum sentence of life imprisonment.
Mr. Adams first tasted fame in 1978, as a standout player on the top-ranked Benjamin Franklin High School team in East Harlem.
He was a star center from 1981 to 1985 at the University of Nevada-Las Vegas, where he was twice named conference player of the year, and finished with 1,168 points and 623 rebounds. In 1985 he was drafted in the fourth round by the Washington Bullets. But the next day, he was arrested and charged with stealing a car in the Bronx.
Mr. Adams later brought his game and 250-pound frame to Holcombe Rucker Memorial Park in Harlem, where he became one of the most sought-after summer tournament players and was nicknamed "the Animal." But he also lapsed deeper into drug abuse, friends said. After his conviction in the purse snatchings and the armed robbery, he played basketball behind barbed wire in an upstate prison from 1989 to 1994.
When he got out of prison, he returned to his mother's apartment in the Bronx. He was still using drugs, friends and neighbors said, still unemployed, and stealing again to support his habit. But by then, his game was deteriorating and his fame had vanished.

HEADLINE: Westchester Legislature Rejects a Tax-Free Week

BYLINE: By The New York Times 

DATELINE: WHITE PLAINS, Sept. 28

 BODY:
The Westchester County Legislature voted tonight against participating in the state's next tax-free shopping week, scheduled for January, concluding that although it would help the county's merchants, it would do so at the cost of a property tax increase for homeowners.
The 11-to-6 vote to keep the county's sales tax in place sets Westchester apart from most of the other counties and cities in the state, which have so far embraced the State Legislature's plan to eliminate the sales tax on some clothing purchases as a means of persuading people not to leave New York State to shop. 
 For a week before the vote, County Executive Andrew J. Spano, a Democrat, warned the Democratic-controlled Legislature that a recent report by a business group, the Westchester County Association, said the reductions in tax revenue would necessitate an increase in property tax. The report estimated that the county would lose $27 million to $35 million in revenue a year if it eliminated the sales tax permanently.
"It's bad for the economy and it's bad for the residents," Mr. Spano said in a telephone interview. "I made a promise to the people that I would not raise their taxes, and I won't."
Tonight's vote addressed only the next tax-free week -- Jan. 17 to 24 -- which applies to clothing and shoes that sell for less than $500. The vote, however, is considered an indicator of how Westchester lawmakers will vote next year when they have to decide on a permanent sales tax exemption for shoes and clothing selling for less than $110. The permanent sales tax exemption was approved by the State Legislature in August and is to go into effect on Dec. 1, 1999.
The sales tax rate in Westchester municipalities, including the 4.25 percent levied by the state, varies from 6.75 percent to 8.25 percent. The four largest cities set their own sales tax rates and the mayors of each of them have said they plan not to participate in future sales tax exemptions. In White Plains, the state and local sales tax rate is 7.75 percent, while in Yonkers, New Rochelle and Mount Vernon it is 8.25 percent.
Because of the range of sales and property tax rates, each Westchester community would feel the impact of the tax change differently. The report estimated that an average homeowner in White Plains, for example, would see an increase of at least $218 in property taxes to compensate for the loss of sales tax revenue. That homeowner would have to spend at least $6,200 a year on clothing or shoes that cost less than $110 to make up for the $218 in added property tax. An average Peekskill homeowner would have to buy $1,146 worth of tax-free items and a Scarsdale homeowner would have to buy $5,674 worth, the report said.
Not everyone agreed with the report's findings.
"I think the numbers the administration is floating around are a little inflated," said James Maisano, a legislator from New Rochelle. "They looked at the September tax-free shopping week figures, but don't forget that was back-to-schools week, so people were shopping more and buying more."
Mr. Maisano voted for the tax-free week and said he wanted to see a study that examined the economic impact of not adopting the plan when communities all around Westchester were planning to adopt it.
"If all the surrounding communities decide to opt in, what will that do to the retail industry and jobs in Westchester?" Mr. Maisano asked.
Mr. Spano said he did not think shoppers would leave Westchester to shop in other counties because the difference between being charged just the local sales tax and being charged no sales tax at all was negligible.
"The state's going to eliminate its 4.25 percent anyway," Mr. Spano said. "We don't feel that people are going to hop into their cars and pay the toll to go to Rockland County or drive into the Bronx to shop."
Shoppers in the gleaming malls in White Plains may not notice much of a difference in forthcoming tax-free periods, since that city charged its normal 2 percent tax during the last two tax-free weeks, in January and earlier this month.

HEADLINE: Time Warner Sponsors School Program for Computer Careers

BYLINE: By JULIAN E. BARNES 

 BODY:
Time Warner announced yesterday that it would sponsor a program to prepare students for careers in computer technology.
The program will train teachers at 10 New York City public high schools to teach students how to link computer systems, a skill increasingly in demand among high-technology companies and one that the school system is just beginning to teach. 
 The company will build a training room at its Rockefeller Plaza headquarters and teach classroom educators and students there. The two-year computer networking curriculum was designed by Cisco Systems, based in San Jose, Calif., and teaches students how to plan, build and maintain computer networks.
At a news conference yesterday, Gerald M. Levin, the chairman of Time Warner, said the program would teach students a valuable skill and improve technology education in the schools. Graduates of the program can take a test to become certified by Cisco to design and repair computer networks.
Time Warner's program will begin enrolling students in September 1999; up to 300 students are expected to participate in the first year.
The company and Board of Education selected the 10 schools primarily on the basis of geography. There is at least one in each borough: Bronx High School of Science and William A. Taft High School in the Bronx; John Adams High School and Hillcrest High School in Queens; Murry Bergtraum High School, A. Philip Randolph High School and Frederick Douglass High School in Manhattan; Staten Island Technical High School and Ralph McKee High School on Staten Island; and Brooklyn Tech High School.
At the news conference, Mr. Levin singled out Taft as "a school I care deeply about." His son, Jonathan M. Levin, was an English teacher at Taft when he was killed in June 1997 in a botched robbery attempt that the police said had been carried out by a former student and another man.
John Chambers, the chief executive of Cisco, who spoke at the news conference by a video link, said that to keep high-tech jobs in the United States, school systems needed to do a better job educating students. "The K to 12 and university system is not preparing our students for the jobs of the 21st century," he said.
Schools Chancellor Rudy Crew said the program was an example of how businesses could help prepare students for the job market.
"The long-term engine for our economy is sitting in our classroom now," he said.
Cisco has sponsored programs to teach computer networking at high schools and colleges nationwide, but this is the first time it has found a corporate partner to expand the program, Mr. Chambers said. Mr. Levin would not say how much money his company was spending on the program. Cisco said it has spent $20 million developing its curriculum, opening training centers and educating teachers since the program began in October 1997.
The New York City Board of Education, in partnership with Cisco, already offers the computer networking program in Stuyvesant High School and Thomas Edison High School.
The board hopes to expand to eight more beyond the schools Time Warner is sponsoring. Students at Thomas Edison in Queens began the Cisco program last winter. and 29 students are enrolled in the program this fall, said the teacher, Jose Otero. Those students spent the first days of the school year linking many of the computers at their school, he said.
"This is more hands on and more fun," said Sharaz Hasein, a 17-year-old senior. "We are building our own lab and constructing our own networks."

HEADLINE: Abroad at Home;
The Piper and the Tune

BYLINE: By ANTHONY LEWIS 

DATELINE: BOSTON

 BODY:
One political force is more determined than any other to drive President Clinton from office for his behavior, and the same force would be the big political gainer if he is removed. That is the Christian right.
Elizabeth Drew, writing in The Washington Post last week, said that the President "will be impeached." One reason, she said, is that "the ever-stronger Republican base, the Christian right, demands that it happen, and few Republicans will risk crossing them. This is more important to most Republicans than the President's job approval ratings." 
 Impeachment needs only a simple majority in the House. Conviction in the Senate, requiring a two-thirds vote, is much less likely. But even impeachment -- the course on which House Republicans seem to be set -- would have enormous consequences for our politics.
The Christian Coalition and other religious conservatives would become still more influential in the Republican Party. In recent years they have had a disproportionate voice in the writing of the party platform and in Presidential primaries. In the year 2000 they might well control the choice of the nominee.
George W. Bush, the centrist Governor of Texas whom many regard as the front-runner for 2000, said the other day that seeing Washington in its uproar over Monica Lewinsky made him wonder about running for President. In any event, he could have trouble winning the nomination in a convention dominated by the right, whatever his poll numbers.
The shift to the right would be just as consequential in Congressional policy terms. The social issues that mean so much to religious conservatives -- the issues that President Reagan pushed aside to concentrate on economic policy -- would come to the fore.
Abortion would be targeted for a range of new restrictions, including even a constitutional amendment to outlaw it. And concern with sexual matters would not be likely to stop there. There would be legislation to limit U.S. help for population control efforts around the world. Federal regulations to give equal treatment to homosexuals would be another target. The law forbidding grants to "indecent" art could be expanded to other fields.
Criminal law is another possible area for punitive moralism. House Republicans have already acted under cover of the Lewinsky turmoil to try to sneak a harsh new measure on juvenile crime onto the statute books. They have attached to a non-controversial bill a rider requiring the states, among other things, to put more children in prison with adult criminals.
If you think about all those things, it is clear that there is an effort under way to bring about a fundamental change in the political direction of this country, effectively changing the results of our last two national elections. It would be a coup d'etat.
Long before Linda Tripp gave her tapes to Kenneth Starr, there really was a right-wing conspiracy of sorts to bring down this President. Richard Mellon Scaife gave The American Spectator millions for its Arkansas Project to find dirt on Bill Clinton. Crazies spread tales that he was involved in murder and drug-smuggling. Conservative groups financed Paula Jones's lawsuit against the President. (Her lawyers hired as investigators members of a Texas church that tried to remove "Moby Dick" and "To Kill a Mockingbird" from the local high school reading list.)
It was President Clinton's arrogant folly that opened the way for the religious right and others long frustrated in their desire to destroy him. And they are dead serious in their determination to exploit the opportunity he gave them.
The outside world looks with astonishment at what is happening here. A columnist of The Financial Times of London, Philip Stevens, put it: "As the days pass, the proposition that the most powerful nation on earth could sacrifice its leader to lies about his sex life becomes ever more eccentric."
Many Americans who do not agree with the religious right -- who want this to remain an open and tolerant society -- are unhappy about President Clinton's conduct. But as we consider how to deal with it, we have to be aware of the political consequences.

HEADLINE: (Loosely) Managed Care Is in Demand;
Provider Plans Zooming Over Restrictive H.M.O.'s

BYLINE: By MILT FREUDENHEIM 

 BODY:
Some of the hottest, fastest-growing managed health care plans are turning out to be the ones that are hardly managed at all.
Unlike health maintenance organizations, which typically try to keep tight control over their members by requiring them to funnel all requests for specialized care through a single doctor, the minimal health plans try to keep costs in check mostly by persuading doctors and hospitals to agree to reduced fees. 
 The loosely managed plans, called preferred provider organizations, or P.P.O.'s, are not new, but their popularity is surging -- as they take customers away from the traditional unlimited fee-for-service plans as well as from the more restrictive H.M.O.'s.
The members of P.P.O.'s can go to any doctor without asking permission, although it costs them more to go to physicians and hospitals outside the organization's network.
H.M.O.'s -- managed care plans that depend on elaborate sets of rules to govern their payments -- also usually negotiate discounted fees by hospitals and specialist physicians.
But in most plans, members must use the network physicians for primary care and, to see a specialist, must get approval from a primary doctor called a gatekeeper.
Some H.M.O.'s are even more restrictive, relying on staff physicians to provide primary and specialized care at in-house clinics.
"Consumers are demanding wide choice, and health plans are scrambling to offer it," said Dr. William Roper, a former managed care executive who is dean of the School of Public Health of the University of North Carolina.
There is the risk, though, that what consumers want will eventually send overall health care costs soaring again. As more people reject the restrictive H.M.O.'s for the relative freedom of preferred provider plans, questions arise as to whether quality health care can be delivered at reasonable cost. Meanwhile, some H.M.O.'s that have tried to compete by being more flexible have run into serious financial trouble.
At the center of all the changes is the fading of the gatekeeper concept -- which was supposed not just to control costs but also to improve care by having one person, the primary doctor, generally in charge of a member's entire treatment.
Now, some say that the H.M.O. gatekeepers themselves are increasingly liberal about allowing tests and visits to specialists and thus have become an expensive layer in the networks' administrative costs. With hospital and physician costs starting to rise after several years of flat costs or only tiny increases, some skeptics even question whether the gatekeepers and other management techniques of H.M.O.'s really deserve credit for keeping inflation in check.
"What if, when all the smoke about savings clears, all the savings were accomplished by means of the discounts?" asked John Erb, a consultant in Boca Raton, Fla., with Arthur J. Gallagher & Company. "Those 25 percent to 30 percent discounts from hospitals and physicians may be the source of the savings that we've seen over the last five years."
The P.P.O. surge in popularity -- nationally, the provider plans now have 40 percent more members than H.M.O.'s -- has won new respect for the networks. "Five years ago, people viewed preferred provider organizations as a dying breed, a transition" to H.M.O.'s, Dr. Roper said. "Now we are seeing a resurgence in interest in more loose arrangements."
Health maintenance organizations are also gaining members, but much more slowly than the provider organizations.
Nationally, preferred provider organizations have 105 million members and H.M.O.'s have 75 million, said Karen M. Ignagni, president of the American Association of Health Plans, a managed care trade group. In the last five years, P.P.O.'s added 44 million members, while H.M.O.'s added 30 million.
One national survey of large employers, conducted by the KPMG Peat Marwick consulting firm, found this year that the proportion of employees in H.M.O.'s has dropped three percentage points from its peak, to 30 percent.
Even in California, a bastion of managed care, the big Wellpoint Health Networks says its provider organizations have been growing twice as fast as its health maintenance organizations. The insurer, one of the largest in the nation, says its provider organizations added 850,000 members last year for a total of four million. Its H.M.O.'s have 1.6 million members, up 300,000.
"Americans don't want to be told what to do," said Leonard D. Schaeffer, chairman of Wellpoint. "They want choice."
Aside from a monthly premium that is often subsidized by an employer, in a preferred provider network a member pays $5, $10 or $15 for an office visit to a doctor in the network. For doctors outside the network and some medical services, the costs are like those in traditional insurance -- after an annual deductible of a few hundred dollars, the member pays 20 percent of the charges.
A backlash led by disgruntled doctors and patients has pushed many tightly structured H.M.O. plans to relax their rules, blurring the line between H.M.O.'s and preferred provider plans.
These flexible H.M.O.'s, known as point-of-service plans, which permit members to go outside if they get permission from their H.M.O. primary doctors, are also growing but seem to be losing momentum, especially in the East.
Small companies say the preferred provider plans help them to recruit and retain employees. "We employ kids out of college who don't know doctors and can consult the network," said Steve Kantor, president of Gnossos Software in Washington, D.C., which has 25 employees.
A growing number of health maintenance organizations also allow members to consult specialists on their lists without first getting permission from a primary care doctor, or gatekeeper. Others, like Oxford Health Plans Inc., let members consult outside specialists who are not on the H.M.O. list, but members usually need advance approval from a gatekeeper doctor.
Big health insurers like the United Healthcare Corporation have moved millions of members from traditional fee-for-service plans, which typically pay full rates, to preferred provider plans. One in four of the 69.9 million members of Blue Cross and Blue Shield plans now have this type of coverage, compared with only one in 10 a decade ago.
A number of the point-of-service H.M.O.'s, notably Oxford Health Plans, have reported financial troubles that analysts say were brought on by difficulty in keeping track of costs when members go to doctors outside the plans' lists.
The outside doctors in these H.M.O.'s typically have little reason to hold back on consultations and tests, so costs may rise.
Moreover, administrative costs in health maintenance organizations can be twice as high as in provider networks, where patients make their own decisions without gatekeepers.
Whether H.M.O.'s are "worth the hassle and the administrative cost is coming into question," said Liz Rossman, vice president for benefits at Sears, Roebuck & Company. Although most of the 300,000 employees and their dependents that Sears covers are still in classic H.M.O.'s, the company plans to switch 40,000 from point-of-service H.M.O.'s and traditional fee-for-service plans to a preferred provider network on Jan. 1.
The provider plans are cheaper for employers, said Charles Wolcott, a vice president of Sony Music Entertainment, and "probably will have the same results in the delivery of care." Consulting a gatekeeper just adds one more layer of doctor bills, he said.
"Some H.M.O.'s have gotten unbelievably expensive" for employers, Ms. Rossman said. "The country is seeing for the first time actually sick people and older people in H.M.O.'s, and we are not seeing evidence of H.M.O.'s doing a particularly good job of managing care either."
On average around the country, preferred provider premiums for single employees are $175 a month this year, according to KPMG Peat Marwick. Point-of-service H.M.O.'s averaged $176, and the standard H.M.O.'s, $160.
But costs vary from city to city. "In some locations, preferred provider organizations will actually be less than some H.M.O.'s," Ms. Rossman said.
Gary Krueger, a benefits executive at Circuit City Stores, said a point-of-service plan that now covers 19,000 workers at the retail chain had not been effective in "getting people to the best-qualified provider and making sure they get the care they need."
Circuit City, based in Richmond, is replacing the point-of-service plan with a preferred provider network organized by Empire Blue Cross Blue Shield of New York.
Empire, which has 800,000 members in the provider organizations, is ending its point-of-service plans for all but its biggest customers, said Dr. Michael Stocker, president of the big New York-based insurer. Most are switching to preferred provider organizations.
Robert Marshall, a race track clerk for the New York Racing Association, said he tries to stay in his preferred provider network. When he broke a bone recently, he went to an emergency room in the network and paid only $35. "I had no problem with the coverage whatsoever," he said.
Some experts worry, though, that the benefits of H.M.O. care will be lost in the shuffle. Suzanne Mercure, an independent consultant in Falls Church, Va., said H.M.O.'s were more likely than networks of doctors to keep track of patients and collect information to help them deal with chronic problems like asthma and diabetes.
But in the end, it will probably mostly come down to price.
"Any consumer would probably prefer a P.P.O.," said William Sullivan, president of Oxford Health Plans. "But they are more expensive than H.M.O.'s. Members go ping-ponging around from specialist to specialist," adding to costs.
Oxford, which has one of the nation's biggest point-of-service H.M.O.'s, has been battered by big increases in medical costs. But Mr. Sullivan thinks the popularity of the preferred provider organizations will be dimmed as higher costs are passed along as higher premiums.
"Upper-middle-class people will be willing to pay more for the choice," said Jon Gabel, director of surveys at Peat Marwick. Health maintenance organizations will remain popular with people who are "more price sensitive," he said.

HEADLINE: In Dominican Republic, Isolated Areas Get Food

BYLINE: By JOSEPH B. TREASTER and RAYMOND HERNANDEZ 

DATELINE: SANTO DOMINGO, Dominican Republic, Sept. 28

 BODY:
A small plane chartered by the United States began airdropping parcels of food and water today to beleaguered people in villages and small towns that have been isolated for nearly a week by flood waters and broken bridges resulting from the hurricane that struck on Tuesday.
Late this afternoon the twin-engine turbo-prop plane swooped low over a village mired in mud and swampy water about 100 miles northwest of the capital. Hundreds of people frantically waved their arms, yelled and scrambled to retrieve the parcels of bread, cheese, chocolate and water. Some ripped open plastic wrappings and began to eat immediately. 
 "These bags don't contain so much, but it's gold when you haven't eaten for four or five days," said Franklin Polanco, a spokesman for the United States Embassy here.
Working in a stifling hot airplane hangar in the capital's domestic airport here, more than a dozen Peace Corps volunteers stuffed thousands of bags with food throughout the afternoon, breaking periodically to load them into the empty cabin of a small, twin-engine turbo-prop jet as it returned from each airdrop.
In one flight to a village of 15,000 people that has been cut off by flood waters for five days, Hurricane Georges's devastation could be seen for miles. Cattle and horses wandered aimlessly, the rivers were choked with mud. The tin roofs of houses had been ripped off and scattered about, trees and crops were flattened.
As the plane approached, villagers rushed it, sprinting across muddy fields, trampling through a river and, in a few cases, racing on horseback. Even after the plane dumped its load and began ascending, people chased it, waving their arms and shouting.
Dominican and United States officials estimated that as many as several hundred thousand people may have been cut off from the rest of the country by the hurricane and forced to survive on whatever food and water they had on hand before the storm hit.
With only four small helicopters -- and those not always in good operating order -- the Government of President Leonel Fernandez has been able to get relief supplies to only a small portion of those in need since the hurricane walloped the island in the most severe natural disaster here in nearly 20 years.
"This is a tragedy beyond our strength," said Adriano Tejada, the chief spokesman for President Fernandez.
Over the weekend, Government military trucks began delivering food, water, small electric generators and tin roofing materials in the capital and other towns and rural areas where the roads were not cut.
Two United States Army Black Hawk helicopters arrived this morning to help out and four more are expected on Tuesday.
As an initial response, the United Nations has provided 700 tons of food and hundreds of cisterns for drinking water.
The head of the United States Agency for International Development and several Clinton Administration Cabinet members, as well as a half-dozen members of Congress, are expected here this week.
One United States official said the Administration was close to agreement on providing about $20 million in aid to the Dominican Republic, more than twice the $9.2 million that had previously been allocated for all of 1998. The officials said $15 million was likely to go to other hard-hit Caribbean islands.
United States and Dominican officials estimate the cost of reconstruction here at $3 billion. The next most severely hit island, Puerto Rico, is expected to need $2 billion to rebuild.
Much of the capital was still without electricity today, as were many of the other hardest hit areas along the eastern coast of the country and the northwestern region stretching toward the border with Haiti.
The Government said two more bodies of people killed by the hurricane were found today, bringing the total dead to 203. Some Government officials said they did not expect the losses to rise much higher, but Adm. Ruben Paulino Alvarez, the chief of the Dominican armed forces, said 75 people were still unaccounted for.
"We don't have much confidence" that they will be found alive, Admiral Alvarez said.
Health officials said reports of eye infections and outbreaks of diarrhea, brought on by contaminated water, had been coming in from shelters housing several hundred thousand people who have lost their homes, as well as from elsewhere in the country. To counter the effects of diarrhea, Unicef has shipped in supplies for rehydration therapy.
With pools of stagnant water all over the country, the health officials said they were worried, too, about increases in dengue-fever, a mosquito-borne disease similar to malaria that is endemic to the Dominican Republic and Haiti.
The airdrops today were organized by Natalie Woodward, the head of the 150-person United States Peace Corps contingent in the Dominican Republic. With no other aircraft available and trucks useless because of debris thrown around by the hurricane, Ms. Woodward chartered a small, propeller-driven plane with civilian pilots using money provided by American aid. Peace Corps volunteers spent most of last night wrapping the food in two-pound packages, which they dropped like small, friendly bombs this morning.
Not sure that the food parcels would survive the fall of 300 to 400 feet from the small planes, some of the volunteers staged a test drop last night from the tallest building in Santo Domingo, a 24-story apartment house. Three out of four parcels were still in good condition after taking the nearly 250-foot plunge, said Michael Stanton, an American Embassy spokesman, so the Peace Corps workers "decided it was worth doing."
The small plane, usually used to carry tourists and businesspeople around the country, made four flights today, dropping about 2,500 food parcels.
It was far less food than was needed. "It's a small step," Mr. Stanton said, "but it's a start."

HEADLINE: Iraq Says It Won't Let U.N. Resume Spot Arms Checks

BYLINE: By BARBARA CROSSETTE 

DATELINE: UNITED NATIONS, Sept. 28

 BODY:
Iraq will not withdraw its ban on spot arms inspections, Deputy Prime Minister Tariq Aziz said today after a meeting with Secretary General Kofi Annan.
Iraq is seeking a comprehensive review of its relations with the United Nations. Mr. Aziz was apparently told at the meeting that Iraq must rescind the ban before any broad review is undertaken. The ban has already led the Security Council to suspend its regular reviews of the economic sanctions it has maintained against Iraq since 1990. 
 After the hourlong meeting, the Deputy Prime Minister repeated that Iraq had already complied with Security Council resolutions and that the sanctions should be lifted.
"Therefore the idea that Iraq should do this or that concession before the comprehensive review takes place is not legal and not logical," a visibly annoyed Mr. Aziz told reporters. He is expected to meet with Security Council members during the week and return for another session with Mr. Annan on Friday.
Hanging over these talks is an Iraqi threat to stop all cooperation with the inspectors. That would effectively shut down the most ambitious arms monitoring system ever established in a country that had violated international law. About 125 inspectors and staff members are still in Iraq, backed by a sophisticated array of soil, air and water samplers as well as on-site video cameras and surveillance aircraft.
The Iraqis, implacable foes of Israel, found some propaganda mileage today in an interview that Scott Ritter, a former American arms inspector whose specialty is detecting concealment, gave to the Israeli newspaper Haaretz. In that interview, Mr. Ritter was quoted as saying he had been working closely with the Israelis while he was a United Nations arms inspector.
Mr. Ritter was reported to have said he could not have done his job without Israeli help, since the Central Intelligence Agency had not been cooperative. He accused the C.I.A. of provoking an examination by the Federal Bureau of Investigation of whether he had given sensitive information to Israel.
Officials at the Special Commission say it is normal for member countries of the United Nations to assist the weapons inspection program. Israel, which bombed the Osirak nuclear reactor in Iraq in 1981, is known to have watched Iraq carefully.
Responding to Iraq's ban on spot inspections, on Sept. 9 the Security Council froze all future reviews of the sanctions imposed after Iraq invaded Kuwait in August 1990. Until those reviews resume, sanctions cannot be lifted. The regular reviews are separate from the comprehensive review that the Iraqis are seeking.
In recent weeks the Iraqis have been trying to move the issue away from the Security Council to the Secretary General's office, building on an agreement they struck with Mr. Annan in February, when he went to Baghdad to defuse a crisis.
But diplomats and United Nations officials say the Secretary General has refused to renew his direct involvement and has repeatedly sent the message to Baghdad that there can be no circumventing of Security Council resolutions and that spot inspections must resume.
Inspectors from the United Nations Special Commission, which looks for biological and chemical weapons and prohibited missile systems, and the International Atomic Energy Agency, which watches nuclear developments, say inspections are vital to the monitoring system.
Even after sanctions are lifted, the Security Council intends to keep the long-term surveillance in place, but inspectors say that to make that work, they must follow up with site visits when suspicious new information emerges from the monitoring.
Because Iraq continues to block inspections, the Security Council has made little effort to define exactly what a comprehensive review of sanctions would entail.
Suggestions range from a study of the ways that Iraqis have suffered under the embargo to a renewed look at Iraqi failures to account for missing Kuwaitis or to return property stolen during the Persian Gulf war, a review the United States insists on.
Americans who oppose an indefinite embargo against Iraq may soon find a new public ally in Denis Halliday, who until this week directed the "oil for food" program in Baghdad that allowed the Iraqis to sell limited amounts of oil to buy civilian goods.
Although Mr. Halliday, an Irish expert on development, was able to broaden considerably the aid Iraqis received, he became an opponent of sanctions during his tenure in Baghdad. He not only resigned his position there but also left the United Nations, and he is being sought as a speaker and for Congressional testimony, diplomats said here.
Today the United Nations announced the name of his replacement, Hans von Sponeck of Germany, a former official of the United Nations Development Program.

HEADLINE: New Regents Standards Will Hurt Weak Students, Study Says

BYLINE: By ANEMONA HARTOCOLLIS 

 BODY:
A science teacher predicts that if tough new state standards are implemented, the weakest students will be "thrown to the wolves." A principal laments that "many teachers can't write," let alone teach challenging material. Another administrator warns that immigrant students cannot be expected to know, say, that George Washington was the first President of the United States.
As high schools in New York City and throughout the state begin phasing in new graduation standards this year, a report released yesterday by a New York City civic group paints a dour picture of the current condition of education, especially in inner-city and rural schools. It predicts that many schools are setting up children for failure because the schools are not prepared to meet the new goals. 
 The report, by the Community Service Society, a nonprofit group dedicated to fighting poverty, argues that the new standards, while laudable, are being imposed willy-nilly and without enough money to back them up. It estimates that a huge infusion of cash -- $1.5 billion in New York City alone -- is needed to put the standards in place.
Among the obstacles that must be overcome, it says, are untrained teachers; overcrowded classes; students who need remedial work; immigrant students who are not familiar with American history, literature and language; bilingual teachers who are not proficient in English, and the lack of basic equipment like science laboratories.
"If large numbers of inner-city and rural kids can't meet these benchmarks, it means they have no place to go in the economy whatsoever," David R. Jones, president of the society, said yesterday. "You literally could take what's a great idea and turn it into a real negative for the state's kids."
Under the new standards -- imposed by the State Board of Regents and the State Education Commissioner, Richard P. Mills -- this year's class of 11th graders must pass an English Regents exam before graduating in the year 2000. The current class of sixth graders will have to pass all five Regents exams -- in English, math, United States history and government, global studies and science -- with a score of at least 65 percent.
In between, the exams will be phased in one at a time. Until now, students could take a much easier Regents Competency Exam to graduate, and often only the best students at the best schools would even attempt the Regents.
Interviews with principals and department heads from 18 schools found many struggling just to keep up with current requirements. "The state is just crazy," says one administrator, who like all those quoted by the report is not named. "They really need 10 years to do this."
Another predicts that "more and more students will have to work on their own, because we simply don't have the time," adding that the weakest students will sink to the bottom.
Still another says that no amount of training will be enough for some teachers, who he said are almost impossible to get rid of, adding, "I do have some teachers who I'd prefer not to teach Regents classes."
By far the largest single cost identified by the report -- $3,375 per high school student -- is for new facilities, including science and computer labs, Internet technology and the space needed to cut class sizes to the 24 students the report urges from 30.
The researcher who conducted the study, Gary Natriello, a professor of sociology and education at the Teachers College of Columbia University, said: "I know in New York City this is a sea change, but in most places when you talk about small classes you're talking 15. I didn't even think of these as class size reductions. I thought of them as standard classes."
Statewide, the report estimates that the cost of putting the new Regents standards in place will range from $2.7 billion to $3.5 billion, with more than half for new facilities.
The state's own estimate is much lower, at $66 million to $72 million for all schools in the state, Dr. Natriello said.
An Education Department spokesman, Bill Hershen, said: "There's no agreed-upon price. This is evolving over a year-by-year basis."

HEADLINE: State Offers Savings Plan For College

BYLINE: By KAREN W. ARENSON 

 BODY:
Joining a growing number of states that give tax breaks for college savings, New York inaugurated a program yesterday that allows parents to save thousands of dollars in state taxes as they put aside money for a child's college education.
The program offers some of the most generous terms and widest flexibility in the country, state officials said. Contributors can save money for the education of other relatives, friends or themselves, as well as their children. 
 Taxpayers who live or work in New York will be able to deduct a total of $5,000 a year from their taxable state income for contributions to one or more Family Tuition Accounts; couples can deduct up to $10,000 a year. Money put in the accounts -- and the interest earned on that money -- will not be subject to any New York State taxes. The interest earnings will also be protected from Federal income taxes until the money is withdrawn.
A couple making $40,000 a year or more and contributing the maximum of $10,000 would save $685 annually in state taxes.
The program allows for a maximum total contribution of $100,000 per student, which could grow substantially depending on how, and how long, the account is invested.
Unlike prepaid tuition programs that require savings be used at a particular college or in a particular state, New York will allow the money to be spent at any accredited college or university, professional or trade school, in the United States or abroad. The money can be used for tuition, books, room and board, and other educational fees.
"This is a pretty substantial tax deduction," said Robert Maurer, president of the New York State Higher Education Services Corporation, a state agency that will administer the program with the State Comptroller's office. "It's like having the state put up the first 7 cents of every dollar you save for college."
The legislation creating the savings program, which had bipartisan support in Albany, was signed into law by Gov. George E. Pataki in September 1997.
At a New York City ceremony to inaugurate the program yesterday, Sharon Steinhoff, a freelance editor, opened accounts for her 13-year-old twins, Sarah and Seth, who attend the Simon Baruch Middle School (M.S. 104) on East 21st Street.
"When you have twins, the first thing people say to you is, 'How are you going to pay for college?' " she told an audience that included the State Comptroller, H. Carl McCall, and Schools Chancellor Rudy Crew. "As a parent you don't want to have to put a cap, if you don't have to, on how much you're going to spend for a child's education."
Still, said Ms. Steinhoff, who herself attended Brown University, "up to this point, it didn't make sense to save."
"There were no benefits to gained from a tax perspective, or we had to lock up the money for a certain period," she said.
Now, she said, she and her husband would use the new accounts because of the tax benefits.
The cost of college rose sharply in the 1980's and early 90's, but has tapered off in the last several years to 3 percent to 5 percent a year, still slightly ahead of inflation. The average price last year for a four-year private institution was $21,424 for tuition, room and board, books and other fees, and $10,069 at a four-year public institution. Many students, however, pay less than that because of financial aid and scholarships.
State officials predict that in the first year alone, more than $135 million will be put into more than 50,000 accounts, for a tax savings of more than $22 million.
"We think this is going to be really big," Mr. Maurer said. "Everyone tells you you ought to save for college. People are going to want to do it because they want to see something there for their kids."
Other states, including Connecticut and New Hampshire, have set up college savings plans since the passage of Federal legislation last year that clearly established the Federal tax benefits for such programs. Federal taxes are deferred, and when earnings are withdrawn, they will be taxed at the student's Federal tax rate, which is often lower than the contributor's. The Federal rules also call for penalties if the money is not used as intended.
Under the New York plan, withdrawals will be subject to state and Federal taxes as well as a 10 percent penalty if the money is not used for qualified educational expenses. But any money not used by the intended beneficiary can remain in the account indefinitely or the contributor can shift it to another beneficiary in the same family.
The minimum investment to open an account is $250, or enrollment in a plan to deduct $25 a month from a checking account or an employer's payroll. An account must be open at least 36 months before money may be withdrawn.
People who pay income taxes in New York City or Yonkers would also see their city taxes reduced when they make contributions because those taxes are based on the calculation of taxable income they make for the state.
The tuition accounts will be managed by TIAA-CREF, a nonprofit financial services organization that manages more than $230 billion, including pension fund accounts for many university professors. It will invest the accounts in a mix of stocks, bonds and money market funds.
At the ceremony yesterday at Baruch Middle School, students from two social studies classes peppered the Comptroller with questions. One savvy seventh grader asked if people could lose money if their account was invested in stocks.
"It is true that investments aren't guaranteed, but TIAA-CREF is an excellent organization with a proven investment track record," Mr. McCall said.
He added: "People ask me when to invest. I say when you bring the child home from the hospital."
Dr. Crew said that when he was touring schools during the opening days of the school year, he asked children what they would be doing eventually. Most of the time, he said he got one answer. "Inevitably they would say, 'I'm going to college.' "
"My job is to make it possible for you academically to go where you want to," he continued. "I also know the other half of that is your parents are trying to figure out, 'How do we get this tuition bill paid?' Now with this program, they have an answer."
New York officials said that money in the college savings accounts would not be counted when students apply for state-administered financial aid programs for students, but might be taken into account in other scholarship programs.
Information about how to open an account is available over the Internet at www.nysaves.org or by calling 1-877-NYSAVES. A national clearinghouse of state plans is also available at www.collegesavings.org.

This Race Was for the National League Mild Card

BYLINE: By Murray Chass 

DATELINE: CHICAGO

 BODY:
The second most exciting race of the season was decided here last night. That doesn't say much for the competitive part of the year.
The final spot in the post-season playoffs, the National League wild-card berth, was filled by the Chicago Cubs, who beat the San Franciso Giants, 5-3, in a playoff game that was the culmination of a race that no team could win because no team was good enough to win it.
The Mets certainly weren't. With a week to go in the season, with only five games to play, the Mets led the wild-card race. They were one game ahead of the Cubs, four ahead of the Giants.
It doesn't take a doctorate in calculus to figure out that to be bad enough to squander a four-game lead with five games to play, the leading team has to lose just about every game. That's exactly what the Mets did. They lost every game.
If they had won just one of those five games, the Mets would have played San Francisco at Shea Stadium yesterday. Then, if they had won that game, they would have played the Cubs at Shea Stadium today. Then maybe they would have joined Atlanta, Houston and San Diego in the post-season playoffs.
If the Mets had won two of those final five games, beating the downtrodden Montreal Expos last Tuesday and Wednesday, for example, the Giants and the Chicago Cubs would not have played at Wrigley Field last night. There would have been no need for a playoff for the playoffs.
But the Mets turned out to be too mediocre to alter the course of October events.
And what about those mighty Giants and Chicago Cubs, the teams that benefited from the Mets' ultimate failure? In the final week, they each squandered a 7-0 lead in a game. If either team had held its hefty lead, it would have advanced as the wild-card team, instead of meeting in a playoff game that automatically took on an air of excitement because playoff games are supposed to be exciting.
To his credit, Jim Riggleman, the Cubs' manager, absolved the Giants of their squandering while not taking his team off the hook.
"Their loss was different," he said before the playoff game. "They lost their game in Colorado. Watching their score, when it was 7-0, at that point in the game you figure they may score 14 or Colorado may score 10 or 12. You just can't figure the score is going to stay anything close to what it is in the fourth. You figure it's going to be hugely different."
The Cubs, on the other hand, blew their 7-0 lead in the seventh inning in Milwaukee.
"Our loss was probably more painful than theirs," Riggleman said. "We had a 7-0 lead in a normal atmosphere of a ball park. No crazy conditions, light air, ball flying all over the place. We should've been able to hold that lead. In Colorado you can never really fault yourself for giving up a lead."
The Cubs at least won two of their last five games to get to a playoff game, though they could not win the game they needed on the last day to avoid a playoff. The Giants didn't win the last game either, but they won their first six in the last week of the season.
Peter Magowan, the Giants' proud owner, rejected any suggestion that the playoff for the playoffs was a matchup born of mediocrity.
"We've won 9 out of 11, even with the loss yesterday," Magowan said outside the visiting clubhouse, "so don't tell me this is a bunch of losers that are showing up to play this game. If we win this game, we've won 90 games. What did the Indians win this year?"
Touche. The Indians won 89 and a division title. Not to mention that a year ago the wild-card Florida Marlins were about to embark on a course that would make them World Series champions.
"The wild card gives a lot of teams a chance for post-season play that otherwise wouldn't have been able to be there because of economics," Magowan said, casting a vote for the continued existence of wild-card teams. He also cited the increased September attendance of teams in the wild-card races.
Does that mean baseball should expand the wild-card format, the way the National Football League did? No, Magowan said firmly. One wild-card team in each league is enough. Riggleman didn't campaign for any format, but he also didn't think any losses leading up to the playoff for the playoffs, including those on the final day of the season, detracted from the show at Wrigley Field last night.
"The bottom line is," the manager said, "this game will be remembered, not that both clubs lost yesterday. I certainly know if we were going to play this game tonight, I'd want it to be because both teams won, not because both teams lost."
In retrospect, the only real excitement of the season should have been for Mark McGwire and Sammy Sosa. No one should have become excited over a race of also-rans.

AMERICAN EXPRESS TO BUY BACK $3.28 BILLION IN SHARES

BYLINE: Dow Jones 

 BODY:
The American Express Company said yesterday that it would repurchase an additional 40 million shares, or $3.28 billion in stock, expanding a four-year buyback program. The New York-based company said the new repurchases represented about 9 percent of its 456.8 million shares outstanding. Under the existing 100-million-share buyback program, begun in September 1994, American Express has repurchased 89.5 million shares. The New York-based company, which has assets of about $120 billion, said it would use the repurchased shares to "offset share issuances under employee compensation plans and to increase economic value for shareholders." Shares of American Express rose $2.50 each, to $83, on the New York Stock Exchange.

LEVI STRAUSS IS CLOSING TWO FINISHING PLANTS IN TEXAS

BYLINE: AP 

 BODY:
Levi Strauss & Company is closing two finishing centers in West Texas as part of the jeans maker's attempts to cut costs. Levi, a closely held San Francisco-based manufacturer, said yesterday that it would shut plants in Amarillo and El Paso by the end of the year, although it will continue to pay the 990 employees who will lose their jobs through May 1999. Levi Strauss will continue to operate its finishing center in San Antonio, which employs 680 workers. The finishing plants, which are responsible for washing, rinsing, dyeing, pressing and inspecting garments, have not had enough work to do since Levi Strauss closed 10 sewing plants earlier this year.

HEADLINE: A Top Iranian Aide Rejects U.S. Overture on New Ties

BYLINE: By ELAINE SCIOLINO 

 BODY:
Iran's Foreign Minister, Kamal Kharrazi, yesterday rebuffed the offer by the United States to draw up a "road map" to re-establish relations between the two countries, accusing the Clinton Administration of an outdated policy of hostility toward his country.
In a calm voice in a speech to the Asia Society, Mr. Kharrazi noted a "new tone" toward Iran on the part of President Clinton and Secretary of State Madeleine K. Albright. 
 But he added that "sole reliance on variation in verbiage can simply not provide the necessary basis for an invitation to political dialogue."
Mr. Kharrazi, a former representative to the United Nations who earned a doctorate in education at the University of Houston, is a close adviser of Iran's reformist President, Mohammed Khatami.
The address was intended as an official response to Ms. Albright's speech before the organization in June in which she called on Iran to join in drawing up the road map to normal relations. But her failure to offer any specific initiative or policy shift irritated Iranian officials, who said there was no incentive to begin a political dialogue with Washington.
Mr. Kharrazi reiterated that position yesterday, making no effort to disguise his displeasure at American policy toward Iraq and reciting a litany of actions that he said indicated Washington's "cold war mentality."
The policies of the United States and its lack of commitment to change are "hardly compatible with the proposal to develop a road map to change the state of affairs," Mr. Kharrazi said. "This is because there is no ground for political negotiations while these policies continue."
The Administration sent a number of senior officials to New York to hear Mr. Kharrazi. They included Thomas R. Pickering, Under Secretary of State for Political Affairs; Martin S. Indyk, Assistant Secretary of State for Near Eastern Affairs; Wendy Sherman, a senior State Department adviser, and David Welch, a Middle East specialist and Mr. Indyk's chief deputy.
"It did not offer a road map for the future," Mr. Pickering said of the speech. But he said that "the most important and interesting thing is it is clearly a step forward to have the Foreign Minister of Iran come to the United States and make a speech" that responded to the Secretary of State.
Cyrus R. Vance, who was Secretary of State in the Carter Administration and during Iran's 1979 revolution, said simply, "It was a very tough speech." Mr. Vance resigned as Secretary of State after the failed American military mission in 1980 to free Americans held hostage by Iran's revolutionary government.
Mr. Kharrazi made these criticisms:
*The United States lacks "a commitment to international law" because of its imposition of sanctions against Iran and dozens of other countries around the world.
*The United States is "retarding economic prosperity of Iran and the region" by its policy of obstructing the building of a pipeline through Iran to ship oil and gas from Central Asia and the Caucasus.
*The United States is trying to "sabotage" Iran's efforts to play a role in promoting regional stability.
*The covert program approved by Congress to destabilize Iran and the recent creation of a Persian-language radio station "to wage a propaganda war" against Iran are evidence of American "interference in internal affairs of Iran."
Mr. Kharazi also criticized Ms. Albright for defending American support for the late Shah Mohammed Riza Pahlevi in her speech to the Asia Society as an "attempt to justify the wrongful past," and blamed the United States for the C.I.A.-sponsored coup that restored the monarchy in 1953.
Mr. Kharrazi defended what he called his country's war on drug trafficking, its opposition to terrorism and its determination to prevent the spread of nuclear weapons. But there was no direct overture to cooperate with the United States.
Still, Mr. Pickering said that Mr. Kharrazi "held the door open on a number of subjects that are of great interest to us: counter-narcotics, antiterrorism and weapons of mass destruction."
The Administration characterizes Iran as the world's most active sponsor of terrorism, a developer of nuclear weapons and long-range missiles and a violator of human rights.
Mr. Kharrazi's speech was underwritten by the American oil company Conoco, which was on the verge of signing a billion-dollar deal to develop Iranian oil and gas fields when the Clinton Administration blocked it.

HEADLINE: France Worries as New German Leader Stresses Ties to Britain

BYLINE: By CRAIG R. WHITNEY 

DATELINE: PARIS, Sept. 29

 BODY:
Faced with the prospect of a German Chancellor who believes that his country's relations with London will be at least as important as its ties with Paris, France is filled with anxiety about being taken seriously enough by its powerful eastern neighbor.
Gerhard Schroder, who unseated Helmut Kohl in German elections on Sunday, lost no time in moving to reassure his allies across the Rhine. He accepted an invitation to lunch at Elysee Palace on Wednesday with President Jacques Chirac and a meeting with Prime Minister Lionel Jospin immediately afterward. 
In an article published this morning in the French daily Le Figaro and the German daily Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung, Mr. Chirac expressed concern that a German leader who had none of the complexes born of World War II might take France too much for granted. "Now that the geopolitical context has been radically transformed since the end of the cold war, some ask if the relationship has lost its reason for being," Mr. Chirac wrote. "Our two peoples give the impression of not knowing each other so well, of coming together with less spontaneity."
Underlying the French concern is fear that unless the French-German relationship is revitalized, France may have difficulty steering the Germans on a European course of French design.
Mr. Schroder's generation may no longer feel the sense of obligation to right historical wrongs that was a central characteristic of Mr. Kohl's era, Mr. Chirac said. "Our bilateral relationship may seem less intense," he wrote. "The emotion of reconciliation, so strong for those who went before us, is attenuating with the passing of the generations."
For France, the French-German relationship is the keystone of the whole European edifice, and Germany's support of France's ambition for a global strategic, economic and political role for the European Union is crucial. Germany will hold the rotating chair of the group for six months starting in January.
Even the common European currency that will be introduced next year, the euro, is seen by Mr. Chirac and others as chance to challenge the dominance of the dollar, an ambition that, as a former Bundesbank president, Karl-Otto Pohl, has pointed out, is shared by few in Germany.
For Germany, good relations with the United States during the cold war were as important as those with France. "Do not force us to choose between Paris and Washington," German officials often pleaded with their French and American counterparts when, as so often, France's cultural, economic and political goals clashed with America's.
That was Mr. Kohl's stand for 16 years. But France is not so sure what Mr. Schroder's position will be.
The Chancellor-designate was reassuring in an interview with French Europe 1 radio the day after his election. "My personal relationship with France is much better than the press believes," he said. "The Franco-German axis is of historic importance and will remain the most important axis in Europe."
But he added that reinforcing links between Germany and Britain would make the core European relationship three-sided rather than two-sided in the future.
With Prime Minister Tony Blair of the Labor Party running Britain and a Social Democrat now in charge of Germany, some members of France's Socialist-led Government see a chance for new European initiatives to tackle the Continent's double-digit unemployment rates without worrying as much about inflation as Mr. Kohl's conservatives did.
One thing the French clearly expect Mr. Schroder to do is to keep insisting, as Mr. Kohl began to do in the last year or so, that Germany can no longer be the European Union's rich uncle. Mr. Kohl said Germany would not keep paying in almost $16 billion more than it got out of European Union programs, and the French do not expect Mr. Schroder to take a different line. "It's part of the normalization of Germany," the French Foreign Minister, Hubert Vedrine, said recently. "Since unification, Germany doesn't have to be the good boy of Europe any more."
Reworking expensive longstanding subsidies for European agriculture -- arrangements that are still highly beneficial to French farmers -- is expected to be difficult, and Mr. Schroder will give his views in a meeting with other European Union leaders in Austria on Oct. 24 and 25.
One thing the French would like is for the Germans to work with them to strengthen the distinct cultural, social and economic cohesion of Europe and resist the encroachments of "globalism," a menace the French believe to be incorporated in the Anglo-Saxon entrepreneurial ethic.

HEADLINE: For Pakistan And India, Atom Pact Is Hard Sell

BYLINE: By CELIA W. DUGGER 

DATELINE: NEW DELHI, Sept. 29

 BODY:
For the Prime Ministers of India and Pakistan to follow through on their stated willingness to sign the nuclear test-ban treaty, both men will need to convince their restive publics that they got something substantial in return.
The response to their speeches at the United Nations General Assembly last week, in which they said their countries were ready to sign the treaty within a year if sanctions against them were lifted, was optimistic in the United States. But political and policy analysts here paid more attention to the conditions each man set, and in India's case especially, it is far from certain that those conditions would be met. 
 Pakistan's Prime Minister, Nawaz Sharif, and India's, Atal Behari Vajpayee, face politically insecure futures and would pay a high price with voters if they signed the treaty without bringing home the goods.
Mr. Sharif's political fortunes have swooned since the United States imposed economic sanctions on his country after it tested nuclear weapons in May, seriously worsening Pakistan's bleak economic prospects. Not surprisingly, he declared he would sign the treaty only if the United States lifts the economic sanctions and helps Pakistan get an aid package to prevent its default on $30 billion in debt.
The week before he went to New York, Mr. Sharif sought legislative approval to sign the treaty, but many members of Parliament were unwilling to give him the go-ahead without a specific description of what Pakistan would get in return. And the United States will be unable to give Mr. Sharif what he asked for unless Congress either gives the President authority to waive sanctions or removes them itself, and so far only the Senate has agreed to a waiver.
Mr. Vajpayee, whose Bharatiya Janata Party heads a fragile coalition Government, has an even more complicated task.
For many years there has been a broad consensus in India against signing the treaty. Some officials said India needed the freedom to test so it could develop a credible nuclear deterrent against Pakistan and China; others said India should not sign until the five declared nuclear powers agreed to move decisively toward global disarmament.
"The B.J.P. doesn't have much room to do a deal without getting important concessions," said Brahma Chellaney, a national security analyst at the Center for Policy Research, a nonprofit research group in New Delhi. "And it's not clear what the Americans can offer. The President has been weakened and Congress is hostile."
What India wants from the United States -- for example, the opportunity to buy advanced technology from the United States -- will be difficult for the United States to give without seeming to reward India for having tested nuclear weapons in May. The grueling negotiations between India and the United States since the tests have yet to resolve this and many other knotty issues.
Nor is the United States willing to lift sanctions, much less make other serious concessions, if all Pakistan and India do is sign the test ban treaty. American negotiators want both countries to halt their production of weapons-grade plutonium and uranium, the stuff of bombs -- something Pakistan is especially reluctant to do.
In a speech on Monday to the Asia Society in New York, a dour Mr. Vajpayee made clear India's resentment of Washington's angry denunciations of the nuclear tests, while the established nuclear powers have ignored India's pleas for disarmament.
"They first used the cold war as a pretext for a costly arms race," he said. "Now, even though the cold war is over, they have sought to perpetuate their hegemony through discriminatory nonproliferation treaties which are bound to fail."
And he justified India's nuclear tests "as a powerful challenge to the practitioners of nuclear apartheid."
Mr. Vajpayee was surely playing to his audience back home, but the anger in India is real.
Even the coolest-headed intellectuals ask why China, an authoritarian Government that has exported nuclear technology to India's archrival Pakistan and has a terrible human rights record, is allowed to buy American satellites and other technology while India, the world's largest democracy, is not.
India's nuclear scientists have recently declared that India can go ahead and sign the test-ban treaty without damaging its weapons program.
The tests conducted in May provided them with what they needed to know, they said.
And while those assurances may ultimately help Mr. Vajpayee make the case domestically for signing the treaty, they will not be enough by themselves.

An Internet buying service is planning to book hotel rooms for guests at prices they propose.

BYLINE: By Janet Piorko 

 BODY:
PRICELINE.COM, the Internet buying service that tries to book flights for travelers at prices they propose, is planning to do the same thing with hotels starting next month.
According to Jay Walker, vice chairman of the company, rooms will be offered by late October at more than 1,000 hotels in 26 cities nationwide, including Dallas, Houston, New York, Los Angeles, San Francisco, Chicago, Denver, Seattle, Boston and Washington. The company hopes to add more United States cities later this year and international destinations next year. Mr. Walker would not name the participating hotels but said all would be major chain properties. 
 The process will be similar to the way Priceline books airline seats. Using the company's World Wide Web site (www.priceline.com), travelers will select a city and a geographical zone within it, travel dates, the amount of money they are willing to pay and a minimum category of hotel desired. The categories, from two star to five star, will be described on the site. The company's computer will scan its data base in an attempt to find a hotel that will accept the named price; the request will be accepted or rejected within an hour.
Travelers are guaranteed the minimum category of room chosen; in turn they must take the hotel assigned. They will not know the specific hotel (or its location, except for the broad geographical zone) until the reservations are confirmed and paid for, Mr. Walker said.
Reservations will be accepted up to a year in advance but no later than 48 hours ahead. There will be no fee to consumers.
Priceline, based in Stamford, Conn., has sold more than 60,000 economy-class airline seats, most of them domestic, since it introduced that service in April, according to Mr. Walker. Critics have asserted that most major domestic airlines do not participate in the program; Brian Ek, a company spokesman, responded, "We're offering tickets through major airlines, but we cannot say what they are." Passengers must be willing to travel anytime between 6 A.M. and 10 P.M. and make one stopover; they cannot choose their airline, and they earn no frequent-flier points. Priceline, which recently added a car-buying service in the New York area, received a patent last month for its method and use of "buyer driven commerce."
 
New Swiss Airline
A new airline, Swiss World Airways, began service earlier this month between Newark and Geneva, with flights every day except Wednesday. The president and chief executive of the company is Peter A. Leishman, who formerly helped found two British low-fare start-ups, Debonair and Easyjet.
The Geneva-based airline received approval from the Department of Transportation only a few days before it started flying, according to Mr. Leishman, and is only now getting its flights into the computer reservations systems used by travel agents. Swiss World Airways' Boeing 767 -- the airline currently has just one jet, which it leases -- seats 159 passengers in three classes.
One-way unrestricted fares range from $167 to $530 in economy class, $667 to $1,000 in business class and $1,267 to $2,000 in first class.
The carrier offers a few unconventional twists. Food service consists of mostly cold choices to avoid reheating, with only one hot entree cooked on board. Travelers flying on discount fares pay for food, drinks and headsets; full-fare travelers get them free. The frequent-flier program consists of instant lottery-style tickets offering a gift or a premium that applies to the next flight.
The airline hopes to add a second flight to Geneva from New York in November, via Basel, and service from Dulles International Airport or Baltimore-Washington International Airport next spring.
The toll-free worldwide reservations number is (011-800-11) 767-767.
 
Shuttle's New Boston Home
The US Airways Shuttle is scheduled to move on Sunday from Terminal A at Logan International Airport in Boston to the newly renovated Terminal B. The new shuttle gates will be 10, 12 and 13 at the end of the concourse. Counters for ticketing and check-in will be next to the security checkpoint at the entrance to the main concourse and at the gates. The shuttle offers 17 daily round-trip flights between Logan and La Guardia Airport in New York, as well as 15 daily flights between Ronald Reagan Washington National Airport and La Guardia.
 
Train to the Plane
A rail link from Copenhagen International Airport to the Central Railway Station downtown opened Sunday. The seven-mile trip takes 11 minutes and costs $2.60, compared with a taxi fare of around $20. The train terminal is underneath the airport's departure and arrival halls.
 
Hotel Update
Two new hotels on the hip side are scheduled to open tomorrow, one in Chicago and one in Denver.
The House of Blues Hotel, a Loews Hotel, at the Marina City riverfront complex in Chicago, is the first in a series planned by House of Blues Hospitality. The 367 guest rooms will offer in-room faxes, CD players, videocassette recorders, voice mail and two-line phones, as well as direct Internet access via TV sets. Meetings and other events can be arranged in the House of Blues Music Hall and Restaurant next door; the complex also has a 36-lane bowling center and a health club.
In downtown Denver, the 189-room Hotel Monaco is situated at 1717 Champa Street in two renovated adjoining buildings, the 1917 Railway Exchange Building and the 1937 Art Moderne Title Building. Rooms will have CD players and two-line phones with data ports for computers. The hotel is part of the Kimpton Hotel and Restaurant Group.

HEADLINE: THE MARKETS;
Most Borrowers in U.S. Can Expect to Benefit

BYLINE: By SHARON R. KING 

 BODY:
The Federal Reserve's decision yesterday to lower interest rates for the first time since January 1996 should translate into lower borrowing rates on many consumer loans and keep mortgage rates for home purchases and refinancings below 7 percent at least through the end of the year, economists said.
The reduction of a quarter of a percentage point, to 5.25 percent, in the target for the Federal funds rate was smaller than had been widely anticipated. But the impact is enough to keep 30-year fixed-rate mortgages below 7 percent in 1998 and possibly through 1999, said Robert Barr, a senior economist at Fannie Mae, the Congressionally chartered private company that helps finance mortgages. 
 The Mortgage Bankers Association of America, a trade group, has an even more optimistic forecast, estimating that rates could drop as low as 6.25 percent before the year ends.
Mortgage rates are at their lowest levels in a generation but have not fallen as much as yields on Treasury securities, the benchmarks for calculating rate trends.
One reason is that strong investor demand for Treasuries as a safe haven from turbulent markets has pushed those yields lower.
The average rate on a 30-year fixed-rate mortgage was about 6.64 percent in the week ended Sept. 25, the 15th consecutive week of rates below 7 percent, according to Freddie Mac, the mortgage company. That level was 2.07 percentage points higher than the 4.57 percent yield on 10-year Treasury securities. On average, 30-year fixed mortgage rates are usually about 1.5 percentage points higher than the yield on 10-year Treasury notes.
That gap could narrow as Treasury rates stabilize near historic lows and mortgage rates slip, Mr. Barr said.
This year, new mortgages for home purchases and refinancings are expected to hit a record $1.4 trillion, said Brian Carey, an economist at the Mortgage Bankers Association.
After the Fed's move yesterday, Norwest Bank in Minneapolis cut its prime lending rate, and others were expected to follow. The prime rate is a benchmark for other consumer and corporate loans, like credit cards, auto loans and small-business loans. The prime rate, 8.5 percent at most banks, should fall by at least a quarter-point, analysts estimate. Banks may also cut the interest rates they pay on savings accounts and certificates of deposit.
On average, savings accounts paid interest of about 2.17 percent in April, according to Bank Rate Monitor, a research firm in North Palm Beach, Fla., that reports savings account rates twice a year. One-year certificates of deposit at banks paid an average rate of 4.69 percent as of Monday.
Consumers with such loans as adjustable-rate mortgages and home equity lines of credit tied to the prime rate could see the impact of lower rates within the next few months, said Keith Gumbinger, vice president of HSH Associates, a financial research firm in Butler, N.J.

HEADLINE: Expert for Microsoft Helps Fight One of Its Subpoenas

BYLINE: By STEVE LOHR 

 BODY:
The software industry is a notoriously fast, fluid business, with today's friend becoming tomorrow's foe. So too, it seems, for the industry's most famous defendant, the Microsoft Corporation, in its pretrial preparations.
Microsoft recently selected Richard Schmalensee, a distinguished economist and professor at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, as its expert witness to explain why the huge software company is a national asset and not a monopolistic predator. He will testify before Judge Thomas Penfield Jackson of the United States District Court in Washington, who will hear the antitrust case filed against Microsoft by the Government and 20 states. 
 But Mr. Schmalensee is also helping to fight a subpoena filed last week by Microsoft's lawyers in preparation for the trial, scheduled to begin Oct. 15. M.I.T. and Harvard University filed a motion on Friday in a Federal court in Boston to stop Microsoft from obtaining the interview tapes and transcripts for a book written by two business school professors, one from M.I.T. and the other from Harvard.
As the acting dean of M.I.T.'s Sloan School of Management, Mr. Schmalensee told Michael A. Cusumano, a Sloan professor of management and co-author of the book, to fiercely resist the Microsoft subpoena. "He put on his dean's hat and advised me not to hand anything over," Mr. Cusumano said.
An assistant to Mr. Schmalensee said yesterday that he was unavailable for comment.
The book research sought by Microsoft involves nearly 200 hours of tape-recorded sessions and more than 2,000 pages of interview transcripts with current and former executives of the Netscape Communications Corporation. The Microsoft legal team wants the materials to try to show that Microsoft's rise in the market for Internet browsing software was more a result of Netscape's mistakes than of any misconduct by Microsoft.
In a ruling on another subpoena, Microsoft won a round yesterday. Judge Jackson ordered that the Oracle Corporation had to hand over to Microsoft documents concerning agreements it has with other companies, including Apple Computer, I.B.M. and others. Microsoft is seeking the information to try to show that Microsoft meetings the Government has characterized as efforts to thwart competition are actually commonplace in the industry, where competitors often cooperate.
The book, which will be shipped by Simon & Schuster to stores within days of the start of the trial, is titled "Competing on Internet Time: Lessons from Netscape and Its Battle with Microsoft." The other author is David B. Yoffie, a professor at Harvard Business School.
The book does document Netscape's missteps, but Mr. Yoffie said he also thought that Microsoft's extremely aggressive business practices in the Internet software market had almost invited a strong reaction from the Government.
Emphasizing that he was not making a legal judgment, Mr. Yoffie said, "I think Microsoft could have achieved 90 percent of what it did without crossing the line as much as it did."
It will be up to the Federal courts to decide whether Microsoft violated any laws. But legal experts said that pointing out the mistakes of competitors was a standard line of defense in antitrust cases. It was used successfully in private antitrust cases by Xerox in the 1970's and Eastman Kodak in the 1980's.
"It's the shot-yourself-in-the-foot defense," said Stephen M. Axinn, a leading antitrust litigator. "Microsoft will argue that it is not a predatory monopolist but that Netscape was its own worst enemy."
Yet the court will have a great measure of discretion on how much of a role competitor information will play in the case. It could weigh heavily, or the court could decide that the real issue is not Netscape's mistakes but Microsoft's use of its market power, Mr. Axinn said.
Harvard and M.I.T. assert that Microsoft's subpoena of the writers' materials poses a threat to the First Amendment rights of the authors and to the integrity of academic research. The Harvard Business School curriculum, Mr. Yoffie observed, is based on case studies of corporations. The quality of that work, he added, rests on the ability of the researchers to assure corporate executives that confidential information will remain confidential.
"Our whole research process at Harvard is put at risk by this," Mr. Yoffie said.
Microsoft obtained a copy of the manuscript in early September through a subpoena issued to Netscape. The authors had given a couple of Netscape executives copies of the manuscript to read and review confidentially. On Sept. 18, Microsoft asked the authors to hand over their tapes and notes voluntarily.
"Our response was, 'Not on your life,' " Mr. Yoffie said.
However, the authors did offer a compromise: allow a third party to review the tapes to verify the accuracy of the quotations from Netscape executives. Microsoft rejected that proposal and subpoenaed the materials four days later.
Whether Microsoft will prevail remains uncertain. Massachusetts has a "shield" law that affords writers some protection for confidential sources and unpublished research materials. But that protection is generally less for academics than it is for print journalists, and legal experts describe the law as weak.
Microsoft, legal experts added, will try to override the shield law by saying that the authors' research is crucial to its defense and cannot be obtained elsewhere.

HEADLINE: Consumer Confidence Continues to Decline

BYLINE: By The Associated Press 

 BODY:
Shaken by global economic and political turmoil, Americans' confidence in the United States economy fell in September for a third consecutive month, to its lowest level in almost a year.
The Conference Board, a business research organization, reported yesterday that its index of consumer confidence fell 7.1 points, to 126 in September from a revised 133.1 in August. The index is down 12.2 points from its 29-year high in June. 
 September's decline, which was larger than Wall Street analysts had expected and was the biggest monthly drop since January, brings the index to its lowest level since October 1997.
Consumer sentiment is an important economic indicator since consumer spending accounts for two-thirds of the nation's overall economic activity.
In the Conference Board report, consumers expressed concern with the outlook for the next six months, sending the expectations index down 10.9 points, to 95.9.
Fewer Americans said they would buy a car or a large appliance in coming months, while more expected business conditions to worsen, incomes to decrease and fewer jobs to be available.
Although consumers are worried about future economic conditions, they remain somewhat confident about their current economic situation. The index that measures feelings about present conditions dropped only 1.4 points, to 171.2, in September.

HEADLINE: Germany's Greens: Can They Put 'Chaos' Behind Them?

BYLINE: By ROGER COHEN 

DATELINE: BONN, Sept. 29

 BODY:
It has been a roller-coaster year for Germany's environmentalist Greens. They have zigzagged on German troop deployment in Bosnia, called for a near-tripling of gasoline prices, only to shelve the idea, gone back and forth on what to do about NATO and finally found themselves a likely member of Germany's new government.
"We have shown a certain amount of chaos," said Harald Handel, a spokesman for the party that seems almost certain to form a "Red-Green" coalition with the Social Democrats of Chancellor-elect Gerhard Schroder. "The chaos was a reflection of a lack of organization, and we now intend to change that." 
 But can the Greens, founded in 1979 as a loose coalition of pacifists, environmentalists, socialists and feminists, evolve from the freewheeling ways of opposition into a cohesive party of government that speaks with a single voice?
Mr. Schroder, who is to begin coalition talks with the Greens on Friday, clearly has concerns. "The Social Democratic Party stands for economic stability, law and order and continuity in foreign policy," he told the mass-circulation newspaper Bild in an interview published today. "This is not negotiable."
In other words, closing nuclear power stations that produce a third of Germany's energy -- a Green demand -- is incompatible with "economic stability." Legalizing soft drugs like marijuana -- a Green demand -- is incompatible with "law and order." Opposing NATO expansion -- a Green demand -- is incompatible with "continuity in foreign policy."
In Washington, officials indicated, some of Mr. Schroder's concerns are shared, although it is widely believed that the Greens, hungry for a power they have never tasted, will prove pragmatic, allowing the party's most influential figure, Joschka Fischer, a possible Foreign Minister, to hold his eclectic followers to NATO policies.
The United States therefore expects periodic irritations -- protests from some party members on NATO expansion, hesitations over any NATO military action in Kosovo, resolute opposition to imports of American foods that have been genetically modified -- rather than any serious confrontation with the Greens.
Sensing the unease over the unpredictability they have shown this year, the Greens today announced a reorganization of the party aimed at wresting some power from local organizations and increasing centralized control.
In the past, such moves have been resisted, because they smacked of excessive hierarchy. Even the term "leader" has been shunned because it was a far cry from the sandal-wearing spontaneity of the party's birth. "We want to carry out structural reforms that will lead to a truly federal party," Heide Ruehle, the party manager, said in a radio interview. "At the moment we are a kind of loose collective of very strong local groups with their own rules and funding, who have pushed the central party around a bit."
Up to now, about 80 percent of the party's financing has gone to state units of the Greens, and only 20 percent to the central organization. As a result, Mr. Handel said, the party had little central control, and "we have been talking with different tongues."
This was evident at a party congress in Magdeburg in March that turned into a fiasco, when, despite Mr. Fischer's pleas, the party came out against the continued participation of German troops in the NATO mission in Bosnia. To Mr. Fischer's horror, the congress also voted for the taxes that would sharply increase gasoline prices.
Both those positions were later revised as their unpopularity and the obstacles they would pose to an alliance with the Social Democrats became clear.
But the old split between "Fundis" and "Realos," the die-hard pacifists and the pragmatists, remains, as does a rivalry between Mr. Fischer and Jurgen Trittin, another leading figure whose criticism of the German Army caused an outcry early this year.
Immediately after the election, for instance, Mr. Trittin called for the closing of Germany's 20 nuclear power plants "as soon as possible." Mr. Fischer was silent on the subject.
The Greens now plan to set up a 20-member committee that will provide greater central control and insure that the positions of the party's various leading figures are closely coordinated, party members said.
Mr. Handel, the spokesman, said: "We want to be serious partners for our European and Atlantic allies. There are treaties, and these treaties must be respected. We do not want to turn back the tide of history."
Thus, while the party has taken a position against NATO expansion, it recognizes that a decision has been taken and will abide by it, he said. "In the long term," he added, "we would like to see the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe take over many tasks from NATO, but that, I repeat, is a long-term aim."
In the short term, it seems clear that the Greens will work hard to agree on a solid four-year government program with Mr. Schroder and to disprove departing Chancellor Helmut Kohl's repeated warning during the campaign: "The Green Party platform represents a major security risk for Germany."
It will be a major adjustment for a party unused to the strictures of government or central organization. The adjustment will have to made quickly. Officials said today that Mr. Schroder wanted to be sworn in by Oct. 22 so he can attend a European Union summit meeting in Austria later that week.

HEADLINE: Programs That Make Leadership Their Goal

BYLINE: By WILLIAM H. HONAN 

 BODY:
Are leaders born or bred? Can students be taught how to set a course that others will follow?
Brenda Bryant, director of the Virginia Women's Institute for Leadership at Mary Baldwin College, a small women's college in Staunton, Va., is a believer. "If some things can't be taught," she insisted, "at least they can be learned." The institute, whose mission is to bring out the take-charge qualities in its students, opened in 1995 with 42 students; it now has 150. 
 Leadership as an area of study is becoming increasingly popular at colleges and universities throughout the country. There are nearly 700 leadership-development programs at American academic institutions today, about double the number four years ago, according to the Center for Creative Leadership, a nonprofit educational research organization based in Greensboro, N.C.
Some are merely resource centers to which prominent leaders are invited for a day or two in the hope that some charisma will rub off. But others, including the University of Richmond's program, address the subject with an array of rigorous courses like "History and Theories of Leadership" and "Leadership in Political Systems," and offer successful candidates a bachelor's degree in leadership studies.
While it may be too early to gauge the programs' effectiveness, administrators say the course of study and mentorship help shape responsible leaders. "We believe that leadership is learned, not just an attribute," said John Burkhardt, a spokesman for the W. K. Kellogg Foundation in Battle Creek, Mich., which has given about $20 million over the past decade to some 34 institutions to develop leadership-teaching programs.
A principal reason for the blossoming of leadership studies is that, at a time of economic uncertainty, students see the programs as "career-planning resources," to take a phrase from the Mount Holyoke College catalogue. Mount Holyoke's program, for example, stresses internships and counseling, with interviews with prominent professionals in the students' area of interest.
Administrators find leadership development programs to be effective recruiting tools. Austin College, a small liberal arts school in Sherman, Tex., offers 15 $10,000 scholarships a year to students who enroll in its Leadership Institute. "Many others who didn't make it come to us anyway," said Shelton L. Williams, the institute's director.
The standards for admission to such programs are often high. "We're not just looking for a resume with a lot of presidencies on it," Mr. Williams said. "We're looking for people who created organizations or took existing ones to a higher level."
The easy part, most specialists agree, is teaching skills like running a meeting, resolving conflicts and getting the best out of creative people. The hard (if not impossible) part is to instill charisma, perseverance and trustworthiness.
"We try to set up a learning situation at Mary Baldwin by putting the students in leadership situations outside the classroom, like running a social event or operating a motor pool for the R.O.T.C.," Ms. Bryant said.
Students are graded on everything from their effectiveness on the speaker's platform to their ability to analyze success or failure on the part of historical or fictional figures, ranging from Abraham Lincoln to Captain Ahab.
The programs have become particularly popular at private women's colleges. "It's an outgrowth of the women's movement of the 1980's," Ms. Bryant said.
The idea of leadership development can be traced to the Industrial Revolution, said Mary K. Schwartz, a spokeswoman for the Center for Creative Leadership.
"The first stimulus was when people left the farms and came to the cities to work in highly organized factories," Ms. Schwartz said. "They needed help to get people working together. The next thing was when the soldiers came home from World War II. They tried to exercise leadership in the control-and-command style, the way they had done in the military, but it didn't motivate people so they looked around for something else.
"In 1959," she added, "the Carnegie and Ford Foundations simultaneously published reports proposing ways to reform business and management training at the college and university level, and that was really the birth of leadership education."
Not everyone agrees that a formal academic program is the best way to develop future leaders. Ruth Simmons, the president of Smith College in Northampton, Mass., said leadership development, which is mentioned in the college's recruiting literature, takes place at Smith naturally without benefit of a program.
"Because of our low student-faculty ratio and the small scale of the college, Smith students get close attention and mentoring from the faculty," Ms. Simmons said. "That gives them the confidence to go out and start companies because they've done big things here. Also, because the students live in one of 35 self-governing houses, the chances are great that any student who wants the opportunity to be in a responsible role will get the chance."
Many academicians, though, seem to prefer a more direct approach. One of the nation's best-known leadership schools, the Jepson School of Leadership Studies at the University of Richmond, offers a degree in leadership, and its graduates typically go into business, law or government.
The school got its start in 1992 with a $20 million gift from the investment banker Robert S. Jepson Jr., an alumnus. It has 11 faculty members, including Mary Sue Terry, a former Virginia State Attorney General, and accepts 40 juniors and 40 seniors each year.
Last year Mount Holyoke College, a women's college in South Hadley, Mass., started its own leadership resource center, the Center for Leadership and Public Interest Advocacy, which does not offer degrees. Activities include a new theme each semester -- currently, "Making a Difference" -- related symposiums, discussions, scholars-in-residence, lectures and "dinner and dialogues," at which students talk informally with faculty members over a meal. Courses include "Speaking, Arguing and Writing," which focuses on the art of persuasion.
Teachers point to students like Jennifer Miscovich, a junior at Austin College's Leadership Institute, as evidence that leadership can be fostered in people who show promise.
Ms. Miscovich, a self-described wallflower who in high school expected to pursue "a conventional career" in teaching or the health sciences, now holds two jobs, maintains a 3.87 grade point average and founded the Sherman, Tex., chapter of America's Promise, the national organization of business and civic leaders who work to help at-risk youths.
Reflecting on her transition to a mover and shaker, Ms. Miscovich credited the leadership institute.
"It woke me up," she said. "It gave me insight into public life. There's no turning back now. I know I'm going to be involved in some sort of community service from here on."

HEADLINE: THE MARKETS: STOCKS;
Fed's Rate Cut Has Little Impact as Dow Falls by 28.32

BYLINE: By KENNETH N. GILPIN 

 BODY:
The first interest rate cut since January 1996 failed to impress stock investors yesterday, and the major market indexes were narrowly mixed at the end of a fairly active session.
Investors in the bond market had a somewhat stronger reaction and drove up prices, particularly in the long end of the market, pushing the yield on the benchmark 30-year Treasury bond down to another 30-year low, 5.09 percent. (Bond prices and their yields move in opposite directions.) 
 As expected, the Federal Reserve Board announced shortly after 2 P.M., Eastern daylight time, yesterday that it had voted to lower its target for the Federal funds rate, by one-quarter of a percentage point, to 5.25 percent.
Stocks, which were modestly higher early in the day, pulled back after the Fed decision was announced, and the market seesawed for the rest of the day. The Dow Jones industrial average closed down 28.32 points, or nearly four-tenths of 1 percent, to 8,080.52.
The Standard & Poors 500 index eked out a gain of 0.33 point to close at 1,049.02. And the Nasdaq composite index fell 5.17 points, or three-tenths of 1 percent, to 1,734.05.
The prospect of a rate cut has been viewed as a near certainty since Sept. 23, when Alan Greenspan, the Fed chairman, told Congress that slumping economies abroad were a bigger threat to the health of the American economy than inflation. And stock prices staged some strong rallies for a few days after he made those comments.
As a consequence, yesterday's announcement had an anticlimactic element.
"The Fed never used to announce interest rate cuts like they are doing now," said Al Goldman, chief market strategist at A. G. Edwards in St. Louis. "We have spent the last several sessions discounting this news."
Still, the session had its share of surprises, and some were unpleasant.
A number of big companies, including Goodyear Tire and Rubber, Viacom Inc., and the CBS Corporation were hit hard on concerns that third-quarter earnings will not meet expectations. And the Fed's rate cut failed to provide much assistance to many financial service company stocks, despite the fact such companies stand to benefit directly from a reduction in borrowing costs.
"While the general earnings tone remains poor, the laundry list of companies buying back stock has accelerated in recent days," said Thomas Galvin, investment strategist at Donaldson, Lufkin & Jenrette. "We may get to a point where lower rates cushion the economy, stabilize earnings and some big market capitalization sectors, like the financials, technology and energy, show gains."
Investors hammered stocks that were not dispensing good news.
Goodyear, North America's largest tire maker, fell 3 3/4, to 52, after warning that unfavorable conditions in Asia and Latin America will cause third-quarter earnings to fall short of expectations. The stock's drop accounted for about 25 percent of the decline in the Dow.
Meanwhile, Viacom Inc. fell 11 percent on concern that higher costs at its Blockbuster Entertainment video store chain and MTV Networks cable unit will hamper growth in third-quarter cash flow. The company's class B shares fell 4 1/2, to 58 1/4, in heavy trading.
CBS fell 2 1/2, to 23 1/4, on concern that cash flow growth in its television businesses will slow because of advertising cutbacks by General Motors in the wake of its recent strikes.
But other companies that have previously announced a slowdown in third-quarter earnings saw their stock prices improve. A notable example was Coca-Cola, which rallied for the second straight day. Coke's stock closed at 5811/16 , up 17/16 a share.
"If you are going to disappoint, the market will kill you," Mr. Goldman said. "But if your outlook is better, you get rewarded. This market is becoming much discriminating than it was a few weeks ago."
Treasury prices rose after the Fed announcement, even though some traders and investors had expected a cut of half a percentage point.
The price of the 30-year Treasury rose 22/32 , to 1067/32 . The yield of 5.09 percent was down from 5.14 percent on Monday and down 27 basis points, or hundredths of percentage points, from where it was just three weeks ago.

HEADLINE: Paying Back College Loans May Be Easier

BYLINE: By JOHN H. CUSHMAN Jr. 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Sept. 29

 BODY:
College students who take out Federal loans will pay the lowest interest rate in decades, saving hundreds of dollars each, while grants to poorer students will increase by thousands of dollars under a bill that won final passage in the Senate today and is sure to become law.
Millions of students would benefit from the more generous terms over the next five years. The Senate approved the bill, 96 to 0, a day after the House approved it unanimously. Despite reservations about subsidies for the banks that make most of the loans, the Clinton Administration has embraced the bill. 
 Senator Edward M. Kennedy, a Massachusetts Democrat who is a sponsor of the measure, estimated that the typical student graduating from college with $13,000 in debts would save $700 in interest payments. A student with a loan of $20,000 would save about $1,000 in the five years it takes to pay back college loans.
In another bonus to recent graduates, the measure extends for another four months, until next Jan. 31, a window during which they may go back to the bank and consolidate existing loans at the new rates.
The lower interest rates for student loans, about three-fourths of a percentage point below the rates on student loans issued last year, reflects the general decline in interest rates throughout the economy as well as changes in how the rates are set. Congress put the new system into effect earlier this year, but only on a temporary basis. The legislation makes the system permanent.
Under the bill, the interest rate for borrowers will be the rate on 91-day Treasury bills plus 1.7 percentage points while the student is in school, and the Treasury bill rate plus 2.3 percentage points after the student graduates and begins repaying the loan. The rate could not rise above 8.25 percent.
Currently, this would result in an interest rate of less than 7.5 percent, compared with just under 8.25 percent last year.
Borrowing costs for students might have gone even lower under a formula that was to have taken effect this summer, but lenders contended that the interest rate would have been so low that they would have to withdraw from the program.
The compromise that passed today uses a Federal subsidy to pay banks an interest rate that is somewhat higher than what the students pay.
More than half of all college undergraduates get aid under the Higher Education Act of 1965, and the Federal Government is expected to guarantee 88 million loans over the next 10 years and to issue more than 25 million Pell grants to low-income students over the coming five years, sponsors said.
The votes in the House and the Senate to make the aid more generous is among the few major bills to pass the Congress without partisan rancor as the legislative session draws to a close.
"The process in both the House and Senate has been characterized by a spirit of bipartisanship," said Senator James M. Jeffords, Republican of Vermont, who managed the bill in the Senate.
Next year the maximum annual Pell grant, as the Federal aid for low-income students is known, will rise from $3,000 to $4,500, and students will be allowed to earn up to $2,200 without losing their eligibility for the grants. Over the next five years the maximum Pell grant will rise to $5,800.
Beyond the financial aid for students, the bill makes dozens of changes to Federal programs for higher education. It forgives some loans for students who work in child care or in schools in low-income neighborhoods, and it increases the budget for college work-study programs to $1 billion for next year.
But House and Senate conferees rejected a provision that had passed the Senate amending the welfare law to help welfare recipients attend college. The provision would have counted two years of college as meeting the new work requirements for welfare recipients.
Concerned that increasing financial aid would merely fuel the engines of academic inflation, lawmakers took a few tentative steps to hold back the rate of increase in college costs, which have exceeded the general rate of inflation for years.
One provision in the bill gives parents and students new access to information from colleges about the factors that are driving tuition higher. Another cost-saving provision permits colleges to offer their older faculty members new incentives, such as additional benefits, to retire voluntarily.

HEADLINE: Government By Automatic Pilot

BYLINE: By Eugene J. McCarthy; Eugene J. McCarthy, the former Democratic Senator from Minnesota, is the author of "No-Fault Politics." He was assisted on this article by Keith Burris of The Journal Inquirer of Manchester, Conn.

DATELINE: WASHINGTON

 BODY:
Puritans usually wreak more havoc than sinners. Cromwell did far more damage than any English king. Reformers did more harm to American cities earlier in this century than the supposedly corrupt political bosses did. And the postal system based on patronage worked better than the one that allegedly runs on "merit."
The independent counsel law has both complicated and outweighed Bill Clinton's sins because it structurally undermined the rule of law and representative institutions. 
 Worse, it is part of a long-running trend. It is one of many laws enacted in the past 30 years that try to elevate government above politics and therefore criminalize politics, cripple government or both. The idea is to inoculate the country against the errors and failings of our leaders by putting government on automatic pilot.
The assumption behind the independent counsel law is that elections, the Justice Department, the courts and Congress will all be insufficient to check whatever corruption exists in the executive branch.
Similarly, when the House found it necessary to investigate two of its Speakers, Jim Wright and Newt Gingrich, it did not trust itself. Even though the Constitution says that each house of Congress determines its own rules and punishes its own members, special counsels were deemed necessary.
The Federal Government in general has become positively prosecutorial. Unelected magistrates at the Internal Revenue Service and the Environmental Protection Agency routinely rule on the motives as well as actions of citizens, with little regard for their legal rights.
This is no-fault politics -- where the buck never stops. In the wake of Vietnam, Congress passed the War Powers Act, which only muddied the constitutional waters and blurred the moral and political responsibilities of both the President and the Senate. Similarly, the 1982 Boland Amendment, which forbade the Central Intelligence Agency to intervene in Nicaragua, undermined the President's authority to make foreign policy while bypassing the advice-and-consent responsibilities of the Senate.
So too with indexing of government salaries and entitlement cost-of-living adjustments for inflation, a practice Congress embraced 20 years ago. Relying on an automatic mechanism was easier than making case-by-case judgments and accepting the political consequences.
We seem to be saying: "Save us from politics and from the responsibility of choice. Let us trust a magistrate instead." We do not trust our own ability to lead and judge, or the system the Founders created.
Instead of asserting political control over Social Security, the President and Congress appointed a "bipartisan" commission to deliver a "solution" -- one that did not take.
The White House has been no better. Instead of dealing directly with Congress on taxes and the budget, for example, President Bush initiated the "budget summit" in 1990. Instead of taking their health plan to the people, President Clinton and Hillary Rodham Clinton assembled a kitchen cabinet of experts and delivered their report to the various interest groups.
When a President misbehaves, it is for Congress to discipline him as the Constitution indicates. The inquiry should begin and end in Congress.
Government by special ministers is not representative government. And prosecution by special prosecutors is not consistent with the American idea of due process.
The fault is not in our constitutional system, or in ourselves, but in the current disposition to assign all difficult problems in American government to independent agents and procedures in which no elected official is held to account. By doing so, we have de-democratized much of government and criminalized much of politics.

HEADLINE: RJR Nabisco Braces for Drop In Russian Sales

BYLINE: By CONSTANCE L. HAYS 

 BODY:
The RJR Nabisco Holdings Corporation, the latest United States company to be buffeted by economic crisis from abroad, warned yesterday that "depressed market conditions" in Russia would reduce its third-quarter earnings well below earlier expectations.
RJR said results would be 46 cents to 48 cents a diluted share; many analysts had predicted 60 cents. The company issued its warning after the stock market closed. In after-hours trading, RJR shares fell to $25, down $1.9375, or 7 percent, from their close on the New York Stock Exchange. 
 RJR, while also known for such food brands as Ritz crackers and Oreo cookies, derives about two-thirds of its profits from tobacco. Its cigarette sales in Russia and the rest of the former Soviet Union had been running at an impressive rate in the first half of the year, close to 20 percent of international profits, said Emanuel Goldman, a tobacco and beverage analyst with Paine Webber in San Francisco. Last year, the company's sales there accounted for 15 percent of international profits and represented 42 percent of international volume.
"Now that earlier rate is not going to happen," Mr. Goldman said. "This is an important market for them. It's low profitability, but higher volume."
(The rival Philip Morris, by contrast, has much more limited exposure to Russia. Philip Morris's sales in Russia last year were 9 percent of international volume, and profits were 3.5 percent of the international total, Mr. Goldman said.)
The third quarter is now expected to be the second consecutive disappointing quarter for RJR. In July, the company reported a loss of $130 million, attributed in part to weakness in Russia.
Along with such American brands as Winston, RJR's sales in Russia include cigarettes produced specifically for the Russian market. One, the Peter I heritage brand, is the largest-selling filtered cigarette in Russia, the company says. Other brands include the Genghis Khan, sold in Kazakhstan, and the Arsenal, sold in Ukraine.
The crisis in Russia forced RJR to suspend both imports of its American brands and manufacturing of its Russian brands for about two weeks, said Martin Feldman, a tobacco analyst with Salomon Smith Barney. Though manufacturing has resumed, "demand from wholesalers remains extremely uncertain, and the prospects for the company in Russia remain problematic," he said. Demand had all but fallen off, he said, as wholesalers and distributors ran out of cash to pay for their orders.
In its statement yesterday, RJR blamed "the devaluation of the ruble, limited availability of trade credit and generally poor economic conditions" for the suspensions.
In 1997, the company made $80 million in profits from its Russian operations, Mr. Feldman added. "This year, with a fair wind in the fourth quarter, they might make $20 million for the whole year," he said.
Another product of the Russian crisis will be higher taxes. The company's overall tax rate will be pushed up, from 43.5 percent to 45.5 percent, Mr. Feldman said. That happens because the company pays lower taxes on international profits than on domestic profits and so, as international profits fall as a percentage of overall profits, the company's tax rate goes up.
Still, RJR should not flee the Russian market, Mr. Feldman said. "As soon as the Russian economy begins to stabilize, you'll see an improvement in RJR's business," he said. "The current problems are severe, but not a reason to give up on the business."

HEADLINE: When Lending Money Just Isn't Enough;
Critics Seek a New Role for the I.M.F. As Recent Bailout Programs Fall Short

BYLINE: By MICHAEL M. WEINSTEIN 

 BODY:
The world looks to the International Monetary Fund to stop financial crises. Yet its best efforts are failing. Even apart from the spectacular collapses in Asia last year and in Russia this year, there has been a "boom in busts" -- an explosion in the number of countries whose economies have been devastated by simultaneous runs on their currencies and banks.
What is worse, some hard-hit countries, like Indonesia and Russia, were operating under a bailout program approved by the fund. The I.M.F., critics say, appears short of ideas to stanch these crises, and short of the money that would even allow it to try. 
 But if the I.M.F. did not exist, it would have to be invented. That is why most experts, even as they disagree loudly over how to restructure the fund, argue that the lending institution should not simply be abandoned. "The mission," C. Fred Bergsten, the director of the Institute for International Economics, said, "is to save the fund, not bury it."
Prior to 1973, the I.M.F. had a clear role: the world's currencies were tethered to gold and the fund bailed out countries running out of dollars. But since President Nixon eliminated the gold standard, countries have had the option of letting their currencies float in value, helping to eliminate persistent balance-of-payments deficits without outside support.
The fund had to scrounge for a new mission. By the early 1980's, it had settled into lending to countries hit by massive capital flight. But Allan Meltzer of Carnegie Mellon University charges that the "fund is unqualified to assume its new tasks."
"Its structure harks back to its founding 50 years ago and ill serves today's needs," he said.
And even if the I.M.F. has the will, it no longer has the way to impose its views. Almost everyone agrees that it cannot perform its current mission with the sums -- now down to well under $100 billion by any accounting -- left in its coffers. Paul Krugman of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology estimates that "the fund may need another $200 billion just to bail out Brazil without imposing a severe recession."
So the I.M.F. needs to change. But how? Economists have produced a number of answers. Some call for expanding the I.M.F.'s powers to aid crippled economies, perhaps by turning it into a true "lender of last resort" that disburses money to prop up countries in financial distress. Others would expand its mission by having it insure foreign loans.
Yet another group would take the opposite tack, trimming the role of the institution. They would offer bailouts to fewer countries, or focus the fund's efforts on convening negotiations between debtor countries and their creditors.
But much of the disagreement flows from one deep-seated dispute -- whether a territory as small as Hong Kong or a country as large as Brazil should fix their currencies in terms of dollars or let them float according to the vagaries of the market. If the members of the I.M.F. could settle the issue of exchange rates, many of the other policy issues would fall quietly into line.
Countries adopt a fixed exchange rate -- a pledge to convert currencies into dollars at a preset rate -- in part to reassure investors that their money is safe. But fixed rates get countries into financial trouble when, for whatever reason, investors get spooked and all rush for the exits at the same time. With trillions of dollars sloshing around world capital markets, the dollar reserves of nearly every country can be decimated in days, if not seconds.
Russia, like some other countries, brought disaster on itself by printing too many rubles. The more ominous lesson of the last few years is that fickle investors can also rock countries that conduct prudent policies. Mr. Krugman worries that it takes "a minority of skittish investors to set off a self-justifying run on the country's reserves."
The upshot is that countries that pledge to preserve fixed rates at any cost are sometimes forced to do exactly that: Sweden in 1993, Brazil today and scores of other countries whose currencies have come under attack have been forced to jack up domestic interest rates to 40, 50 or 100 percent or more to convince investors to stay. High rates can stop the outflow of dollars, but they also crush the domestic economy. Indeed, the fund is criticized for strangling the economies of South Korea, Indonesia and Thailand last year by needlessly insisting they impose sky-high interest rates as part of their fund-approved packages.
Jeffrey Sachs, director of the Harvard Institute for International Development, argues that fixed rates do not work well with unlimited capital flows. His answer is to let currencies float. "There was a role for fixed rates in countries like Argentina and Brazil when they had to break hyperinflation and prove to investors that monetary policy would not repeat the blunders of the past," he said. "The mistake was holding onto the fixed rates. They become a trap if kept longer than necessary, say 18 months or so."
By proposing that countries move to freely floating rates, Mr. Sachs hopes to minimize the possibility of sudden currency collapses. He would urge the fund to help countries whose currencies are under attack, but only after the currency is set free. The money would be used to mitigate the impact of devaluation on the poor and to reassure investors that the country's finances would be sound and its currency unlikely to plunge much further.
Mr. Sachs also urges the fund to focus less on bailing out debtor countries than on helping them negotiate relief from their creditors. When a debtor cannot repay loans in the United States, the courts step in and suspend payments until a settlement that is fair to all creditors can emerge. Mr. Sachs wants a similar procedure internationally.
Indeed, Korea solved its immediate debt problem by pressuring its creditors to stretch out loan repayments in negotiations, even though Korea had no legal coercion on its side to force cooperation. "So while international debt negotiations lack the legal protections to work in theory," Mr. Sachs said, "they somehow manage to work in practice."
Had the fund steered Korea toward debt negotiations from the beginning, Mr. Sachs argues, there might have been no need to crack down so hard on its economy.
Mr. Meltzer starts from the same presumption as Mr. Sachs -- that fixed rates do not work well in a world of vast capital flows -- but comes to a different conclusion. He wants to minimize the role of the fund, whose bailouts, he argues, have done a lot of harm.
His solution is to turn the fund into a limited lender of last resort, lending money to debtor countries for a fee. But debtors would have to post ample collateral. That leaves Mr. Meltzer vulnerable to the charge that his plan would bail out only countries that do not need the fund's help. And in a sense, he agrees: Classic economic thinking suggests bailing out only those borrowers who are merely illiquid, simply lacking ready cash to pay back creditors while holding ample assets, but not those who are insolvent, without enough assets to cover their debts.
But many economists, and these include key policy makers like Stanley Fischer, the fund's No. 2 official, regard floating rates as unacceptably risky for developing countries. Fickle investors, controlling trillions of dollars, can drive currency values up and down in huge swings for seemingly no valid economic reason.
Sudden currency swings play havoc with people's lives. Depreciation can decimate industries that rely on imported parts, turning once secure jobs into rubble. In Asia, steep currency declines sent the price of imports skyrocketing, impoverishing millions last year. They also drove up the cost, measured in local currency, of loans denominated in dollars. That threatens many banks throughout Asia and Latin America.
"It is no accident," Mr. Fischer said, "that countries turn to fixed rates to bring order to their economies."
Economists who tie themselves to fixed rates also tie themselves to the I.M.F. The world simply needs some institution to lend money to countries whose reserves are temporarily under attack, they say.
That is why Mr. Bergsten, who advocates rates that are flexible only enough to float within a preset range, argues for making the fund work better within its existing role. He would have the fund scrutinize pertinent financial data of its member nations and intervene early before they run into problems. As part of his "I.M.F. plus" proposal, he would also require the fund to eliminate the worst feature of its Mexican and Asian bailouts. Under those programs, Western creditors were hardly nicked, encouraging them to take imprudent risks elsewhere. In Russia, some investors soaked up Government bonds, mistakenly confident that the fund would bail out the Russians if they faltered. The most direct way to correct this "moral hazard" is for the fund to pressure creditors to offer significant debt relief.
George Soros, the billionaire investor and philanthropist, has a more ambitious plan. "International capital movements need to be supervised and the allocation of credit regulated by an international authority," he argues. Mr. Soros proposes, as yet without detail, that a new spin-off of the I.M.F. calm jittery foreign investors by "guaranteeing international loans for a modest fee" up to a limit. The guarantees would be backed by special drawing rights that, in effect, use American dollars -- together with backing from other major countries -- perhaps without explicit Congressional permission.
Even if Mr. Soros's proposal could overcome political objections on Capitol Hill, there are still practical challenges to the idea. Loan insurance encourages investors to ignore the creditworthiness of borrowers, which is why it is limited in the United States to relatively small deposits in commercial banks and savings and loans. His proposal may invite reckless investing.
There are also proposals, most recently by Jeffrey Garten, a former Commerce Department official, to turn the fund or some other institution into a global central bank able to issue money whenever the international economy sags. But economists point out that his bank would require gargantuan resources and the legal power to intervene in the economies of member countries.
There will be lots of talk of reform this week when the I.M.F. and World Bank hold their semiannual meetings. Even if there is as yet no consensus for radical overhaul, the fund's survival may depend on its ability to borrow at least some of what its critics propose.

HEADLINE: A Cautious Rate Cut

 BODY:
By choosing to lower interest rates by only a small amount, the Federal Reserve has opted for a gradual and measured response to the growing problems affecting the world economy.
The move, reducing the rate on loans between banks by a quarter of a percentage point, to 5.25 percent, was welcome. But financial markets were nonetheless disappointed, both by the amount of the cut and because there is no indication that European central banks will join in the effort to stimulate economic growth in the face of the deflationary and recessionary winds blowing from Asia and Russia. The Dow Jones industrial average fell 100 points in the minutes after the decision was announced, and markets also fell sharply in Latin America. But most markets later rebounded. 
 The Fed's caution may prove to have been too great, but the central bank nonetheless is to be commended for acting at all. While financial markets are clearly worried, the statistics still show a strong domestic economy. The latest consumer confidence figures from the Conference Board showed a growing number of people worried that the economy will get worse within the next six months, but that concern is not yet reflected in consumer spending figures.
If there were a way to stimulate economic activity in part of the world but not the rest, America would be the least appropriate candidate for monetary stimulus. But central banks in developing countries, where the need is greatest, are in no position to stimulate growth because such actions would put further pressure on already shaky currencies. It is central banks in the leading countries that have the ability to act, and that is why pressure grew on the Fed to ease credit.
It was encouraging that Canada's central bank joined yesterday's move, but regrettable that Germany's Bundesbank, in its final months as the de facto European central bank, has been unwilling to join in cutting. The Bundesbank is rightly proud of its reputation as being vigilant against inflation, but inflation is not the world's primary problem now.
If the world economy does not turn around quickly, further rate cuts, by the Fed and other central banks, may be needed before the year is out.

HEADLINE: White House Considers New Uses for Sampling

BYLINE: By STEVEN A. HOLMES 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Sept. 29

 BODY:
Having lost two decisions in the lower courts, Clinton Administration officials and advocates of statistical sampling in the 2000 census have begun to think about ways to use a modified form of the methodology even if they do not prevail in the Supreme Court.
The officials and proponents of the method say recent rulings by special Federal courts in Virginia and the District of Columbia that held sampling to be illegal covered using the method only to determine population counts for the allocation of seats among the states in the House of Representatives. Even if the Supreme Court agrees with those rulings, officials said they would still be free -- some say required -- to use the method to determine how Federal money is allocated and to establish population counts that are provided to states for drawing boundaries for Congressional, state and local legislative districts. 
 "What we're really saying is that the court cases and the arguments by the opponents of the census 2000 plan have been very limited to apportionment," said Robert Shapiro, Undersecretary of the Commerce Department's Economic Statistics Administration, the agency that oversees the Census Bureau.
Simply put, sampling is gauging the characteristics of households that do not respond to census queries based on the traits of those that do.
Special three-judge panels ruled this summer that the Census Bureau's plans to use sampling to augment the 2000 census violated the Census Act of 1976. That act stated that "except for the determination of population for purposes of apportionment of Representatives in Congress among the several States," the Secretary of Commerce shall use statistical sampling in the census.
Some lawyers representing proponents of sampling note that because the statute uses the term "shall," the law requires the Census Bureau to use sampling to help determine the population for the allocation of Federal funds and for use in drawing lines for election districts. That mandate would remain in force even if the Supreme Court affirms the decisions that sampling used for apportioning Congressional seats among the states is illegal, the lawyers say.
In an interview today, Mr. Shapiro said he fully expected the Supreme Court to rule that sampling was indeed legal. He also stressed that any decision about what the Administration would do if the court upheld the lower courts would be made in consultation with Congress.
A White House official familiar with the census issue said today that the White House had asked the Office of Management and Budget for a legal opinion of whether the President already has the authority to order that sampling be used for determining the population for the allocation of Federal funds.
Republican opponents of sampling said today that they would never agree to finance a census count that allowed sampling to be used for the drawing of election districts.
The idea that a court decision invalidating sampling would be limited to apportionment of Congressional seats adds a new wrinkle to what has become a highly partisan battle.
"Nobody ever really cared too much about the Federal funding aspect," said Clark Bensen, president of Polydata, a Republican demographic research company. "To the extent that the politicians get excited about the census, they don't get excited about apportionment which might shift one or maybe two seats to different states. They get excited because of redistricting."

HEADLINE: THE MARKETS: Market Place;
InvestorsView Rate Cut By the Fed as Too Timid

BYLINE: By GRETCHEN MORGENSON 

 BODY:
The Federal Reserve cut interest rates yesterday. Almost nobody cheered.
To stock investors, the rate cut -- of a quarter-point in a key short-term rate -- was too timid. They pushed the Dow Jones industrial average down 28.32 points. 
 To bond traders, the cut signaled that they, more than the Fed, remained in charge of interest rate policy. And that means continued high Treasury prices and more flatness in the yield curve, in which long-term rates are as low or lower than short-term rates.
To be sure, the rate cut by the Fed was considered far better than no action at all. And further cuts may come later this year. But bond traders who thought a one-quarter-point decline might finally brake the runaway train Treasury market were disappointed.
Yesterday, the yield on the 30-year Treasury bond fell to another new low, 5.09 percent. The 10-year note closed at a yield of 4.58 percent, well below the new Federal funds rate, or the rate banks charge each other for overnight borrowing, and just off its lows last Friday of 4.56 percent.
This is bad news for the traders and speculators that have sold Treasuries short in recent months in the belief that yields on the 30-year would never approach 5 percent. These include the trading desks at major brokerage firms and the large hedge funds like Long-Term Capital Management, the giant fund that almost failed last week and is now being run by its creditors. For them, the Federal Reserve's rate reduction provides no relief.
Indeed, the historic moves down in Treasury yields in recent months is more about speculation in that market than it is about the policy of the Federal Reserve Board. What began this summer as a concerted investor flight from risky securities to the safest, most liquid market in the world is suffering from what feels like a short squeeze. But it's not an orchestrated short squeeze like the one traders put on at Salomon Brothers in 1991, when they tried to corner the market. Today's squeeze, in which investors who have sold Treasury securities they do not own and are therefore hurt whenever the prices of those issues rise, has been created by professional investors. Many of these speculators had bought fixed-income securities that carried higher yields than Treasuries -- junk bonds, convertible bonds, mortgage-backed securities -- and hedged those positions by selling short Treasuries with similar maturities and lower yields.
Such a trade produced terrific profits for traders and money managers for the last five years or so. Typically, the yields on the instruments move in tandem, but this summer, they diverged, leading to losses in both positions. Now these investors are scrambling to cover their disastrous gambles. And in so doing, they are pushing Treasury prices even higher.
Combine this with a dearth of new Treasury issues -- the next Government refunding isn't until November -- and it looks as if Treasury prices will continue to trade at extraordinarily high levels relative to the Federal funds rate.
The sharp declines in Treasury yields reinforce that the bond market, not the Federal Reserve, is driving interest rate policy. In the 30 years leading up to 1990, Fed policy led the bond market in raising or pushing down rates; during this decade, the bond market has been first to the punch. "Even though the Fed had done nothing since the Asian crisis first emerged, the bond market has been easing long-term yields since last fall," said Jim Paulsen, chief investment officer at Norwest Investment Management Inc. in Minneapolis.
A bond market that eases before the Fed produces a different, more subtle effect from a Fed ease, according to Mr. Paulsen. When the bond market lowers rates, for example, it has good effects on mortgage rates, which help consumers.
But its effects on banks' profits are more deleterious. With short-term rates higher than long-term rates, as is the case now, banks cannot make as much money on their loans as they could if the Fed funds rate were below longer-term rates. That's why bank shares weakened yesterday, even after the rate cut. Citicorp was down 3 percent; Nationsbank lost 2.6 percent, and BankAmerica fell 2 percent.
Sometimes subtlety is not enough. When real trouble is brewing, as has been the case since the summer of 1997 in Asia, bond traders acting ahead of the Fed can mask some of the peril. This can, in turn, encourage continued passivity from the Federal Reserve. "If the bond market acted like it did in the 1970's and 1980's, there would be no movement until the Fed eased, and the full weight of the crisis would be evident," Mr. Paulsen said. "Now it's masked and allows for a policy mistake." That mistake? Too little a move by the Fed and too late.
When the Fed cuts rates ahead of the bond market, as was typical in past decades, both borrowers and lenders get a big break. This stimulates the economy much more than if only one of the two groups benefits. Many economists argue that the double whammy is needed now, given the severity of the crisis roiling economies around the world.
But abrupt changes in monetary policy by the Fed have also led to the four-year booms and busts that have characterized the American economy in the postwar years. Letting the bond market adjust policy incrementally has resulted in greater economic stability and smoother cycles.
Some analysts believe that the bond market's control over interest rates will last as long as Alan Greenspan does as chairman of the Fed. One reason is his unceasing fear of inflation, which has kept him from lowering rates until now. And, having presided over the longest period of economic prosperity in postwar history, Mr. Greenspan has come to appreciate the stabilizing effects of a more passive approach to policy. The only question is whether today's perilous circumstances require more from the Fed than it is willing to give.

Fed Lowers Interest Rates To Ease Effects of Turmoil
The Federal Reserve cut interest rates by a quarter of a percentage point in an attempt to keep the financial turmoil afflicting much of the world from derailing growth at home. 
 The Fed's reduction of the main short-term rate it controls, to 5.25 percent from 5.5 percent, also signaled the central bank's deepening concern about the economy's prospects. It was the first time the Fed has cut rates since January 1996, and the first change in rates since March 1997. Page A1.
 
Lower borrowing rates on many consumer loans are expected as a result of the rate reduction. Economists said mortgage rates for home purchases and refinancings should remain below 7 percent through 1998. C6.
 
Shaken by global economic and political turmoil, Americans' confidence in the United States economy fell in September for a third consecutive month. C19.
 
Mixed Market Response to Rate Cut
Wall Street was not impressed with the Fed's rate reduction, and the major market gauges were narrowly mixed at the end of an active session. The Dow Jones industrial average fell almost 100 points after the reduction was announced but rebounded somewhat to close down 28.32 points at 8,080.52. Investors in the bond market had a somewhat more positive reaction and drove up prices, pushing the yield on the 30-year Treasury bond down to 5.09 percent, another 30-year low. C7.

HEADLINE: Computers Help Math Learning, Study Finds

BYLINE: By ETHAN BRONNER 

 BODY:
The first large-scale examination of how computers affect the learning of mathematics in American classrooms found that when used selectively by trained teachers in middle schools they can significantly enhance academic performance.
But the study also indicated that their value in elementary school is far more limited and that when used primarily for drills and practice at either level, which is common, or when students spend long periods of time using them, computers in schools can be counterproductive. 
 The results imply that school districts should spend more on computers in middle schools than elementary schools and should focus attention on professional development for teachers to make sure they know how to use the computers effectively.
The study, called "Does It Compute?" released yesterday, was carried out by a researcher at Educational Testing Service in Princeton, N.J., and sponsored by the journal Education Week and the Milken Exchange on Education Technology, which promotes the effective use of computers in the classroom. It took the scores of thousands of fourth and eighth graders on the 1996 math portion of the National Assessment of Educational Progress, the most widely cited test given to samples of students across the country, and examined them based on surveys of students and teachers regarding classroom computer use.
Among eighth graders, it found that when students used computers for more complex mathematics like simulations, which measure changing variables, or applications, where data are manipulated and analyzed, gains of more than a third of an academic year were registered. For fourth graders using computers for mathematical games, the gain was a tenth of an academic year, or a few weeks' worth of instruction. The study divided computer use into four categories: drill and practice (common but least effective), demonstration of new topics (seldom used), as well as mathematical games, and simulations and applications.
By using a large sample size and controlling for such factors as socio-economic background, teacher preparedness, class size and school environment, the new study offers insight in the heated debate over the cost-benefit of the $5 billion spent annually on school computers.
"When computers are used to perform certain tasks, namely applying higher order concepts, and when teachers are proficient enough in computer use to direct students toward productive uses more generally, computers do seem to be associated with significant gains in mathematics achievement," concluded the report, written by Harold Wenglinsky.
It added: "The effects of technology appear to be much smaller in the fourth than the eighth grade, and so may not be cost-effective. To the extent that the primary benefit of computers lies in applying higher order skills, there may not be much opportunity to benefit from using computers before middle school."
Given the circumscribed and mixed nature of the findings, they are likely to be used by both sides in the debate over whether the investment has proven itself. In 1983, there was a computer for every 125 students whereas in 1995, the ratio was 1 to 9.
"What this tells me is that under certain conditions, uses of technology with certain kids in certain subjects at certain times will be effective," said Larry Cuban, an education professor at Stanford University and a longstanding skeptic toward the value of computers in schools. "That kind of conditional statement can be made about virtually any approach to teaching. The question I continually ask is how else we could achieve the same results in a less costly way."
But those who have advocated increased investment in education technology say they feel vindicated.
"What is unprecedented about this study is the way it takes a broad cross section of schools," said Christopher J. Dede, a professor of education and information technology at George Mason University in Virginia. "It turns out that if you are at all in the ballpark about using technology correctly, there are some things that are happening that are good. It is not idiosyncratic to one teaching style or software vendor but something fundamental. Technology permits different kinds of pedagogy."
The report describes technology uses among the 6,627 fourth graders and 7,146 eighth graders who took the core assessment in mathematics in 1996. It sought to avoid pitfalls of earlier studies on computer use by, for example, asking not about ratio of computer to student but frequency of use.
The study found that eighth graders and fourth graders use computers in school at about the same frequency. Less well off students have as much access to computers as better off students and, in fact, poor students had higher levels of computer use than their better off peers.
"Compared to white, non-poor, and suburban students, those who are minority, poor and urban find at least as much opportunity to use computers in school," the report said.
It added, "It seems that policies to promote computer access in school have succeeded in eliminating inequities of this sort; yet inequities in teacher preparedness and what is taught using computers remains."
The report measured teacher preparedness by whether teachers had received training in computer use but it did not distinguish between a weekend seminar and a semester-long course.

HEADLINE: Amtrak Unveils $185 Million Plan for Faster Service Upstate

BYLINE: By ANDY NEWMAN 

 BODY:
Amtrak officials and Gov. George E. Pataki announced a five-year plan yesterday to upgrade the tracks between New York City and Albany and rebuild trains used on the route to shave at least 20 minutes off the trip, allowing riders to cover the distance in less than two hours.
When the work on the $185 million program is completed, trains that now rarely exceed 90 miles per hour will cruise at 125 m.p.h. The plan also includes building a second track between Albany and Schenectady and an upgrade of the track between Albany and Buffalo, cutting as much as an hour off a trip from New York City and Buffalo, which now takes more than seven and a half hours. 
 The upgrade, which comes as Amtrak's ridership in New York State is expected to reach its highest level in more than 15 years, is expected to draw even more people to the train and away from cars and planes.
"Two hours from New York to Albany is kind of like a magic number," said Michael Fleischer, a spokesman for the State Department of Transportation. "When people realize that the trip takes less than two hours, it's kind of a stumbling block you get around."
The trip from New York City to the state capital now takes between 2 hours and 20 minutes and 2 hours and 30 minutes. There is one express train a day that makes the trip in 2 hours and 10 minutes.
Amtrak and the state will split the $140 million cost of rebuilding seven Turboliner trains. The trains, to be rebuilt by Super Steel Schenectady Inc., will have engines on both ends, allowing them to change direction without turning around, which should allow Amtrak to get two or three extra trips a day without increasing the number of trains. The trains will also get bigger seats, each with a hookup for a laptop computer.
The remaining $45 million will be used to build a second track between Albany and Schenectady and to realign other track and straighten curves to allow trains to reach higher speeds. Over all, about three-quarters of the state's funding for the project will come from various Federal sources.
The upgrade is not expected to require a fare increase. The fare from New York to Albany is $34 each way during the week and $41 on weekends.
Rick Remington, a spokesman for Amtrak, said the number of riders on the railroad's New York State trains is growing at a much faster rate than Amtrak ridership nationwide. Since last October, ridership in New York State has increased by more than 10 percent, to more than 97,000 riders a month. On a typical Friday, the busiest day of the week, 3,900 riders take Amtrak on routes within the state, Mr. Remington said.
At the present rate, service for the year would top 1.1 million for the first time since at least 1983, the earliest year for which Mr. Remington provided statistics. Ridership within New York State has increased 53 percent since then.
Mr. Remington attributed the boom to a strong economy, improved on-time performance and more narrowly focused advertisements.
"People in New York State are looking for a different sort of Amtrak service than someone who wants to take a leisurely ride from Chicago out West," Mr. Remington said. "Corridors like this are where we can compete with the car and plane for business travelers."
Transportation planning advocates hailed yesterday's announcement.
"Using state capital dollars for mass transportation is a very good thing, compared to where it usually goes, into roads," said Jon Orcutt, the associate director of the Tri-State Transportation Campaign, a watchdog group. "It's the kind of transportation investment that will help development in city centers along the line, places like Buffalo, Syracuse and Albany. If you put millions of dollars into highway lanes, you'd just be accelerating sprawl."

HEADLINE: Gulf Coast Feeling Lucky Hurricane Wasn't Worse

BYLINE: By RICK BRAGG 

DATELINE: MOBILE, Ala., Sept. 29

 BODY:
Sometimes, Reola Jones said, a tree just knows which way to fall.
Hurricane Georges ripped through her neighborhood here in the darkness of early Monday morning, blowing through windows and snapping trees and sending water rippling down the street. Power lines sparked along a pitch-black street as she prayed in the little wooden house she shares with her elderly father on Duval Street. 
 "I got up out of bed and wondered which window I was going to end up flying through," Ms. Jones said, adding that she was fearful until daylight.
At dawn, she saw that two large trees had fallen on either side of her house. One tree missed the house by just a few feet as it toppled in the yard. A second one, uprooted, was snagged by power lines as it toppled toward her home.
"The wonderful works of God," she said, sitting outside the house as power company workers tried to untangle the mess of power lines and limbs as cars crept through a street still puddled with dingy water.
"It's a mess," Ms. Jones said, "but we were lucky."
That seemed to be the most-repeated assessment of this hurricane here on Mobile Bay -- and elsewhere along the Gulf Coast -- as Hurricane Georges faded first into a tropical storm and then a tropical depression as it moved sluggishly out of the region, dumping heavy rains on South Alabama, southeastern Georgia and northern Florida. Roads in Alabama flooded; lights winked out as far north as Montgomery, and coastal residents from Louisiana to Florida found beach houses, piers and businesses badly damaged by wind and storm surges. Only four deaths in the region were attributed to the storm.
But, people here said, it threatened to be much, much worse.
"A lot of houses banged up," Henry Williams said as he cleaned a mess of tree limbs from the front yard of his small house on Victory Drive. Not far away, chain saws tore through the last of the trees that blocked a narrow street as people swept the dark water off porches and knelt in mangled flower beds.
"All you can do is pray that the Good Lord don't take you," Mr. Williams, 53, said as he threw down an armload of tree limbs. "I slept through it."
Many people could not. Hurricane Georges had left a wake of death and destruction through the Lesser Antilles, Puerto Rico, the Dominican Republic, Haiti and Cuba before raking across the Florida Keys and then slamming into the Gulf Coast.
While winds in Mississippi and Alabama tore off pieces of roofs and ripped patches from beach-side condominiums, storm surges picked apart piers, eroded beaches and undercut homes. Tens of thousands were evacuated to shelters, hotel rooms and churches.
Forecasters had hoped that Hurricane Georges would have been reduced to a much weaker storm after it crossed the steep mountains of the Dominican Republic and Cuba, but the hurricane had sustained winds of about 100 miles per hour and even higher gusts when it made landfall at Biloxi, Miss., on Sunday. Instead of pounding northward, however, the hurricane stalled just inland, dropping as much as 30 inches of rain on parts of the Gulf Coast.
As the storm crept to the northeast today, it dumped up to 15 inches of rain in southern Alabama and spawned tornadoes in some parts of the state. Flood waters filled town streets in southern Alabama. It was waist-deep in parts of East Brewton, Ala., and Flomaton, Ala., early this evening as creeks and rivers overflowed their banks.
"We're hoping it doesn't get to the downtown," said Sandy Stargel, chief dispatcher at the Flomaton Police Department. "We've already got water in several houses."
But it was along the coast in Mississippi and Alabama that the floods caused the most trouble. In Pascagoula, Miss., water reached rooftops, roads were washed out and oyster shells were swept into yards. More than 600,000 people had lost power.
Thousands filled hotel rooms as far north as Memphis. Marilyn Dedeaux of Jackson, Miss., kept 16 relatives and friends and four large refugee dogs in her home, where they all waited for the floods to recede. Ms. Dedeaux said the people got along well in the crowded house, but her 75-pound bassett hound, Lindsey, was very unhappy.
In Alabama, on the Dog River near Mobile, more than 100 boats were sunk or damaged as the storm blew through. Water as deep as 11 feet swamped Water Street in downtown Mobile, flooding homes and chasing residents into shelters. The stately mansions on Government Street in Mobile seemed mostly untouched, while poorer neighborhoods suffered much worse.
Ms. Jones, on Duval Street, wondered a little about that. But she is not complaining too much, considering her luck with the trees.
Her luck, before the storm, had not been good.
"I had a little job in town, but it played out," said Ms. Jones, who is 56 and still unemployed. She and her elderly father live on his Social Security check while she looks for work.
They had been trying to fix their small house, and its multicolored walls, pieced together from different materials, are signs of that.
As the storm pounded them early Monday, she feared that they would lose the roof, at least, she said.
"That wind sounded like a missile," Ms. Jones said. "The window broke," and limbs rattled across the shingles. One tree tumbled across a chain link fence, destroying it -- "one more thing we got to do" -- as water filled the streets, she said.
One big tree that missed the house also missed her car, by inches.
"It will set us back further," she said of the damage to their property. But all in all, she said, their luck held. "I'm just amazed," she said.
While the damage to property along the coast and points inland will be in the millions, the storm -- which caused more than 300 deaths in the Caribbean -- is blamed for only 4 deaths on the Gulf Coast. Candles, lit because of power blackouts, led to fatal fires in Pensacola, Fla., and New Orleans. A traffic accident killed a woman in Pensacola, and an elderly woman died while being moved to a shelter in Baton Rouge.
But no one was killed by flying debris or drowned, at least as of this evening, in the flood waters.
In New Orleans, where people had feared the storm would make landfall and flood a city that is six feet below sea level, some 21,000 people left shelters this morning and headed home, "thankful that we were spared" said the city's Mayor, Marc H. Morial.

Text of Release From the Fed

BYLINE: Agence France-Presse 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Sept. 29

 BODY:
Following is the statement issued by the Federal Open Market Committee, the Federal Reserve's monetary policy panel, after its decision today to lower short-term rates:
The Federal Open Market Committee decided today to ease the stance of monetary policy slightly, expecting the Federal funds rate to decline one-quarter percentage point, to around 5 1/4 percent. 
 The action was taken to cushion the effects on prospective economic growth in the United States of increasing weakness in foreign economies and of less accommodative financial conditions domestically. The recent changes in the global economy and adjustments in U.S. financial markets mean that a slightly lower Federal funds rate should now be consistent with keeping inflation low and sustaining economic growth going forward.
The discount rate remains unchanged at 5 percent.

HEADLINE: AN AMERICAN PLACE: Two Years Later;
Bellwether's Rank and File Strongly Support Clinton

BYLINE: By MICHAEL WINERIP 

DATELINE: CANTON, Ohio, Sept. 25

 BODY:
In 1996, Canton's newspaper, The Repository, endorsed Bill Clinton for President. It was not an easy call for editorial board members. For much of its history, The Repository has had a Republican slant. At the endorsement meeting, while editors praised the President's economic and welfare overhaul policies and called him courageous for standing up to the gun and tobacco lobbies, they also fretted over "the character issue," "the womanizer," "the guy involved in Whitewater."
"I'm frightened," David Kaminski said to his fellow editors that day in late October 1996, "that we will be embarrassed as a newspaper if we endorse Clinton and have a huge scandal break out." 
 And that, of course, is exactly what happened. Fifteen months later, as details of the Lewinsky investigation came spilling out, Mr. Kaminski, the Repository editor, and his fellow board members began to seethe. "I was growing more and more disgusted with the fact that his sexual relationship was part of a national discourse," Mr. Kaminski said. "I have a 12- and 15-year-old and they're quite aware that the President is accused of awful things."
Gayle Beck, the editorial page editor, who describes herself as a "moderate to liberal" feminist, said, "I was so upset, I could not bring myself to editorialize about the dress -- I found it so offensive that we as a nation had to think about it, so I didn't mention it."
When the Starr report became public, "we were simply appalled," Mr. Kaminski said. "Our patience broke. I read excerpts from the A.P. midafternoon on the computer. It put us over the edge." That evening, Sept. 11, the newspaper that had endorsed Mr. Clinton twice composed an editorial beginning with the words: "President Clinton ought to resign. He has destroyed his Presidency."
But in the two weeks since, it has become clear to The Repository's top editors that they are out of step with their community on this one. This is a political bellwether, a place that votes as America does for President, that swung to the Republican Presidents during the 1980's and to Mr. Clinton in the 1990's, and from extensive interviewing here it is clear that people still strongly support the President. Even right after the Starr report was issued, when the sentiment against Mr. Clinton was most heated, calls to the newspaper's telephone response line favored the President's remaining in office; that first weekend, 56 percent of the 674 callers opposed impeachment. "I even hear it from my mother," said Michael Hanke, the newspaper's general manager. "She's never talked about the news business in her life and she tells me, 'That's his business.' "
It is the ordinary people of Stark County, not the political elite, who are behind the groundswell for the President. Just as there is a division between Americans living inside and outside Washington's Capital Beltway, there is a split here in Stark between community leaders and the general population that goes beyond Republican and Democratic politics.
The people who run the newspaper, the judicial system, the nonprofit agencies and the schools tend to be much more concerned with the implications of a politician like President Clinton lying than are mainstream Stark County residents, who often assume that lying and evasion are the standard operating procedure for politicians. Leaders immersed in public policy spend their lives striving to bring order to community life; the general population lives with the reality -- the cracks, gaps, imperfections, potholes and shortcomings of daily life.
An example of this split: Sally Efremoff is a family court magistrate and former school board member who voted for Mr. Clinton in 1996 because she liked his stands for abortion and against school vouchers. She says she now thinks it would be best if he resigned. "I tell the young people who come before me in court you shouldn't lie, you shouldn't cheat. And then they see the President's not paying attention to this? The whole system of justice is built on the truth."
But that is not how Tim Gates, a Republican voter (Dole '96, Bush '92) working the register at The Book Shoppe in the Canton Centre mall, sees it. Mr. Gates does not support impeachment because he feels this is more about sex than lies, and he expects politicians to lie. "If you're a politician, that's how you get into power," Mr. Gates said. "Clinton's a standard politician." Rita Amedeo, a supermarket produce clerk who tends to vote Republican (Perot '96, Bush '92), agrees with that view. "I hate to see him resign or be impeached," she said. "It's not that this kind of thing hasn't happened to other Presidents."
Stark, a political swing county of 370,000 in northeastern Ohio, has voted as America has in eight of the last nine Presidential elections. For that reason, The New York Times spent 1996 writing about political and economic trends here. That November, Stark County residents voted for Mr. Clinton by a margin of 8 percentage points -- precisely his national margin. Although there has been no scientific polling done in Stark recently (it is too expensive for the local paper to undertake), from six dozen interviews conducted here at supermarkets, factories, a bar, a book shop and a hair salon, as well as with community leaders like Representative Ralph Regula, the Republican Congressman here, and Jim Repace, president of the union at the Hoover vacuum cleaner factory, it appears that Mr. Clinton's support is still strong.
It is, for example, much easier to find Republicans and independents siding with Mr. Clinton in the Lewinsky matter than it is to find Democrats who believe he should be impeached. At GSV Design Group, a beauty salon in one of Canton's wealthier neighborhoods, the verdict one recent afternoon, even among women who did not support Mr. Clinton for President in 1996, was nearly unanimous in his favor. Rosemary Zaremba (Dole '96, Bush '92), a housewife getting a shampoo and cut, never much liked President Clinton ("I can't believe I'm standing up for him") but does not think he should be impeached. "Absolutely not," she said. "Most men would lie in that situation. This isn't a public issue -- I think if they said they'd investigate all of Congress the way they did Clinton, this would be over quickly."
The salon owner, Sharon Vaccani (Dole '96, Perot '92), who was doing Ms. Zaremba's hair, agreed. "As Rose said, he hasn't done a bad job as President -- this isn't impeachable." And Toni Mikstay, the hairdresser at the next station (Dole '96), felt the same. "I don't think anything should happen to him," she said. "Look, I didn't vote for Clinton for President, I thought he was a weasel, too shady, but this is a personal matter."
Katie Hanenkrat (Perot '96) interrupted her shopping at a Fishers Foods supermarket to say, "No other President was impeached for these doings. You can't judge someone's personal life as long as it doesn't interfere with your work life." And Wendell Skelley, a supervisor for American Electric Power (Perot '96, Bush '92), carrying an armful of groceries, said, "This has all been such a waste of money and time. Quite frankly, there's an awful lot of people in the same situation. Quite frankly, even a person you work with could be in the same situation."
A majority of those interviewed saw it as a personal matter, and for guidance on how to judge it, they looked into their own lives and the lives of their neighbors. There is no more respected family in Stark County than the Timkens, who for four generations have run the Timken steel and bearing company, Stark's biggest employer, with 6,800 workers here and 21,000 worldwide.
The Timkens are admired for working to keep good-paying union jobs in Canton and for their local philanthropy. They are known as ardent Republicans who donate $100,000 to the party during Presidential election years. And they are also known as a family that has had its share of stormy marriages and painful divorces. Last year, W. R. Timken Jr., or Tim, the company chairman, reached a divorce settlement with his first wife just before the case was to go to trial, and a few months later, he remarried.
During the 1980's, Joseph Toot Jr. was divorced from one of Mr. Timken's sisters but continued as company president. "People here talk about the Timken situation, the Toot situation," said Mr. Repace, head of the union at Hoover and a Clinton supporter. "And their attitude is live and let live. I think it's the same attitude you see about the President. We're going to impeach a President because he had an affair and didn't want to stand up and admit it? I mean, come on."
(In the 1996 election, Mr. Timken gave several press interviews criticizing President Clinton, but a company spokeswoman, Elizabeth Smith, said that this time, "because of the subject matter Mr. Timken won't be commenting.")
Mr. Regula, a cautious, moderate Republican who is expected to easily win a 14th term, has not taken a stand on impeachment. In the days after the Starr report, he says, calls to his office were running three-to-one for impeachment, but the grand jury videotape "moderated people, you could feel a shift, and we're not getting a lot of calls now."
The President is helped by the economy here, too. When he was elected in 1992, the unemployment rate in Stark was about 8 percent; now it is 3.9 percent. Janet Weir Creighton, the county auditor (a Republican who said she thought the President should resign), said, "Our country is in great shape, our county is in great shape." Sales tax revenues are up 6.5 percent over last year; the general county debt was recently paid off; real estate values are up an average of 18 percent, and challenges to property tax assessments are at a record low. "People are happy," she said, "People are content."
There is also a fear, expressed even by middle-of-the-road Republicans, that impeaching Mr. Clinton would set loose right-wing forces in the Republican Party. Nancy McPeek, a banker, a former president of the county United Way and a moderate Republican (Dole '96) said she believed that the President should have to go through the impeachment process, but she also worried it would make the right wing more dominant in the party. "If they're successful," she said, "it will give the far right a bigger bandstand for the conservative approach to issues like abortion and vouchers, and that does scare me."
It scares Democrats even more. They are in a bad position in Ohio, even without President Clinton's problems. Republicans are favored to win all six statewide races this year, including those for governor and senator. Susan Keim, a nurse (Clinton '96 and '92) says she is fed up hearing Congressional leaders bragging that they are not going to be paying attention to the public opinion polls as they make their decisions on Mr. Clinton. "I hate that," she said, "I think we count. We are the polls." Her husband, a Timken steelworker, said that in November, for the first time in years, "I'm just voting straight Democrat."

FEDERAL RESERVE LOWERS KEY RATE BY QUARTER-POINT

BYLINE: By RICHARD W. STEVENSON 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Sept. 29

 BODY:
The Federal Reserve cut interest rates by a quarter of a percentage point today in an attempt to keep the financial turmoil afflicting much of the world from derailing the domestic economy.
The central bank reduced the main short-term rate it controls to 5.25 percent from 5.5 percent, the smallest increment available to it, in a move intended as much to signal the Federal Reserve's deepening concern about the economy's prospects as to stimulate faster growth. 
 It was the first time the Federal Reserve has cut rates since January 1996, and the first change in rates since March 1997.
The cut in the Federal funds rate, widely anticipated by economists and investors, will put downward pressure on the rates paid by consumers and businesses and could give a slight boost to the American economy at a time when the financial crisis that began last year in Asia is hitting the United States with increasing force.
Maury N. Harris, an economist at Paine Webber in New York, described it as a "growth insurance policy" taken out by the Federal Reserve to head off the possibility of a downturn and the need for a more pronounced rate cut later.
The reduction is likely to have only a marginal effect on the problems plaguing Japan, Southeast Asia, Russia and Latin America. But to the extent it keeps the American economy healthy, the rate cut would help other countries by strengthening demand for their products from the world's biggest economy. It could also give embattled markets around the world some reassurance that Alan Greenspan, the world's most influential economic policy maker, recognizes the severity of the crisis facing them.
"It's really signaling that somebody at the top knows what's going on," said M. Cary Leahey, an economist at High Frequency Economics, a consulting firm.
On Wall Street, where there had been some speculation that the rate cut would be half a percentage point, investors seemed disappointed that the Fed had limited the move to a quarter-point.
The Dow Jones industrial average fell almost 100 points immediately after the announcement by the Fed this afternoon before rebounding somewhat to close at 8,080.52, down 28.32 points. Page C1.
"The big signal is that the Fed is still very cautious in how fast it moves," said John E. Silvia, chief economist at the Kemper funds in Chicago. "They're confronted with two very different mixed pictures: domestic economic strength and foreign financial market concerns."
The central bank's decision to limit the rate cut seemed to reflect the continuing concern among some of its members that with unemployment at 4.5 percent, a 25-year low, there is still a risk that upward pressure on wages could cause an inflationary spiral if growth accelerates.
But in the last several months there have been increasing signs that the economy is slowing because of the problems that have devastated Asia and Russia and are threatening Latin America. Since early this month, Mr. Greenspan has been signaling that the risks from abroad are forcing the central bank to consider a rate reduction.
Manufacturers and farmers have seen many of their export markets shrivel. The stock market has fallen sharply from its mid-July peak, raising questions about the ability and willingness of consumers to continue spending. Fearful of growing worldwide risks, investors and lenders have pulled back, creating the circumstances for a credit shortage.
The near-collapse last week of a little-known but highly sophisticated investment firm, Long-Term Capital Management L.P., made clear that the United States was not completely insulated from jarring financial shocks. And just hours before the Fed announced its decision today, the Conference Board, a business research group, reported that consumer confidence fell sharply in September.
"The action was taken to cushion the effects on prospective economic growth in the United States of increasing weakness in foreign economies and of less accommodative financial conditions domestically," the central bank's policy-making Federal Open Market Committee said in a statement.
"The recent changes in the global economy and adjustments in the U.S. financial markets mean that a slightly lower Federal funds rate should now be consistent with keeping inflation low and sustaining economic growth going forward," the statement said.
Analysts said the Fed's statement was notable for its emphasis on tightening credit conditions.
Many of the interest rates that most affect consumers are already quite low, especially mortgage rates, and consumer demand has shown no signs of being inhibited by interest rates.
But the problems at Long-Term Capital Management, including the losses its problems have inflicted on banks and brokerage firms, as well as a rise in the cost of capital for companies seeking financing in the stock and bond markets, have together created a developing squeeze on Wall Street. In addition to exerting a braking effect on growth, the tighter conditions could cause problems in the event that other investment firms or banks encounter difficulties linked to the global crisis.
Easing the Federal funds rate -- the rate on overnight loans between banks -- would help counter that credit shortage and help avert any potential problems in the financial system.
"This is not your normal kind of rate cut," said G. David Orr, an economist at the First Union Corporation. "It was not taken to stimulate an economy being hurt by high interest rates. It was taken to protect the economy from a potential credit contraction resulting from loan losses at major money center banks and brokerages."
The Fed left unchanged, at 5 percent, the other short-term rate it controls -- the largely symbolic discount rate on loans it makes to banks.
The policy panel meets twice more this year -- on Nov. 17 and Dec. 22 -- and many analysts think further rate reductions are likely, especially if growth continues to show signs of moderating or if the global crisis further unsettles the markets.
"This is just the beginning," Mr. Orr said.
The Fed has been under growing pressure for months from Wall Street, manufacturers, farmers and other nations to cut rates. But within the central bank there has always been a band of determined inflation-fighters who are likely still to be wary of loosening policy.
Their leaders this year have been Jerry L. Jordan, the president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Cleveland, and William Poole, the president of the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis. Both have expressed concern at policy meetings this year that a rapid increase in the money supply is an early warning sign of inflationary pressures. How they voted at today's meeting will not be disclosed until the minutes are released on Nov. 19; their votes at the previous meeting, on Aug. 18, will be disclosed on Thursday.
The Fed may also have held to a quarter-point reduction today because of its experience in 1987, when it quickly cut rates after the stock market crash in October. Although Mr. Greenspan was widely praised at the time for increasing the flow of money into the financial system during a time of crisis, the economy proved stronger than expected, inflation began creeping up, and within months the Fed had to reverse itself and start raising rates.
While Fed officials have repeatedly stressed in recent weeks that they cannot act as central bankers to the world, their decision today, especially if followed by additional easing, could have some helpful effects on the global markets.
Lower American interest rates could help diminish the flow of capital from around the world to the United States, where Treasury securities have become the safe haven of choice for increasingly nervous investors. The less money flowing into the United States from abroad, the more is available for investment in other markets that need it more.
In the same way, rate cuts could weaken the dollar and help encourage lower rates in other countries, aiding governments, banks and companies that are coping with debts denominated in dollars and with tumbling currency values.

Yesterday, the Federal Reserve cut the target rate on Federal funds, the overnight lending rate among banks. The action was the first interest rate move by the Federal Reserve since March 1997 and the first cut since January 1996. The cut came after a long period of decline in interest rates on Treasury debt and some types of consumer loans.

TIRE MAKER LOWERS EARNINGS FORECAST FOR 3D QUARTER

BYLINE: Reuters 

 BODY:
The Goodyear Tire and Rubber Company, the international tire maker based in Akron, Ohio, forecast disappointing third-quarter results yesterday because of economic turmoil in Asia and Latin America and a summer strike at the General Motors Corporation. Goodyear said results were also hurt by a strong United States dollar, the costs to convert some plants in North America to seven-day operations and plans to address year 2000 issues. The 100-year-old company said it had lowered its forecast about 35 cents a share and now expects earnings from continuing operations of $180 million to $190 million, or $1.15 to $1.20 a share, for the quarter. The news sent the shares down $3.75, to $52.

HEADLINE: Tom Bradley, Mayor in Era Of Los Angeles Growth, Dies

BYLINE: By JANE FRITSCH 

 BODY:
Tom Bradley, the sharecropper's son who became Mayor of Los Angeles and presided over the city for two decades of explosive growth and change, died yesterday at the Kaiser Permanente Medical Center in West Los Angeles. He was 80.
The cause was a heart attack, hospital officials said. Mr. Bradley had been in poor health since March 1996, when he had his first heart attack. Two weeks later, after bypass surgery, a stroke left him partly paralyzed and unable to speak. 
 Mr. Bradley was Mayor from 1973 to 1993, an era in which Los Angeles was transformed from a collection of suburban neighborhoods to what Mr. Bradley liked to call a "world-class city," a place with glittering skyscrapers, a striking new skyline and a vibrant downtown. In the Bradley years, Los Angeles surpassed Chicago to become the nation's second largest city.
His election as the first black Mayor of Los Angeles, which was then the nation's third largest city and largely white, reflected a significant change in local politics in the United States. For most of that time, Mr. Bradley was an immensely popular figure whose stately bearing and placid demeanor seemed to reassure his increasingly polyglot city.
Soft-spoken and self-effacing, Mr. Bradley shunned some of the perquisites that his stature and office might have brought him. Calling it a foolish waste of money, he refused to use a cellular telephone that was installed in his car, a former aide recalled. Still, Mr. Bradley learned to move as easily in the society of the fabulously wealthy as he did in the world of the poor and disadvantaged from which he had come.
"There wasn't a lot of flash to him," said Dee Dee Myers, a former White House press secretary, who worked for Mr. Bradley in the 1980's. "His enemies always underestimated him, but at the end of the day he was always the last one standing."
 
Tenure Bracketed By Racial Strife
Despite a long period of relative harmony in the city, Mr. Bradley's tenure was clouded at the beginning and at the end by racial strife.
He first ran for mayor in 1969, when the Watts riots of four years earlier were still an open wound in Los Angeles. He was painted as a dangerous radical by the incumbent Mayor, Sam Yorty, and lost.
But by 1973, Mr. Bradley had forged a powerful coalition of black and white liberals and moderates, and soundly defeated Mr. Yorty to become the city's first black Mayor. That he did so at a time when the black population of Los Angeles was only about 15 percent was a testament to his broad appeal.
In April 1992, as Mr. Bradley was mulling whether to run for a sixth term, the city was roiled by three days of riots provoked by the acquittal of four white policemen who had been charged with the beating of an unarmed black motorist, Rodney G. King. Mr. Bradley was deeply affected by the riots and, five months later, announced that he would not run for mayor again.
"The April unrest tore at my heart," he said, "and I will not be at peace until we have healed our wounds and rebuilt our neighborhoods."
Like most in Los Angeles, he was taken by surprise by the rioting.
"He never really understood it," a friend recalled. "It was a tragedy in his life that you can't overestimate. It was like he was hit in the stomach with a two-by-four."
Since stepping down as Mayor, Mr. Bradley was associated with the Los Angeles office of Brobeck, Phleger & Harrison, a San Francisco law firm that hoped to capitalize on his ties to Asia; Mr. Bradley had vigorously courted businesses in Pacific Rim nations on behalf of Los Angeles while he was Mayor.
After his stroke, his activities for the firm were severely curtailed. Friends said he regained most of his mobility, but never regained his ability to speak. Even so, he maintained an active social life, with a group of loyal friends who accompanied him to lunch and civic events.
Friends read to Mr. Bradley regularly because, while his mind remained sharp, he could no longer read or write, said Wendy Greuel, a former aide. At a recent lunch with former aides, Mr. Bradley squinted his delight at jokes about himself, his shoulders heaving with the gaiety of the occasion, Ms. Greuel said.
 
How Socks Became Symbols of Poverty
Thomas Bradley, the second of seven children, was born on Dec. 29, 1917, on a cotton plantation in Calvert, Tex., 120 miles south of Dallas. His grandparents were slaves, and his father, Lee Thomas Bradley, was a sharecropper who abandoned the family not long after they moved to Los Angeles, when Tom was 7. His mother, Crenner Bradley, worked as a maid to support the children. Young Tom earned money with a paper route, and later as a publicity photographer for the comedian Jimmy Durante.
During the toughest of those early years, the family was so poor that Tom could not afford new shoes and socks. He lined his worn shoes with cardboard and vowed that when he got a job, he would have enough socks, he once told an interviewer.
"They became a symbol of my poverty," Mr. Bradley said. "When I was on the police department, I can remember every sale that was held in downtown Los Angeles, I always managed to stop by and stock up on socks, it was like a security blanket. Then one day I noticed I had about 200 pairs."
Mr. Bradley entered the University of California at Los Angeles on a track scholarship in 1937, but dropped out after his junior year to join the Los Angeles Police Department, where he stayed for 21 years.
In 1941, he married Ethel Mae Arnold, whom he had met at church when they were teen-agers. Mr. Bradley is survived by his wife and their daughters, Phyllis and Lorraine. A third daughter died on the day she was born.
 
Law Degree in Hand, A City Council Seat
While working as a police officer, Mr. Bradley went to law school at night and eventually received a law degree from Southwestern University. Meanwhile, he was working his way up from walking a beat to the rank of lieutenant, the highest rank a black officer had achieved at the time. But in 1961 he concluded that he could go no higher and quit the department.
He worked for a time for a law firm, but his real interest was politics, and in 1963 he ran for and won a seat on the Los Angeles City Council, to which he was re-elected twice.
In 1969, he made his first bid to unseat Mayor Yorty, who repeatedly raised the issue of race and asserted that Mr. Bradley was appealing for votes to blacks and "left-wing militants." At the same time, some militant blacks denounced Mr. Bradley as a "white man's candidate," and referred to him as Uncle Tom.
He sought to play down race as an issue, but had little success.
"I have no sympathy for lawlessness," Mr. Bradley said, "but even less sympathy for injustice, poverty, unemployment and slum housing."
Four years later, with the race issue receding and Mr. Yorty under attack in personal and financial matters, Mr. Bradley was elected to his first term as Mayor.
Nonconfrontational and intent on building coalitions, he set out to revive the storefronts and small businesses that had been wiped out during the Watts riots, and to position Los Angeles as the unofficial capital of the Pacific Rim for an era of growing trade.
For years, as a new wave of Hispanic and Asian immigrants were drawn to the city, both residential and commercial development went virtually unchecked.
In 1982, with Los Angeles booming, Mr. Bradley tried the first of two bids to defeat the incumbent Republican, George Deukmejian, for governor of California, but lost by less than one percentage point.
 
Height of Popularity With 1984 Olympics
Mr. Bradley reached the height of his popularity when he brought the Summer Olympic Games to Los Angeles in 1984. Despite a Soviet-led boycott, the Games went off without a hitch and showed off the glittering city to the world. He had fought hard to bring the event to Los Angeles, but at the same time he forced a tough agreement with the International Olympic Committee to indemnify the city against any possible financial losses. The Los Angeles games were the first privately financed Olympics and they turned a huge profit.
His reputation buoyed by the Olympics success, Mr. Bradley was re-elected Mayor in 1985 with 68 percent of the vote over John Ferraro, a conservative City Council member, who received only 30 percent.
Mr. Bradley said then: "Los Angeles is the city of hope and opportunity. I am a living example of that."
With his profile high, Mr. Bradley ran against Governor Deukmejian again in 1986, but was soundly defeated and vowed that it was his last bid.
In Mr. Bradley's five terms as Mayor, Los Angeles International Airport was built, the Port of Los Angeles became the biggest and busiest in the country, the city's financial and business district was revitalized and construction of a subway was begun.
But eventually, the years of growth for which Mr. Bradley could claim credit brought problems for which he was blamed. Pollution, traffic jams and overdevelopment had become major issues for Mr. Bradley in his later terms.
A symbol of propriety and ethics, Mr. Bradley felt particularly wounded in 1989 when newspapers began raising questions about his personal financial and business dealings. The reports, which prompted investigations by the law-enforcement authorities, described how for years Mr. Bradley had been paid as a director or consultant for banks that did business with the city.
Also, he had failed to disclose some investments and stock dealings. Eventually, he was cleared of any criminal wrongdoing, but he agreed to pay a $20,000 civil penalty for the disclosure lapses. And he conceded that he had made "an error in judgment" by accepting outside employment while Mayor. The damage to his reputation had been done.
"It was the worst year of my entire life," Mr. Bradley, an intensely private man, told a reporter in 1990.
 
Charter Limits Power Against Police Chief
But more difficult times were ahead. The videotape of the beating of Rodney G. King, played over and over on television within hours after it happened on March 3, 1991, led to calls for the ouster of Daryl F. Gates, the city's combative police chief.
Hamstrung by a city charter that gave Mr. Gates virtual lifetime tenure, Mr. Bradley appeared helpless to act. He began working behind the scenes to put pressure on Mr. Gates and eventually moved to dismiss him, but was blocked by an increasingly powerful City Council.
Relations between Mr. Bradley and Mr. Gates were so strained that when the rioting first erupted in April 1992, the two had not spoken for more than a year. Their poor communication was pointed to by a panel of inquiry led by William H. Webster, a former Director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, as a factor in the city's inability to act quickly to quell the disturbances.
Mr. Bradley, badly shaken by the acquittal of the white policemen, was uncharacteristically blunt in the hours after the verdict. At a news conference, he said he was "outraged" at the outcome of the trial.
"Today that jury asked us to accept the senseless and brutal beating of a helpless man," Mr. Bradley said.
He regained his composure in the tumultuous days after the verdict and set about to bring calm to the city, but critics said he shared blame for the riots in which more than 50 people died and property damage approached a billion dollars.
"He probably was outraged," Mr. Ferraro of the City Council said then, "but he's the Mayor of the city and he's got to keep his cool and calm."
Mr. Bradley quickly got his anger under control, Mr. Ferraro said, adding, "I think he's shown some leadership since then."
Several days after the riots had subsided, as he began working on plans to rebuild the city, Mr. Bradley was asked whether, if he were not the Mayor, he would be afraid to be a black man in Los Angeles.
"No," he said. "I would be angry."

 CORRECTION:
The obituary of former Mayor Tom Bradley of Los Angeles yesterday referred incorrectly in some copies to the landmark he attained with his election in 1973. While Los Angeles had a significantly smaller percentage of black voters than other big cities with black mayors, Mr. Bradley was not the first black mayor of a largely white major city; a majority of Cleveland's population was white when Carl B. Stokes was elected mayor in 1967.
