HEADLINE: Send In the Clueless

BYLINE: By PAUL KRUGMAN

 BODY:
There are two crucial things you need to understand about the current state of American politics. First, given the still dire economic situation, 2012 should be a year of Republican triumph. Second, the G.O.P. may nonetheless snatch defeat from the jaws of victory -- because Herman Cain was not an accident.
Think about what it takes to be a viable Republican candidate today. You have to denounce Big Government and high taxes without alienating the older voters who were the key to G.O.P. victories last year -- and who, even as they declare their hatred of government, will balk at any hint of cuts to Social Security and Medicare (death panels!). 
And you also have to denounce President Obama, who enacted a Republican-designed health reform and killed Osama bin Laden, as a radical socialist who is undermining American security.
So what kind of politician can meet these basic G.O.P. requirements? There are only two ways to make the cut: to be totally cynical or to be totally clueless.
Mitt Romney embodies the first option. He's not a stupid man; he knows perfectly well, to take a not incidental example, that the Obama health reform is identical in all important respects to the reform he himself introduced in Massachusetts -- but that doesn't stop him from denouncing the Obama plan as a vast government takeover that is nothing like what he did. He presumably knows how to read a budget, which means that he must know that defense spending has continued to rise under the current administration, but this doesn't stop him from pledging to reverse Mr. Obama's ''massive defense cuts.''
Mr. Romney's strategy, in short, is to pretend that he shares the ignorance and misconceptions of the Republican base. He isn't a stupid man -- but he seems to play one on TV.
Unfortunately from his point of view, however, his acting skills leave something to be desired, and his insincerity shines through. So the base still hungers for someone who really, truly believes what every candidate for the party's nomination must pretend to believe. Yet as I said, the only way to actually believe the modern G.O.P. catechism is to be completely clueless.
And that's why the Republican primary has taken the form it has, in which a candidate nobody likes and nobody trusts has faced a series of clueless challengers, each of whom has briefly soared before imploding under the pressure of his or her own cluelessness. Think in particular of Rick Perry, a conservative true believer who seemingly had everything it took to clinch the nomination -- until he opened his mouth.
So will Newt Gingrich suffer the same fate? Not necessarily.
Many observers seem surprised that Mr. Gingrich's, well, colorful personal history isn't causing him more problems, but they shouldn't be. If hypocrisy is the tribute vice pays to virtue, conservatives often seem inclined to accept that tribute, voting for candidates who publicly espouse conservative moral principles whatever their personal behavior. Did I mention that David Vitter is still in the Senate?
And Mr. Gingrich has some advantages none of the previous challengers had. He is by no means the deep thinker he imagines himself to be, but he's a glib speaker, even when he has no idea what he's talking about. And my sense is that he's also very good at doublethink -- that even when he knows what he's saying isn't true, he manages to believe it while he's saying it. So he may not implode like his predecessors.
The larger point, however, is that whoever finally gets the Republican nomination will be a deeply flawed candidate. And these flaws won't be an accident, the result of bad luck regarding who chose to make a run this time around; the fact that the party is committed to demonstrably false beliefs means that only fakers or the befuddled can get through the selection process.
Of course, given the terrible economic picture and the tendency of voters to blame whoever holds the White House for bad times, even a deeply flawed G.O.P. nominee might very well win the presidency. But then what?
The Washington Post quotes an unnamed Republican adviser who compared what happened to Mr. Cain, when he suddenly found himself leading in the polls, to the proverbial tale of the dog who had better not catch that car he's chasing. ''Something great and awful happened, the dog caught the car. And of course, dogs don't know how to drive cars. So he had no idea what to do with it.''
The same metaphor, it seems to me, might apply to the G.O.P. pursuit of the White House next year. If the dog actually catches the car -- the actual job of running the U.S. government -- it will have no idea what to do, because the realities of government in the 21st century bear no resemblance to the mythology all ambitious Republican politicians must pretend to believe. And what will happen then?

HEADLINE: America's Recent Grads, Now Sought in India

BYLINE: NEHA THIRANI


HIGHLIGHT: Indian companies offer low pay but lure young professionals facing a tough job market at home. 

 BODY:
Born and raised in Minneapolis, Win Bennet traveled extensively with his parents growing up, part of a family that enjoyed exploring different cultures. 
When he graduated from Brown University with a major in economics and international relations in 2009, the American job market was less than welcoming, to say the least -- so he looked to India. 
"India is a natural choice for a few reasons," said Mr. Bennet, 24, who studied urban planning in Bangalore in his junior year. "The Indian overseas diaspora is a very vibrant and welcoming community." Also, he said, Indian professional networks with the West are large, deep and growing. "It was easy to explore opportunities and find a niche that fit my passion and skill set," just by talking to family friends and acquaintances, he said. 
Mr. Bennet landed a job as an analyst at ICICI, India's largest private bank, and has lived in Mumbai for the past three years. 
With the economy at home showing no signs of improving, an increasing number of recent graduates from the United States are job-hunting in India. Eager for the talent, Indian companies have responded by setting up recruiting programs overseas. While the pay in India is usually much lower than a graduate would earn in America, a lower cost of living can mean a better quality of life. "The chance to travel the world and live in a colorful Asian democracy far outweighs salary considerations when you have just graduated," Mr. Bennet. 
Kunal Bahl, the co-founder of Snapdeal, an Indian e-commerce company, recently returned from a recruiting trip to the United States with stops at Columbia, the University of Pennsylvania, Northwestern and Stanford. "We don't have a very old legacy of Internet technology in India, and for a company that is as fast-growing as us the talent pool quickly dries up," said Mr. Bahl, 29, an engineer with a business degree from the Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania. 
When Snapdeal's team spread the word that they were planning a U.S. recruiting trip, they were surprised by the response: more than 2,000 resumes, 30 percent of them from people who were not of Indian descent. For many non-Indians, Mr. Bahl said, "It's not that they are not getting jobs there, but they are not getting the jobs they want." So young American graduates "would rather come to India with all the resources available and get to do exciting things," he said. He plans to return in the spring for another recruiting drive. 
Indians who have lived abroad for some time are also aggressively looking for work back home. "We do get a lot of C.V.'s from people abroad, especially Indians looking to come back to India," says Hitesh Oberoi, chief executive of Naukri.com, a leading Indian job site. "The number of Indians going abroad to study has increased significantly in the last few years, and they are potentially a great talent pool for companies here, especially start-ups," he said. 
Snapdeal is not alone in looking for fresh talent overseas; Mahindra & Mahindra is recruiting at the Wharton School at Penn along with Barclays and Royal Bank of Scotland. At job fairs held in New Jersey and California recently, Indian companies included FlipKart, InfoTech Enterprises, Jindal Steel & Power and Tata Motors. 
"In the recent past, a lot of Indians who have been living and working abroad have shown an interest in moving back to the country," said Mekin Maheshwari, president of engineering at FlipKart, of the decision to participate in the job fair. 
Universities have also noticed the trend. Rajiv Dewan, a senior associate dean at the Simon School of Business at the University of Rochester, said that about 20 percent of the school's 400 graduates were now taking jobs in Asia, up from less than 10 percent five years ago. Of the nearly 40 Indians in the class, about 10 have taken jobs back home, where in the past only a handful would have done so, he said. 
"In the past, if people come back they would be considered a failure," Mr. Dewan said during a recent visit to India. "Now, when people come back they feel that this is the best start for them."

HEADLINE: Dec. 5, 1933 | Ratification of 21st Amendment Ends Prohibition

BYLINE: THE LEARNING NETWORK


HIGHLIGHT: On Dec. 5, 1933, national Prohibition came to an end, as Utah became the 36th state to ratify the 21st Amendment to the Constitution. 

 BODY:
On Dec. 5, 1933, national Prohibition came to an end, as Utah became the 36th state to ratify the 21st Amendment to the Constitution. The amendment repealed the 18th Amendment, which had taken effect nearly 14 years earlier.
The New York Times noted that President Franklin Roosevelt made a "plea to the American people to employ their regained liberty first of all for national manliness." The president also said, "Tthis return of individual freedom shall not be accompanied by the repugnant conditions that obtained prior to the adoption of the Eighteenth Amendment and those that have existed since its adoption."

Prohibition was introduced after decades of campaigning by a nationwide temperance movement, which argued that alcohol consumption caused poor health, hurt families, and increased crime and bad behavior. The 18th Amendment, ratified in 1919 and put into effect in January 1920, banned the "manufacture, sale, or transportation of intoxicating liquors."
Many advocates of Prohibition believed that it would be a cure-all for society's problems. The well-known evangelist Rev. Billy Sunday proclaimed, "The slums will soon be a memory. We will turn our prisons into factories and our jails into storehouses and corncribs. Men will walk upright now, women will smile and children will laugh."
Prohibition would have the opposite effect, however. It led to a rise in organized crime and the establishment of a large black-market for alcohol smuggling and trade, a practice known as bootlegging. Many Americans ignored Prohibition laws, drinking alcohol at secret bars and clubs known as "speakeasies." Government agencies were unable to halt the flow of alcohol, due to a lack of funding and resources, and, in some cases, corruption. Prohibition cost the government hundreds of millions of dollars in law enforcement and lost tax revenue from the sale of alcohol.
By the end of the 1920s, even many prominent Prohibition advocates realized that Prohibition had failed and advocated for its repeal. Congress passed the 21st Amendment in February 1933. It was ratified by a series of state conventions rather than by state legislatures, which have been used to ratify every other amendment, as Congress felt that many state legislators remained beholden to pro-Prohibition interests.
Connect to Today:
The federal government currently bans the use and sale of marijuana, but there is a growing movement to legalize it. An October 2011 Gallup poll found that 50 percent of Americans support the
legalization of marijuana.
Some states have already legalized the use of marijuana for medical purposes and some states have decriminalized it, imposing only small fines or drug education classes on those charged with possession. According to the Times Topics: Marijuana and Medical Marijuana overview page, however, U.S. Attorney General Eric Holder maintains that the federal government will continue to enforce its laws against marijuana even if they conflict with state law. 
What similarities, if any, do you see between Prohibition and the federal ban on marijuana? What are some differences? Given the increasing public support for its legalization, do you think the ban on marijuana will be repealed in your lifetime? Why or why not?

Consumer confidence surges in November. Cyber Monday sales were up 33 percent over 2010, and up 29.3 percent over Black Friday. Retail e-mail volume also hit a record on Cyber Monday. President Obama supports a very successful Small Business Saturday. Black Friday increased car sales to their best rate since "cash for clunkers." Consumer debt fell in the third quarter. But Nathan A. Martin doesn't believe that retail sales rose as much as reported: "sales are measured in dollars, not units, thus the outrageous production of money creates inflation - inflation does not equal growth in sales, it equals growth in money production!"
The Data: Job Numbers Improve
Unemployment falls to 8.6 percent. Non-farm private business sector employment increased by 206,000 from October to November. Small businesses created 55,000 jobs in November. The Restaurant Performance Index stayed unchanged in October. New home sales increased in October but home prices weakened. More than 10 million properties now have negative equity.

The Economy: Central Banks Get Involved 
Shares jump as central banks try to ease Europe's financial woes. Here are five things to know about the deal. But Nigam Arora says the intervention raises questions:"The only explanation for the massive action is that central banks were concerned about a pending failure that is not publicly known." Peter Boockvar says another round of quantitative easing is "all but guaranteed." Meanwhile, our money supply goes through the roof. Extensions of unemployment benefitsand the payroll tax reduction are likely. And this guy wins cubicle of the year.

The Outsourcing Institute plans a Dec. 12 webinar on optimizing your outsourcing relationships.

The Week's Bests
Ways to improve your e-mail marketing. John Jantsch offers five suggestions, including "Serve snacks": "Currently, my newsletter format is designed to offer several compelling article abstracts grouped into a set of topics that I believe my readers expect from me. ... When I switched to this snack-sized, scanable format, I immediately noted that my response and engagement increased dramatically."
Analysis of the financial crisis. Matt Yglesias says: "Having ensured the basic stability of the banking system, monetary policy makers in America proceeded to forget all about their go-getter attitude and ability to reach deep into the practical and legal toolkit in order to get what they want. ... If in a time of crisis, the right thing to do is to get 'crazy,' then there's plenty more crazy stuff the Fed could be doing to boost overall spending in the American economy. Or if the right thing to do is to stay orthodox and ignore the human consequences, then there was no reason not to stay orthodox three years ago and refuse to lend at anything other than a penalty rate."
Reason to sell to your existing customers. Karl Stark and Bill Stewart say, "The problem is that as the management team's growth expectations increase, it gets increasingly harder to acquire more customers. ... To solve this growth dilemma, (we) need to ask three key questions: What revenue growth will we achieve if we keep our existing customers for just one additional month, on average? What will it cost us to do this by, say, improving customer service or adding customer benefits? How does this growth compare, both in magnitude and cost, to acquiring new customers?

HEADLINE: An 'Elderly-Based' Community

BYLINE: THE NEW YORK TIMES


HIGHLIGHT: Southbury, Conn., has morphed into a town whose population is overwhelmingly elderly. 

 BODY:
The Times reports on Monday on the transformation of Southbury, Conn., into a town of senior citizens -- a foreshadowing of the changes to come in many American towns.
Elderly people are now a greater portion of the population than at any time since the government began keeping track, and the Northeast, not warm weather retirement Meccas like the South and Southwest, has the largest percentage of people 65 and older, according to the Census Bureau....
Once dairy farming country, Southbury is now a place where the elderly are not just the dominant demographic but increasingly, the engine of the economy and the focus of town life. For now, it works. Long term, it may get more complicated.
"When Heritage Village first came in, it was us versus them," said First Selectman Bill Davis, speaking about the sprawling 55-and-over complex with 1,000 acres and about 4,000 residents, which opened in 1967. "But now, almost anything we do we take them into account. That's who we are. We're an elderly-based community."

 BODY:
As a political movement, Occupy Wall Street has attracted plenty of headlines, buzz and creative energy. Now, this being New York, it has its own film series. Rooftop Films, in partnership with several movie houses throughout the city, is presenting a free series of four films from Dec. 13 to 16 featuring issues that ignited the demonstrations.
Rooftop Films is a nonprofit best known for showing movies outdoors (hence the name). In a statement released on Monday, Dan Nuxoll, the program director for Rooftop, said the series was prompted by a public outpouring over the events surrounding Occupy Wall Street.
"As the situation in Zuccotti Park unfolded the last few months, Rooftop Films received countless e-mails and phone calls from filmmakers, activists and organizations who felt that it was important to put together screenings of films that focus on the issues that instigated the protests," Mr. Nuxoll said in the a news release. "We were never able to do a screening in the park, unfortunately, but we believe strongly that the discussion must continue, and we think these screenings can help sustain that conversation." 
In that spirit the first film in the series is "Just Do It: A Tale of Modern-Day Outlaws," which is billed as a "sneak preview," scheduled for 7 p.m. next Tuesday, Dec. 13, at reRun Gastropub Theater in the Dumbo section of Brooklyn. Directed by Emily James, it is a look at "climate activists" in Britain.
On Dec. 14 at 7 p.m. the screening will be "Battle for Brooklyn" at the Brooklyn Society for Ethical Culture in Park Slope. The directors Michael Galinksy and Suki Hawley will be available for a Q. and A. session about their 2012 Oscar-nominated documentary film about families and businesses uprooted in Brooklyn by the construction at Atlantic Yards of the Barclays Center, the new home for the New Jersey Nets (as they morph into the Brooklyn Nets).
At 7:30 on Dec. 15 "The Flaw," an examination of the causes behind the recent financial crisis, will be shown at the Film Society of Lincoln Center's Elinor Bunin Monroe Film Center. It will run ith Matthew Modine's 2011 short "Jesus Was a Commie," which presents provocative ideas about Jesus Christ and his political views. The series ends at 7:30 p.m. on Dec. 16 at UnionDocs in South Williamsburg, Brooklyn, with a series of short films and multimedia projects documenting Occupy Wall Street and other social movements.
Seating for the films will be on a first-come-first-served basis.

HEADLINE: Occupy Davis, as Covered by High School Journalists

BYLINE: HOLLY EPSTEIN OJALVO


HIGHLIGHT: How the student newspaper staff members at Davis Senior High School covered the events that occurred in the aftermath of the pepper-spraying incident at U.C. Davis. 

 BODY:
Dec. 6 1:05 p.m. | Updated 
Readers learned of the pepper-spraying incident at the University of California-Davis by reading coverage on The Lede, The Times's breaking news blog, in a post by Brian Stelter. The next day, Mr. Stelter reported that the university had responded by placing two officers on administrative leave, and Jennifer Medina followed up a day later with an article about the fallout from the incident, including how the chancellor, Linda P. B. Katehi, was responding to calls for her resignation. 
Meanwhile, the student journalists at Davis Senior High School, less than a mile from the university campus, were going into action, too. 
After the pepper-spray incident, staff members of the award-winning Blue Devil HUB heard about it on Facebook. The next day, they saw status updates about the U.C.-Davis chancellor's planned press conference, then used the social networking site to get organized, sending the editor in chief, a reporter, a photographer and a videographer to cover it. And they stayed for hours, capturing on video the ensuing "silent protest" by students as she left the building. 
The student staff members then used Facebook and YouTube to share their photographs and video with their school community - and the world. The Blue Devil HUB video of Ms. Katehi walking through a group of silent student protesters was played on the "Today Show" and "Good Morning America," and has gotten more than 127,000 hits on YouTube to date. 
Ultimately, they covered the events with articles and multimedia, both in print and online. Their coverage includes articles, video, photos, audio and an interactive timeline.
In an e-mail, their teacher and adviser, Kelly Wilkerson, told us about her students' work and their process: 
Our staff members have had to learn how to cover a breaking news story, posting videos on YouTube that have attracted 120,000 views. Along the way, they have had to confront issues of bias (student editors made the decision to pull some reporters off the story because they had made favorable, or unfavorable, comments about the protest on their Facebook pages). They have also been granted incredible access by college students who sometimes distrust the mainstream media. For example, when Chancellor Katehi was escorted out of a building after a tense standoff, a student leader shouted to the crowd, "Katehi just left, and so did the media." Our high school journalists, however, were still on the scene.
Late last month, the student newspaper staff members put out a one-page special issue with more coverage of the fallout from the pepper-spray incident and a look at a coming protest on University of California campuses, along with interviews about the Constitutional issues involved and comparisons to nonviolent action in history. 
In a phone interview, Ms. Wilkerson -- who spent five years as a news writer for CNN before becoming a teacher and newspaper adviser -- said her student staff members posted the special issue online and distributed a print edition to the social studies and history teachers in their school. And that week, her students said, the social studies teachers all used their special issue to teach about the event, from the perspectives of United States history, civics, economics and geography. 
Chloe Kim, the Blue Devil HUB's editor in chief, said she and several other newspaper staff members headed over to the campus in the afternoon to cover the press conference and see what would happen. 
Only the videographer, Anna Sturla, had her school-issued press pass with her. It was enough to get her into the press conference, where she shot video alongside journalists from the mainstream media. ("I was shaking," she said in an interview. "I had never talked to an adult as a journalist.")
The students interviewed student protesters while they waited for Ms. Katehi to leave the building, and watched as the protesters debated what to do when she emerged. "I actually got the sense that the student protesters were more willing to talk to us" than to professional reporters, Ms. Kim said. 
Finally, the protesters decided to line the walkway and sit silently as Ms. Katehi walked through the group. Ms. Sturla was in position to shoot video of the "silent walk." 
That evening, the staff members gathered at Ms. Sturla's house, transcribing notes, editing photos and video and pulling together a story. Anders Young, the staff photo editor, said earlier that week the newspaper had reintroduced its Web site, and the staff members had challenges using the new system. It took him, he said, about two hours to get photos up online, and he spread the word about them on Facebook. 
When the coverage went up on the newspaper's Web site, traffic "skyrocketed," Ms. Kim said. Mr. Young later created a timeline of the events, using his own photographs as well as images available under Creative Commons licensing, which has gotten a lot of traffic. 
Ms. Kim said that when the staff members put together their one-page issue, they sent e-mails to every social studies teacher, "respectfully requesting that they use the special issue to teach about the events." Several teachers expressed gratitude, she said, for providing the material. Staff members have received enthusiastic feedback from other students as well, many of whom are applying to the U.C. system for college and are concerned, Ms. Kim said, about rising tuition and about student rights on campus. 
And the experience has changed the way the newspaper staff members operate. Ms. Kim said that two print reporters have been reassigned to the Web site, and the staff members are now posting more content, with greater frequency, online than they were previously. 
After a high school career in which she has been active in journalism, Ms. Kim hopes to continue to pursue the craft - perhaps at U.C. Davis, where, among other schools, she has applied for next year.

HEADLINE: City Opera Calls for Mediator in Impasse With Unions

BYLINE: DANIEL J. WAKIN


HIGHLIGHT: New York City Opera announced on Monday that it was seeking the help of a federal mediator to address a deadlock with the unions representing its chorus and orchestra. 

 BODY:
New York City Opera announced on Monday that it was seeking the help of a federal mediator in a deadlock with the unions representing its chorus and orchestra. The company's management declared an impasse last Thursday when the two sides were unable to come to terms on new contracts. City Opera has reduced its budget by nearly two thirds and has moved out of its Lincoln Center home to save money. It is seeking to pay the chorus members and musicians for each rehearsal and performance, with reduced health benefits, while the unions want to be compensated by the week and are seeking stronger guarantees of employment.
A spokeswoman for the players, Gail Kruvand, a double bassist, said the orchestra's union was discussing the matter. Alan S. Gordon, the executive director of the American Guild of Musical Artists, which represents the chorus and others, sounded skeptical about management's mediation effort. "They said they had made their final economic offer and they would not change," he said. "Unless that statement was untrue, there's nothing to mediate."
Risa Heller, a company spokeswoman, said, "We have always been open to mediation." She said that the unions wanted it during negotiations but that no mediator ended up being engaged. She also said that the company had not yet discussed the issue with union negotiators after talks ended last week.

HEADLINE: With a Little Help, East London Embraces Tech

BYLINE: MARK SCOTT


HIGHLIGHT: A section of London once known for its dreariness is becoming home to many high-technology and new-media start-ups. 

 BODY:
LONDON - When Eventbrite, a start-up based in San Francisco that sells tickets online, decided to open its first international office, the founders turned to the East End of London.
The British capital offered a thriving music and theater scene, a large work force of young, multilingual college graduates and easy access to both the Asian and North American markets. In October, the technology company moved into a converted jewelry workshop in Saffron Hill, a district that was notorious for crime in the 19th century and inspired Fagin's Den in "Oliver Twist."
"London will be our hub for the rest of Europe," said Renaud Visage, a co-founder of Eventbrite who splits his time among the Bay Area, London and Paris. "It's a natural progression for U.S. start-ups to move to the U.K., then expand further afield."
 Once a rundown area dominated by derelict warehouses and manufacturing sites, East London has emerged as a miniversion of Silicon Valley, attracting hundreds of technology and new media start-ups.
Rundown greasy spoons have been replaced by hipster coffeehouses that serve $6 macchiatos to trendy customers in their 20s. Local pubs like The Queen of Hoxton and Commercial Tavern now stock high-end European microbrews. Amid the revitalization, the price of office space has jumped as much as 50 percent at some buildings.
"All the start-ups out here are forming our own little community," said Paul Brine, chief marketing officer for the Web site FarFetch, which provides an online marketplace for high-end European and North American fashion boutiques. "It helps to have a support network as we're all working towards the same goal."
The local industry is getting a helping hand from the British government. Last year, Prime Minister David Cameron announced a $23 million investment fund to attract technology entrepreneurs to East London, which the government calls Tech City.
Officials also created an entrepreneurial visa to fast-track immigration approval for non-Europeans interested in starting businesses in Britain, and announced $312 million of equity finance for fast-growing homegrown technology companies.
"Our role is to make sure the right infrastructure is in place to help the tech cluster grow," said Eric Van Der Kleij, the British government's "entrepreneur in residence," who oversees the state-backed Tech City Investment Organization. "My target is to set a date to close our organization because the private sector is doing so well."
The government's strategy is starting to pay off. London-based companies attracted $433 million of venture capital in the first nine months of 2011, according to the data provider Dow Jones VentureSource. That is a 25 percent increase over the same period last year and the largest amount raised since the beginning of the recent recession.
The city has also been gaining ground on Britain's most established start-up cluster, in Cambridge, which has fed off its university to churn out successful tech companies like the chip designer ARM Holdings and the business software company Autonomy.
"U.S. investors are paying increased attention to what's going on in London," said David Hornik, a partner at the Silicon Valley venture capitalist firm August Capital, during a recent trip to Britain. "There's huge interest from companies over here to be funded by established American V.C.'s."
Silicon Valley stalwarts are considering East London, too. In September, Google announced plans to open a seven-story office building in the heart of East London. The company will use the space to run workshops, show off new products and provide office space for organizations that support local start-ups. Intel is building a computer research lab in the area, and Cisco Systems has pledged $500 million of investment over the next five years, including the construction of an innovation center at the site of the 2012 Olympic Games.
Despite London's vibrant start-up community, the city still lacks many basics that help to fuel entrepreneurial activity. Mr. Brine of FarFetch said the company had to beg to break its lease when it outgrew its current warehouse office. Eventually, the property owner agreed to shorten the contract.
Bullseyehub, a Web site that helps event organizers promote their shows online, had trouble finding qualified developers and engineers in London as it grew from five people to a team of 28 in less than a year. To fill the gap, they had to recruit a product manager from Silicon Valley with experience in scaling up small tech companies.
"London is a fantastic place to run a business, but there's a shortage of people who have been in successful start-ups," said Alex Will, 28, a founder of the company, whose revenue now exceeds $1.5 million.
Britain's technology infrastructure also may dampen East London's growth. The country ranks 25th for Internet broadband speeds, according to the Web infrastructure company Akamai. That places Britain - the world's sixth-largest economy - behind countries like Romania and Latvia.
And even though the country's new entrepreneurial visa has helped to attract entrepreneurs to London, the system can be too inflexible to entice the best talent, according to Reshma Sohoni, a United States-born partner in Seedcamp, an investment firm that finances early-stage companies.
To qualify for a visa, entrepreneurs must have at least $78,000 in financing in place from registered venture capitalists or the British government. Ms. Sohoni said the Australian co-founder of a start-up that she backed was turned away because he had raised only $70,000.
"The government needs to focus on getting the infrastructure right," she said. "East London is getting traction with investors. Now we need start-up success stories to convince them to stay."

HEADLINE: Zynga Rival in Japan Prices $1.2 Billion I.P.O.

BYLINE: HIROKO TABUCHI and EVELYN M. RUSLI


HIGHLIGHT: Nexon, a fast-growing Asian online game company, set the price for its initial public offering at $16.68 a share, a debut that could value the company at $7.2 billion. 

 BODY:
TOKYO - The online game company Nexon, a fast-growing Asian rival to Zynga, on Monday set the price for its initial public offering at 1,300 yen a share, a debut that could value the company at 560 billion yen, or $7.2 billion.
The public offering by Nexon -- on track to be the biggest Japanese I.P.O. this year -- underscores investor confidence that online game companies will continue to grow despite a cloudy outlook for the global economy. Nexon is expected to go public on Dec. 14 on the Tokyo Stock Exchange.
Founded in South Korea in 1994, Nexon has been a pioneer in developing free online games that users can access at no charge, but must pay for virtual goods like clothes and tools for their avatars. 
 Zynga, which has grown rapidly by developing such games on Facebook, set its price range last week. The offering, which aims to raise about a billion dollars, could value the company at $7 billion.
Though that pricing reflects tempered expectations in the I.P.O. market, it will still be the biggest technology offering in the United States since Google in 2004.
In a filing with the Tokyo Stock Exchange, Nexon said it would price its shares at 1,300 yen, compared with an expected range of 1,200 to 1,400 yen. At that price, Nexon could raise about 91.1 billion yen ($1.17 billion), the largest I.P.O. since the pharmaceutical company Otsuka Holdings raised 160 billion yen in December 2010. It is offering 70,100,000 shares, with an option for its underwriter, Nomura Securities, to sell an additional 5.3 million shares, depending on demand.
The company has hired Morgan Stanley, Nomura and Goldman Sachs to serve as the joint global coordinators for the offering.
Nexon has more than 77 million active monthly users, compared with Zynga's 260 million. Net profit at Nexon, which employs 3,240 people, mostly in its native South Korea, has nearly tripled in the last two years, to 21.64 billion yen in 2010, according to its filing with the Tokyo exchange. In the same period, revenue has roughly doubled, to 69.78 billion yen.
The company, which plans to use the proceeds to repay debt, build facilities and invest in product development, derives most of its business from Asia. Last year, China and South Korea accounted for 66 percent of revenue.

HEADLINE: Monday Motorsports: Ferrari and Red Bull Abandon Formula One Teams Association

BYLINE: JONATHAN SCHULTZ


HIGHLIGHT: The teams expressed frustration at the association's inability to effectively control team costs. 

 BODY:
The body created to represent the mutual goals and grievances of Formula One teams is losing two highly visible members of its rank and file.
Red Bull, the winner of the 2010 and 2011 Constructors' championships, and Ferrari announced their withdrawals from the Formula One Teams Association on Dec. 2.
"FOTA's drive has run its course," said Ferrari in a statement.
Among the association's most contentious projects was to establish spending caps, which were agreed on in principle by the association's 11 member teams in 2009, as a means of controlling costs and leveling the playing field. The so-called Resource Restriction Agreement was introduced when Luca di Montezemolo, the Ferrari chief executive, led the association.
The remaining members of the association are scheduled to meet on Tuesday to discuss next steps for the organization.
In other motorsports news:
Bernie Ecclestone, the boss of Formula One, extended the deadline for organizers of the United States Grand Prix, the Formula One race scheduled for Nov. 18, 2012, in Austin, Tex., to prove that the requisite funding was in place for the race. The World Motor Sport Council is expected to ratify the 2012 Formula One calendar on Wednesday, the day on which Mr. Ecclestone said adequate funding must be proven by the organizers. The grand prix would take place at the Circuit of the Americas, a race circuit that was under construction outside the Texas capital until last month, when organizers stopped work because they did not have a contract in hand from Mr. Ecclestone to host the race.
 Sprint Cup will be called Sprint Cup through at least 2016. Nascar announced on Dec. 3 that its title sponsor in the elite Cup series signed a three-year contract extension. The current contract with the telecommunications company applies through the 2013 season. Officials at Nascar said they hoped that the commitment from Sprint would help teams secure sponsors to fund their race campaigns, a difficult proposition even for successful teams.
 Newman/Haas Racing, the team co-founded by the actor Paul Newman, announced last week that it would not field a team for the 2012 IndyCar season. "The economic climate no longer enables Newman/Haas Racing to participate in open wheel racing at this time," said Carl Haas, who founded the team with his friend Newman in 1983, in a statement. Newman/Hass driver Oriol Servia finished fourth in the overall championship in 2011.

HEADLINE: The Search for an Era of Labor Peace

BYLINE: STEVEN GREENHOUSE


HIGHLIGHT: Boeing's agreement with the machinists' union has parallels with a 1948 accord between General Motors and the United Automobile Workers, another far-reaching contract meant to overcome a history of strife. 

 BODY:
When the Boeing Company announced its far-reaching, precedent-setting agreement with the machinists' union last week, all the talk was about the ushering in of a new era of labor peace between a company and union that were long known for their horrendous labor relations record. That record included five strikes since 1977, among them a 58-day walkout in 2008 that cost Boeing $1.8 billion.
When I wrote about the Boeing deal, I realized that there were some uncanny parallels with another far-reaching contract - and far more precedent-setting one - reached in 1948 between General Motors, then by far the nation's largest company, and the United Automobile Workers.
Both Boeing now and General Motors then were eager to ramp up production, but both companies worried that another round of painful strikes would throw a wrench into their expansion efforts. In late 1945, a 113-day strike by 175,000 workers had paralyzed G.M., with the union demanding hefty raises not just to enable workers to keep pace with raging inflation, but to help stimulate the overall national economy. One of the strike's slogans was "Purchasing power for prosperity."
G.M.'s president at the time, Charles E. Wilson, feared another walkout by the militant U.A.W., then headed by Walter Reuther, especially because G.M. had ambitious plans to invest $3.5 billion - about $30 billion in today's dollars - to expand production to take advantage of the huge pent-up consumer demand from World War II and the flood of Americans moving to the suburbs.
Fearing new union conflagrations, both Boeing and General Motors agreed, in essence, to buy labor peace by offering unusually generous contracts.

In 1948, G.M. signed a two-year contract - often called a "grand bargain" - that offered the auto workers an 11 percent raise over two years, an annual cost-of-living adjustment to help workers keep up with inflation and a newfangled notion: an additional 2 percent annual raise, called the annual improvement factor, intended to let G.M.'s workers profit from the company's steadily improving productivity. (I write about this landmark contract in my book, "The Big Squeeze, Tough Times for the American Worker," pages 73-76.) 
Boeing, too, has been eager to expand, with its current backlog of 3,500 planes valued at $273 billion. (Like General Motors, it should be noted Boeing worried that a new, prolonged strike would give a big boost to its competitors, especially Airbus.) 
Boeing's six-year contract - its grand bargain with the International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers - contained many elements similar to those in the 1948 G.M. contract: annual wage increases of 2 percent, cost-of-living adjustments, a productivity incentive program intended to pay bonuses of 2 percent to 4 percent. In addition, Boeing gave the union something it badly wanted - it pledged to add several thousand jobs in Washington State (rather than another state) as it moves to expand production of its 737 Max passenger jet to 42 aircraft a month from 35 a month. 
Tom Wroblewski, president of the machinists local that represents Boeing workers in Washington State, spoke for both sides when he said the agreement "signals the start of a new relationship that can both meet our members' expectations for good jobs, while giving Boeing the stability and productivity it needs to succeed."
For Boeing, one big, additional benefit of the "grand bargain" is that the newly happy machinists union has promised - assuming the rank and file ratifies the deal - to push the National Labor Relations Board to drop its complaint against Boeing for building a $750 million assembly plant in South Carolina rather than Washington State, a complaint originally brought at the machinists' behest.
(I should note that Boeing, like G.M. six decades ago, can afford to be generous to its workers because it is in an oligopoly situation with few competitors, making it easier to pass on increased labor costs to its customers.)
Because G.M. was the largest and most influential company in the nation, its 1948 contract generated a cascade of large me-too raises at companies across the United States. Not only that, its two-year bargain for labor peace was so successful that it caused G.M. and the auto workers to reach an even more generous five-year contract in 1950 that assured five years without strikes. In that agreement, G.M. promised the auto workers the highest employee pensions in the country. (In the new Boeing deal, the company - at a time when many companies are freezing traditional pensions and not giving them to new hires - agreed to make its pension formula more generous for current employees and to continue providing traditional pensions to new hires.)
Like G.M.'s 1948 agreement with the U.A.W., its 1950 contract caused a flood of copycat deals in which hundreds of other companies agreed to provide generous raises and benefits in exchange for years of labor peace - a wave of contracts that went far to create America's great middle class during the 1950s. As Nelson Lichtenstein wrote in his biography of Walter Reuther, "The Most Dangerous Man in Detroit," Business Week hailed the 1950 deal as "industrial statesmanship of a very high order" and The Washington Post declared it "a great event in industrial history."
Professor Lichtenstein, a labor historian at the University of California, Santa Barbara, sees the Boeing deal as far different from the G.M. deal in one important respect. He does not believe other companies are going to rush to copy the Boeing deal. Indeed, Boeing signed its generous contract in an era when many companies are reluctant to deal with labor unions, and those that do often seem to be demanding concessions. 
Professor Lichtenstein said, "This kind of successful private-sector bargaining is so unusual today - and the Boeing situation is so different from the rest of the economy - that it will set no 'pattern.'"

HEADLINE: Wealthy New Yorkers Are Staying In State, Census Shows

BYLINE: SAM ROBERTS


HIGHLIGHT: Wealthier New Yorkers do not appear to be leaving the state, as many critics of the so-called millionaires' tax claim. 

 BODY:
As Albany debates whether to raise taxes on the wealthy, there appears to be little conclusive evidence that the so-called millionaires' tax imposed in 2009 on individuals who make more than $200,000 drove New Yorkers out of state. The tax is scheduled to lapse on Dec. 31, but Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo is negotiating revisions in the tax code with legislative leaders that would raise taxes on wealthier New Yorkers.
Opponents of extending the surcharge have argued that it would chase away the rich and, as a result, reduce overall tax revenue. But two census analyses do not support that view. 
 According to the Census Bureau's latest American Community Survey, the average household income of those who left the state in 2010 was $44,739. The average for those who came was $55,419 - the largest differential in at least five years. 
"Despite claims to contrary," said Andrew A. Beveridge, a sociologist at Queens College of the City University of New York, "it appears that among affluent households, more chose to move to New York State and City than chose to leave it."
A separate analysis of census data found that the number of households making more than $250,000 who lived in New York a year earlier but left peaked in 2004 and has generally declined since 2007. About 14,000 households in 2009 and the about the same number in 2010 reported having left New York within the past year, the lowest numbers in that category since 2003. 
That analysis did not take into account inflation, and could reflect lower migration rates in general across the country.

 BODY:
Modest Bonus Year on Wall St., but Stock Could Yield Fortunes | Buffeted by lackluster profits and turmoil in the global markets, Wall Street is bracing for one of the worst bonus seasons in recent memory. But in the alchemy of high finance, bankers are hoping to turn the slump to their advantage.
Financial firms are preparing to dole out huge amounts of stock at depressed prices, the value of which could rise substantially in a few years.
"This year is the perfect situation where they can say it is a modest bonus season, but in the end, it could end up making many of them zillionaires," said Jonathan R. Macey, a professor of corporate law and finance at Yale. "Not all banks may do well in the long run, but most will."

HEADLINE: In Gingrich, Romney Now Sees a Grave Threat

BYLINE: JOHN HARWOOD


HIGHLIGHT: Mitt Romney has run a textbook campaign, but Newt Gingrich's surge in popularity, a month before voting starts, is cause for concern. 

 BODY:
 BOSTON - Inside a drab office building here, Mitt Romney's aides have been following all the rules. Now they'll find out if the rules still apply.
Build on Mr. Romney's 2008 run to assemble a broad but lean campaign infrastructure? Check.
Focus the candidate's message, in strong debate performances and well-controlled campaign events, on the core issue of economic revival? Check.
Take the long view toward a general election war against President Obama? Check.
Yet Mr. Romney, a former governor of Massachusetts, suddenly faces a challenge from Newt Gingrich, who is enjoying a tidal surge in support. Mr. Gingrich, shredding campaign textbooks that prize preparation and discipline, has leads in polls in Florida, Iowa and South Carolina, and is drawing closer in New Hampshire, Mr. Romney's redoubt.
The timing of Mr. Gingrich's rise, just a month before the nomination voting starts, and his track record in national Republican politics make his a graver threat than earlier surges by Representative Michele Bachmann, Gov. Rick Perry of Texas and Herman Cain. That's clear from Mr. Romney's allusions to Mr. Gingrich, a former House speaker, as a "lifelong politician," an "insider" and a "lobbyist" - with more probably to come in debates and perhaps television advertisements.
"Mitt likes to say he served in government but didn't inhale," said one of his aides, Eric Fehrnstrom. "Newt has taken large inhalations of Washington air."
But the confidence of Romney supporters has been shaken. For the first time since the nomination field became set in late summer, "it is possible" that Mr. Romney could lose, said Vin Weber, a Republican former congressman from Minnesota.
A Scramble to Expand
Team Romney so far has been soothed by the flaws of his rivals. None can match Mr. Romney's combination of resume, presidential bearing, campaign experience, financing and organization.
Mr. Romney's staff numbers around 80 - less than half its size four years ago, but enough for the arcane tasks of fielding delegate slates, securing ballot access, planning events and amassing endorsements. It includes roughly a dozen fund-raising aides, who coordinate with regional finance consultants and a volunteer national finance team.
Mr. Gingrich's organization, beyond himself and his wife, Callista, has been tiny. He is now scrambling to expand it, while counting on online social networks and other modern communications tools to create the political equivalent of a flash mob.
"In the Internet age, it's possible there will be a lot of self-organization," said Joe Gaylord, a longtime confidant of Mr. Gingrich. "Newt believes that."
Can it work in the Iowa caucuses, which by reputation demand that successful campaigns guide supporters to protracted midwinter meetings in schools, firehouses and church basements? Can it convert popular support into nominating delegates in a fast-moving gantlet of primaries?
Team Romney can only hope not.
"There's another name for 'an unconventional campaign,' and that's 'a losing campaign,' " said Mr. Weber, a former House ally of Mr. Gingrich who was helping Mr. Romney raise money in Washington last week. "There are reasons we call things 'conventional' - because they work."
But conventional tactics sometimes outlive their usefulness. Steve Schmidt, a Republican strategist, said there was a "quadrennial industry" of paycheck-seeking Iowa operatives who profit from "the myth that organization wins Iowa."
Mike Murphy, a veteran Republican ad-maker, said: "Is it helpful? Sure. But message moves people."
For Mr. Gingrich, Mr. Murphy said, "The issue is, does he have money for TV ads? He could."
The Establishment
TV advertisements form only part of the campaign message. Mr. Gingrich's inclination to hubris and rhetorical excess will test his rise; so will scrutiny of his checkered personal life, speakership and lucrative consulting career.
Romney aides prefer that others carry the attack. That includes the news media and candidates obscured by Mr. Gingrich's rise, like Gov. Rick Perry of Texas.
But they may not have that luxury. They believe, for instance, that Mr. Perry has depleted his once-formidable war chest.
In the meantime, a Romney machine built on establishment credibility keeps churning. At headquarters last week, Michael O. Leavitt, a former governor of Utah and member of President George W. Bush's cabinet, shared an office with Ron Kaufman, a former White House political director for the first president Bush.
 While The Manchester Union-Leader endorsed Mr. Gingrich, former Senator John Sununu of New Hampshire wrote an op-ed article in The Boston Globe criticizing him. Mr. Sununu's father, a former governor and White House chief of staff, is among several major New Hampshire politicians to endorse Mr. Romney.
 Yet Mr. Gingrich, having led the 1994 Republican Revolution, boasts an organic connection to the party's conservative base that Mr. Romney cannot match. Ken Khachigian, a speechwriter for President Ronald Reagan, said primary voters may care less about Mr. Romney's superior electability than about Mr. Gingrich's superior ability to articulate their "deep animosity" toward Mr. Obama.
 "Parties sometimes make big mistakes," Mr. Weber said. "Democrats nominated McGovern and lost 49 states" to President Richard M. Nixon in 1972.
 "I hope my party doesn't make one," he said.

HEADLINE: The Reinvention of Political Morality

BYLINE: THOMAS B. EDSALL


HIGHLIGHT: Mitt Romney's deceptive ad about President Obama's economic policies is only the latest moment in a long history of political sleight-of-hand that has its roots in the 1980s. 

 BODY:
Struggling to justify a recent television spot that reached new heights of deception, a top operative in Mitt Romney's 2012 presidential campaign put it plainly, while insisting on anonymity:
"First of all, ads are propaganda by definition. We are in the persuasion business, the propaganda business . Ads are agitprop.... Ads are about hyperbole, they are about editing. It's ludicrous for them to say that an ad is taking something out of context.... All ads do that. They are manipulative pieces of persuasive art."
The back story: On October 16, 2008, campaigning in Londonderry, New Hampshire, Obama cast his opponent, John McCain, as out of touch with the problems facing the country - a month after the financial collapse that saw the American economy crater. Obama was expressing his incredulity at McCain's lack of understanding of the full import of the world-engulfing fiscal crisis: "Senator McCain's campaign actually said, and I quote, 'If we keep talking about the economy, we're going to lose.' "
Fast forward to 2011. Two weeks ago, the Romney campaign, perhaps banking on the arcane nature of its deception, instigated a new epoch in aggressive messaging and took Obama's 2008 Londonderry remarks and obliterated the fact that Obama was at that time quoting the words of a McCain staffer. Obama's statement was cut to "If we keep talking about the economy, we're going to lose" - with the erroneous implication that the "we" referred not to McCain's 2008 effort but to the current Obama campaign. 
The non-partisan web site Politifact, which evaluates the accuracy of political ads, said that the Romney spot was "ridiculously misleading," and gave the ad its worst rating, "pants on fire."
The significance of the spot lies in its explicit distortion of an opponent's remark, but the spot's direct duplicity is also the latest step in the transgression by political operatives of formerly agreed-upon ethical boundaries. What was once considered sleazy becomes the norm.
Over the past four decades, moral standards governing the conduct of political competition have been violated by both left and right, with two goals: winning elections and making money. In this endeavor, the early 1980s were a fertile period. 
Shortly after Ronald Reagan was sworn into office, three of his campaign operatives, Charlie Black, Paul Manafort and Roger Stone, recognized that they could make money from their willingness to break the unwritten rule requiring the separation of campaign consulting from lobbying and collect huge fees in the process. 
Stone, who first won fame by orchestrating dirty tricks for Richard Nixon in 1972, proved by far the most creative: his rules include "politics is not about uniting people. It's about dividing people" and "getting your fifty-one per cent"; "attack, attack, attack-never defend"; and "admit nothing, deny everything, launch counterattack." 
In 1981, Stone and his confreres joined together and set up the first "double-breasted" political consulting and lobbying firm - Black, Manafort and Stone (BM&S) - erasing the traditional line separating the two.
During elections, the firm's principals served as paid consultants conceptualizing and executing key campaign strategies for Republican candidates; when the election was over, and close bonds with successful politicians had been firmly established, the operatives resumed their lobbying activities. Their decision paid off handsomely. Clients seeking access to power brokers in the Republican-controlled Senate flocked to BM&S, where partners could confidently guarantee access to those members of the House and Senate they had guided to victory - a promise no other firm was then able to make.
It didn't take long for the practice to become standardized, and today firms on both sides of the aisle are "double breasted." It is just this kind of 'inside-the-beltway' cronyism that both the Tea Party and Occupy Wall Street define as corrupt. 
The willingness to horse trade without compunction spread quickly. On the Democratic side, Congressman Anthony Coelho of California was picked in 1981 to chair the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee. The previous year, business groups, along with their political-action committees and lobbyists, had moved decisively to the Republican Party and Coelho foresaw a dangerous future in which corporate support for Democrats dried up.
Until Coelho took over as chair of the D.C.C.C., the fact that contributors were buying a commodity - access to elected officials -was implicit rather than explicit. 
Cohelo came to believe that a more effective way to convince lobbyists to open their wallets was to lay the deal out on the table. He created a hierarchy of clubs - the Speaker's Club, the Chairman's Club, and so on - for donors. The higher the dues you paid, the more intimate your access to Democratic House leaders and to Democratic committee chairs was.
"Members of the Speaker's Club serve as trusted, informal advisers to the Democratic members of Congress," a promotional brochure declared. When Coelho was asked what the givers got, he answered: "Access. Access. They meet with the leadership and with the chairmen of the committees. We sell ... the opportunity to be heard." 
The business community may have liked Republicans better - Republicans had the White House and the Senate - but Democrats still controlled the House and the legislative agenda. Democrats determined which bills would be called up for action and when. For a lobbyist seeking to tack an amendment onto a bill, access to the appropriate committee chairman could prove crucial.
With the cost of access now clearly defined, lobbyists knew that if they did not play ball, others would, putting the interests of their clients at risk. Few could afford to tell Coelho, "No." 
Some reform-minded Democratic candidates were uncomfortable with Coelho's tactics, but no one in a tough race turned down D.C.C.C. money. Coelho's cash-for-access worked.
While Coelho's skills were praised by both Democratic and Republican fundraisers, Republicans have generally demonstrated far more willingness to push the envelope. 
Take the end run candidates started to do around campaign finance law - specifically around the 1974 amendments to the Federal Election Campaign Act - legislation which, following Watergate, aimed to reduce the role of private money in politics and to establish spending limits in exchange for public funding of presidential races. 
In 1976, and throughout the 1980s, all presidential candidates accepted public financing in the primary and general elections. One of the most common complaints among Republicans and Democrats, however, was that accepting public money required candidates to stay within constricting state-by-state spending limits, limits that operatives argued were unrealistically low in such key battlegrounds as Iowa and New Hampshire. 
In 1980, an obscure Republican National Committee staffer, Robert Perkins,
who never achieved the celebrity status of Tony Coelho, found a way to circumvent spending limits by exploiting a seemingly minor 1979 amendment to federal election law. In doing so, Perkins opened up one of the biggest loopholes in post-Watergate history.
The 1979 amendment was designed to encourage local grassroots political activities - get-out-the-vote drives, telephone banks, coordination of volunteer programs, voter registration, the purchase of bumper stickers, buttons, lawn signs and other campaign materials - by exempting the money raised to pay for them from federal contribution regulations.
Under Perkins's direction, this exemption was used to collect "soft-money" - unlimited contributions from corporations, unions and other sources - which was then transferred to state and local political party organizations.
In 1980, the Reagan campaign raised an estimated $15 million in soft money - at the time a groundbreaking sum - and the use of soft money promptly exploded. It was a core source of cash for Michael Dukakis' presidential bid in 1988 and for Clinton's 1996 re-election campaign. By the 1999-2000 election cycles , each political party raised more than $240 million in soft money.
In 2000, George W. Bush became the first major candidate to reject public financing of his primary bid altogether in order to spend unlimited amounts. John Kerry followed suit in 2004. Obama in 2008 rejected all public financing - and the attendant restrictions - for both his primary and general election campaigns. In 2012, both general election nominees are expected to forego public financing. 
***
Campaign contributions, lobbying, negative advertising, and the commodification of access are all interrelated and together constitute the underbelly of American politics. The Republican House leaders who gained power after the 1994 elections introduced at least three major innovations. The first was the now infamous K Street Project, spearheaded by former House whip and majority leader Tom DeLay of Texas, in which Republicans denied access to lobbyists who had contributed to Democrats. DeLay kept a ledger on his desk listing all lobbyists' donations. In addition, DeLay and other project leaders pressed trade associations and assorted industry lobbying groups to fire Democrats and hire Republicans, especially former Capitol Hill staffers, to fill lucrative executive posts. 
The second innovation was to turn the conservative Republican lobbying community into a formal arm of the House leadership, empowered to write legislation and to serve as the whip team lining up votes for tough-to-pass bills - especially free-trade bills that were difficult for Republicans in manufacturing and garment-producing districts to support. 
The third innovation was the direct intervention of DeLay and other House leaders on behalf of major soft money donors to insert favorable provisions - never subjected to committee review - into conference reports during closed meetings. 
For example, in 2003, an investigation of alleged illegal activities by a Kansas energy company, Westar, revealed an email in which a Westar executive wrote to a colleague that getting a favorable provision inserted into pending legislation "requires working with the conference committee," adding that "we have a plan for participation to get a seat at the table, which has been approved by David, the total of the package will be $31,500 in hard money (individual), and $25,000 in soft money (corporate)." 
The $ 25,000 that Westar gave in corporate soft money went to a political committee with strong ties to DeLay, Texans for a Republican Majority PAC. A DeLay spokesman in 2003 denied any impropriety, adding "We have no control over any fantasies they might have about what they might get for a campaign contribution." 
DeLay escaped serious trouble in Washington, but back in his home state of Texas, an Austin prosecutor and a criminal jury found he had broken a state law against money laundering. DeLay is now appealing a three-year sentence imposed on Jan. 10 this year. 
***
Every four years, at the Republican National Convention, the merging of politicians and lobbyists reaches new heights, trumping similar but less omnipresent practices at Democratic conventions. To a larger extent than the Democratic party, the Republican party turns over the entire convention operation, from top management to floor runners, to Washington lobbyists. This saves a substantial amount of money since these selfless men and women generally work for free.
One of harshest critics of the lobbying community was John McCain. In 2008, he told Politico, "Whenever there's a corrupt system, then you're going to have these birds of prey descend on it to get their share of the spoils."
Even as he spoke, however, McCain showed no reluctance in selecting 11 "birds of prey" to run his 2008 campaign, including such major players in the special interest universe as former Republican congressman Tom Loeffler of Texas as campaign co-chair; David Crane, senior executive at lobbying powerhouse The Washington Group, as top policy adviser; and the ever-present Charlie Black as campaign spokesman and strategist.
In this context, the misleading ad put together by Romney's staff two weeks ago - passing off a McCain staffer's quote as Obama's - is relatively small potatoes, despite the fact that it is the first irrefutable violation of ethical standards in the 2012 campaign.
For operatives, strategists, and office holders, some ethical gambles are clearly worth the risk. If the current flap generated by the Romney campaign's doctored messaging redounds to the candidate's detriment, it will prove to have been a bad bet, but he may get away with it. However it plays out, it will not be the last demonstration during the campaign of the continuing reinvention of political morality.

HEADLINE: A British Guide to Cutting Public Spending

BYLINE: NANCY FOLBRE


HIGHLIGHT: The British approach to slashing spending and imposing austerity provides a model for what a Republican president might do, an economist writes. 

 BODY:
"Pensions melting like polar ice" was chalked on a London wall I passed while returning to my hotel after giving a talk at the London School of Economics last week. 
Earlier, talking with English colleagues, I realized that policies being carried out by the coalition government headed by Prime Minister David Cameron prefigure what is likely to happen in the United States if a Republican is elected president next fall. 
As George Osborne, the chancellor of the Exchequer, made clear in his "Autumn Statement" on Nov. 29, the government remains committed to an austerity strategy of major budget cuts. 
The basic theory, sometimes called "expansionary fiscal contraction," holds that cutting public spending will reduce the deficit, keep interest rates low and stimulate a boom in private employment. 
So far, no such boom has taken place, and the spirit of John Maynard Keynes, channeled through an opinion piece in The Guardian by his biographer, Robert Skidelsky, helps explain why. Austerity has contributed to persistently high unemployment and declining real wages. Lower than anticipated rates of economic growth have led to reduced tax receipts.

Therefore, the cuts have not reduced the deficit as planned. Mr. Osborne blamed a "debt storm," or force of nature originating somewhere between Germany and Greece, and reassured his constituents that further cuts in public spending would solve the problem. 
These cuts are largely focused on cutting pension benefits for workers in the public sector. As Lord Hutton, author of an influential government report, has emphasized, some changes are necessary to improve both fairness and sustainability. 
But the Cameron government -- calling for increased private contributions, reduced benefits and a higher retirement age -- added insult to injury by announcing strict limits on future wage increases. Given current and expected rates of inflation, public-sector workers -- more than two-thirds of them women, and many of them teachers and nurses -- are looking at an average pay cut of about 16 percent over the next five years.
Researchers who have formed a Women's Budget Group in Britain assert that lone mothers and older women pensioners are suffering ill effects from other budget cuts. 
One could credibly argue that these groups should help bear the brunt of adjustment to slower economic growth if those who benefited most from the financial boom were also paying up. But as Stewart Lansley makes clear in his new book "The Cost of Inequality" (and in this brief summary of it), the higher echelons of the British income distribution are thriving. A recent report by the High Pay Commission points to excesses in top executive pay.
The Cameron government seems remarkably uninterested in reducing tax evasion, much less increasing taxes on the rich. 
As in the United States, divisions among the lower 99 percent are great. Indeed, the British welfare state has divided its own constituency: few private-sector workers have access to any kind of occupational pension offering defined benefits. As a result, they feel less sympathy for their public-sector counterparts than they might. 
Cuts in public spending seem to reflect a divide-and-conquer strategy. Planned increases in unemployment benefits next year will be paid for by cuts in tax credits for low-income families.
Although the Cameron government insists that it remains committed to a longstanding British campaign to reduce child poverty, it has scrapped its plans to increase the child tax credit. Families with children in the lower half of the income distribution will be hurt most. 
Opposition to the austerity program is growing. On Wednesday - just as I was leaving the country - public-sector workers staged the largest strike in a generation, closing more than half of all state schools, as well as many hospitals.
Protesters from Occupy London found their way to the office of the highest-paid chief executive in the country, Mick Davis of Xstrata, to brandish a banner reading "You get 18,426,105, we get austerity." 
Prime Minister Cameron referred to the strike as a "damp squib," a firecracker that fails to ignite. Melting wages and benefits do dampen spirits, up to a point. But continued austerity, along with disregard for economic inequality, will increase their explosive potential.

HEADLINE: Are Parks a Boon to State Economies?

BYLINE: JIM ROBBINS


HIGHLIGHT: Economists urge the Obama administration and Congress to create more protected preserves, arguing that local economies will benefit. 

 BODY:
 Challenging the notion that protecting public land locks it up, more than 100 economists, including three Nobel laureates, are calling on the president and Congress to create more parks and other protected preserves in the West as a way to bolster state economies.
The economists also urge the creation of something similar to the Depression-era Civilian Conservation Corps, which built trails and maintained infrastructure in national parks. 
 "We urge you to create jobs and support business by investing in our public lands infrastructure and establishing new protected areas such as parks, wilderness and monuments," they wrote in a letter. Such areas "attract innovative companies and workers, and are an essential component of the region's competitive advantage," they added.
The drafting of the letter was organized by Headwaters Economics, a nonprofit organization that studies the economics of natural resources, with a tilt toward preservation. Ray Rasker, an economist with Headwaters, cited a study by his organization that found that Grand County, Utah, home to the tourist mecca of Moab, has been doing quite well: jobs there grew at a 7 percent annual rate in the 1990s and have been growing 2 percent annually during the current recession.

 "In the last 40 years, the fastest growth in the West has been in communities adjacent to protected public lands," Dr. Rasker said. "This is what's creating jobs currently at a time of high unemployment - we need policy that creates jobs."
 The idea of expanding preservation does not go over well among everyone. Many people in Western states see the creation of new federally protected areas as putting land off limits to mining, logging and other uses and potentially harming the economy. 
Ryan Yonk, an assistant professor of political science at Southern Utah State in Cedar City who worked with two other economists on a different study of protected lands and their economic impacts, expressed skepticism about the evidence underlying the economists' argument. "The economists who signed the letter are making a policy statement," he said. "That's fine. Where it goes off the rails is saying there are universally positive effects" from protecting federal land." 
His study, carried out with Brian C. Steed and Randy Simmons of Utah State University, found no evidence of a positive economic effect from protecting public land, Dr. Yonk said. "And we find split evidence of a negative effect," he added. 
In a study focusing on Kane County, home to Grand Staircase-Escalante National Monument, "we can find no effect in the local economy," he said. 
Granting protection to wilderness and other lands is an enduring political issue in the West and surfaces frequently during election campaigns. 
The Headwaters study drew criticism, for example, from a spokesman for Representative Denny Rehberg, a Montana Republican who is challenging Jon Tester, a Democrat, for his Senate seat in 2012. "The faulty assumption that creating new national parks, wilderness or monuments always creates jobs is like saying an oil rig will always produce oil no matter where you put it," said the spokesman, Jed Link. "It just isn't true."

HEADLINE: Senators and Congressmen, All Trying for a Laugh

BYLINE: JASON ZINOMAN


HIGHLIGHT: A trip to the nation's capital for a night of politicians doing stand-up proved the old truism: Washington is rather humorless. 

 BODY:
As I was working on my argument about political parody on "Saturday Night Live," I traveled to our nation's capital to see if the humor of our political elite was also suffering from malaise. Wednesday was the 18th annual Funniest Celebrity in Washington Contest, a benefit whose proceeds go to the Susan G. Komen for the Cure, which fights breast cancer. The evening featured a bipartisan bill of stand-up performances by politicians, journalists and lobbyists who all seem to agree on one thing: People from Washington are not funny.
Senator Scott Brown, Republican from Massachusetts, who bashfully threw out the first few jokes, all but apologized for his performance, which included this zinger: "What did the mother bullet say to the father bullet? Let's have a BB." Congressman Allen West, Republican from Florida, also vociferously protested that he was not good for a laugh, although he did deliver an amusing impersonation of a fake Australian documentary film director covering his swearing-in as the first black Republican congressman in more than a century. "Now let's see what the black Republican eats," he said with wonder.
At one point the host Jamie McIntyre, an NPR anchor, pointed out how few jokes were landing. Jamie Weinstein, a columnist from The Daily Caller, joked that finding the funniest comedian in Washington is like "finding the most conservative writer for Politico." He actually won the contest, but it should be noted that one of the judges was a Hogette, one of the obsessive Washington Redskin fans who have been wearing dresses and pig's snouts to football games since the 1980s. 
As a Washington native, I have always thought that the city's reputation for humorlessness was overstated. Any place with a high density of intense, unattractive cynics surely will produce a lot of good jokes. But I must admit, these performers made a persuasive case. Most of their jokes were cheesy, clumsy and out of date. Lanny Davis, former special counsel to President Bill Clinton, may not be the only person still joking about the Monica Lewinsky scandal, but he is the last one doing it with a reference to the former spokesman Mike McCurry.
Stand-up comedy is much harder than it looks. Politicians like Mr. West and Earl Blumenauer, Democrat of Oregon, who did lots of Portland humor, are far from nervous speakers in public, but their comfort leads them to ramble and goof. The one who seemed to take comedy seriously was, believe it or not, Grover Norquist, the president of Americans for Tax Reform.
Turns out he's as resourceful at telling jokes as he is at wielding power. Short and compact, he has a deadpan stand-up face that is indistinguishable from the one he wears on "Meet the Press." That is a very savvy decision, exploiting his public persona rather than making the mistake the others did by acting looser and unbuttoned. But that's not to say he doesn't have a comedic model. It's clear whom he's aping from the opening joke.
"When midgets," he begins in a monotone, followed by an oddly dramatic pause, "play miniature golf, do they know?" Even before I read in a profile that he was a fan of Steven Wright, it was obvious by his dry jokes, which were economically written, especially among this crowd.
Clearly he's not in the same league as Mr. Wright, and about half the jokes in his set fell flat. But he had some solid one delivered cleanly with precise timing. Refusing to make fun of his own stature as a power broker was a missed opportunity, but in the context of Republican politics, he didn't play it safe. Musing about how he hopes his two daughters become Mormons, he explained his reasoning this way: "If things work out, we only have to pay for one wedding."

HEADLINE: Newt Gingrich Meets With Donald Trump and Other Strange Events

BYLINE: ANDREW ROSENTHAL


HIGHLIGHT: Herman Cain's out, but the entertainment-political complex is thriving. 

 BODY:
I was out of the country last week, and I think I may have developed unreasonably high expectations for the American primary campaign.
That must explain why I bothered to feel disappointed - in a whatever-happened-to-dignity sort of way - by the start of today's news cycle. This morning, Donald Trump and Newt Gingrich had an hour-long meeting at Trump Tower in New York, followed by a joint press conference in which Mr. Gingrich defended the completely ridiculous idea of having Mr. Trump moderate one of the thousands of GOP "debates."
It was vintage Gingrich. Appearing in a debate moderated by Mr. Trump, he said, is no more ridiculous than the fact that Ronald Reagan once starred in a movie with a chimp. (I'm not sure who is Reagan and who is the chimp in this equation.) Mr. Gingrich also said that he met with Mr. Trump because he's a "great showman" and a great businessman and sometimes campaigns need a little comic relief. There is nothing to add to that.
Mr. Gingrich, of course, threw in a mention of Herman Cain, who now seems to be more popular among the Republican contenders now that he's not running. Oh, sorry, he's just "suspended" his campaign.
That's a nice little dodge whereby he gets to keep raising money. The surviving Republican contenders all quickly claimed to be the heir to his supporters. What they really meant is that they want the cash. There are so many things wrong with our campaign system, but one big is this business of being able to raise unlimited amounts of money through a campaign structure that doesn't actually exist.
Before Mr. Cain's announcement, we were all made to suffer through days of his aides portentously announcing that he was "reassessing" his candidacy. When did he assess it in the first place? Did Mr. Cain actually not know that he would be asked questions about, say, foreign affairs? Did he not think that every aspect of his life would be examined under a microscope? Mr. Cain continues to insist that the parade of women who said he sexually harassed them, and the one who said they had a 13-year-long affair, were just making it up as part of a left-wing conspiracy. But he had to know - at the very least - that the harassment settlements would haunt him, didn't he?
So, now Mr. Cain says all of that was a "distraction." That's what politicians generally say when they have to retire from the field after unsavory revelations about their personal lives. And he says he will continue to talk about issues, like the economy and foreign policy, by which I presume he means he will give paid speeches and promote his book, "This is Herman Cain! My Journey to the White House." This is not unprecedented, of course. Think Sarah Palin. Loses with John McCain in 2008. Quits her governorship of Alaska in short order. Gets down to the serious business of making bundles of cash.
So that leaves us with the rest of the Republican field. How might the nomination process shake out?
An important caveat: my predictions are not always, or even frequently, correct. But I think I'm a bit more likely to pick the winner than the Union Leader of Manchester, N.H., which has endorsed Mr. Gingrich. In 1996, the paper endorsed Pat Buchanan, who went nowhere. In 2000, they picked Steve Forbes.
I can't believe the Republicans will nominate Mr. Gingrich. Just remember what it was like when he was Speaker of the House and was whining about not getting enough honey-roasted cashews on Air Force One. Mr. Gingrich is a right-wing radical. He doesn't even believe the Supreme Court has the right to enforce the Constitution.
Michele Bachman has no chance of winning. Neither do Jon Huntsman or Ron Paul, although they at least had the sense to say no to the Trump debate.
Which leaves Mitt Romney. The Republicans have a tendency to nominate the person who is most obviously next in line. As odd as his candidacy is - a combination of relentless flip-flops on big issues, bad prescriptions for the economy and the claim that he's ready to lead because he ran a company that specialized in shipping jobs overseas - he seems like the best bet.
Let me just add that "best bet" is distinct from "best." And with that, I'll go back to feeling disappointed.

HEADLINE: Journalists Should Be Government Mouthpieces, Chinese Media Leader Says

BYLINE: J. DAVID GOODMAN


HIGHLIGHT: Comments by the new president of CCTV drew comparisons with Joseph Goebbels and comes amid an uptick in the official Chinese government language targeting the spread of rumors online and "fake news." 

 BODY:
The new president of China's largest television network, the state-run organization known CCTV, drew fire over the weekend from Chinese press advocates and others online over comments urging journalists to drop their pretensions of professionalism and submit to being mouthpieces of the government. 
Some on China's free-flowing microblogs compared the new president, Hu Zhanfan, with the infamous Nazi propagandist Joseph Goebbels. 
"The first social responsibility and professional ethic of media staff should be understanding their role clearly and be a good mouthpiece," Mr. Hu was quoted by Agence France-Presse as saying to a press association gathering this year, months before he took the helm at CCTV. 
His remarks, including a warning to journalists who do not take "up the position of mouthpiece" that they "will never go far," were reported by China's Xinhua news agency but attracted little notice at the time. Below is a partial translation by the China Media Project at the University of Hong Kong of his remarks, as reported by Xinhua:
A number of news workers have not defined their own role in terms of the propaganda work of the Party, but rather have defined themselves as journalism professionals, and this is a fundamentally erroneous role definition. Strengthening education in the Marxist View of Journalism and raising the quality and character of news teams is not just very necessary, it is a matter of extreme urgency.
The report continued:
Concerning social responsibility and professional ethics, editor-in-chief Hu Zhanfan believes that the first and foremost social responsibility [of journalists] is to serve well as a mouthpiece tool (\xE5\x93\xE5\xA5[#x5589][#x820c][#x5de5][#x5177]). This is the most core content of the Marxist View of Journalism, and it is the most fundamental of principles. 
Mr. Hu, an ex-newspaper editor and former vice minister of the State Administration of Radio, Film and Television, was named to top position by the Central Committee of the Chinese Communist Partyless than two weeks ago, and his rise to the top China's powerful state television apparatus appears to have precipitated the resurfacing of his past comments on Chinese microbloging sites over the weekend. 
"After Hu took the position of CCTV director, people expose his words, as they maybe disagree with them," said Jiao Guobiao, a former journalism professor at Peking University, told the New York-based NTD television network, which is highly critical of the Chinese government. Mr. Jiao, who has sharply criticized the government's heavy hand in China's media, notably in a widely read 2004 article, told the network that Mr. Hu's comments simply reflect the status quo in Chinese media. But he added: "The public is calling for objective, neutral, and diverse media."
Quotes from Mr. Hu were shared more than 10,000 times on microblogs and Twitter, the Voice of America China reported, and elicited sharp criticism as well as dispirited comments from those Chinese who still view of journalism as a professional enterprise. "As a media student, I feel very depressed," read one post, translated by the AFP. "People who are obviously doing advertising claim that they are doing news." 
Many microbloggers drew a line connecting Mr. Hu with Mr. Goebbels. One user compared CCTV news broadcasts with images of Nazi Germany, while another asked, "When will Goebbels-style news controls end?" -- the China Media Project reported.
The resurfacing of Mr. Hu's earlier comments comes as some China observers have noted an uptick in the official language targeting the spread of rumors online, especially on Chinese social networks like the popular Twitter-like microblog Sina Weibo. 
"In the last week there have been multiple articles in official Chinese media about the importance of the proper handling of microblogs and the dangers of Internet rumors," Bill Bishop, an American blogger living in Beijing who writes on China and the Internet, wrote on his blog DigiCha on Sunday. 
The comments by Mr. Hu, the new CCTV president, that drew outrage were also primarily focused on stamping out so-called "fake news," which he appeared to see as a rapidly metastasizing social ill: 
First, [fake news] has spread from commercialized, metro media to traditional authoritative [Party] media. Second, it has spread from entertainment and social news to economic and political news. Third, as traditional and internet-based media have had a more interactive relationship, fake news has been transmitted much more rapidly and widely. Fourth, there has been a trend from simple concocting of fake news to making idle reports, reporting gossip, exaggerating, going against common knowledge and other such issues, which have steadily spread. 
Mr. Bishop, the blogger, highlighted two recent articles -- one in Xinhua, the other in The People's Daily, China's official newspaper -- where Internet rumors are likened with illegal drugs. "The article states that 'Internet rumors are 'societal drugs' which are no less harmful to society than Internet pornography, gambling or drugs," he said of the piece in The People's Daily. 
"The comparisons to drugs and drug dealing, sometimes a capital offense in China, may be a sign of an impending harsh crackdown on those who spread Internet rumors," he said.

HEADLINE: It's Tone, Not Taxes, a Tycoon Tells the President

BYLINE: ANDREW ROSS SORKIN


HIGHLIGHT: In an "open letter" to President Obama that whizzed around e-mail inboxes of Wall Street and corporate America last week, Leon Cooperman argued against "the divisive, polarizing tone of your rhetoric." 

 BODY:
Leon Cooperman, a 68-year-old Wall Street veteran, says he is for higher taxes on the wealthy. He would happily give up his Social Security checks. He voted for Al Gore in 2000. He says the special treatment of investment gains, or so-called carried interest, for private equity and hedge fund managers is "ridiculous." He says he even sympathizes, at least to some extent, with the Occupy Wall Street protesters.
And yet, Mr. Cooperman, a man with a rags-to-riches background who worked at Goldman Sachs for more than 25 years in the 1970s and 1980s before starting his own hedge fund, Omega Advisors, which has minted him an estimated $1.8 billion fortune, is waging a campaign against President Obama.
Last week, in a widely circulated "open letter" to President Obama that whizzed around e-mail inboxes of Wall Street and corporate America, Mr. Cooperman argued that "the divisive, polarizing tone of your rhetoric is cleaving a widening gulf, at this point as much visceral as philosophical, between the downtrodden and those best positioned to help them."
He went on to say, "To frame the debate as one of rich-and-entitled versus poor-and-dispossessed is to both miss the point and further inflame an already incendiary environment."
The letter comes as President Obama is planning to give a speech on Tuesday in Osawatomie, Kan., about the economy and the middle class, following in the path of President Theodore Roosevelt, who campaigned a century ago in that very city against the wealthy and big business.
Mr. Cooperman's complaint has less to do with the substance of taxing the wealthy than it does the president's choice of words in promoting it, an emphasis that he says is "villainizing the American Dream."
While many executives have complained about what they perceive as the president's antibusiness bent, Mr. Cooperman's letter has gained credibility and attention in political and business circles because of his own seemingly liberal stances on taxes and the like.
Mr. Cooperman, in an interview, said he had been deluged with hundreds of e-mails and phone calls about the letter, "99.9 percent of it positive."
"I came from nothing," he said, explaining how he grew up in the Bronx and went to P.S. 75. "I have lived the American Dream. I don't want to be constantly attacked."
He was quick to say that he did not write the letter "on behalf of Wall Street." Indeed, Mr. Cooperman's view of the financial industry is dimmer than you might expect from someone who made his fortune in it. "Wall Street screwed up," he said matter-of-factly. "They did things they shouldn't have."
He said he decided to write the president a letter because he became convinced that Mr. Obama was "villainizing success." He added, "We are supposed to admire success."
Of course, his letter has not gone over well with some audiences - he has been called a "whiner" and worse. On Daily Kos, a left-leaning commentary site, one member wrote: "He simply embarrasses himself with this rant, and seems more interested in complaining about the points Obama is making that aren't in his personal economic interests than in providing any real solutions to our problems."
Mr. Cooperman acknowledged that he had received at least one negative e-mail. "I got one that said, 'Be very careful when you start you car in the morning because there might be a bomb in it.' " He tried to laugh it off.
Some critics of Mr. Cooperman's letter say President Obama has not been hard enough on big business and questioned what it was that the president has said that has drawn the ire of the business community.
"What pushed me over the fence was the president's dialogue over the debt ceiling," Mr. Cooperman said, explaining that just when it seemed like a compromise was near, President Obama went on national television and pressed harder on "millionaires and billionaires," a phrase that has stuck in the craw of many of the elite. For example, Mr. Cooperman zeroed in on what he described as the president's belittling remarks about taxing the wealthy: "If you are a wealthy C.E.O. or hedge fund manager in America right now, your taxes are lower than they have ever been. They are lower than they have been since the 1950s. And they can afford it," the president said back in June. "You can still ride on your corporate jet. You're just going to have to pay a little more."
The president's tone can be debated. Some people would argue it is simply factual, others contend that it is dripping with derision.
Mr. Cooperman acknowledges that, in the debt ceiling debate this summer, it was as much the fault of Republicans and House Speaker John Boehner's inability to gain support for a compromise as it was the Democrats that a deal did not get done. And Mr. Cooperman accepts that taxes are indeed at record lows.
But he says the president could do a better job of pressing for higher taxes on the rich without "the sense that we're bad people." He added, "I pay federal income tax. I don't have any tax dodges." He paused, before saying, "Most people I know are prepared to pay more in taxes as long as it's spent intelligently."
He added that he understood the politics of what he called "class warfare." "Now, I am not naive. I understand that in today's America, this is how the business of governing typically gets done - a situation that, given the gravity of our problems, is as deplorable as it is seemingly ineluctable."
Mr. Cooperman said he personally had been advocating adding a 10 percent tax surcharge on all incomes over $500,000 for the next three years. He also advocates that the military "get out of Iraq and Afghanistan" and that every soldier should be "given a free four-year education." His personal "platform" - he insists he is not running for any office - also includes setting up a peacetime Works Progress Administration to rebuild United States infrastructure; freezing entitlements; raising the Social Security retirement age for full benefits to 70 "with an exception for those that work at hard labor"; adding a 5 percent value-added sales tax; and "tackling health care in a serious way," among other things.
Mr. Cooperman, who recently signed the Giving Pledge, Bill Gates's and Warren Buffett's effort to press the world's billionaires to give away at least half of their wealth, said he felt he came into his money honestly and said proudly, "I spend more than 25 times on charity what I spend on myself." Asked whether he had received any response from the president for his letter, he replied with a chuckle, "I'm not optimistic I'll hear from him."

HEADLINE: Romney Embraces Extension of Payroll Tax Cut

BYLINE: ASHLEY PARKER


HIGHLIGHT: After just weeks ago deriding the idea as "little Band-Aids" that offered only a temporary fix, Mitt Romney said he would like to see the payroll tax cut extended. 

 BODY:
On Monday, Mitt Romney embraced one of President Obama's signature proposals - another one-year extension of a cut in payroll taxes, after just weeks ago deriding the idea as "little Band-Aids" that offered only a temporary fix.
"I would like to see the payroll tax cut extended just because I know that working families are really feeling the pinch right now - middle-class Americans are having a hard time," Mr. Romney said Monday on Michael Medved's conservative radio talk show. 
Newt Gingrich, currently Mr. Romney's main rival for the nomination, said months ago that he favored an extension. 
While Mr. Romney's statement will not only ripple through the debate in Washington over the payroll tax extension, the Romney campaign tried to pre-empt criticism that he once again provides ammunition to both his Republican rivals and Democratic critics that he changes positions to suit the political environment.
The Romney campaign said that Mr. Romney has always favored tax cuts, but worried about Mr. Obama's proposal because he didn't consider it a long-term solution.
"Mitt has never met a tax cut he doesn't like but we're going to need more permanent job creating incentives in order to turn around the economy," said Andrea Saul, a spokeswoman for the campaign.
At a debate in October, however, Mr. Romney disagreed with the fundamental premise underlying the president's payroll tax break. 
"I don't want temporary little Band-Aids," Mr. Romney said. "I want to fundamentally restructure America's foundation economically."
Earlier in his answer, he also explained, "No one likes to see tax increases." But Mr. Romney was taking a nuanced position likely to be exploited by his rivals - both Democratic and Republican - who are always eager to paint him as a shape-shifter, especially now that he has come out in favor of the tax cut he previously hedged on.
"Now that public support has increased for an extension of the payroll tax cut, Mitt Romney is jumping on the bandwagon once again to support a plan he previously opposed - demeaning it as nothing more than a 'temporary little Band-Aid,'" wrote the Democratic National Committee, in a press release. "Mitt Romney changes his positions with the political wind and as today's wind blows toward more public support of President Obama's plan to extend the payroll tax cut for millions of middle class Americans, Mitt Romney's support blows with it. If the American people can't trust Mitt Romney to stand up for middle class tax cuts before his back is against the wall, why should they ever trust him?"
Ben LaBolt, a spokesman for Mr. Obama's re-election campaign, also wasted no time attacking Mr. Romney, saying in an e-mail statement that, "Mitt Romney's position on the payroll tax cut makes a tilt-a-whirl look steady."

HEADLINE: In Essay, Cuomo Offers His Case for Amending State's Tax System, Which He Calls 'Unfair'

BYLINE: By THOMAS KAPLAN; Kate Taylor contributed reporting from New York.

 BODY:
ALBANY -- Laying out his case for raising taxes on the wealthy, Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo on Monday criticized New York State's tax system as ''unfair'' and said it should be revised now.
''Simply put, to me, 'fairness' dictates that the more you make, the more you pay, and the higher your income, the higher your rate,'' Mr. Cuomo, a Democrat, wrote in an essay his office sent to the state's newspapers. 
Mr. Cuomo, saying that the existing tax code places too much of a burden on the state's middle class, called for the creation of multiple new tax brackets and new tax rates for both middle- and high-earning New Yorkers that would be graduated and indexed to inflation. He did not provide details, but said the changes would reform a tax code that he described as antiquated and less progressive than in other states.
''In New York under the permanent tax code, an individual making a taxable income of only $20,000 pays the same marginal tax rate as an individual making $20 million,'' he wrote. ''It's just not fair.''
Mr. Cuomo's essay came as lawmakers, business leaders and labor unions prepared for a possible special session of the Legislature at which lawmakers would take up changes to the tax code. Members of the Democratic majority in the State Assembly planned to meet at the Capitol on Tuesday to discuss possible changes, and members of the Republican majority in the State Senate were set to follow suit on Wednesday.
Mr. Cuomo has not unveiled any legislation for the lawmakers to consider, but he wrote in his essay that he wanted to reform the tax code ''in a way that creates jobs and grows our economy'' and said the Legislature ''will need to act, swiftly and effectively.''
He is hoping lawmakers will act before the expiration later this month of a so-called millionaires' tax -- actually a surcharge on income over $200,000 for individuals and $300,000 for married couples. When the surcharge expires, New York's top tax rate for those people will return to 6.85 percent, the same that applies to individuals who earn over $20,000 and joint filers with an income over $40,000.
Even without specifics, Mr. Cuomo's proposal to revise the tax code has started a debate among lawmakers and interest groups.
On Monday, the chairman of the state Conservative Party, Michael R. Long, wrote a letter to the Senate majority leader, Dean G. Skelos, a Long Island Republican, in which he urged Senator Skelos to stand firm against any proposed tax increases.
''Raising taxes sends all the wrong signals to those who must live with the government's decision to take more of their hard-earned paycheck to pay for the special interest of select clientele,'' Mr. Long wrote.
At the same time, Democrats and labor leaders who have been avidly seeking the extension of the millionaires' tax started a new push to try to persuade Mr. Cuomo to be as aggressive as possible in generating new revenues with his tax proposal.
The Public Employees Federation, the second-largest union of state workers, produced a flier urging people to call Albany lawmakers and demand that any tax deal generate the same amount of money as the expiring tax surcharge.
The millionaires' tax is projected to bring in about $4 billion for the state in the current fiscal year.
''You could do something that has a progressive methodology, but the huge question is how much money you get out of it and what to do with the money,'' said Michael Kink, the executive director of the labor-backed Strong Economy for All Coalition.
Reaction from business leaders was mixed.
The acting president of the Business Council of New York State, Heather Briccetti, said Monday, ''An improved business climate -- not new taxes -- needs to be Albany's top priority in 2012.'' But later in the day, the Business Council released a statement that said, ''We have total confidence in the governor and his commitment to enhance New York's role as a pro-business state.''
Steven Spinola, the president of the Real Estate Board of New York, said he was ''not ready to scream or yell that this is terrible.''
''If we're actually reforming the system and it looks like it's got the potential to be a permanent solution that will give some confidence to the people who own businesses here in the State of New York, then it's something that we're prepared to look at,'' he said.
Mayor Michael R. Bloombergreacted cautiously but skeptically to reports of Mr. Cuomo's interest in raising taxes on the wealthy. ''I think you have to look at everything,'' he said, ''but fundamentally you cannot tax your ways out of problems.''

HEADLINE: With a Leaner Model, Start-Ups Reach Further Afield

BYLINE: By STEVE LOHR

 BODY:
SUNNYVALE, Calif. -- Lee Redden, 26, a Ph.D. student in engineering at Stanford, recently decided to shelve his education and help found a start-up company. His skills lie in a couple of red-hot niches of artificial intelligence, computer vision and machine learning. Yet he is not applying his talents to Internet search, online commerce or intelligence surveillance.
Mr. Redden's ambitions are further afield -- in farm fields, actually. His company, Blue River Technology, is developing a robotic weed killer for organic farms, which shun chemical pesticides. The new venture, he said, is ''a great way to bring this technology to agriculture.''
The start-up here points to the latest stage of evolution in Silicon Valley, the world's epicenter of innovation. Over the years, the region has shown an unmatched economic dexterity in jumping from one industry of opportunity to another, from military electronics to silicon wafers to personal computers to the Internet. 
But the business of the Valley today is less about focusing on a particular industry than it is about a continuous process of innovation with technology, across a widening swath of fields. The trend reflects the steady march of that most protean of technologies -- computing -- as it makes further inroads into every scientific discipline and industry. Clean technology, bioengineering, medical diagnostics, preventive health care, transportation and even agriculture are part of the mix these days for the Valley's technologists and entrepreneurs.
The pace of discovery has quickened, not only for technologies but also for the process of finding out what companies will succeed.
''What's different in the Valley is that we've found a quasi-scientific method for reinventing businesses and industries, not just products,'' said Randy Komisar, a partner in a leading venture capital firm, Kleiner Perkins Caufield & Byers, and a lecturer on entrepreneurship at Stanford University. ''The approach is much more systematic than it was several years ago.''
The newer model for starting businesses relies on hypothesis, experiment and testing in the marketplace, from the day a company is founded. That is a sharp break with the traditional approach of drawing up a business plan, setting financial targets, building a finished product and then rolling out the business and hoping to succeed. It was time-consuming and costly.
The preferred formula today is often called the ''lean start-up.'' Its foremost proponents include Eric Ries, an engineer, entrepreneur and author who coined the term and is now an entrepreneur in residence at the Harvard Business School, and Steven Blank, a serial entrepreneur, author and lecturer at Stanford.
The approach emphasizes quickly developing ''minimum viable products,'' low-cost versions that are shown to customers for reaction, and then improved. Flexibility is the other hallmark. Test business models and ideas, and ruthlessly cull failures and move on to Plan B, Plan C, Plan D and so on -- ''pivoting,'' as the process is known.
The National Science Foundation is betting on the new model to improve the rate of commercialization of the university research it finances. In October, the foundation announced the first series of grants for what it calls the N.S.F. Innovation Corps. The 21 three-member teams selected from across the country will receive $50,000 each for six months to test whether their inventions are marketable. It begins with a swing through Stanford and courses taught by Mr. Blank and others, followed by online classes and mentoring. Each team is expected to constantly test its ideas and products with customers, to experiment again and again, adhering to the lean start-up formula.
''It's all about how to apply the scientific method to market-opportunity identification,'' said Errol B. Arkilic, a program manager at the foundation. ''And that is exactly why this method is the one the N.S.F. selected.''
Mr. Arkilic, who worked for seven years as an engineer at start-ups in the Valley before joining the government, says that the foundation plans to award 15 or 20 Innovation Corps grants every quarter. ''We can't replicate Silicon Valley elsewhere,'' he said. ''But we need to figure out a way to take some of the best practices in Silicon Valley and deploy them elsewhere.''
The Valley's lean start-up model is influencing mainstream business education. At business schools, courses on entrepreneurship and entrepreneurial management have been around for years. But this spring, the 900 first-year students at the Harvard Business School must start a business as a required course. In teams of six students each, they will be given $3,000 and told to create a start-up that pulls in revenue by the end of the semester, explained Thomas R. Eisenmann, a professor who will oversee the program.
Dr. Eisenmann is also a leader of a Silicon Valley immersion program that takes dozens of students there each year for a firsthand look at not only the practices but also the culture of the entrepreneurial hothouse. ''Everybody is involved in a start-up,'' Dr. Eisenmann observed. ''It's assumed to be normal behavior, the cool thing to do.''
The start-up culture, to be sure, owes much to the Valley's history and the enduring influence of its defining personalities, like Frederick E. Terman. A longtime engineering professor at Stanford who was provost in the 1950s and 1960s, Dr. Terman encouraged his star students to put their ideas to work by starting their own companies. Among them were Bill Hewlett and David Packard, who founded Hewlett-Packard in 1939. Dr. Terman often invested his own money in such start-ups.
''His message was that starting a company was every bit as important as getting your Ph.D.,'' said Mr. Blank, who lectures at Stanford. ''That was heresy in academia.''
Most start-ups fail. More than perhaps anyplace else, the Valley's investors and technologists tend to view failure with a certain scientific objectivity, as if setbacks are heuristic tools leading to further research and discovery.
''Over 70 years, this Valley has developed a culture that does not personalize failure,'' said Mr. Komisar, of Kleiner Perkins. ''If you're not corrupt, stupid or lazy, we see failure as learning -- learn from it, and reapply it.''
That risk-taking and perpetual learning culture is now being applied far beyond computer hardware and software. There are high-profile ventures like Nest Labs, founded by Tony Fadell, a former Apple executive, which has hired more than 100 engineers from Apple, Google, Microsoft and other high-tech companies, and it is backed by a pack of venture capital firms. Its product, introduced in late October, is a reinvention of the thermostat, combining sensors, machine learning and Web technology in a clever, energy-saving device.
Yet the Valley is filled with other, less-prominent start-ups in new fields, including Blue River Technology. Mr. Redden met his fellow founder and the start-up's chief executive, Jorge Heraud, 41, in Mr. Blank's class.
Mr. Heraud, an engineer, had decided to return to Stanford to refresh his career, after working for years as a manager for an agriculture equipment company.
He met up with Mr. Redden, and they jointly recognized the opportunity for applying computer vision and machine learning to agriculture. They explored other ideas, but after talking to potential customers, they settled on killing weeds for organic farming -- a fast-growing industry that cannot use pesticides and struggles with labor costs.
In their office in Sunnyvale, they are assembling the machine and training the computer-vision software to distinguish lettuce plants from weeds. Initially, they experimented with laser blasts to kill the weeds, but that proved too costly. Now they plan to use superheated oil (organic, of course).
Their contraption, pulled behind a tractor, must identify weeds and kill them within 200 milliseconds, a formidable but attainable challenge, Mr. Redden says.
If applying computer vision to agriculture is so promising, why are the big farm equipment companies not well ahead?
''This isn't on their radar screen,'' Mr. Heraud replied. ''They aren't putting their heads into computer vision. That's a Silicon Valley technology.''

HEADLINE: Many Workers In Public Sector Retiring Sooner

BYLINE: By MONICA DAVEY

 BODY:
MADISON, Wis. -- As states and cities struggle to resolve paralyzing budget shortfalls by sending workers on unpaid furloughs, freezing salaries and extracting larger contributions for health benefits and pensions, a growing number of public-sector workers are finding fewer reasons to stay.
The numbers of retirees are way up in Wisconsin, where more applications to retire have been filed this year than ever before. Workers in California's largest public employee pension system have retired at a steadily increasing rate over the last five fiscal years. In New Jersey, thousands more teachers, police officers, firefighters and other public workers filed retirement papers during the past two years than in the previous two years.
In part, the flood of retirements reflects a broader demographic picture. Baby boomers, wherever they work, have begun reaching the traditional retirement age.
But increasingly workers fear a permanent shift away from the traditional security of government jobs, and they are making plans to get out now, before salaries and retirement benefits retreat further. 
''You start to feel like, 'What will they do next?' '' said Bob McLinn, 63, a labor union president who left his job with the Wisconsin Department of Corrections in March, earlier than he planned, after political leaders pressed to cut benefits and collective bargaining rights for workers.
''There's always been this promise that if you came to work and did your job, at the end there would be your reward -- a defined retirement. The idea was you could retire with respect and dignity. But that whole idea has been slashed now, and I felt like, 'What is the point?' ''
In some places, the rise in retirement has brought welcome and needed financial news. Kansas announced last month that it would save $34.5 million over two years because more than 1,000 workers had agreed to accept cash and health insurance incentives to leave. State officials said they had yet to determine which of the positions of departing workers they considered critical enough to refill.
But some experts and workers question the ultimate result of so much leaving, saying it is already leaving some governments short-staffed (and, in some cases, obliged to pay overtime) and at risk of losing institutional knowledge and technical expertise as older workers vanish.
''What we're going to see is a lot of young people reinventing the wheel,'' said Karen Gunderson, 56, who retired this year from her information technology job with the State of Wisconsin after 26 years, a few years sooner than she had intended, saying she felt that public workers were being ''turned into scapegoats'' for a troubled economy.
''We're going to waste a lot of tax dollars with young people attempting things that were tried before. You can get people cheaper, but whether you save money, I don't know.''
The pattern of retirements, while pronounced in some states and towns, has by no means played out everywhere. In fact, a countervailing trend -- of delaying retirement and staying put -- has been clear since after 2008, when the national recession and the shortage of jobs (and of potential second careers in the private sector) made people queasy about making moves at all.
Certainly, the number of state and local public-sector workers has been shrinking since the second half of 2008, a necessary, useful scaling back in the eyes of some political leaders facing major budget shortfalls. Across the nation, there were 71,000 fewer state government workers in November than there were a year ago, and 180,000 fewer local government workers, federal Bureau of Labor Statistics data shows.
But a broad survey of about 100 public retirement systems suggests a rate of retirement that has remained within a relatively steady range in recent years, said Keith Brainard, research director for the National Association of State Retirement Administrators. ''Before I would call this a trend, it would need to continue for another year or two,'' he said.
Still, even with lingering queasiness over jobs and the larger economy, there are other signs that the mood of public workers is turning toward retirement, a worrisome possibility for some already precarious, underfunded pension plans.
In 2009, a survey of more than 400 state and local governments found that about 85 percent of public workers were postponing retirement (presumably because of the grave economy), while fewer than 9 percent were accelerating their retirement dates. This year, a similar survey by the Center for State and Local Government Excellence, a nonprofit research group, found 40 percent still delaying their retirements, with nearly a quarter speeding up their retirement dates.
Already, the trend is apparent in places where lawmakers have made the clearest calls for decreasing workers' benefits or increasing their contributions for health care insurance and pension plans. And in the last two years, 41 states have made significant changes to at least one of their retirement plans, the National Conference of State Legislatures found.
In Alabama, an unusually high number of school employees -- 1,600 -- asked to retire this month, leaving some students uncertain midyear about who will be teaching them. Lawmakers there had approved increases to the cost of health insurance for those who retire before they are eligible for Medicare or have fewer than 25 years of service, and the law goes into effect on Jan. 1, setting off a flood of applicants who wanted to beat the change.
In Florida, more than twice as many workers applied to be part of a deferred retirement program in May and June as had the year earlier, protecting them from cuts to pension benefits that legislators put into effect as of July 1.
And in Ohio, where a law cutting collective bargaining passed this year (and was later repealed) and where bills are still pending over raising the age and years of service for eligibility for a public-sector pension, applications for retirement rose 39 percent in the first 10 months of the year compared with a year earlier.
But here, in Wisconsin, the battle over public workers may have been the loudest. Republican leaders said their only hope of balancing the state's budget was to require workers to pay more for their pensions and health care premiums and to significantly reduce collective bargaining rights for public-sector unions.
Union supporters pushed back, leading an effort to recall Gov. Scott Walker next year over the issue. But government workers also left: 16,785 workers filed retirement applications as of Oct. 31, while in all of 2010, 11,750 workers had done so.
''It's about fear,'' said Jim Palmer, executive director of the Wisconsin Professional Police Association. ''A lot of people are seeing this war on public employees and saying, let's get out.''
Governor Walker, through a spokesman, declined to be interviewed for this article.
For some states, the increase in retirements has been a planned outcome, a budget fixer. In recent years, places like Minnesota and New York offered incentives for employees to retire sooner than they may have planned. In 2010, New York State processed 30,772 retirement applications, more than ever before, and state officials attributed 12,000 of those to an early retirement incentive.
The surprise, though, came in 2011, when no such incentive was offered. In a year after a special retirement deal, applications to leave usually drop off. This year, state officials said, they have not.

HEADLINE: Vermont Rebounding Quickly From Hurricane Irene's Big Hit

BYLINE: By JOHN SCHWARTZ

 BODY:
BETHEL, Vt. -- The raging White River that chewed up seven miles of Route 107 has gone back to being tame and lovely.
The road? Less so. Wedged between the river and the steep hills, this highway, a well-traveled east-west connector, was hit by torrents from above and surges from below -- the devastating one-two punch from what had been Hurricane Irene. ''You couldn't even tell there was ever a road there, the day after the flood,'' said Kenneth Robie, project manager for rebuilding 107.
Now enormous haulers capable of carrying 60 tons of stone in every load rumble back and forth across the river, delivering the 300,000 tons of rock required to fill in the holes and build up the roadbed and embankments. A special ''rock train'' carts pink stone 100 miles from quarries near Burlington, and workers scoop washed-out stone and gravel from the river itself. 
Yet what is truly impressive about the work here is not the amount of damage, or even the size of the big boy toys involved in the repair. Instead, it is that 107 is the last stretch of state road that Vermont has not finished repairing. In the three months since Hurricane Irene, the state repaired and reopened some 500 miles of damaged road, replaced a dozen bridges with temporary structures and repaired about 200 altogether.
Vermont's success in repairing roads while keeping the state open for tourism is a story of bold action and high-tech innovation. The state closed many damaged highways to speed repairs and it teamed with Google to create frequently updated maps-- showing which routes were open. Vermont also worked in cooperation with other states, legions of contractors and local citizens.
While many Americans have come to wonder whether the nation has lost the ability to fix its ailing infrastructure or do big things, ''they haven't been to Vermont,'' said Megan Smith, the state's commissioner of tourism and marketing.
State roads, which are the routes used most by tourists, are ready for the economically crucial winter skiing season. But Vermont had many of those roads open in time for many of the fall foliage visitors, who pump $332 million into the state's economy each year, largely through small businesses like bed and breakfasts, gift shops and syrup stands. Within a month of the storm, 84 of the 118 closed sections of state roads were reopened, and 28 of the 34 state highway bridges that had been closed were reopened.
Local roads, which are owned and maintained by the towns, suffered extensive damage around the state, with more than 2,000 battered segments and 175 roads completely closed. That work is proceeding, though more slowly than the state effort.
Gov. Peter Shumlin recalled thinking as he flew over the state on the Monday after the hurricane, which had been downgraded to a tropical storm by the time it hit Vermont, that it had ''whacked us.'' ''My God, we're going to be without power and roads for months. We'll never get this done before snow flies,'' he had thought. Now, he exults, ''If you've ever wanted to see a shining example of turning tragedy into opportunity and getting tough things done, you're seeing it in Vermont.''
How did they get so much done so quickly? Within days after the storm hit on Aug. 28, the state had moved to emergency footing, drawing together agencies to coordinate the construction plans and permits instead of letting communications falter. National Guard units from eight states showed up, along with road crews from the Departments of Transportation from Maine and New Hampshire, and armies of private contractors. The attitude, said Sue Minter, Vermont's deputy secretary of transportation, was, ''We'll do the work and we'll figure out how we're paying for it, but we're not waiting.''
Vermont officials initially estimated the repairs would cost a half billion dollars. Now that they have gotten a thorough look at the problems and the work is well under way (the temporary bridges will have to be replaced with permanent structures), the estimate has dropped to somewhere between $175 million and $250 million. The federal government will pay most of that out of disaster relief funds, and Vermont estimates it will have to come up with $27 million.
''We don't even realize to what degree we depend on our government, but in a crisis we sure do,'' Ms. Minter said.
Richard M. Tetreault, chief engineer for the Vermont Agency of Transportation, noted that it helped speed things along to close roads completely instead of having to allow for traffic. Some damage to highways like 107 was predictable, he said, since many roads in mountainous areas follow river valleys.
''We're not looking to move a highway up a mountain slope,'' he said. ''If you look at an insurance policy, you weigh your premium against your risk. That's what society does with factors of safety on a whole host of infrastructure.''
This time, the equation did not work out, Ms. Minter acknowledged, but ''this was like no other storm.'' With the White River 28 feet above its normal level, a great many sections of roads were damaged; debris can still be spotted in tree limbs.
As the road-repair efforts raced forward, the state created a ''foliage force'' to get the word out that Vermont was still open for business. People who saw news of the destroyed roads and bridges were canceling reservations in resorts like Jay Peak and Stowe and the Lake Champlain Islands in the northern part of the state, which was largely unaffected and easily reachable. Google worked with the Agency of Transportation to develop a live road map showing the extent of repairs. The effort has paid off, Ms. Smith, the tourism official said: meal and room revenues for October were up slightly from the previous year, which she called ''nothing short of phenomenal.''
Not everyone has felt the benefits. Marsha Hemm, who owns the Vermont Marble Museum near Rutland, said that while crews cleared the way to her town quickly, the state was slow to reflect it. Her business missed the fall foliage traffic, which ''affected us tremendously.''
It was in the state's interests to paint a glowing picture of a gentle impact on business, Ms. Hemm said, ''But the reality was, for us, different, and I can't help but think we weren't alone.''
Some environmentalists, too, are unhappy with the way many of the repairs have been done. Mary Watzin, the dean of the Rubenstein School of Environment and Natural Resources at the University of Vermont, said that armoring repaired riverbanks with stone could cause damage downstream. ''You haven't gotten rid of the problem, you haven't solved the problem. You've transferred the problem,'' she said.
To Mr. Robie, that is a sign that things are getting back to normal. At first, ''it's 'Hurry get our roads open!' '' After the crisis, ''it's 'Why did you do it like that?' ''
Professor Watzin said that everyone understood the need for quick action and repair to connect people and communities, but that the river work would ultimately require a more comprehensive attitude. ''We certainly are going to have more severe storms as we look into the future with climate change,'' she said. ''We've got to make ourselves more resilient in the future.''
That means planning roads and rivers together, she said, and working not to control nature so much as to work with it.
''We need to be designing for tomorrow,'' she said, because ''the next storm will come.''

HEADLINE: S.&P. Warning Trims Market Gains

BYLINE: By REUTERS

 BODY:
Stocks rose on Monday, although they lost some of their gains after a media report said Standard & Poor's was about to warn Germany and other euro zone nations that their credit ratings were being assessed for a possible downgrade.
The markets were generally higher earlier in the day when an agreement between leaders of France and Germany raised optimism that European leaders would reach a credible solution to their debt crisis. 
S.& P. confirmed after the closing bell that it might downgrade the credit ratings of 15 euro zone countries. S.& P. placed the ratings of euro zone countries, including top-rated Germany and France, on credit watch negative. The euro last traded at $1.339, down 0.1 percent for the day, near a session low of $1.337.
''We know Europe is facing a dire situation here and this action seems appropriate,'' said Brian Dolan, chief strategist at Forex.com in Bedminster, N.J. ''If they are trying to send a message, now is a good time.''
The rating agency's move came as the leaders of France and Germany agreed to a master plan for imposing budget discipline across the region ahead of a meeting on Friday.
The proposal from President Nicolas Sarkozy of France and Chancellor Angela Merkel of Germany included automatic penalties for governments that fail to keep their deficits under control.
Wall Street ended off the day's highs, though it was still near 1 percent higher.
The Dow Jones industrial average gained 78.41 points, or 0.65 percent, to 12,097.83. The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index rose 12.80 points, or 1.03 percent, to 1,257.08. The Nasdaq climbed 28.83 points, or 1.10 percent, to 2,655.76.
European stocks hit a five-week closing high, though analysts were wary the optimism could prove overdone.
''We are far from an easy consensus that it's a done deal,'' said Marc Pado, United States market strategist at Cantor Fitzgerald in San Francisco. ''But we are further along in the negotiations than we've been and we are focused on the right things now.''
While the American economy is still expected to avoid another recession, data released Monday was also downbeat.
Growth in the service sector in the United States eased last month, and new orders for factory goods fell in October, tempering recent optimism that the economy might be poised for a more vigorous rebound.
The Institute for Supply Management said Monday that its services index fell unexpectedly to 52.0 last month from 52.9 the month before, dragged lower by a decline in employment. Although that figure was at its weakest since January 2010, business activity and new orders both improved, showing the mixed nature of expansion that also was evident in the upbeat jobs report for November.
A reading above 50 indicates expansion.
''This is the first disappointing indicator we've seen in the last couple of weeks,'' said Cary Leahey, managing director at Decision Economics in New York. ''The economy has improved, it is still not growing very quickly.''
Pointing to growth in services, the I.S.M.'s gauge of new orders rose to 53.0 from 52.4.
In a separate report on Monday from the Commerce Department, new orders for factory goods fell in October for the second consecutive month, suggesting a possible softening in manufacturing. That area of the economy has been a crucial support for the recovery. The agency said that orders for manufactured goods decreased 0.4 percent.
Economists had forecast orders would fall 0.3 percent after a previously reported 0.3 percent increase in September.

HEADLINE: Out of a Writer's Imagination Came an Interactive World

BYLINE: By JOHN SCHWARTZ

 BODY:
Neal Stephenson doesn't like talking about how he predicted the future.
Mr. Stephenson is the author of a baker's dozen novels whose dazzling range includes rocket-propelled thrillers and a vast historical epic known as the Baroque Cycle, which takes place at the dawn of modern science in the time of Newton and Leibniz.
His reputation for prescience is well earned, even if he regards it lightly. His third novel, ''Snow Crash,'' was published way back in ancient 1992 and laid out many of the attributes of today's online life, including the Metaverse, a virtual place where people meet, do business and play, presenting themselves as avatars. If you've ever played wildly popular multiplayer online games like World of Warcraft, or visited the virtual communities of Second Life, you can get a chill thinking about what he saw back before the popularization of the World Wide Web.
The title of seer falls to novelists now and then: William Gibson got it in the early 1980s for works envisioning cyberspace; more recently, Gary Shteyngart picked it up for the eerie elements of a future foretold, including people's total reliance on their ''apparat'' smartphones in his novel ''Super Sad True Love Story.'' 
Asked to join in a conversation about the future of computing grounded, in part, in that sense that many of us are living in a world he envisioned, Mr. Stephenson, 52, responded with the e-mail equivalent of a sigh.
Politely, but with a suggestion of weariness, he wrote: ''Thanks for thinking of me, but this is actually just about my least favorite interview topic of all time. I'm not sure why.''
He added, ''It seems reasonable, but I just can't find the joy in talking about how I allegedly 'foretold' stuff.'' He then agreed to the interview anyway, to coincide with a trip to New York.
Over lunch at the Omni Berkshire Place hotel in Manhattan, he explained his reticence about taking credit for clairvoyance. For one thing, he said, it isn't really true. ''The way the Internet developed, in my mind, is completely different from the Metaverse in 'Snow Crash,' '' he said. ''I can talk all day long about how wrong I got it. But there are a lot of people who feel as though that was an accurate prediction.''
He described his reputation as a seer in terms resembling what psychologists call the focusing illusion -- too much attention to some aspects of a thing and too little to others. Science fiction writers are ''shotgunning ideas'' through their works, he said, and people tend to recall the pellets that hit the target. ''The perception of goodness is just selective,'' he said.
He suggested that the near-reverence for writerly efforts at prognostication -- and Mr. Stephenson's many fans can be disconcertingly passionate -- are downright goofy in light of the fact that ''there must be countless billions of dollars that go every year into really systematic and motivated future-predicting activities.''
Of course, those systematic and well-financed efforts can fail spectacularly, as when the intelligence community failed to anticipate India's test of nuclear bombs in 1974. Remember those Iraqi weapons of mass destruction?
The thought receives a sardonic grin in reply.
Regardless of whether he foresaw the future, he did foresee the world he would create in his most recent novel, ''Reamde,'' a 1,056-page return to the thriller genre after years of weightier fare like the Baroque Cycle.
Its protagonist, Richard Forthrast, is a onetime marijuana smuggler who becomes the creator of a successful multiplayer online game, T'Rain. There are hackers who unleash a malicious computer program (the titular Reamde) and set in motion a swirling plot that involves Russian mobsters, British and American agents, Chinese hackers and Forthrast's niece Zula and her hacker boyfriend. A tag line for the novel on Mr. Stephenson's Web site reads, ''When the virtual game becomes real, you win or you die.''
Which is also a great line from George R. R. Martin's ''Game of Thrones,'' but let's let the folks in marketing thrash that one out.
This use of the vast resources of a networked world to play games with mortal stakes is a central element of the world that Mr. Stephenson laid out in books like ''Snow Crash,'' and in another of his novels, ''The Diamond Age: Or, a Young Lady's Illustrated Primer.'' That book, published in 1995, described in detail an interactive book that can teach lessons on many topics, entertain with games and provide virtual training for living in the real world.
And the notion of learning real-world skills from online gaming is also a big theme of ''Reamde,'' in which young Chinese hackers hone their skills in English, learn effective problem-solving skills, even jury-rig a sail for a motorboat that has run out of fuel.
When he was asked, toward the end of lunch, where he thought computing might be headed, he paused to rephrase the question. ''I'll tell you what I'd like to see happen,'' he said, and began discussing what the future was supposed to have looked like, back in his 1960s childhood. He ticked off the tropes of what he called ''techno-optimistic science fiction,'' including flying cars and jetpacks. And then computers went from being things that filled a room to things that could fit on a desk, and the economy and industries changed. ''The kinds of super-bright, hardworking geeky people who, 50 years ago, would have been building moon rockets or hydrogen bombs or what have you have ended up working in the computer industry, doing jobs that in many cases seem kind of ignominious by comparison.''
Again, a beat. A consideration, perhaps, that he is talking about the core readership for his best sellers. No matter. He's rolling. He presses on.
''What I'm kind of hoping is that this is just kind of a pause, while we assimilate this gigantic new thing, ubiquitous computing and the Internet. And that at some point we'll turn around and say, 'Well, that was interesting -- we have a whole set of new tools and capabilities that we didn't have before the whole computer/Internet thing came along.' ''
He said people should say, ''Now let's get back to work doing interesting and useful things.''
The needs of the world are great: New forms of energy, space transportation and infrastructure all need to be tackled with imagination and innovation, he said. He grew animated as he discussed his latest initiative: He is now pushing for a return to a can-do American culture that can ''get big stuff done.''
He is trying to carve out a place for science fiction to help by, well, predicting the future. Wait, that's not quite it: He wants science fiction to help by creating the future -- supplying the imagination and inspiration to the next generation of engineers and scientists, just as writers like Stanislaw Lem helped inform and usher in the space age. And as he might have done by giving engineers a vision of the Metaverse, though he doesn't say that part out loud.
He is doing it through Hieroglyph, a project of writers who hope to reignite the popular imagination to ''develop new technologies and implement them on a heroic scale,'' as he put it in a recent essay in World Policy Journal, with fiction that returns to its techno-optimistic roots.
The tools of computing and a networked world can help to get us there, he said, but only if we use our newfound power as a means to those ends, instead of as ends in themselves.
''We can't Facebook our way out of the current economic status quo.''

HEADLINE: Getting Her Dream Home, but Missing the Furniture

BYLINE: By ANN FARMER

 BODY:
Natasha Sydney's new home has a sunset view of the Verrazano-Narrows Bridge and three ''Happy Birthday'' balloons hovering near the living room ceiling, but not much else.
That is because Ms. Sydney, 30, and her three daughters had nothing to furnish their two-bedroom apartment in the Sheepshead Bay Houses in Brooklyn, where they moved in August.
They borrowed some plastic lawn chairs to sit on. Unable to buy a table, they ate on their laps. Ms. Sydney and her daughters also slept on the floor.
''I laid out here,'' said Ms. Sydney, pointing to the vinyl-tiled living-room floor where she had placed a comforter and pillows. She fashioned a similar arrangement in her girls' bedroom. 
''It's been tough; but it was good for my back,'' she said, laughing.
Looking tidy in a blue blazer and slacks that were set off by her vivacious smile, Ms. Sydney said she became a mother at 14, never graduating from high school. In 2003, she landed a retail position at Bloomingdale's that paid $600 a week plus commissions. About five years later, as the recession prompted shoppers to cut back, she lost her job.
''I never saved for a rainy day,'' Ms. Sydney said with regret. After she exhausted her 401(k) to cover her rent and her commercial landlord refused to participate in the Section 8 housing program, she said, she and her daughters were forced to move. They lived with an aunt, and then with Ms. Sydney's mother, putting their possessions into storage and squeezing into a three-bedroom home that accommodated several others.
When Ms. Sydney could not keep up with the storage payments, all their belongings were auctioned off. The worst part was losing precious family photographs. ''I even had a picture of my dad at 18,'' she said, sighing.
Ms. Sydney received welfare for a time. But, she said: ''It wasn't for me. I felt trapped.''
After applying for numerous positions, she got a job two years ago as a home health aide for Attending Home Care in Brooklyn, where she now works four days a week, 12 hours a day. Her weekly salary is $407. But she is happy to have a job. ''Now I make my own money,'' she said.
When the New York City Housing Authority offered her an apartment in July, she barely glanced it over, so eager was she to move in with the family's few possessions: a cooking pot, a blender, a stereo and clothes. But no beds. Ms. Sydney turned to Catholic Charities Brooklyn and Queens, one of the seven agencies supported by The New York Times Neediest Cases Fund.
''When she came to me the first time, she started crying,'' her case worker, Maria Gualy, recalled. ''She said, 'I need to provide my daughters with what they deserve.' ''
Through the fund, Catholic Charities gave Ms. Sydney $700 to buy a queen-size bed and a bunk bed designed to sleep three comfortably.
''It's good,'' said her oldest daughter, Tyisha Tasha King, 16. ''Good, good,'' chimed in the two younger girls, Myeira Natalia Joseph, 6, and Tianna Tafari King, 12.
''It's a new beginning,'' Ms. Sydney said. ''I'm going in wiser. I'm more cautious.''
She is enrolled in a workshop run by Operation Hope at Catholic Charities, where she is learning to manage her finances better. ''I'm doing extreme couponing,'' she said, describing how she cuts coupons from newspapers and visits Web sites to ferret out other discounts. ''It's helping me get back to where I need to be.''
''And I'm not doing fast foods,'' she said. Instead, she is focusing on home cooking, like the dish she made from random things in her cupboard, including spaghetti, corn, onion and Adobo seasoning on a recent night. ''I don't know what it was,'' she said, ''but they loved it.''
Although Ms. Sydney receives $392 in food stamps and $200 in child support, there is little left over for more home furnishings. ''I like color,'' she said, envisioning a red sofa someday brightening up the beige walls.
As the sunset faded, and not having a single living-room lamp to turn on, she got up and switched on the kitchen light. It will do for now.

HEADLINE: A High-Stakes Search Continues for Silicon's Successor

BYLINE: By JOHN MARKOFF

 BODY:
STANFORD, Calif. -- In a cluttered chip-making laboratory on Stanford's campus, Max Shulaker is producing the world's smallest computer circuits by hand.
Mr. Shulaker, a graduate student in electrical engineering, is helping to pioneer an extraordinary custom manufacturing process: making prototypes of a new kind of semiconductor circuit that may one day be the basis for the world's fastest supercomputers -- not to mention the smallest and lowest-powered consumer gadgets.
If the new technology proves workable, it will avert a crisis that threatens to halt more than five decades of progress by chip makers, who now routinely etch circuits smaller than a wavelength of light to make ever more powerful computers.
Even light waves, it turns out, have their limits. In an industry renowned for inventions both radical and resourceful, designers are in urgent need of new ways to make circuits smaller, faster and cheaper. 
This year Intel, the world's largest chip maker, introduced a 3-D transistor that pushes a thin pillar out of the plane of the silicon surface, in an effort to accommodate billions of tiny switches on a single microprocessor.
That approach is controversial; the challenge is not just to squeeze in more switches but to get them to turn on and off quickly and cleanly, and many people in the industry believe there are less drastic ways to do that.
And whichever approach proves most effective, there is a growing consensus among engineers and industry executives that silicon's days are numbered. On the horizon is an even smaller manufacturing world, nanoelectronics, that will be characterized by the ability to build circuits on a molecular scale.
So at universities and corporate laboratories around the world, researchers are trying to develop the next generation of chip-making technologies.
Mr. Shulaker is a member of the Robust Systems Group at Stanford, led by Subhasish Mitra, a former Intel engineer. The new switch he and other student researchers are making is called a carbon nanotube field effect transistor, or C.N.F.E.T.
To make prototype switches, Mr. Shulaker first chemically grows billions of carbon nanotubes -- each only about 12 atoms wide -- on a quartz surface. He coats them with an ultrafine layer of gold, and then uses a piece of tape -- much like a lint remover -- to pick them up by hand and transfer them gently to a silicon wafer.
The difference is that for the first time circuits are not etched with light waves; rather, they are at least partly ''self-assembling.'' The ultrafine wires made from carbon nanotubes are being laid down using a chemical process as the first step in making a computer circuit.
What results are nanocircuits that are far smaller and use far less power than today's most advanced silicon-based computer circuits.
With the light-etching method, the smallest part of a semiconductor is currently 32 nanometers, and the nanotechnology is an approach that both Intel and I.B.M. have high hopes for by the time semiconductor parts are down to seven nanometers -- which could be as early as 2017.
''We're exploring this very seriously,'' said Supratik Guha, director of physical sciences at I.B.M.'s Thomas J. Watson Research Laboratory. ''We feel that if we can place carbon nanotubes a couple of nanometers apart, they will outperform silicon.''
The idea of scaling down electronic circuits goes back at least to 1960, when a young electrical engineer named Douglas Engelbart spoke at a radio and electronics technical conference in Philadelphia. Dr. Engelbart had hit on the idea that shrinking the basic circuitry of the first digital computers could lead to a drastic increase in power.
''Boy, are there going to be some surprises over there,'' he told his audience.
It turned out to be an understatement.
A half decade later, Gordon Moore, then a chemist at Fairchild Semiconductor, formalized the ability of a new technique called photolithography to scale down components, saying it could be done at regular intervals and predicting that it would be exponential -- doubling the number of transistors that could be put on a microchip every year.
Moore's Law, as it came to be called, was only a little optimistic: The doubling has taken place every 18 months or so for nearly five decades. Today several billion transistors can fit on a single chip, and the resulting era of microelectronics has transformed the world, touching virtually every aspect of human existence -- from African subsistence farmers who can now get market prices via text message to supercomputers that can simulate nuclear explosions and predict climate change.
But with each new generation of technology, the obstacles have grown more imposing, and the cost of surmounting them is going up, not down. For example, the Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company, one of the world's largest chip makers, expects to spend almost $10 billion on its next factory.
Moreover, as standard CMOS computer circuits pack more and more transistors, they tend to leak electricity -- and thus generate excess heat.
The warning signs began a decade ago, when Patrick P. Gelsinger, then Intel's chief technology officer, warned that if the trends continued, microprocessor chips would reach the temperature of the sun's surface by 2011. To prevent that, the company executed what it called a ''hard right turn,'' gaining speed by adding parallel computing capabilities rather than increasing the chips' clock speeds.
Even that approach has its limits, however. This year, researchers at the University of Washington and Microsoft warned of what they called ''dark silicon.'' With so many processors on a single chip, it is impractical to supply power to all of them at the same time. So some of the transistors are left unpowered -- dark, in industry parlance.
The new limits are particularly daunting for supercomputer designers, who are looking to build an ''exascale'' system -- 1,000 times the speed of today's fastest computers -- by 2019. Using today's components, that would require 10 million to 100 million processors -- compared with almost one million today -- and would consume more than a billion watts.
At the annual supercomputing conference in Seattle last month, Jen-Hsun Huang, chief executive of Nvidia, a maker of graphics accelerator chips used in game machines and computers, warned that while supercomputing performance had improved one million times in the last two decades, the power needed to run a computer had increased just 40 times. This rate of increase had been predicted by Robert H. Dennard, the I.B.M. electrical engineer who invented the dynamic random access memory, or DRAM, chip. However, in the face of the growing problem of current leakage, the huge benefit, which had offered a constant eight times performance increase per watt, has reached its limit.
''The impact of that small analysis is dramatic over time,'' Mr. Huang said. ''It's fundamental to our industry -- this is our gravity.''
Mr. Huang's company, which began as a Silicon Valley maker of graphics cards for 3-D video games and has recently begun to offer software that optimizes its processors for scientific and engineering applications, mirrors broader trends in the computer industry.
Until the 1990s, state-of-the-art computing systems began with corporate and military applications. Since then, increasingly the technology has been driven from the bottom up. The vast economies of scale offered by consumer electronics products has dictated that many of the fastest supercomputers are now built from components first designed for consumers.
At this year's supercomputing conference, for example, researchers at the Barcelona Supercomputing Center in Spain announced that they were planning a system based on a new Nvidia chip that combines its graphics processors with the ARM microprocessor that is widely used in smartphones.
Combining graphics processors, microprocessors and other computer components onto single integrated chips is only a stopgap measure, however. Within a few years, experts say, the conventional CMOS transistors will no longer be able to scale down at a Moore's Law pace.
Here at Stanford, Dr. Mitra says a system based on carbon nanotubes may greatly outperform Intel's current 3-D transistor technology. Indeed, it might be possible to stack multiple layers of these carbon switches, creating genuine three-dimensional circuits.
But he acknowledges that carbon nanotube technology ''still has its catches.''
Other technologies, too, may be contenders in the nanoelectronics sweepstakes.
Researchers at HP Labs have said they are close to commercializing a new semiconductor technology based on a circuit element called a ''memristor,'' which can substitute for transistors, initially in a memory chip that might offer an alternative to both Flash and DRAM memories.
The researchers previously reported in The Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences that they had devised a new method for storing and retrieving information from a vast three-dimensional array of memristors. The scheme could potentially free designers to stack thousands of switches in a high-rise fashion, permitting a new class of ultradense computing devices even after two-dimensional scaling reaches fundamental limits.
In a recent lecture at Stanford, Stan Williams, a physicist who is leading the effort at HP, said the group was focusing on a new type of semiconducting material, titanium dioxide, which he said could rival silicon.
''Suffice it to say this is not in the deep dark future,'' he said. ''This is not 10 years out.''
Dr. Williams said the memristor could have significant power and size advantages over conventional transistors used in logic devices like microprocessors, which must be continually powered to preserve information. By contrast, the HP technology is nonvolatile -- it is necessary only to apply power to change the state of the switch and to read its value.
Moreover, like the carbon nanotube design, it lends itself to three-dimensional structures.
''This is something that has been eluding the community for 30 years,'' he said.

HEADLINE: Graying Town Builds a Life Beyond Bingo

BYLINE: By PETER APPLEBOME

 BODY:
SOUTHBURY, Conn. -- Judy Plouffe and her mom are big on mother-daughter outings in this picturesque suburb off Interstate 84.
There are Friday pizza nights with their neighbors in Heritage Village, van trips to the Danbury Fair Mall and a full schedule of events at what used to be the town library. Ms. Plouffe is partial to the aerobics, pinochle and square dancing there. Her mother, Frances Lefevre, preferred weight-lifting, tai chi and bowling on the Wii until health problems slowed her down, but she figures she is about ready to get back to some of her favored activities at the old library, which is now the Southbury Senior Center.
''She does well,'' said Ms. Plouffe, 64, a retired home health aide who, like her mother, is widowed. ''She has problems, but any 92-year-old would. Me, I'm one of the kids around here.''
Elderly people are now a greater portion of the nation's population than at any time since the government began keeping track, and the Northeast, not warm-weather retirement destinations like the South and Southwest, has the largest percentage of people 65 and older, according to the Census Bureau. 
The lives of Ms. Plouffe and her mother in Southbury make an intriguing snapshot of the graying of America. Once dairy-farming country, Southbury is now a place where the elderly are not just the dominant demographic but also increasingly the engine of the economy and the focus of town life. For now, it works. In the long term, it may get more complicated.
''When Heritage Village first came in, it was us versus them,'' said First Selectman Bill Davis, speaking about the sprawling 55-and-over complex of 1,000 acres and about 4,000 residents, which opened in 1967. ''But now, almost anything we do we take them into account. That's who we are. We're an elderly-based community.''
More than 30 percent of Southbury's population is over 60, a segment expected to be about 40 percent by 2020. Nationally, according to the 2010 census, the population over age 62 grew by 21 percent in a decade, compared with just 2.6 percent for those under 18. Maine had the highest median age, 42.7, followed by Vermont, West Virginia, New Hampshire, Florida, Pennsylvania and Connecticut, whose median age was 40. In 2000, no state had a median age above 40.
In addition to Heritage Village, where the median age is 77, Southbury has the Grace Meadows public housing complex for the elderly, three assisted living centers, and two nursing homes -- all in a town with less than 20,000 people -- which provide an interdependent network of services. After spending time rehabilitating at the River Glen Health Care Center following hip replacement or heart surgery, a resident of Heritage Village might move back home or into an assisted living center like the Hearth at Southbury, Pomperaug Woods or the Watermark at East Hill; eventually, they might relocate to the Lutheran Home, which specializes in dementia care.
It is not quite a Yankee Shangri-La, but some residents say it seems that way to them. Ronald Cooper, 70, a Southbury native, grew up on a local dairy farm without running water, electricity or heat other than the fireplace. He helped build Heritage Village, did various other jobs, then came back to work there as a maintenance foreman. On Thursdays he is one of 50 or so people, perhaps half a dozen of them male, who show up at the senior center for the weekly bingo game called by the 86-year-old Vincent Ditaranto.
''I see very little we could improve on,'' Mr. Cooper said. ''People complain about money and tax issues, and if you don't have enough for proper health care, eyeglasses, medicine and all that, it's a problem. Fortunately, I have four pensions. I'm not saying we're rich, but we live comfortably.''
Of course, for many, comfort can still be elusive, even in a community where the elderly population is relatively affluent. Longtime residents cite a shortage of affordable housing for the elderly. The 88 units of public housing have a three-to-four-year waiting list with over 150 names.
Ms. Plouffe and her mother, a retired secretary, struggle to pay Heritage Village's rising maintenance fees, now almost $500 a month. Ask most people and you hear financial concerns.
''Almost everyone has lost a good part of their portfolio, their savings,'' said Grethe Arthur, who at 79 ice-skates and takes part in the exercise and photography classes at Heritage Village and the senior center. ''Everyone's feeling it, but they don't want to talk about it.''
And Southbury and Connecticut, like much of the nation, face the huge challenge of supporting their aging population. The solvency of Social Security and the rising costs of Medicare are two problems yet to be solved, since the Congressional deficit reduction committee failed last month to reach a deal.
Benjamin Barnes, the state's budget director, said Medicaid costs, which are shared with the federal government, were a pressing issue already consuming $5 billion, a quarter of the Connecticut budget. One of the fastest-growing segments of Medicaid is nursing care, which the state has tried to address by encouraging home care as an alternative to more costly institutionalized care. ''Health care cost containment is a big challenge for us in the long term, and obviously an aging population is one of the demographic trends working against us,'' he said.
Beyond that, he said, local and state tax revenues face growing pressure as people live on pensions instead of salaries and health care costs leave less discretionary income. ''If someone goes on a pension and their income is cut in half, thinking as the tax man, I just lost half their taxes,'' he said.
But there are economic upsides, too, in having so many retirees around. Southbury is sending fewer students to school but still providing tax revenue to the school district. The retirees volunteer in great numbers at local agencies and churches. In Connecticut Magazine's statistical rating of the best towns of its size, Southbury ranked eighth, between the tony towns of Madison and Stonington.
And if the future is uncertain, Southbury, with its ample open space and tidy, fashionable shopping centers, does not show it. The town's Senior Resource Guide shows why, with its advertisements for elder-care lawyers, cardiac and joint-replacement medical care, home health care, upscale residences and hearing aid companies.
At the senior center, which opened four years ago, the struggle for visitors is often figuring out which activities to do: Pilates or Fit and Flex? Line dancing or tap dancing? Photos for Fun or table tennis? Five drivers deliver patrons there or to other places in town in four vehicles, including a 14-passenger van.
With two replacement knees, Evelyn Bowen, the 77-year-old widow of a Brooklyn chiropractor, does aerobics, armchair yoga, tap and Spanish castanet dancing; plays bingo Thursday at the senior center; and calls bingo Friday at Heritage Village. She is in the Celtic Club, the Italian Renaissance Club and the Hadassah Women's Club when not spending the winter in Florida.
''I'm still partial to New York, but this is a much calmer place to live,'' she said. ''No one's rushing here, there and everywhere.''
Everett Park Hopkins, 88, who heads the senior center's photography club, said politics were relatively simple here: most people just want to make sure their benefits are protected and their taxes are kept down. ''That's very nice if you can do it,'' he said.
Solving the big problems may be the task for another generation. At the senior center, they are handling smaller, more immediate challenges.
Mr. Hopkins was driving Ms. Arthur home to Heritage Village after their photography class the other day. But first, he had to get up from his chair. He scrunched forward, leaned hard on the armrests and with her help made it up.
''On top of everything else, she's strong,'' he said as the two walked slowly toward the exit.

HEADLINE: In Ireland, Austerity Is Praised But Painful

BYLINE: By LIZ ALDERMAN

 BODY:
DUBLIN -- As European leaders scramble to overcome the Continent's debt crisis, many are pointing to Ireland as a model for how to get out of the troubles.
Having embraced severe belt-tightening to mend its tattered finances, Ireland is showing glimmers of a turnaround. A year after it received a 67.5 billion euro bailout, or about $90 billion at current exchange rates, modest growth has returned and the budget deficit is shrinking.
But the effects of austerity have pummeled Ireland's fragile economy, leaving scars that are likely to take years to heal. Nearly 40,000 Irish have fled the country this year alone in search of a brighter future elsewhere; the trend is expected to continue.
''This is still an insolvent economy,'' said Constantin Gurdgiev, an economist and lecturer at Trinity College in Dublin. ''Just because we're playing a good-boy role and not making noises like the Greeks doesn't mean Ireland is healthy.'' 
The German chancellor, Angela Merkel, recently praised the Irish prime minister, Enda Kenny, for setting an ''outstanding example,'' while the French president, Nicolas Sarkozy, declared that Ireland was already ''almost out of the crisis.''
Underneath the surface, however, the grinding reality of Irish life belies those glowing commendations.
Salaries of nurses, professors and other public sector workers have been cut around 20 percent. A range of taxes, including on housing and water, have increased. Investment in public works is virtually moribund.
On Monday and Tuesday, Mr. Kenny's government is announcing an additional 3.8 billion euros in tax increases and spending cuts for 2012 that will affect health care, social protections and child benefits.
Retail sales fell 3.8 percent in October from a year earlier as spending was down even on things like school textbooks, shoes and other basic goods.
At a Spar convenience store in the center of Dublin, Samantha O'Donnell, a mother of two, filled her shopping basket with some necessities, then put a few back on the shelf.
''A lot of people are just trying to get by week to week,'' said Mrs. O'Donnell, who said her salary as a nursing assistant had been cut.
To Sean Kay, a professor of politics at Ohio Wesleyan University in Delaware, Ohio, and the author of a recent book examining Ireland's crisis, Mrs. O'Donnell's experience is typical. ''The Irish are being praised for doing what they were asked to do, which is important for bringing investors back to the country,'' he said. ''But for the Irish people, it's not paying off.''
There are signs of improvement. Compared with the previous year, exports are up 5.4 percent for the first nine months of 2011, driven by gains from Pfizer, Intel, SAP and other multinational companies that were drawn to Ireland in the 1990s and 2000s by its low taxes, well-educated English-speaking work force and access to the European market. New information technology companies like LinkedIn and Facebook have recently arrived.
Prospects for local technology companies are improving, too. Brian Farrell founded Tethras with a partner three years ago to develop mobile applications for smartphones. He now has 16 employees and hopes to double his work force in the next 18 months.
''Every time you turn the radio on, companies in I.T. are hiring,'' Mr. Farrell said, referring to information technology.
Gross domestic product grew 1.2 percent in the second quarter from a year earlier, compared with a decline of 0.4 percent for all of 2010 and 7 percent in 2009.
The interest rates that Ireland would pay its international creditors if it were not on a financial lifeline have also fallen, to 8.7 percent today from 14 percent in August, in part because investors hope that European policy makers will resolve the broader debt crisis.
But that is still above the level that led Ireland to seek a bailout and too high to allow for sustainable finances.
The budget deficit has fallen to around 10 percent of gross domestic product this year from a staggering 32 percent in 2010. But even under the best circumstances, it will not reach the Europe-wide target of 3 percent until 2015.
Moreover, the recovery looks to be short-lived, probably putting that goal out of reach. The Economic and Social Research Institute, based in Dublin, recently cut its 2012 growth forecasts for Ireland in half, to under 1 percent. It cited an expected recession in the wider euro zone, in part because the austerity being pressed on much of Europe by Germany and the European Central Bank is seen as worsening the prospects for recovery rather than improving them.
''The present situation contains elements reminiscent of policy during the Great Depression, when a mounting crisis was confronted by an orthodoxy that resulted in great poverty that could have been avoided,'' the institute wrote in a report.
Pain is inevitable in any nation overwhelmed by its debts, which in Ireland continue to climb rather than fall as a percentage of gross domestic product. But the Irish example shows the dangers of taking from ordinary people to pay off creditors rather than sharing the burden more broadly.
For example, welfare payments have steadily been reduced even as the unemployment rate has ticked up to 14.5 percent, and is forecast to remain high at least through next year.
The Irish are not prone to protest, but now more are being organized, inspired by the Occupy movement in the United States.
On a recent frosty night in Dublin, David Johnson, 38, an I.T. consultant, stepped outside a makeshift camp set up by the Occupy Dame Street movement in front of the Irish Central Bank.
''This is all new to Ireland,'' he said, pointing to tarpaulins and protest signs that urged the government to boot out the International Monetary Fund and require bondholders to share Irish banks' losses that have largely been assumed by taxpayers. ''The feeling is that the people who can least afford it are the ones shouldering the burden of this crisis.''
Joblessness would be much higher, economists say, if not for the rising tide of Irish people leaving for Australia, Britain and Canada as opportunities at home stagnate. Thousands of students and construction workers left this country of 4.5 million people after the economy slid into recession in 2008, most of them expecting to be away temporarily.
But now, accountants, engineers, dentists and other high-skilled professionals are moving with their families. And many are not looking back, said Edwina Shanahan, a senior manager at Visa First, a company that helps set Irish citizens and others up with visas abroad.
''The politicians said things would get better,'' she said. ''But things are instead a disaster zone for many.''
Deirdre Cronin, 29, an accountant in Cork, plans to move in the new year with her husband and two young children to Australia, which has become a mecca for tens of thousands of Irish seeking a brighter future.
''We feel we would never be able to give our children an opportunity'' in Ireland, she said. ''We're going to work hard out there, and earn a decent living.''
The exodus of workers from declining areas to growing ones is one way economies rebalance. But it could take years to do so. In the meantime, many Irish acknowledge that they fear that the hard gains Ireland has eked out could be swept away if Europe's leaders fail in their latest effort to prevent the crisis from fracturing the monetary union.
''The euro zone is entering a very serious slump, and it is not certain the euro will survive in its current form,'' said Simon Johnson, a professor at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology's Sloan School of Management and a former chief economist at the I.M.F. ''Why Ireland would want to spend its time being a model student in the context of the broader European mishandling of the situation, I don't know.''

HEADLINE: Penalties May Send Oil Prices Soaring, Iran Warns

BYLINE: By RICK GLADSTONE; Artin Afkhami contributed reporting from Boston, and Choe Sang-Hun from Seoul, South Korea.

 BODY:
Alarmed by the possibility of new Western penalties that could abruptly reduce or even halt its oil exports, Iran issued a warning on Monday that crude oil prices could more than double to $250 a barrel if such sanctions were given serious consideration.
The warning, issued by the Foreign Ministry, appeared to be part of an attempt by Iran to intimidate its adversaries as tensions grow. Western nations stepped up their efforts to isolate Iran diplomatically after mobs stormed and vandalized Britain's diplomatic facilities in Tehran less than a week ago, evoking stark images of the United States Embassy takeover after the 1979 Islamic Revolution. The assault was widely criticized, even by some of Iran's friends. 
Despite the Iranian warning, oil prices were little changed by the end of the day Monday.
Iranian leaders are increasingly concerned that oil sales, Iran's main source of income, are now at risk in ways that they were able to avoid in earlier rounds of Western sanctions. Those sanctions were imposed to press Iran, so far unsuccessfully, to halt its suspect nuclear program.
Iran is the third-largest exporter of oil, after Saudi Arabia and Russia. Its biggest customers --China, the European Union, India, Japan, and South Korea -- together account for more than three-quarters of total Iranian oil exports, according to an analysis published by the Energy Information Administration in the United States. Reduced orders from just one of those customers could be disruptive for Iran, where the economy is already suffering from the accumulated effects of other sanctions.
After the assault on the British Embassy, European Union ministers said they would give serious consideration to an oil embargo at a meeting in January, and the United States Senate voted 100 to 0 for legislation that would penalize any foreign bank that does business with Iran's central bank.
The Senate measure, meant to use access to the United States market as leverage in isolating Iran, is not yet law and could be modified. But analysts said that such a measure, if enforced, could wreak havoc on Iran's oil industry, because the central bank is the main conduit for receipts from oil sales.
''At some point, sanctions become an act of war,'' said Vali Nasr, a professor at Tufts University and an expert on Iranian affairs. ''If you cut Iran out of the oil market, this is no longer economic pressure.''
The situation has been heating up since the International Atomic Energy Agency, the monitoring arm of the United Nations, issued a report on Nov. 8 that said Iran may be actively developing a nuclear weapon and a missile delivery system. Iran, which has always asserted that its nuclear program is strictly for peaceful purposes, denounced the report as a fabrication created under pressure from its Western enemies.
The United States, Canada and their European allies imposed new sanctions on Iran a few weeks after the United Nations report. But those measures were meant to limit Iran's access to the international financial system and to penalize its petrochemical and oil products industries, not to affect exports of crude oil.
Iran's warning about blocking its oil exports was issued by Ramin Mehmanparast, a spokesman for the Foreign Ministry, in an interview with Sharq, a Persian-language daily, and was transmitted by the semiofficial Fars News Agency.
''As soon as such an issue is raised seriously, the oil price would soar to above $250 a barrel,'' Mr. Mehmanparast was quoted as saying. ''I do not think the situation in the world and especially in the West today is adequately prepared to raise such discussions.''
Oil prices rose on the news but ended the day barely changed. The price of the benchmark grade of American crude oil closed at $100.99 on the New York Mercantile Exchange, up from $100.96 on Friday.
In a separate dispatch from the World Petroleum Congress meeting under way in Doha, Qatar, Fars News quoted the oil minister of India, S. Jaipal Reddy, as reassuring Iran that India would remain a faithful buyer of Iranian oil. The dispatch apparently was intended to give the impression that India, at least, would not be dissuaded by new Western sanctions. Other news reports from Doha, however, quoted Mr. Reddy as saying India was also looking for new sources of supply.
Another prospective threat to Iran's customers came from Seoul, South Korea, where a senior American diplomat, Robert J. Einhorn, urged the government to suspend imports of Iranian petrochemicals. The Foreign Ministry said it was reviewing the request.
Mr. Einhorn, who is the State Department's special adviser for nonproliferation and arms control, said at a news conference that ''the situation in Iran has become more and more worrisome over recent months.''
Without a diplomatic solution in the standoff, Mr. Einhorn said, ''pressures will grow for a much stronger kind of action.''
Abbas Milani, the director of Iranian studies at Stanford University, said he thought Iran's Islamic hierarchy may have miscalculated the strong global reaction to the British Embassy assault, which most Iran experts have said was done with the explicit approval of Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, the supreme leader. Now, Mr. Milani said, the momentum for sanctions aimed at oil, Iran's critical export, presents a new threat.
''They thought they could get away with it, by firing a shot across the bow,'' he said. ''It turned out to be much more costly.''

HEADLINE: Power in Numbers: China Aims for High-Tech Primacy

BYLINE: By DAVID BARBOZA and JOHN MARKOFF; David Barboza reported from Beijing and John Markoff from San Francisco.

 BODY:
BEIJING -- In an otherwise nondescript conference room, Wu Jianping stands before a giant wall of frosted glass. He toggles a switch and the glass becomes transparent, looking down on an imposing network operations center full of large computer displays. They show maps of China and the world, pinpointing China's IPv6 links, the next generation of the Internet.
China already has almost twice the number of Internet users as in the United States, and Dr. Wu, a computer scientist and director of the Chinese Educational and Research Network, points out that his nation is moving more quickly than any other in the world to deploy the new protocol.
IPv6 -- Internet Protocol version 6 -- offers advanced security and privacy options, but more important, many more I.P. addresses, whose supply on the present Internet (IPv4) is almost exhausted. 
''China must move to IPv6,'' Dr. Wu said. ''In the U.S., some people don't believe it's urgent, but we believe it's urgent.''
If the future of the Internet is already in China, is the future of computing there as well?
Many experts in the United States say it could very well be. Because of the ready availability of low-cost labor, China has already become the world's dominant maker of computers and consumer electronics products. Now, these experts say, its booming economy and growing technological infrastructure may thrust it to the forefront of the next generation of computing.
For China, the quest to develop advanced computing centers is not simply a matter of national pride. It is an attempt to lay the groundwork for innovative Chinese companies and to reshape the technological landscape by doing something more than assembling the world's desktop PCs.
Never mind that there may be no Chinese Steve Jobs, said Clyde V. Prestowitz Jr., president of the Economic Strategy Institute.
''There are different kinds of innovation,'' he said. ''We tend to equate innovation with companies that start from garages based on brainstorms.
''There is another kind of innovation that results in constant improvement that we are not good at -- and they are.''
The view is not universal. Still, other experts say it would be a mistake to underestimate China's capacity for rapid progress.
''When I went to China for the first time in 1978, I saw workers stringing together computer memories with sewing needles,'' said Patrick J. McGovern, the founder of the International Data Group, an early investor in Tencent Holdings, one of the most successful Chinese Internet companies. ''Now innovation is accelerating, and in the future, patents on smartphones and tablets will be originated by the Chinese people.''
A New Kind of Challenge
Going back six decades -- to Eniac, considered to be the first electronic computer -- the United States has set both the pace and the path of modern computing and communication. From mainframes to iPhones, from the Arpanet to WiFi, innovation has been as American as Norman Rockwell.
And for more than a generation, the hub of innovation has been Silicon Valley, a multicultural melting pot that has supported the singular amalgam of computer-hacker ethos and entrepreneurial aggressiveness that made it the envy of the world.
Probably the most serious challenge to the Valley's dominance came in the late 1980s from Japan, which seemed on the brink of taking command of the semiconductor and computer industries until its economy foundered.
Today, China poses a very different kind of challenge. While Japan's economy has long been driven by exports, China will soon have the world's largest domestic market for both Internet commerce and computing.
The world took notice of Chinese technological prowess in late 2010, when a Chinese supercomputer, the Tianhe-1A, briefly became the world's fastest. Though it was made from American processors and was soon surpassed by a Japanese machine, it was still indisputable evidence that the Chinese had achieved world-class computing designs.
Then, this October, another Chinese supercomputer, the Sunway Bluelight MPP, broke the petaflop barrier -- a quadrillion calculations per second -- putting it among the world's 20 fastest computers.
This machine proved even more surprising in the West. Not only was it based on a Chinese-made microprocessor, but it also achieved a significant advance in low-power operation. That might indicate the Chinese now have a significant lead in ''performance per watt'' -- a measure of energy-efficient computing that will prove crucial to reaching the next generation of so-called exascale supercomputers, which are computers that will be a thousand times faster than the world's fastest today, and which are scheduled to arrive by the end of this decade.
''This is what Chinese companies need to do,'' said Hu Weiwu, a professor at the Chinese Academy of Sciences who is the chief designer of another Chinese family of microprocessor chips. ''We can send a spaceship to space. We can design high-performance computers.''
American officials agree, saying the Chinese government's investment in supercomputing is paying off.
''The overall point of all of this is that the Chinese understand the importance of high-performance computing,'' said Donna Crawford, the associate director of computation at the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory. ''They are executing on the plan as a key enabler for their whole society.''
Obstacles to Dominance
Last year, in an interview that would have been seen as extraordinary if the remarks had been made by a United States president, Prime Minister Wen Jiabao committed China to creating an ''Internet of things.''
Connecting homes and smart power grids has been a driving principle behind the next-generation Internet in the United States. And it goes hand in hand with ''ubiquitous computing,'' the idea that computing power transforms everyday devices like smartphones and digital music players.
But China's efforts at dominance are hardly without obstacles. The country has fallen far short on a decade-long commitment to build the world's leading semiconductor industry, and it still imports a vast majority of microchips for the products it assembles. Its best chip factories are two to three generations behind world leaders like Intel, in the United States, and T.S.M.C., in Taiwan.
China's great weakness may prove to be too much government control. Chinese innovation may also be limited by the relative lack of intellectual property protection, discouraging entrepreneurs from breaking new ground.
The 13th International Conference on Ubiquitous Computing, in Beijing in September, left American technology experts underwhelmed.
''There was nothing that really leaped out at me,'' said John Seeley Brown, who directed the Xerox Palo Alto Research Center in the 1980s, when the concept was invented.
In contrast, he said, he observed true innovation at companies like Foxconn, the Taiwanese manufacturing firm with extensive operations in mainland China that has done much of Apple's assembly work.
''There is the deep embedding of the research and design culture driving a place like Foxconn to do things that they would never have done on their own,'' he said. ''We've now combined the best thinkers in the U.S. sitting side by side with the people who are best at manufacturing in the world.''
Still, other investors have glimpsed similar possibilities in China itself. Ruby Lu, a Beijing-based partner in DCM, a venture capital firm with investments in China, described a semiconductor firm begun with lead designers in San Diego and support engineers in Shanghai, working at one-sixth the cost.
''It was the Shanghai team who came up with a groundbreaking solution to an existing problem,'' she recalled in an e-mail. What scares competitors is that China has begun producing waves of amazing hardware engineers and software programmers, winning international competitions and beginning to dominate the best engineering programs in the United States. The University of California, Berkeley, is about to announce a deal to create an engineering campus in Shanghai, raising fears about transferring technology from one of the best American engineering schools.
Much has been made of computer science ''returnees,'' most notably Andrew Chi-Chih Yao, who left Princeton to create an institute at Tsinghua University in Beijing that has already made breakthroughs in game theory and computer security.
''Overnight there is lots of activity coming from Beijing,'' said Christos Papadimitriou, a computer scientist at Berkeley.
And there is little question that the structure of Chinese industry is becoming more innovation-oriented. This summer Dieter Ernst, senior fellow at the East-West Center, testified before a Congressional commission that the Chinese had overtaken South Korea and Europe in total patents and were catching up with the United States and Japan.
Moreover, China is now the world's second-largest venture capital market, growing to $7.6 billion from just $2.2 billion in 2005, while the American venture capital market has remained largely stagnant, according to Rebecca A. Fannin, author of the new book ''Startup Asia'' (Wiley).
Researchers at the Stanford Program on Regions of Innovation and Entrepreneurship recently mapped the investment activity of 769 firms investing in 2,203 Chinese companies and found patterns reminiscent of Silicon Valley.
''You have lead individuals and firms that have established beachheads of success and power,'' said Marguerite Gong Hancock, a professor at the Stanford Graduate School of Business, who directed the study. ''They are the same firms that were successful in Silicon Valley that have transplanted their expertise to China.''
The similarities to Silicon Valley can be eerie. ''All the symptoms of a bubble are here,'' said Anne Stevenson-Yang, co-director of J Capital Research, a technology investment research firm in Beijing. ''It's an unsettling instability.''
At the same time, there is a consensus that China's entrepreneurs have a workaholic culture that is unmatched anywhere in the world.
''What I found in doing five startups in China is the culture makes Silicon Valley look laid-back and slow,'' said Tom Melcher, an entrepreneur who left California a decade ago to move to Beijing. ''In Beijing, if you want to find a chief executive at 7:30 p.m. on a Friday, it's guaranteed you will find him at the office.''
Not every China specialist buys such comparisons.
''When we look at China through the lens of American decline, we see the Chinese ascendancy, we see the modern skylines and the fastest computers and the new airports, and we see an invincible force building,'' said Orville Schell, director of the Center on U.S.-China Relations at the Asia Society. ''Through Chinese eyes it looks tremendously uncertain and provisional. They are not filled with self-confidence.''
But Mr. McGovern, the investor and venture capitalist, thinks that may be an advantage. In the United States, he says, he is often approached by overconfident entrepreneurs who walk off in a huff when he is less than impressed by their ideas.
The Chinese entrepreneurs he deals with are different.
''They will come to me and show me their language-translation software that will convert Mandarin to English and back again,'' he said. ''Then I will tell them that I don't think there is a market because it is too difficult to protect the intellectual property.''
Rather than send them away, however, he might ask them if they would be interested in working on a different idea that his firm has been considering.
''They will respond, 'Can I get rich?' When I tell them that I think that there is a good chance, they say, 'O.K., I'll do it!' ''

HEADLINE: As the Republican Race Heats Up

 BODY:
To the Editor:
Re ''Newt's War on Poor Children,'' by Charles M. Blow (column, Dec. 3):
Newt Gingrich's recent attack on poor children and their families is typical of the Republican attitude toward minorities and the less fortunate. In campaign appearances Mr. Gingrich called child labor laws ''stupid'' and said, ''Really poor children in really poor neighborhoods have no habits of working and have nobody around them who works.''
To actually call for poor children to work because no one else in their family is working is racially tinged and shows how far out of touch with real people he is. If this type of ignorance doesn't doom his attempt to become president, then there is something drastically wrong with the majority of the people of this country. 
DAVE WALKER Dartmouth, Mass., Dec. 4, 2011
To the Editor:
As a public school teacher in the nation's capital, I would say that the poor children I know often work much harder than their more affluent contemporaries. Unlike the wealthy children who typically are ferried around to school and activities in style, many poor children rise early in the morning, help care for younger siblings and navigate complicated public transportation systems to arrive at school on time.
After school many of the students then take public transportation to part-time jobs, arriving home in time to cook dinner for younger siblings and tackle their homework on their own while their parents work one or two jobs.
Newt Gingrich should be ashamed of himself for using these vulnerable children for an uninformed attention grab.
LINDA RYDEN Washington, Dec. 3, 2011
To the Editor:
After all the news articles that call Newt Gingrich professorial, scholarly and intellectual, the Dec. 4 columns by Maureen Dowd (''Out of Africa and Into Iowa'') and Frank Bruni (''And Now ...Professor Gingrich'') have finally started us on the road to reality.
Professorial? Mr. Bruni has it right when he calls Mr. Gingrich a bloviator. Scholarly? Ms. Dowd has it right when she dissects his writings and finds his ideas at best confused. Intellectual? Only when compared with Sarah Palin, Michele Bachmann and Rick Perry.
JERRY V. TOBIAS Ledyard, Conn., Dec. 4, 2011
To the Editor:
Re ''Send In the Clueless'' (column, Dec. 5):
Paul Krugman is correct in asserting that Mitt Romney's strategy ''is to pretend that he shares the ignorance and misconceptions of the Republican base'' because that's what it will take to win in enough primaries and caucuses to secure his party's nomination.
When (and if) that happens, he will begin to espouse ideas and policies that reflect an understanding of what the important issues are and realistic ways of dealing with them, as he demonstrated when he was governor of Massachusetts. In other words, the strategy will then shift away from appealing to the narrow-minded Republican die-hards and toward the independent voters who will determine who the next president will be. That's just the simple and cynical way in which the game is played.
JERRY RAPP New York, Dec. 5, 2011
To the Editor:
Paul Krugman asks, ''And what will happen then?'' if a flawed Republican candidate is elected president. Permit me the luxury of answering a rhetorical question. Pragmatic concerns will dictate economic policy, and the inherent self-healing tendencies of the business cycle will get the economy going.
The public, with pragmatic views and short memories, will credit whoever then occupies the White House, regardless of past campaign statements, and acclaim him or her an economic genius.

HEADLINE: Pakistan Fans the Flames

 BODY:
Pakistan is refusing to help calm public fury -- or help figure out what led to a NATO attack that left 24 Pakistani soldiers dead. It has rejected American entreaties to participate in a joint investigation. On Monday, it boycotted an international conference in Bonn that laid plans for Afghanistan's future. Both moves are self-defeating. 
If there is any chance of salvaging a working relationship, Washington and Islamabad must establish what went wrong along the border and work together to ensure that it does not happen again. The Pentagon has promised a transparent inquiry -- it must deliver one -- and officials say they can compensate for Pakistan's lack of cooperation by using phone conversations, e-mail exchanges and surveillance images. But without Islamabad's participation, the Pakistani public will never find the results credible.
The two sides have radically different versions of what went awry during an Afghan-American operation against a Taliban training camp. The Americans say they were fired on first and cleared the strikes with Pakistani Army officers. The Pakistanis say that NATO gave the wrong coordinates for the strikes and that their forces fired only after the attacks began.
The United States needs Pakistan's cooperation -- as grudging and duplicitous as it is. Islamabad controls supply routes for American troops in Afghanistan (they were closed in retaliation for the attack), and it is essential to negotiations with the Taliban. Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton and Defense Secretary Leon Panetta quickly offered condolences. President Obama waited eight days to overrule Pentagon concerns and telephone President Asif Ali Zardari of Pakistan to say the deaths were regrettable and accidental. We share frustrations over Pakistan, but that delay further fueled the crisis.
Pakistan needs American aid and help to hold off the extremists -- a fact no Pakistani leader has the courage to admit. Their behavior in recent days has become even more irresponsible. Gen. Ashfaq Parvez Kayani, the chief of the Pakistani Army, made things more dangerous by giving his border troops the green light to return fire without asking for permission beforehand.
Pakistan's refusal to attend the Bonn conference was misguided. The meeting, attended by dozens of countries and organizations, worked on a political and economic strategy to ensure Afghan stability after NATO troops draw down. Pakistan has a strong strategic and economic interest in Afghanistan's future. With its boycott, it has denied itself a voice and increased its own isolation.

HEADLINE: Aid Agencies In Afghanistan Fear Reversals

BYLINE: By ROD NORDLAND

 BODY:
KABUL, Afghanistan -- Even as President Hamid Karzai beseeched nations at a conference in Germany on Monday to continue aid to Afghanistan for another decade, the American withdrawal from Afghanistan is already being felt among civilian aid workers, raising anxieties that Afghanistan will be abandoned and that the hard-earned development gains will be reversed.
The United States, which provides two-thirds of all development assistance in Afghanistan, slashed its $4 billion aid budget to $2 billion in the 2011 fiscal year, which ended on Sept. 30. The budget for 2012, being considered in Congress, may be cut further.
CARE, which is deeply involved in setting up schools and improving life for Afghan women, has lost 80 percent of its budget here. As a result, it has had to lay off 400 of its 900 employees in Afghanistan, only a tenth of whom are non-Afghan staff members, according to the group's country director, Brian Cavanagh. Other American-based charities that are suffering steep cuts are Mercy Corps and the International Rescue Committee. 
So far the $2 billion decrease in aid over the past year has not resulted in cutbacks of continuing programs, according to a senior American official, because unspent money from previous years is still available, cushioning the blow.
And some aid workers say the cutbacks may not turn out to be devastating, at least in the short run, because some agencies had been unable to spend money quickly when large new amounts of aid came pouring in over recent years. Some Western donors have also indicated misgivings about the Afghan government's ability to spend aid money efficiently and without corruption.
But the recent cutbacks at a number of charities have struck a nerve here and raised concerns about the long-term implications, especially because aid work has always been emphasized as a critical part of the Americans' long-term counterinsurgency strategy. The timing has only exacerbated those worries, coming as the American troop withdrawal has gotten under way: 10,000 troops are due to withdraw by the end of December, and 4,000 of those have already left, according to a senior NATO official.
''There is a fear that all this could be cut and Afghanistan could be left alone as it was in the '90s, which will have very bad consequences this time,'' said Hashim Mayar, a special adviser to the Agency Coordinating Body for Afghan Relief, which represents many of the major relief groups in Afghanistan. ''What we have gained should not be lost.''
Programs that have closed this year were already coming to the end of their contracts, the American official said. The aid groups disputed that, however, saying they had hoped to renew them.
''Our hope is that what we will be able to do is continue on what we call a soft-landing approach, a gradual decline over time,'' the official said, speaking anonymously in line with his agency's policy. ''We'll see what comes forth from the Congressional process.''
CARE's biggest loss was the shutdown of an education program it ran in remote areas for 21,000 boys and girls; hundreds of small schools were closed, with 5,000 students, mostly girls, unable to find alternatives, said Jennifer Rowell, head of advocacy for CARE here. Some of the schools were turned over to the Afghan Ministry of Education, but it could not take all of them. Girls are less likely to be allowed to travel long distances to another school.
Mercy Corps, another major American-based aid organization, has had a $32 million ''Cash for Work'' program in northern Afghanistan brought to an end. And the International Rescue Committee's budget for Afghanistan next year is only $9.5 million, compared with $18 million last year, although the agency is still hopeful it can cover the shortfall.
All are troubling losses in a country where rampant unemployment, especially in more remote areas, is seen as a real security risk.
''Aid is decreasing very rapidly and markedly,'' said the International Rescue Committee's country director, Nigel Jenkins. ''We're trying to move to areas where money is still available.'' That would mean, for instance, starting projects in more dangerous parts of Afghanistan, like Kandahar and Helmand Provinces in the south, rather than other poorer areas, he said.
Aid cutbacks come as Afghanistan has instituted the second stage of its transition plan, taking over responsibility for security in 24 provinces or cities, areas accounting for half the country's population. In theory, that is meant to make it possible for the United States and its coalition partners to begin stepping up their withdrawal of forces, which is meant to be completed by 2014.
Ashraf Ghani, the Afghan government's transition chief, has said it hopes to see a ''transition dividend,'' in which those countries that benefit by reducing their military spending would return part of that savings to Afghanistan by increasing aid for reconstruction and development.
At a time of economic crisis in Europe and America, that may prove politically unpopular.
Many aid groups, even those hard hit by the cutbacks, are not sure they are devastating losses, at least in the short term. In an effort to use aid money to help the military's counterinsurgency strategy, money sometimes poured in faster than it could be spent. Now, at least, many hope it will be spent more effectively.
''Within the aid community there's a general feeling that less could actually be better, because the amount of money poured into Afghanistan is absolutely ridiculous and not sustainable,'' Mr. Jenkins said. ''Last year there were huge amounts of development money, but there is no question that not much of that has trickled down to those who were in need.''
Referring to nongovernmental organizations, Mercy Corps' departing director for Afghanistan, Christine Mulligan, said: ''You can do more with less. Will you see a lot of NGOs lamenting the budget cuts? Maybe not. That two billion was almost like new money, and it was all about the burn rate, how much they could spend and how quickly, not what they could do for people.''
American officials and many traditional nongovernmental groups have been at odds in recent years over the American strategy of concentrating development aid in conflict areas, as an avowed part of the military's counterinsurgency strategy. Some derided it as the ''weaponization of aid,'' and many charitable groups refused to take on projects in conflict areas, leading to an American reliance on mostly for-profit private contractors.
''While we were looking at needs, they were looking at how much money they could get out of it,'' Mr. Jenkins said.
A report in June by the Senate Foreign Relations Committee noted that 81 percent of the United States Agency for International Development budget in the 2011 fiscal year was spent in southern and eastern Afghanistan, where the insurgency was strongest and the American troop presence greatest, while poverty and lack of development has been worse elsewhere.
''What we say is that really development and security must go hand in hand,'' the American official said. ''I understand that there's concern about things such as weaponization of development or whatnot, but we would posit that really the two need to go hand in hand.''
The large outlays of the past two years, however, were aimed at stabilization, a term the military uses to mean rapid-fix projects intended to undermine insurgents and deliver local government services, for instance. Future aid programs will go beyond that, the official said, focusing on sustainable efforts to set up and improve Afghan institutions.
While some aid workers may welcome that shift in focus, many Afghan officials are deeply worried. ''People think they will keep cutting and then desert us,'' said Sayed Habib Ahmadi, the Afghan head of the Joint Coordinating and Monitoring Board, which brings Afghan and global officials together to discuss aid priorities.
Already, Afghan officials complain that, as Mr. Ahmadi put it, ''the main problem is that international donors have not delivered what they've pledged.'' Western donors, however, say that pledged money is still available, but the Afghan government lacks the capacity to spend it efficiently and free of corruption. The result is that of budgeted American relief aid, only 18 percent to 20 percent has actually been spent over all, American officials say, with the rest still in the ''pipeline.''
While that has a cushioning effect, it is also true that most aid programs in Afghanistan now operate with money from a few donor countries and agencies, rather than broad-based contributions from individuals and foundations. Many fear that as troop commitments fall, so will nonmilitary-aid commitments.
Total foreign aid to Afghanistan in 2010 was equal to the country's entire gross domestic product, $15.7 billion, which the World Bank said in a recent report ''cannot be sustained.'' By 2018, the report predicted, 90 percent of that aid will be gone.

HEADLINE: After Faulting a Tax Cut, Romney Calls for Extension

BYLINE: By ASHLEY PARKER

 BODY:
11:25 p.m. Updated On Monday, Mitt Romney embraced one of President Obama's signature proposals - another one-year extension of a cut in payroll taxes, after just weeks ago deriding the idea as ''little Band-Aids'' that offered only a temporary fix.
''I would like to see the payroll tax cut extended just because I know that working families are really feeling the pinch right now - middle-class Americans are having a hard time,'' Mr. Romney said Monday on Michael Medved's conservative radio talk show. 
Newt Gingrich, currently Mr. Romney's main rival for the nomination, said months ago that he favored an extension.
Though Mr. Romney's remarks represented a shift in tone on the payroll tax cut, he had never specifically opposed extending the tax breaks, instead arguing that Mr. Obama's proposal was a temporary fix rather than a long-term solution.
''Mitt has never met a tax cut he doesn't like, but we're going to need more permanent job creating incentives in order to turn around the economy,'' said Andrea Saul, a spokeswoman for the campaign.
In an interview with the Nashua Telegraph editorial board in November, Mr. Romney said that while Mr. Obama was offering ''small bore'' solutions ''around the edges'' of the economy, he didn't necessarily disagree with the president when it came to the payroll tax cut.
''Extending the payroll tax holiday for a little longer is a positive thing,'' Mr. Romney said. ''We're going to extend the payroll tax - the lower payroll tax -- for a little while. Fine, these are tough times. I don't want to raise taxes on anybody. But those modest proposals are not going to get America's economy going again, or return to America the level of competitiveness that will allow us to out-compete anyone in the world.''
At a debate in October, however, Mr. Romney disagreed with the underlying premise of the president's payroll tax break.
''I don't want temporary little Band-Aids,'' Mr. Romney said. ''I want to fundamentally restructure America's foundation economically.''
Earlier in his answer, he also explained, ''No one likes to see tax increases.'' But Mr. Romney was taking a nuanced position likely to be exploited by his rivals - both Democratic and Republican - who are always eager to paint him as a shape-shifter, especially now that he has come out in favor of the tax cut he previously hedged on.
''Now that public support has increased for an extension of the payroll tax cut, Mitt Romney is jumping on the bandwagon once again to support a plan he previously opposed - demeaning it as nothing more than a 'temporary little Band-Aid,''' wrote the Democratic National Committee, in a press release. ''Mitt Romney changes his positions with the political wind and as today's wind blows toward more public support of President Obama's plan to extend the payroll tax cut for millions of middle class Americans, Mitt Romney's support blows with it.''
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

HEADLINE: With a Little Help, East London Embraces Tech Industry

BYLINE: By MARK SCOTT

 BODY:
LONDON - When Eventbrite, a San Francisco-based start-up that sells tickets online, decided to open its first international office, the founders turned to the East End of London.
The British capital offered a thriving music and theater scene, a large work force of young, multilingual college graduates and easy access to both the Asian and North American markets. In October, the technology company moved into a converted jewelry workshop in Saffron Hill, a district that was notorious for crime in the 19th century and inspired Fagin's Den in ''Oliver Twist.''
''London will be our hub for the rest of Europe,'' said Renaud Visage, a co-founder of Eventbrite who splits his time among the Bay Area, London and Paris. ''It's a natural progression for U.S. start-ups to move to the U.K., then expand further afield.'' 
Once a rundown area dominated by derelict warehouses and manufacturing sites, East London has emerged as a miniversion of Silicon Valley, attracting hundreds of technology and new media start-ups.
Rundown greasy spoons have been replaced by hipster coffeehouses that serve $6 macchiatos to trendy customers in their 20s. Local pubs like The Queen of Hoxton and Commercial Tavern now stock high-end European microbrews. Amid the revitalization, the price of office space has jumped as much as 50 percent at some buildings.
''All the start-ups out here are forming our own little community,'' said Paul Brine, chief marketing officer for the Web site FarFetch, which provides an online marketplace for high-end European and North American fashion boutiques. ''It helps to have a support network as we're all working towards the same goal.''
The local industry is getting a helping hand from the British government. Last year, Prime Minister David Cameron announced a $23 million investment fund to attract technology entrepreneurs to East London, which the government calls Tech City.
Officials also created an entrepreneurial visa to fast-track immigration approval for non-Europeans interested in starting businesses in Britain, and announced $312 million of equity finance for fast-growing homegrown technology companies.
''Our role is to make sure the right infrastructure is in place to help the tech cluster grow,'' said Eric Van Der Kleij, the British government's ''entrepreneur in residence,'' who oversees the state-backed Tech City Investment Organization. ''My target is to set a date to close our organization because the private sector is doing so well.''
The government's strategy is starting to pay off. London-based companies attracted $433 million of venture capital in the first nine months of 2011, according to the data provider Dow Jones VentureSource. That is a 25 percent increase over the same period last year and the largest amount raised since the beginning of the recent recession.
The city has also been gaining ground on Britain's most established start-up cluster, in Cambridge, which has fed off its university to churn out successful tech companies like the chip designer ARM Holdings and the business software company Autonomy.
''U.S. investors are paying increased attention to what's going on in London,'' said David Hornik, a partner at the Silicon Valley venture capitalist firm August Capital, during a recent trip to Britain. ''There's huge interest from companies over here to be funded by established American V.C.'s.''
Silicon Valley stalwarts are considering East London, too. In September, Google announced plans to open a seven-story office building in the heart of East London. The company will use the space to run workshops, show off new products and provide office space for organizations that support local start-ups. Intel is building a computer research lab in the area, and Cisco Systems has pledged $500 million of investment over the next five years, including the construction of an innovation center at the site of the 2012 Olympic Games.
Despite London's vibrant start-up community, the city still lacks many basics that help to fuel entrepreneurial activity. Mr. Brine of FarFetch said the company had to beg to break its lease when it outgrew its current warehouse office. Eventually, the property owner agreed to shorten the contract.
Bullseyehub, a Web site that helps event organizers promote their shows online, had trouble finding qualified developers and engineers in London as it grew from five people to a team of 28 in less than a year. To fill the gap, they had to recruit a product manager from Silicon Valley with experience in scaling up small tech companies.
''London is a fantastic place to run a business, but there's a shortage of people who have been in successful start-ups,'' said Alex Will, 28, a founder of the company, whose revenue now exceeds $1.5 million.
Britain's technology infrastructure also may dampen East London's growth. The country ranks 25th for Internet broadband speeds, according to the Web infrastructure company Akamai. That places Britain - the world's sixth-largest economy - behind countries like Romania and Latvia.
And even though the country's new entrepreneurial visa has helped to attract entrepreneurs to London, the system can be too inflexible to entice the best talent, according to Reshma Sohoni, a United States-born partner in Seedcamp, an investment firm that finances early-stage companies.
To qualify for a visa, entrepreneurs must have at least $78,000 in financing in place from registered venture capitalists or the British government. Ms. Sohoni said the Australian co-founder of a start-up that she backed was turned away because he had raised only $70,000.
''The government needs to focus on getting the infrastructure right,'' she said. ''East London is getting traction with investors. Now we need start-up success stories to convince them to stay.''
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

HEADLINE: Task Force Says BP Oil Spill Fines Should Go to Gulf Restoration

BYLINE: By LESLIE KAUFMAN; Clifford Krauss contributed reporting.

 BODY:
A Gulf Coast task force appointed by President Obama recommended on Monday that a ''significant portion'' of the billions of dollars in fines that BP is expected to pay for last year's Deepwater Horizon oil spill go to ecological restoration. 
Issuing its final recommendations, the federal-state task force said that a permanent panel should be created to champion and coordinate actions like limiting excess nutrients flowing into the Gulf of Mexico from farm states along the Mississippi. It recommended that river engineers put freshwater and sediment flows on an equal footing with issues like flood control.
The recommendations of the task force, which was created by Mr. Obama in the aftermath of the oil-well blowout in 2010, were similar to those in a draft report it issued in October and are not binding.
Under federal law, any civil penalties paid by BP under the Clean Water Act are to go to an oil spill liability trust fund with limited capacity to do restoration.
Legislation being considered in Congress would allocate at least 80 percent of the possible Clean Water penalties to gulf restoration but would define restoration efforts in the broadest terms. One version, to be reviewed Wednesday in a House committee meeting, calls for a new joint federal-state council for ecological restoration to direct or influence the flow of 60 percent of the money.
A full 35 percent would go directly to states to be used at their discretion, including for the purpose of economic restoration like rebuilding boardwalks or a convention center. Five percent would be available for research.
The explosion and blowout on a BP oil rig in April 20, 2010, killed 11 people and caused nearly five million barrels of crude to flow into the gulf, the largest oil spill in the nation's history.
Melanie Driscoll, director of bird conservation in the Gulf of Mexico for the National Audubon Society, emphasized that the ability to do large-scale ecosystem restoration would be ''totally dependent on funding.''
''This is a good first step,'' she said of the task force's recommendations. ''But this is just a strategy document.''
Along with the uncertainty surrounding Congressional action, the extent of the fines BP and other companies will pay is still not settled. Penalties could range as high as $5.4 billion or even $21 billion depending on whether they are found guilty of simple negligence or gross negligence.
The companies, meanwhile, are maneuvering to shift responsibility for the blowout and spill. On Monday, BP accused Halliburton, an oil drilling services contractor, of deliberately destroying evidence that showed that the cement Halliburton produced to secure the Macondo well was unstable.
In a filing in federal court in New Orleans, BP said that Halliburton had refused to turn over internal test results. It suggested that the company had also destroyed computer data ''because it wanted to eliminate any risk that this evidence would be used against it at trial.''
Halliburton said in a statement that it was reviewing the filing but did not believe that it had merit.

HEADLINE: Wal-Mart Debate Rages in India

BYLINE: By VIKAS BAJAJ

 BODY:
JALANDHAR, India -- For multinational merchants like Wal-Mart, it seemed to be the long-awaited opportunity to jump into India with both feet. But on Monday that moment appeared to be delayed once again.
Late last month, as part of a push to modernize his nation's notoriously inefficient retail economy, Prime Minister Manmohan Singh announced that for the first time big foreign companies like Wal-Mart and the British company Tesco could open retail stores in India.
Until now, foreign companies have been restricted to serving only as wholesalers in India. That has already helped create more modern distribution networks, often while generating better prices for farmers and other producers, and giving customers better deals, too.
But expanding the foreign presence to retailing has been seen as the necessary next step for modernists like Mr. Singh, who has been urging the move for years. Praise for his announcement came from India's corporations and some of its 175 million farmers, who see the move as part of a wave of changes that might help jolt a slowing economy. 
And opponents -- representing the 34 million people who work in retail and wholesale businesses, as well as left-leaning politicians -- were just as loud.
On Monday, leaders of two opposition parties said Mr. Singh's finance minister, Pranab Mukherjee, had agreed to a delay. Mr. Mukherjee is expected to make a statement in Parliament on Wednesday.
All of this places Wal-Mart in a position hardly new to the company: at the center of a raging debate that pits the multinational giant from Bentonville, Ark., against local mom-and-pop businesses.
For more than a year, Wal-Mart has been operating a wholesale outlet in this northern city known for its fertile farms and hearty food. Local businessmen like Ravi Mahajan, whose family has had a wholesale general store in the narrow alleys of the Imam Nasir market for 40 years, say their sales have been cut in half as their customers -- retail shopkeepers -- stock up at Wal-Mart.
If the government eventually lets foreign firms expand beyond wholesaling to open retail stores, Mr. Mahajan said, many of his retail customers would be forced out of business, while squeezing out traders like himself who have long served as the crucial middleman in Indian commerce.
''We'll be destroyed,'' Mr. Mahajan said last week, minutes after he and dozens of other traders burned an effigy with a bloated belly and a crudely drawn face, meant to represent multinational marauders.
But Indian business is far from united in opposing foreign retailers.
Farmers like Avtar Singh Sidhu, who sells potatoes to PepsiCo for its Lays chips and has sold baby corn and other vegetables to Wal-Mart's local partner, the Indian conglomerate Bharti, argues that foreign retailers will be a boon to India's struggling agricultural sector. The multinationals, he said, will buy directly from farmers and pay better prices than local wholesalers.
Already, he said, PepsiCo is offering 6 rupees per kilo (or 11 cents) for his potatoes, while local traders offer only 3 rupees (6 cents). ''We need more competition,'' Mr. Sidhu said.
Policy makers are looking for ways to stimulate economic growth, which fell to an annual pace of 6.9 percent in the three months that ended in September. It was the first time India's growth rate had fallen below 7 percent in two years.
The announcement by Mr. Singh's administration on Nov. 24 called for allowing foreign companies like Wal-Mart to team up with Indian partners to open retail stores in metropolitan areas with more than one million people. Jalandhar has 2.1 million people.
The plan ran counter to the views of many politicians who say a slower approach is needed to protect indigenous firms and the rural poor.
But Mr. Singh and his backers have argued that foreign retailers could help reduce chronically high food inflation -- which has run around 10 percent for the last year, on top of 20 percent increases the year before. The retail proposal, proponents say, could improve the lot of the more than a half billion Indians still tied to the land, by improving the supply system from farms to consumers. An estimated one-third of some types of vegetables and fruits rot before ever reaching retail shelves.
Speaking of the Nov. 24 announcement, an adviser to Mr. Singh, Raghuram Rajan, an economist at the University of Chicago, said, ''This is a bold move, and I think this is a necessary move.''
At present, barely 6 percent of India's $470 billion in retail sales takes place in organized retail stores, according to Technopak, a Indian consulting firm. The rest takes place in small shops. By contrast, organized retail makes up more than 20 percent of sales in China and 36 percent in Brazil -- the two emerging economies to which India most frequently compares itself. (The figure is 85 percent in the United States.)
For decades, Indian regulations and the country's weak infrastructure have favored small shopkeepers. Foreigners, since 1997, have been allowed to participate only in wholesale trading -- a segment in which indigenous operators have historically thrived.
In some cases, the government has granted these traders monopolies. Many Indian states, for instance, require farmers and retailers to sell and buy fruits and vegetables only through wholesale markets controlled by committees of traders.
But Wal-Mart's experience here in the state of Punjab, one of India's richest and long the country's bread basket, provides a glimpse at what could lie ahead for the Indian retail sector.
Two years ago, the company started opening Indian wholesale stores called Best Price, that can sell only to retailers, hotels, restaurants and other businesses. The stores are owned jointly by Wal-Mart and Bharti in a partnership that has four wholesale stores in Punjab, among its 15 total in the country.
Raj Jain, president of Wal-Mart India, said that the partners were now expanding in India's south and west and that Wal-Mart and Bharti had begun discussing plans for a new retail strategy that, he said, would be announced in the ''next few months.'' But it will depend on what government officials say on Wednesday to Parliament.
Wal-Mart, which does not disclose its revenue in India, had about 4,000 employees in the country as of August. The Jalandhar store, which opened in August 2010, looks and feels like Wal-Mart's American outlets, with broad aisles stacked high with merchandise.
Rajat Agarwal, who runs his family's grocery store on a busy market street nearby, said he had come to rely on Best Price because it almost always had the products he sold at his store. Often, he said, traditional wholesalers run out of the most popular brands like Sunsilk shampoo and Aashirvad wheat flour.
Prices also tend to be consistent at Best Price, in contrast to the constant jockeying by the local wholesalers who offer deep discounts when they have too much supply and then push up prices when they are running low.
And yet, Mr. Agarwal complains that the Best Price store has also effectively become a competitor. That is because anybody with a valid business registration can buy from it, and the store has 50,000 member-customers. As a result, in addition to buying supplies for their businesses, many people end up doing their household shopping there, too.
Loading a large consignment of supplies at Best Price one day last week, Mr. Agarwal complained, ''This is not a wholesale store.'' Instead of being able to buy single items, as at a retail store, he said they should be required to buy wholesale quantities. ''They should have to buy six or 12,'' he said.
Sumit Gupta, the Best Price store's manager, said there was little he could do to prevent its members from buying whatever they wanted, as long as they could show that they were registered business owners. The company stocks individual packets of many things, he said, because small retailers demand the option to buy in small quantities.
For now, Mr. Agarwal straddles two commercial worlds.
The morning after stocking up at Best Price, his own shop, Kwality Super Store, was buzzing with customers. Mr. Agarwal and his father, Anil, stood behind the counter. As in most Indian stores, there was no cash register. Mr. Agarwal asked customers to call out the items they were buying, and he hand-tallied the totals on small slips of paper.
One customer, Bhupinder Singh, bought tea, soap, lentils and other supplies. He said he frequented Mr. Agarwal's shop -- but also the Easy Day retail outlet that Bharti has opened down the street.
Easy Day often has prices of up to 10 percent less on packaged goods like biscuits. But he sells the milk from his dairy to the Agarwals, and the family offers him credit on his groceries or offsets his purchases against what it owes him for milk.
Which store he visits, he said, ''depends on how I feel that day.''

HEADLINE: It's Tone, Not Taxes, Tycoon Says

BYLINE: By ANDREW ROSS SORKIN

 BODY:
Leon Cooperman, a 68-year-old Wall Street veteran, says he is for higher taxes on the wealthy. He'd happily give up his Social Security checks. He voted for Al Gore in 2000. He says the special treatment of investment gains, or so-called carried interest, for private equity and hedge fund managers is ''ridiculous.'' He says he even sympathizes, at least to some extent, with the Occupy Wall Street protesters.
And yet, Mr. Cooperman, a man with a rags-to-riches background who worked at Goldman Sachs for more than 25 years in the 1970s and 1980s before starting his own hedge fund, Omega Advisors, which has minted him an estimated $1.8 billion fortune, is waging a campaign against President Obama.
Last week, in a widely circulated ''open letter'' to President Obama that whizzed around e-mail inboxes of Wall Street and corporate America, Mr. Cooperman argued that ''the divisive, polarizing tone of your rhetoric is cleaving a widening gulf, at this point as much visceral as philosophical, between the downtrodden and those best positioned to help them.'' 
He went on to say, ''To frame the debate as one of rich-and-entitled versus poor-and-dispossessed is to both miss the point and further inflame an already incendiary environment.''
The letter comes as President Obama is planning to give a speech on Tuesday in Osawatomie, Kan., about the economy and the middle class, following in the path of President Theodore Roosevelt, who campaigned a century ago in that very city against the wealthy and big business.
Mr. Cooperman's complaint has less to do with the substance of taxing the wealthy than it does the president's choice of words in promoting it, an emphasis that he says is ''villainizing the American Dream.''
While many executives have complained about what they perceive as the president's antibusiness bent, Mr. Cooperman's letter has gained credibility and attention in political and business circles because of his own seemingly liberal stances on taxes and the like.
Mr. Cooperman, in an interview, said he had been deluged with hundreds of e-mails and phone calls about the letter, ''99.9 percent of it positive.''
''I came from nothing,'' he said, explaining how he grew up in the Bronx and went to P.S. 75. ''I have lived the American Dream. I don't want to be constantly attacked.''
He was quick to say that he did not write the letter ''on behalf of Wall Street.'' Indeed, Mr. Cooperman's view of the financial industry is dimmer than you might expect from someone who made his fortune in it. ''Wall Street screwed up,'' he said matter-of-factly. ''They did things they shouldn't have.''
He said he decided to write the president a letter because he became convinced that Mr. Obama was ''villainizing success.'' He added, ''We are supposed to admire success.''
Of course, his letter has not gone over well with some audiences - he has been called a ''whiner'' and worse. On Daily Kos, a left-leaning commentary site, one member wrote: ''He simply embarrasses himself with this rant, and seems more interested in complaining about the points Obama is making that aren't in his personal economic interests than in providing any real solutions to our problems.''
Mr. Cooperman acknowledged that he had received at least one negative e-mail. ''I got one that said, 'Be very careful when you start you car in the morning because there might be a bomb in it.' '' He tried to laugh it off.
Some critics of Mr. Cooperman's letter say President Obama has not been hard enough on big business and questioned what it was that the president has said that has drawn the ire of the business community.
''What pushed me over the fence was the president's dialogue over the debt ceiling,'' Mr. Cooperman said, explaining that just when it seemed like a compromise was near, President Obama went on national television and pressed harder on ''millionaires and billionaires,'' a phrase that has stuck in the craw of many of the elite. For example, Mr. Cooperman zeroed in on what he described as the president's belittling remarks about taxing the wealthy: ''If you are a wealthy C.E.O. or hedge fund manager in America right now, your taxes are lower than they have ever been. They are lower than they have been since the 1950s. And they can afford it,'' the president said back in June. ''You can still ride on your corporate jet. You're just going to have to pay a little more.''
The president's tone can be debated. Some people would argue it is simply factual, others contend that it is dripping with derision.
Mr. Cooperman acknowledges that, in the debt ceiling debate this summer, it was as much the fault of Republicans and House Speaker John Boehner's inability to gain support for a compromise as it was the Democrats that a deal did not get done. And Mr. Cooperman accepts that taxes are indeed at record lows.
But he says the president could do a better job of pressing for higher taxes on the rich without ''the sense that we're bad people.'' He added, ''I pay federal income tax. I don't have any tax dodges.'' He paused, before saying, ''Most people I know are prepared to pay more in taxes as long as it's spent intelligently.''
He added that he understood the politics of what he called ''class warfare.'' ''Now, I am not naive. I understand that in today's America, this is how the business of governing typically gets done - a situation that, given the gravity of our problems, is as deplorable as it is seemingly ineluctable.''
Mr. Cooperman said he personally had been advocating adding a 10 percent tax surcharge on all incomes over $500,000 for the next three years. He also advocates that the military ''get out of Iraq and Afghanistan'' and that every soldier should be ''given a free four-year education.'' His personal ''platform'' - he insists he is not running for any office - also includes setting up a peacetime Works Progress Administration to rebuild United States infrastructure; freezing entitlements; raising the Social Security retirement age for full benefits to 70 ''with an exception for those that work at hard labor''; adding a 5 percent value-added sales tax; and ''tackling health care in a serious way,'' among other things.
Mr. Cooperman, who recently signed the Giving Pledge, Bill Gates's and Warren Buffett's effort to press the world's billionaires to give away at least half of their wealth, said he felt he came into his money honestly and said proudly, ''I spend more than 25 times on charity what I spend on myself.'' Asked whether he had received any response from the president for his letter, he replied with a chuckle, ''I'm not optimistic I'll hear from him.''
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

HEADLINE: Mr. Romney's Missing Details

 BODY:
The biggest whopper in Mitt Romney's fiscal plan comes right at the beginning of the description on his Web site: ''We will level with the American people about what it will take to truly cut spending and balance our budget.'' Actually, Mr. Romney never tells voters the full cost of his plan to balance the budget while cutting taxes: popular programs would be slashed or eliminated, vital state and local services would disappear, misery would be inflicted on the poor and the working class.
Such details would make the plan a hard sell as he runs for the Republican presidential nomination, so Mr. Romney presents it as a breeze, with little pain attached. Just cap spending, make the Bush tax cuts permanent and eliminate the estate tax, raise the retirement age for Social Security, and offer some lower-cost Medicare options. Before you know it, economic growth will return to 4 percent a year and military cuts can be called off. 
At no point does Mr. Romney deal with what every reliable budget projection concludes: Without new revenue it will be impossible to cope with an aging population and infrastructure or with the needs of those who are being left behind as the income gap widens.
Details are in short supply. For example, his plan supports passage of the 10-year House budget resolution written by Paul Ryan, with a hard cap on spending at 20 percent of gross domestic product (compared with the current 24.3 percent), but it never says what the House plan contains. Here's a reminder: It would cut food stamps by $127 billion, which would remove millions of people from the rolls during a downturn and cut the benefits of those who remain. Nearly two-thirds of Mr. Ryan's cuts affect low-income programs like Pell grants, housing subsidies and Medicaid.
That's never mentioned by Mr. Romney, who instead talks about big cuts to tiny programs that are wildly unpopular with the party base, like the national endowments, family planning and foreign aid. Of course, he wants to repeal health care reform, which he claims would save $95 billion but would actually raise the deficit by $124 billion in just the first decade.
Mr. Romney's Medicaid plan would turn the program into a block grant that would simply shift costs to struggling states. Mr. Romney wants to cap the federal contribution at a level far less than the currently projected increase in costs and dump the difference on the states.
By his campaign's calculation, the block grant system would cut federal costs by more than $1 trillion between 2013 and 2021. Many states might have to restrict enrollments or benefits, scale back reimbursements to health care providers, or shift costs to poor beneficiaries.
Mr. Romney's plans for Medicare are too vague to evaluate. For workers not yet close to retirement, he would turn the existing Medicare program into a ''premium support'' system in which enrollees would be given fixed amounts of money to buy private health insurance or a version of traditional Medicare.
His campaign says beneficiaries would receive coverage ''at least as good'' as what seniors receive today. But the crucial question is how fast the premium support would be allowed to rise from year to year to keep up with increasing costs. Mr. Romney provides no clue about that.
A fiscal plan this hazy may be sufficient for primary voters. But if Mr. Romney becomes the nominee, he will have a great deal more leveling to do with the broader American electorate.

HEADLINE: Afghans Say Assistance Will Be Needed for Years

BYLINE: By STEVEN LEE MYERS and ROD NORDLAND; Steven Lee Myers reported from Bonn and Rod Nordland from Kabul, Afghanistan. Alissa J. Rubin contributed reporting from Kabul.

 BODY:
BONN, Germany -- As dozens of nations and organizations met here on Monday to plan a transition beyond the withdrawal of American and other international forces from Afghanistan in 2014, the Afghan government had a new deadline in mind: 2024.
President Hamid Karzai and other Afghan officials here called for political and military support for at least another decade -- and financial assistance that would not end until 2030. That would be nearly three decades after the terrorist attacks of Sept. 11 that led to the international intervention in Afghanistan. 
While Mr. Karzai and others celebrated the strides made in Afghanistan since the fall of the Taliban -- 60 percent of Afghans now have cellphones, he said, compared with none in 2001 -- the conference underscored the multiple challenges facing a government undermined by corruption and threatened by a tenacious insurgency.
''We will need your steadfast support for at least another decade,'' Mr. Karzai said, addressing leaders here at a conference held on the 10th anniversary, to the day, of talks in Bonn that established the political foundation for a new government in Afghanistan.
The conference, in the works for months, fell considerably short of the objectives that officials had envisioned. It had been viewed as a milestone that would cement progress in ending the war, both politically and militarily, and lay the groundwork for a self-sustaining Afghan government after 2014.
Instead, the mood was subdued, if not gloomy. The tempo of the war has shown little sign of winding down, despite an upbeat assessment from NATO commanders in October.
Efforts by the United States to negotiate a strategic agreement on relations with Afghanistan, like the one that now governs relations with Iraq, also have been complicated by a number of troublesome issues. Those include night raids by Special Forces and the transfer of prisoners to the custody of Afghans in spite of an abysmal record on treatment of detainees. The two countries cannot even agree on what to call the agreement.
Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton has touted the creation of a New Silk Road to knit together the nations of Central and South Asia by easing trade barriers and creating economic opportunities among Afghanistan's neighbors. And while the Bonn conference was intended to showcase the strategy, the most significant neighbor, Pakistan, refused to attend in protest over the American airstrikes that that killed 24 of its soldiers along the border last month.
President Obama and Mrs. Clinton pressed their Pakistani counterparts to reconsider their boycott in telephone calls over the week, to no avail.
''The entire region has a stake in Afghanistan's future and much to lose if the country again becomes a source of terrorism and instability,'' Mrs. Clinton told the delegates here, who included dozens of foreign ministers. ''And that is why we could, of course, have benefited from Pakistan's contribution to this conference.''
Another neighbor did attend: Iran. Its foreign minister, Ali Akbar Salehi, sat behind Mrs. Clinton as she spoke, though neither she nor other officials had any formal contact with the Iranians here. Mr. Karzai later teased Mrs. Clinton, saying the Iranians were ''your friends'' and that their speech had been kind.
(In fact, Mr. Salehi denounced the international military operation, though in perhaps milder terms than before. ''Certain Western countries seek to extend their military presence in Afghanistan beyond 2014 by maintaining their military bases there,'' he said, in remarks carried by Iran's official Islamic Republic News Agency. ''We deem such an approach to be contradictory to efforts to sustain stability and security in Afghanistan.'')
Ryan C. Crocker, the American ambassador to Afghanistan, accompanied Mrs. Clinton in her meeting with Mr. Karzai. He referred to Mr. Salehi's remarks, saying to Mr. Karzai, ''Mr. President, you call that kind?''
The conference, though far from Afghanistan, was, officially, led by Mr. Karzai's government. It was held in the former Parliament building of West Germany. Across the Rhine protesters erected shiny letters spelling ''End the War in Afghanistan.''
Mrs. Clinton, echoing several other ministers, reiterated the Obama administration's view that there was no purely military solution to the conflict. Still, new efforts to encourage reconciliation with the Taliban -- which also rely on Pakistani cooperation -- appear moribund, especially since the assassination in September of Burhanuddin Rabbani, a senior Afghan official leading the reconciliation process, by a suicide bomber posing as a Taliban peace emissary. Even though President Obama and other NATO leaders have created a timetable for withdrawal by 2014, many officials worry about security and the stability of Mr. Karzai's government once foreign troops leave. It could also have a devastating effect on Afghanistan's struggling economy, which has come to depend on NATO spending.
Mr. Karzai's government presented a paper at the conference, warning that the withdrawal could halve the country's gross domestic product.
It said the government needed $10 billion in 2015 to cover the shortfall. Just meeting the cost of Afghan military forces -- which by 2014 are expected to total 400,000 soldiers -- is estimated at $3.5 billion to $6 billion a year.
''Afghanistan's fiscal gap is significant,'' the paper said in what amounted to a plea for continued financial assistance, ''and unless it is addressed the good work of the past 10 years will come undone.''
The conference was not intended to solicit financial pledges from the nations attending, and none were offered, despite pleas from Mr. Karzai and other officials.
Mrs. Clinton did announce that the United States would once again resume payments to an Afghan reconstruction fund. Those payments, which amount to $650 million to $700 million a year, were halted after the International Monetary Fund raised questions about a scandal surrounding Kabul Bank, one of the country's largest financial institutions.
Speaker after speaker -- including Mr. Karzai -- described corruption and poor governance as obstacles to the country's development, factors that have caused reluctance among many countries about sending aid, especially given the economic crises in Europe and the United States.
''Billions of dollars have been spent in Afghanistan,'' Sayed Rahim Sattar, the head of the Afghan N.G.O.'s. Coordination Bureau, told Mrs. Clinton during a roundtable discussion with members of civic groups, ''but unfortunately, the expectations of the people have not been met.''

HEADLINE: Democrats In Senate Try Again On Tax Plan

BYLINE: By ROBERT PEAR and HELENE COOPER; Ashley Parker contributed reporting.

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- Senate Democrats said Monday that they would try for the fifth time in two months to raise taxes on top earners to pay for legislation that would reduce Social Security payroll taxes, as President Obama sought to keep Congressional Republicans on the defensive, asserting that their intransigence could cause a tax increase for tens of millions of American workers.
With Republican and Democratic leaders deadlocked over the issue in both chambers, two senators offered a bipartisan compromise that they said could help break the impasse before Congress adjourns for the year. 
The proposal, devised by Senators Susan Collins, Republican of Maine, and Claire McCaskill, Democrat of Missouri, would extend the current payroll tax cut for employees and reduce the employer's share of the payroll tax as well. It would also provide additional money for highways, bridges and other job-creating transportation projects.
It would offset the cost with a 2 percent surtax on income in excess of $1 million a year, but would carve out protection for many small-business owners who report business income on their personal tax returns.
''One of the primary objections to a surtax on very wealthy people has been its impact on small business,'' said Ms. Collins, the only Republican who crossed the aisle and voted to take up the Democrats' payroll tax bill last week. ''That concern resonated with me. The fact that we have been able, in a bipartisan way, to come up with a means of protecting small businesses is potentially a breakthrough.''
Mrs. McCaskill said the fact of a bipartisan agreement on the explosive issue of taxes was remarkable -- ''a huge part of the battle right now.''
Democrats have never gotten more than 51 votes for their job and tax proposals, 9 short of the number needed to overcome procedural hurdles in the Senate. But they have put Republicans on the defensive, casting them as responsible for the possibility of a tax increase that could affect 160 million workers in January.
Mr. Obama tried to emphasize the political advantage at a White House news conference, saying a typical family would see a tax increase of about $1,000 next year in the absence of action by Congress.
''When the Republicans took over the House at the beginning of this year, they explicitly changed the rules to say that tax cuts don't have to be paid for,'' Mr. Obama said, striking a consciously puzzled tone. ''So forgive me a little bit of confusion when I hear folks insisting on tax cuts being paid for.''
The Senate majority leader, Harry Reid of Nevada, and Senator Bob Casey of Pennsylvania unveiled the latest version of the Democrats' proposal on Monday.
Senate Democrats scrapped Mr. Obama's proposal to halve the payroll tax paid by employers. They kept his proposal to reduce the employee's share -- the tax paid by employees -- to 3.1 percent of wages, from the current 4.2 percent. If Congress does nothing, the rate will revert to 6.2 percent in January.
The price tag for the bill was reduced by about one-third, to $185 billion from $265 billion, under the Democratic measure rejected by the Senate last week.
Democrats would make up for most of the lost revenue by imposing a surtax of 1.9 percent, starting in 2013, on modified adjusted gross income in excess of $1 million.
Senator Jon Kyl of Arizona, the No. 2 Senate Republican, denounced Mr. Reid's proposal for its continuation of the payroll tax holiday.
''There's no evidence that this temporary tax cut has actually produced any new jobs, which is the whole idea,'' Mr. Kyl said, adding: ''The surtax is, in reality, a new tax that primarily hits small-business owners. That's who creates the jobs.''
The bill drafted by Ms. Collins and Mrs. McCaskill is meant to address that concern.
The future of the payroll tax cut is up in the air because of turmoil in Republican ranks. Mr. Kyl was one of 26 Republican senators who voted last week against a payroll tax cut bill drafted by party leaders. A similar proposal from House Republican leaders has encountered more resistance than expected from rank-and-file members of the party caucus.
The ''millionaires' tax,'' in any form, is a nonstarter with many Republicans in Congress.
But Jenni R. LeCompte, a spokeswoman for the Treasury Department, said the proposed surtax ''would affect only a very, very small number of small-business owners.''
''Only one percent of all small-business owners have adjusted gross income over $1 million and would be affected by this surcharge,'' Ms. LeCompte said, citing a new study by Treasury's Office of Tax Analysis.
The White House has decided that this is a week for the president to step up his campaign for an extension of the tax cut and jobless benefits, which begin to run out early next year for some of the long-term unemployed.

HEADLINE: Biden Treads Softly in Greece

BYLINE: By MARK LANDLER

 BODY:
ATHENS -- What do you do if you're a voluble American official whose words have been known to raise eyebrows, and you're visiting the epicenter of Europe's debt crisis at the start of a crucial week for the euro?
Speak little, and when you do, try to keep it light. 
On Monday, Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. introduced a member of his delegation to Greece's president, Karolos Papoulias. ''This man represents the Treasury Department,'' said a deadpan Mr. Biden. ''He's brought hundreds of millions of dollars.''
His Greek hosts, who knew full well that Mr. Biden brought no offers of American aid, dissolved into laughter.
Thus the vice president cleared the first hurdle of a day filled with many. His aides steered him away from opportunities to rattle European nerves as its leaders were immersed in delicate debt negotiations. A wreath-laying was canceled, and there were no news conferences or other public appearances.
Meeting with Greece's new prime minister, Lucas Papademos, Mr. Biden offered a staunch show of American moral support for the country's efforts to climb out of its debt hole. His interim government, formed last month amid the mounting economic crisis, is drafting an austerity budget and negotiating the latest bailout with its creditors.
''It is a difficult time for Greece, and we stand ready to help in any way we can,'' Mr. Biden said. ''It is overwhelmingly in the interest of the United States that Greece work its way through this financial crisis and remain a strong and vital part of the European Union.''
The vice president praised Greece's efforts to abide by the conditions of the International Monetary Fund and the European Union, whose bailout funds have come tied to stringent requirements that have infuriated many ordinary Greeks. He refrained from any comment on Europe's broader efforts to contain the crisis.
Mr. Papademos, a former central banker and an American-trained economist who taught at Columbia University, said he was confident that the ''U.S. will stand by it during these hard times.''
A question now is whether the International Monetary Fund, in which the United States is the largest shareholder, will play a bigger role in helping to stop the crisis from possibly spreading to Italy or Spain, where borrowing costs are also soaring.
In an interview on Sunday, Mr. Biden confirmed discussions about the fund's role, but said, ''That is not something it would be healthy or correct for me to speculate on as we go into this week.''
Mr. Biden has spoken at length on his eight-day trip about the American withdrawal from Iraq and the geopolitical landscape in the Middle East. But he turned almost Delphic when asked about Europe's crisis.
''Look, I'm going to choose my words here, because I don't want to -- '' he said, trailing off and staring for a long moment at the coffee table in his cabin on Air Force Two. ''For a guy who doesn't own any stock, I don't want the market responding to me.''
The atmosphere in Athens, where protests and strikes have mounted and occasionally turned violent, is less volatile now than it has been in recent months. Employees of the Greek state television service went on strike Monday, so the few images of Mr. Biden's visit were carried only on commercial television.
Mr. Biden noted that President Obama was sending Treasury Secretary Timothy F. Geithner to Europe this week, and that America's role in the crisis was better addressed by him.
''You know, in the good old days when I was a senator, I was my own man,'' Mr. Biden said. ''I could just tell you my views. But now whatever I say is attributed to the administration.''
''I finally learned that,'' the vice president added. ''It took me about six months, but I got it down.''

HEADLINE: Quadrennial Effect Could Make '12 a Very Good Year

BYLINE: By STUART ELLIOTT and AMY CHOZICK

 BODY:
IT sounds like the title of a thriller by Robert Ludlum: ''The Quadrennial Effect.'' Actually, it is something that may make 2012 less of a nail-biter for media and advertising companies.
The fact that several events that happen every four years will take place next year will stimulate the media and ad industries, leading forecasters said on Monday, offsetting the detrimental effects of the European debt crisis.
Events on the 2012 calendar likely to encourage more ad spending than this year include the United States presidential and Congressional elections, the Summer Olympic Games and the European Football (soccer) Championship. Another stimulus could come from Asia, the forecasters said, as the Japanese and Thai economies recover from natural disasters. 
''The strongest-ever quadrennial effect'' is likely next year, said Vincent Letang, executive vice president and director for global forecasting at the Magnaglobal unit of Mediabrands, part of the Interpublic Group of Companies.
Steve King, chief executive at the ZenithOptimedia division of the Publicis Groupe, said his prediction of a 4.7 percent increase in worldwide ad spending next year from 2011 would be cut to a gain of 3.1 percent without the quadrennial effect or the improving Japanese economy. Combined, those circumstances will add $7 billion to global ad spending in 2012, he said.
Likewise, Adam Smith, futures director at the GroupM unit of WPP, said his prediction of a 6.4 percent increase in worldwide ad spending next year compared with 2011 would fall to a gain of 5 percent without those benefits.
For all its power, the quadrennial effect can do only so much. All three forecasters said they reduced their estimates for worldwide ad growth in 2012 compared with their most recent previous predictions. They all blamed the problems in the euro zone for undercutting the confidence of marketers, some of which are reducing ad budgets as a precaution.
''I'm sitting in London,'' said Mr. Smith, who is based there, ''with gloom rolling in from the Continent.'' Mr. Letang said his forecast had ''four or five European countries in recession already,'' but assumed ''no defaults, no contagion.''
Mr. King said he calculated what would happen if ''two, three, key markets came out of the euro zone and defaulted,'' based on what took place after defaults in Argentina and Russia. It could take ad spending in Western Europe next year to minus 4 percent compared with 2011, he said, down from the current forecast for an increase of 2 percent.
Even so, worldwide ad spending would grow compared with last year, Mr. King said, by 3 percent rather than 4.7 percent. He called the exercise a worst-case hypothetical, adding that his forecast assumes ''the euro zone remains intact'' with ''no defaults.''
The forecasters spoke at the start of the 39th annual global media and communications conference, sponsored by UBS, in Midtown Manhattan. The conference, which continues through Wednesday, has more than 2,000 people registered for presentations by more than 90 companies.
The conference is occurring at a ''moment of enormous uncertainty,'' said Aryeh B. Bourkoff, vice chairman and head of investment banking for the Americas at UBS. In this environment, ''risk is not the four-letter word,'' he added. ''Uncertainty is the four-letter word.''
Michael I. Roth, chairman and chief executive of Interpublic, said Europe ''continues to be a concern to everyone'' and clients there ''are being cautious.''
'' 'Caution' is the right word,'' he said. ''It doesn't mean 'stop.' ''
''It stopped'' in 2008, he added, when the global financial crisis caused large declines in ad spending. ''We don't see that.''
Another speaker, David Poltrack, chief research officer at the CBS Corporation and president of its CBS Vision unit, used an analogy to make a similar point.
The economy is like ''a Nascar race, operating under a caution flag,'' he said. ''But no one has dropped out.'' When the racers, that is, marketers, see a green flag, ''they will be competing at full throttle,'' he added, and that may be soon because CBS executives ''remain confident we're on the road to recovery.''
''We believe that consumer spending will continue to increase,'' Mr. Poltrack said, ''fueling that recovery.''
Ad revenue for the big four English-language broadcast networks -- ABC, CBS, Fox and NBC -- will increase 3.4 percent this year compared with 2010, he said, and, reflecting the quadrennial effect, grow 7.3 percent in 2012 compared with 2011.
Philippe P. Dauman, president and chief executive at Viacom, shrugged off concerns that the European debt crisis would affect overseas revenue.
''That's not stopping us from our strategy of building scale,'' he said, mentioning opportunities in the Middle East and in Eastern European countries like Poland.
Mr. Dauman emphasized growth in what he called the ''BRI'' countries, which he pronounced ''Brie'' and explained was short for Brazil, Russia and India. The acronym is typically BRIC, adding China, but he said he omitted China because of widespread piracy and other barriers to entry for entertainment companies like Viacom.
(All the advertising forecasters focused on the BRIC nations, explaining how growth in ad spending there would offset weakness in Europe and buoy worldwide results for 2012.)
Viacom, whose holdings include MTV Networks, Nickelodeon and Paramount Pictures, has homed in on international growth; last year, 28 percent of total revenue came from overseas. That is still a small percentage compared with competitors like News Corporation and Discovery Communications.
Viacom will develop more shows specifically for overseas markets, Mr. Dauman said, in addition to exporting those made for American audiences. In May, Viacom introduced ''Geordie Shore,'' an English version of the popular MTV reality series ''Jersey Shore,'' and it quickly became the top-rated series for MTV U.K.

HEADLINE: FDI in Retail: Another 'Reform By Stealth' Failure

BYLINE: VIKAS BAJAJ


HIGHLIGHT: Recent days show the hazards of neglecting to convince the public reforms are needed. 

 BODY:
If the Indian government decides to undo or indefinitely delay its decision to let foreign retailers into the country, as government sources now quietly predict, proponents of modernization will probably blame the opposition political parties and allies of the government like the Trinamool Congress party, as well as small retailers and wholesale traders.

But a portion of the blame should also be set aside for another target: the cloak-and-dagger way in which this and many other free-market policies are often made in New Delhi, a process often described as "reform by stealth." Faced with politically unpalatable proposals, Indian politicians and bureaucrats often go quiet, enact reforms in the dead of the night and then pray that the opposition is either too lazy or preoccupied to react.
Policy makers know that by talking too much about a policy in advance they will galvanize those who will be hurt by the change - in this case retail and wholesale traders - into trying to torpedo the effort. That is why it has taken more than a decade for the government, whether led by the Congress or its chief rival, the Bharatiya Janata Party, to get the proposal on foreign direct investment in retailing even this far. 
Raghuram Rajan, the economist at the University of Chicago who advises Prime Minister Manmohan Singh, told me the stealth approach was deeply flawed. "The weakness is that you never sell the reforms," he told me by telephone from New York last week, "and I think that is a problem. You don't build a broader constituency for it."
Like many economists, Mr. Rajan argues that foreign chains like Wal-Mart, Tesco and Carrefour could do lots of good for India's agricultural sector. Agriculture employs about 175 million people directly and sustains nearly half the population, by buying produce directly from farmers and offering them better prices than wholesale traders do now.
But farmers are not well organized, and their voices have often been lost in the din of the much louder criticism by the 33 million employees of retailers and wholesale traders who argue that their businesses would be obliterated by greedy multinational companies.
"In much of reform, the long-run consequence and the deeper consequences are harder to sell," Mr. Rajan said. "What people can see is the most immediate stuff, and they go to town on that."
It's true that in this case India's Commerce Ministry published a discussion paper in July 2010 about foreign direct investment in the retail sector, and 45 groups including associations of traders and business advocacy groups provided feedback. But public officials have engaged in little public discussion about the proposal in subsequent year and a half before Nov. 24th, when the cabinet made its decision.
In that time policy makers could, for instance, have held several televised public hearings in places like Jalandhar, in the northern state of Punjab, which I visited recently to see the impact of a Wal-Mart wholesale outlet on the local traders and farmers. The forums could have been thrown open to traders, farmers, consumers, economists and others to provide feedback on the proposal and offer their experience with Wal-Mart. Like most public events in India, these would have been rowdy and chaotic, but they could have helped the government make the case for reforms -- or at least sent a clear signal that India is indeed not ready for foreign retailers.
Earlier this year, Vivek Dehejia, an economist at Carleton University in Ottawa who also writes for India Ink, argued in the Financial Times that the "original sin" of the reforms India enacted during a financial crisis was that the country's leaders, Mr. Singh among them, have never leveled with Indians and made the case for liberal economic reforms.
That may be a big reason why there is no groundswell of support for foreign retailers or many other changes that policy makers would like to push. The upper middle class and corporate India may want Wal-Mart, Target and Ikea to come to India. But the rest of the nation is not convinced. They have never shopped in these stores and don't know what these companies would bring with them. Nobody has bothered to try to convince them, other than their trusty shopkeeper who tells them it will destroy his business.
"This is one of those places," Mr. Rajan said, "where the lack of consensus on where we want to go tends to hurt us."
Unfortunately for India, that is the last thing it needs at a time when the economy is slowing, inflation is running high and private investment both domestic and foreign is falling.

HEADLINE: In Brazil, Finding Dignity in Horror

BYLINE: FERNANDA SANTOS


HIGHLIGHT: Andre Cypriano wanted to show the dignity of the people who live in Rocinha, one of Rio de Janeiro's largest slums. Fernanda Santos, who grew up nearby, talked to Mr. Cypriano about his experience photographing the area. 

 BODY:
I must have been 11, maybe 12 years old. I was staring out the big glass window in the big apartment I lived in Rio de Janeiro, looking at homes made out of wood and broken pieces of plastic and, sometimes, clay bricks, impossibly perched on the hillside ahead. It was a leg of one of the city's largest slums, Rocinha, which had draped over the mountain's top, crossing from one neighborhood to the next.
It had been raining hard for days in Rio, as it often happens in March, and the earth that covered the hill just couldn't hold its grip to the rock beneath it anymore. A red avalanche unfurled, dirt rolling down and swallowing the homes I had been watching. In a matter of seconds, the homes were gone, and there I was, still standing before the big glass window in my big apartment, dry and safe and warm.
Who are these people who live in this godforsaken place called Rocinha?
The photographer Andre Cypriano went searching for the same answers some years ago, spending 30 days and nights in the slum, capturing its essence in black and white. Mr. Cypriano wound up there as a guest of Rocinha's notorious drug lord at the time, Luciano Barbosa dos Santos, who went by the affable nickname Lulu. He had met some of Lulu's associates while photographing some of the inmates at Ilha Grande prison, Brazil's equivalent of Alcatraz, and they suggested Rocinha as the setting for a future project.
Mr. Cypriano - who is 47 and splits his time between Ilha Grande, an island off the southern coast of Rio, and Manhattan - said he felt safer at Rocinha than he did elsewhere. There were men armed with machine guns everywhere he looked, he recalled, and orders from the boss that he was not to be messed with.
"Everybody knew I was there to do a documentary, and I knew I could leave my equipment anywhere and no one would touch it," he said.
Mr. Cypriano has never worked for a newspaper, magazine or photo agency. He describes his work as self-guided documentary photography because he sets the subjects and how they will be photographed. He has been exhibited around the world: one of his pictures from Rocinha - surfers posing on a rock, the slum extending behind them - hangs at the entrance of the Center for Fine Arts in Brussels, as part of a group show by Brazilian photographers called "Extremes." Pictures from the same portfolio are also in the permanent collections of Sao Paulo's Museum of Modern Art, the Sao Paulo Museum of Art, the Afro-Brazilian Museum in Sao Paulo and others. Mr. Cypriano has also published several books.
He finds inspiration in the work of Sebastiao Salgado, a celebrated Brazilian photojournalist who has been known for putting a human face to economic and political oppression. There's an underlying beauty to all of his pictures from Rocinha, even when it's a shot of sewage flowing like a rivulet through the slum, or of hands wrapped around a crumbling wall, or of a crying woman standing in an alleyway.
"I wanted to show the dignity of the people who live there, their beauty," Mr. Cypriano said. "You don't need to focus on the horror to show the horror of living there."
He said he wasn't trying to change Rocinha through his pictures. "There's no intentional social justice component to my work," he said. His goal was simply to register the slum as it was. "My camera," he said, "is the instrument that allows me to enter in these kinds of places and enjoy them for what they are."
The rules of the Rocinha he photographed, written by the gangs that ruled drug trafficking there, are different from the rules he would find there today. The police moved in last month and seized control of the slum, part of a broad effort to tame the city's lawless areas ahead of the 2014 World Cup and 2016 Summer Olympics.
The poverty, though, is still the same.

HEADLINE: Raising Taxes on the Rich: Not Whether, but How

BYLINE: BRUCE BARTLETT


HIGHLIGHT: If the wealthy are not taxed more, then everyone else will have to be, an economist writes. 

 BODY:
Last week, the Senate rejected proposals by both Democrats and Republicans to pay for an extension of the 2 percent temporary payroll tax cut enacted a year ago. The Democratic plan to finance it with a 3.25 percent surtax on millionaires garnered significantly more votes than the Republican plan to cut the number of federal jobs and freeze the pay of federal workers.
This time last year Republicans were insisting that the Bush tax cuts be made permanent without paying for a penny of the cost, even though there is no evidence that they stimulated the economy. 
Saying that they are now concerned about the impact of the payroll tax cut on the deficit and its lack of stimulative effect makes Republicans sound a lot like Captain Renault in "Casablanca," when he said he was shocked to discover gambling going on as he was handed his winnings.
Republicans like to pretend that cutting spending is economically costless, even stimulative, whereas raising taxes in any way whatsoever is so economically debilitating that it dare not be contemplated. This view is complete nonsense.

Careful studies by the Congressional Budget Office and others show that certain spending programs are highly stimulative, whereas tax cuts provide very little bang for the buck.
Keep in mind that these results are symmetrical. A policy with a high multiplier, such as government purchases, will reduce the gross domestic product by exactly the same amount if it involves spending cuts. A tax cut with a low multiplier will have an equally small negative economic effect if it is instead done as a tax increase. 
This would suggest that one of the worst ways to cut spending, from a macroeconomic point of view, would be to do it the way Republicans proposed last week: by cutting government employment. Judging by the table above, cutting taxes for lower- and middle-income people and paying for it with higher taxes for higher-income people, as Democrats have proposed, is unambiguously stimulative.
In any case, the Republican position is politically weak. Polls consistently show that a large majority of Americans favor higher taxes on the rich. For example, the New York Times/CBS News polls in September and October found that about two-thirds of Americans would raise taxes on households earning $1 million or more to reduce the deficit; only 30 percent were opposed.
Growing numbers of millionaires and billionaires have gone on record as favoring higher taxes on the rich, because they can afford them and think they're necessary to deal with our nation's fiscal problem, which is largely due to historically low revenues. 
These include Warren Buffett, Carlos Slim, Mark Cuban and Nick Hanauer, among others. The group Patriotic Millionaires for Fiscal Strength has been lobbying Congress to raise taxes on people like themselves. A similar movement is under way in Europe as well.
It is no longer possible to deny that there has been a sharp rise in the income and wealth of the ultra-rich while everyone else's income has stagnated. Authoritative recent studies by the Congressional Budget Office and by Anthony Atkinson, Thomas Piketty and Emmanuel Saez prove that fact beyond question. 
The point is not to punish the rich for being rich - Republicans routinely scream "class warfare" whenever anyone suggests higher taxes on the rich - but to raise revenue. If the rich don't pay more, everyone else will have to.
Recognizing the intellectual and political weakness of their position, Republicans have responded that there is nothing to stop rich people from sending checks to the Treasury Department to reduce the debt. About $3 million is annually donated to the government for this purpose. On Oct. 12, Senator John Thune, Republican of South Dakota, introduced legislation that would add a line on tax returns to make voluntary contributions to the Treasury. It was enthusiastically endorsed by the anti-tax activist Grover Norquist.
Reducing the deficit through voluntary contributions is not a serious idea. It would be a drop in the bucket, such contributions are not sustainable, and it would be unwise to have the government dependent on them because inevitably they would come with strings attached.
Republicans often say that tax evasion and avoidance by the wealthy would cause revenues to fall, rather than rise, if their taxes are raised. But according to the Tax Policy Center, rates higher than the current top rate of 35 percent accounted for 29 percent of individual income tax revenue as recently as 1986, during the Reagan administration.
Recent studies by Peter Diamond and Emmanuel Saez and by A.B. Atkinson and Andrew Leigh find that increasing the top income tax rate would raise net additional revenue at least until it reached 63 percent and probably much higher. 
Nor is it correct that low taxes on the rich are essential for economic growth. Recent studies by Dan Andrews, Christopher Jencks and Andrew Leigh and by Thomas Piketty, Emmanuel Saez and Stefanie Stantcheva show that while tax cuts for the rich have raised their share of aggregate income, they have not raised the rate of economic growth.
There are legitimate questions about whether the temporary payroll tax cut stimulated employment or if its expiration will reduce growth, about whether a surtax on millionaires is the best way to pay for it and how much additional revenue can reasonably be expected. 
But the idea that the rich cannot or should not pay more should be dismissed out of hand. They can and must pay more; the only question is how best to do it.

HEADLINE: Manish Sabharwal Answers Readers' Questions

BYLINE: THE NEW YORK TIMES


HIGHLIGHT: Manish Sabharwal, chairman of the temporary-employment agency TeamLease answers questions posed by India Ink readers. 

 BODY:
India Ink asked Manish Sabharwal, chairman of the temporary-employment agency TeamLease, who was profiled in a recent New York Times article, to answer readers' questionsabout the Indian labor market and his company's philosophy. Readers posed tough queries about his business model, his competitors and the hurdles that employers and job seekers face in India. The questions and Mr. Sabharwal's answers have been edited.
Q.
This is sheer exploitation of humans by capitalist forces and must be stopped. How is it possible that this is allowed, with a most callous disregard of the worker's right to medical treatment, leave on medical grounds, proper housing and toilet facilities and long-term pension benefit?
A.
More than 50 percent of our employees move on to permanent jobs within a year. Our average salary is three times the minimum wage. We are among the largest payers of employer social security (provident fund, employee pension scheme, health insurance, etc.) in the country. More than 93 percent of India works in the informal sector and we provide a portal to the organized sector. If you include the working poor - people who make enough money to live but not enough to pull out of poverty - India's unemployment rate may be 26 percent. This is not exploitation; a temporary job is better than no job.
Q.
First of all, congratulations on the success of your business. You are obviously meeting a major need in the market by helping firms to get access to the resources they need to grow. In my experience the Indian market for knowledge workers is not as inflexible as it is often portrayed (people can be fired at will just like in the U.S. with few or no repercussions) and major employers are not as squeaky-clean as some would have us believe. What is your perspective on the policies of big IT companies that force young employees into three-year contracts that garnish their wages so the employee loses huge amounts of money if they choose to leave the firm? Sounds like indentured servitude to me.
A.
The challenge for Indian employers is that there is no fiscal model to "manufacture their own employees." The current educational and vocational system often does not produce kids who can hit the ground running in the workplace, and employers have to invest massively in training. The current contract by employers reflects the payback period for those investments by which they are substituting for the state.
From my vantage point, at the bottom of the pyramid, the working conditions and wages are something that most job seekers in India cannot dream of. Also, I think changes in the world of work mean that lifetime employment may be a thing of the past. The employment relationship has shifted from a relationship to transaction. This is not good or bad but is what it is.
Q.
I applaud your entrepreneurship, and I believe that companies like TeamLease are an unfortunate byproduct of India's dysfunctional labor regulations and epitomize the "jugaad" mentality of Indian entrepreneurs today.
What I am interested to know is how much the regulations have affected the pricing of wages for permanent noncontract workers. Do these regulations set a de facto minimum-wage floor that is much higher than the equilibrium market wages? Do you believe that the wages and very limited benefits offered by TeamLease and its competitors to temp contract workers represent the true equilibrium market wages/benefit packages that would be offered to permanent noncontract workers if the labor regulations did not exist?
When we know that the real market wage for an illiterate laborer in the informal sector in India is around $2 per day, and we don't consider that underpaid or exploitative, then it stands to reason the same is true for the temp noncontract workers when it comes to packages being offered by TeamLease. Thank you.
A.
Only 7 percent of India's labor force works in formal employment. This is because of many factors, but an important distortion is above-market minimum wages. So, labor laws have created a labor aristocracy which pays itself above market and creates conditions which makes it difficult for labor-market outsiders to escape.
Wages are rising all over India, and I'd say the formal employment gap over informal employment has narrowed from 50 percent to 30 percent. The biggest distortions are created by government employment, which pays 200 percent to 300 percent more than the real wage if you include benefits. There is not much of a difference between temp and permanent workers in terms of wages because all labor laws apply.
Q.
If you don't believe that TeamLease "should exist," and that your approach is a part of the "genius" of India, why don't you offer better benefits? Just because you represent the private sector, does that mean you should not have more responsibility for the workers you contract? Would it be problematic to take on [partly] the role of government in providing more security to your labor force?
A.
All our employees receive all benefits that a full-time employee would receive: provident fund, health insurance premiums and contributions to a government defined benefit plan. Unfortunately, these benefits amount to almost 40 percent of wages, and the huge difference between gross and net salary makes us uncompetitive with the informal sector. Taxpayer-funded social security is not something India can afford yet; the best social security we can give is jobs and skills. We are a part of the ecosystem. Not a perfect or permanent solution, but a small piece of the solution nonetheless.

HEADLINE: Researchers Question Coverage for a Spine Procedure

BYLINE: REED ABELSON


HIGHLIGHT: Even though studies did not find clear benefits for patients, Medicare and other insurers continue to pay for the treatment. 

 BODY:
What happens when a medical treatment is not found to clearly benefit patients? The answer may depend on whether the barn door is already wide open, according to a new analysis that reviews the history of a common spine procedure that was shown to be of unclear value long after Medicare and other insurers chose to pay for it.
In the article, published Monday in Health Affairs, researchers at Johns Hopkins and the National Institutes of Health looked at percutaneous vertebroplasty, a popular method of treating fractures of the vertebrae by injecting bone cement in the spine. Medicare began covering the treatment in 2001, and eight years later, the results of two published clinical studies indicated the surgery was no better in relieving pain than a placebo. While the surgery might help some patients, the research called into question its broad use.
After the studies appeared, there was much hue and cry from the doctors, and a couple of insurers thought about withdrawing coverage, only to change their minds. As the authors put it, "early coverage before rigorous randomized trials, or 'opening Pandora's box,' as one payer characterized it, tilted the scale against the possibility that payers could or would choose to change coverage for vertebroplasty, even in the face of negative evidence."
The authors recommend that insurers, including Medicare, work harder to demand better evidence from doctors and device makers about whether a new treatment is effective before they decide to pay for it. As long as medical procedures can receive "broad insurance coverage without rigorous evidence of benefit, the vertebroplasty story is likely to be repeated," they argued.
They also recommended that insurers consider changing the way they pay doctors so they do not have a financial incentive to favor one treatment over another, especially in the absence of strong evidence that the more lucrative treatment is better for patients.
Health Affairs is making the study available online without charge for two weeks. 
The authors are Katharine Cooper Wulff, a Sommer Scholar in the master of public health program at Johns Hopkins; Franklin G. Miller, a researcher at the National Institutes of Health; and Dr. Steven D. Pearson, president of the Institute for Clinical and Economic Review at Massachusetts General Hospital.

HEADLINE: A Mismatch Between Grid Regulation and Modern Needs

BYLINE: MATTHEW L. WALD


HIGHLIGHT: Because no single entity is in charge of representing the broad national interest where the reliable delivery of electricity is concerned, it is hard to tap into renewable energy sources, a study suggests. 

 BODY:
Rooftop solar power is unfairly subsidized yet draws excessive opposition from utility companies because of the way the grid allocates costs for power distribution, according to a new study released by the Massachusetts Institute for Technology.
The study also includes more conventional findings, suggesting, for example, that the North American power grid is adequate for meeting current needs but will have more and more trouble integrating intermittent sources of power like the wind and sun unless a single entity is given more authority to marshal resources across state lines. 
"We have a grid in the United States which is old but hardly archaic," said a co-chairman of the study, John G. Kassakian, a professor of electrical engineering at the institute. But the regulatory system dates from the 1930s and most of the decisions are made on a state-by-state basis, which will not be practical if the country plans to tap wind and sun resources that may be several states away from the big load centers, he said.
"No single agency, no single entity, is charged with looking at the broad national interest," he added. "This is just a mismatch between the need to think in wide-area terms, for reliability and to tap into renewables, and the regulatory structure."

That problem has been obvious for a while but so far has not been amenable to large-scale planning. An ambitious effort three years ago by grid management organizations to design a sort of and transport bulk amounts of power from the windy Plains to the East Coast drew opposition from grid operators in New England and New York. The operators recruited governors to urge Congress to block any rule changes that would allow such a system. 
The study broke new ground in criticizing how the costs of maintaining the electricity distribution system are shared. At the moment, those costs are part of the price of a kilowatt-hour, so bigger users pay more and smaller users pay less. But the study noted that when homeowners installed solar panels on their roofs and cut their kilowatt-hour consumption from the utility, they no longer paid for the energy or the cost of local distribution equipment. 
The utility's savings in this case come only from the energy not used. As a result, the study said, solar producers are effectively getting a subsidy and utilities have a greater incentive to make it as difficult as possible for homeowners to add solar cells. 
That pricing structure may not be "in the best interest of the grid," Dr. Kassakian said. Fixed charges for the distribution system would be better, the study said. 
The other co-chairman, Richard Schmalensee, a professor of economics and management, contrasted the utilities with other industries "that were once pervasively regulated,'' like railroads, airlines and telecommunications companies. All of those have been deregulated, he said, "but not electricity, which has taken baby steps." 
The study also said that the technology for monitoring the grid was improving that but more work was needed on refining how to disseminate and use the information. For example, a new class of device called Phasor Measurement Units keeps track of voltage, frequency and more arcane characteristics, but the volume of data is huge and much of the information goes unused. 
The study pointed to other emerging problems, including that research budgets are shrinking. Another is that peak electricity demand is rising faster than overall demand, so more and more power plants must be built to run for just a few hours a year. In fact, 21 percent of power plants run less than 12 percent of the hours in a year, the study found. 
Peak demand could be flattened out if ordinary consumers were charged for energy in the same way utilities must pay, with the price varying sharply from hour to hour. 
With more and more "smart meters" installed around the country, utilities have the ability to charge that way, but regulators are reluctant to let them do so. 
Electric vehicles could help solve that problem, too, if they were charged at night, but the adoption of electric cars will be slow, the study predicts. And electric cars could exacerbate difficulties if drivers recharge them at peak hours, the report said.

HEADLINE: You Like Walking in the City? So Do Plenty of Others

BYLINE: SAM ROBERTS


HIGHLIGHT: In New York, congestion isn't just relegated to the streets: City surveys confirm that sidewalks are becoming more crowded. 

 BODY:
 Feeling congested? Not your nose, your toes. City surveys confirm that sidewalks are becoming more crowded. And transportation officials say that's good for the economy, the environment and for your physical, if not necessarily emotional, health. 
 Since the city began keeping score at 50 of the busiest intersections five years ago, its "pedestrian volume index" has climbed steadily, except for one year, from 2008 to 2009, perhaps because of the recession. Fixing the volume in 2007 at a base of 100, the index rose by more than 10 percent, to 113.2, last May. 
They surveys are taken each May and September. Preliminary figures for September suggest a greater increase again. The volume on West 14th Street between Hudson Street and Eighth Avenue soared by 58 percent from the year before. New Yorkers not only talk the talk - they walk the walk. 
 "Everybody is a pedestrian at some point," said Janette Sadik-Khan, the transportation commissioner. "It's staggering when you think how many people are walking the streets of New York City at any given time."
 How many? About 350,000 a day in Times Square, 97,000 on Main Street in Flushing, Queens, and 80,000 on East Fordham Road in the Bronx, according to a 2007 study. 
 Surveyors wielding hand-held counters found 31,701 people on West 34th Street between Broadway and Seventh Avenue from 4 p.m. to 7 p.m. on May 10 and 26,106 on Fifth Avenue between East 54th and 55th Streets during the same time period two days later. On West 14th between Hudson and Eighth, the volume was 11,166 in September, according to preliminary figures, compared with 8,911 in May and 7,0555 the previous September.
 The least crowded of the 50 corridors in all five boroughs was Victory Boulevard between Bay Street and Van Duzer Street on Staten Island, which was traversed by 1,215 pedestrians between 4 p.m. and 7 p.m. on May 19.
 "These include millionaires who like to walk and people without the wherewithal to get around any other way," Ms. Sadik-Khan said, referring to the city's strollers.
 The Transportation Department has been widening sidewalks where possible and expanding pedestrian malls to make room for more pedestrians because streets that are too crowded can become unsafe and hamper business. Pedestrian volume has increased 12 percent in Times Square since vehicular traffic on parts of Broadway was curbed.
 The problem is defining "too crowded." A department consultant, Gehl Architects, says the maximum volume for comfortable pedestrian movement is 12 people per minute per yard of sidewalk width. By that measure, Main Street in Flushing is overcrowded 83 percent of the day. Is there a saturation point?
"People like to be around people," Ms. Sadik-Khan said. "With 8.4 million people, you don't live here unless you like people. And with 6,000 miles of streets, the challenge is re-engineering the real estate to deliver attractive, safe and sustainable streets."
That includes adding benches - the city is installing 1,000 new ones - and signs to guide pedestrians.
 "At any given time," Ms. Sadik-Khan said, "you have 10 percent of New Yorkers who will admit they were lost in the previous week."
By some measures, pedestrians are more likely to spend money than drivers.
"There's a direct relation between how people get around and how much money they spend," Ms. Sadik-Khan said. "A pedestrian can just stop and walk into a store, which means more feet in the door and across the threshold."
 Walking, she said, "is the most affordable way to get around, better for your health, for the planet. We continue to engineer our streets to make them safer for pedestrians."
In fact, having more people walking the streets has not made them more dangerous. 
Traffic fatalities involving pedestrians have declined 21 percent over the past decade, transportation officials say.

HIGHLIGHT: In New York City, everyone is a pedestrian, which can lead to big crowds on sidewalks. 

 BODY:
Traffic congestion isn't just for the highways. In New York City, it's the sidewalks that are overcrowded.
Since the city began keeping score at 50 of the busiest intersections five years ago, its "pedestrian volume index" has climbed steadily, except for one year, from 2008 to 2009, perhaps because of the recession. Fixing the volume in 2007 at a base of 100, the index rose by more than 10 percent, to 113.2, last May.
They surveys are taken each May and September. Preliminary figures for September suggest a greater increase again. The volume on West 14th Street between Hudson Street and Eighth Avenue soared by 58 percent from the year before.
"Everybody is a pedestrian at some point," said Janette Sadik-Khan, the transportation commissioner. "It's staggering when you think how many people are walking the streets of New York City at any given time."
How many? About 350,000-a-day in Times Square, 97,000 on Main Street in Flushing, Queens, and 80,000 on East Fordham Road in the Bronx, according to a 2007 study. New Yorkers not only talk the talk. They walk the walk.

HEADLINE: Conclave to Open on Mekong's Fate

BYLINE: RACHEL NUWER


HIGHLIGHT: Environmentalists argue that the four countries mulling construction of a dam on the river do not fully grasp the potential ecological and economic impacts. 

 BODY:
The Laotians call it Mae Nam Khong, the Mother of Water. The Vietnamese refer to it as Song Cuu Long, or the Nine Dragons River. The Khmer prefer Tonle Thum, or simply Great River. Whatever its name, the Mekong River is a lifeline for millions in the countries touched by its muddy waters, the world's largest inland fishery.
On Wednesday, ministers from Vietnam, Thailand, Cambodia and Laos open a three-day meeting in Siem Reap, Cambodia, to decide whether to approve a controversial dam on the mainstream of the river in Laos. Proponents say the dam would bring much-needed revenue to Laos and the region, but scientists warn that it could prove devastating for the environment and the people who depend on the river's bountiful resources.
About 1,000 species of fish live in the Mekong, making it the second-most biodiverse river in the world, after the Amazon. The river supports fisheries, farming and transportation.
Scientists are concerned that the dam project, known as Xayaburi, will open up a Pandora's box of dams, given that it is only the first in a cascade of 11 proposed mainstream hydropower plants.

In April, Thailand, Laos, Vietnam and Cambodia -- all members of the 1995 Mekong Agreement, which requires prior consultation before any alterations to the river - met on the issue but failed to reach a consensus. Vietnam called for deferring construction of the dam for 10 years, and Cambodia and Thailand expressed concern about the project.
Xayaburi, which is being financed by the Thais, would be the first mainstream Mekong dam in Southeast Asia and would produce about 1,260 megawatts of power, 95 percent of which would be exported to Thailand. Thai building companies were contracted for the $3.7 billion project, and Thailand would operate the dam for 30 years before turning it over to Laos.
Laos has said it hopes to become "the battery of Southeast Asia" in terms of hydropower.
Environmentalists assert that the developers would reap most of the financial benefits, however. Even more important, they say, the countries involved have failed to grasp the full dimensions of the dam's potential effects on the environment.
"It's quite clear now that the four countries are not in a position to make an informed decision," said Ame Trandem, the Southeast Asia program director of the nonprofit group International Rivers. "All scientific evidence points to the fact that this dam will have devastating impacts."
Zeb Hogan, an aquatic ecologist at the University of Nevada, Reno, said that while "people who have never been to that region might not know it from any other river," the Mekong is unique in terms of fisheries. Some 2.5 million tons of fish are harvested annually in the basin for a total value of $6.5 billion.
The river is also home to five species of endangered fish, including the critically endangered giant catfish, which can grow up to 10 feet long. Dr. Hogan and other scientists fear that the dam would drive animals like the giant catfish to extinction.
An estimated 40 to 70 percent of fish stocks in the Mekong, including many on which people depend on for food, are migratory. A dam would block their annual migrations, meaning that they would not be able to reach spawning grounds to breed. Although developers have proposed things like fish ladders to allow the animals to pass, Dr. Hogan said experience has shown that it is very difficult to build viable fish passages, especially for such a varied mix of large and small species.
A dam would also affect nutrients and flood regimes vital for crop production, scientists say.
"The dam is going to hurt the poorest people because they're going to lose their livelihoods and food security," Ms. Trandem said.
The dam's impact would probably extend 40 to 60 miles north of Xayaburi, where villages would be flooded and people would be forced to relocate, and potentially hundreds of miles south. Currently, no plan exists for moving the approximately 500 households that would be flooded by the dam and there is no guarantee that those families would be compensated for their losses, said David Blake, a doctoral candidate in international development at the University of East Anglia, who spent years in the region studying the dam issue.
"The true situation on the ground is very poorly known or understood because there's no independent monitoring going on," he said. Mr. Blake pointed out that in Laos, people can be arrested just for criticizing the government.
The decision-making process has been less than transparent. No public consultations were held in Laos, and only a few sessions were held in Cambodia, Thailand and Vietnam, Ms. Trandem said. No environmental impact assessments were prepared in time to inform the public sessions that were held, she said.
A report issued by the dam's developer, the CH. Karnchang Public Company, was widely criticized as inadequate and as glossing over environmental and social uncertainties. "I know we can do better than that," Dr. Hogan said.
Although Thongloun Sisolit, a deputy prime minister of Laos, has said his country will wait for "positive signals" from its neighbors before building the dam, construction workers have already begun clearing the Xayaburi area.
A study commissioned by the United States Agency for International Development examined the potential impacts of all of the region's proposed dams. There are so many uncertainties that the economic impact could range from a net gain of $33 billion to a net loss of $274 billion, it found.
"If dams go in and we just hope for the best but things go wrong and fisheries collapse, who's going to pay for that?" said Robert Costanza, a professor of sustainability at Portland State University in Oregon and the lead author of the study. "There's a lot of uncertainty, and the public should not bear the burden of that uncertainty."
Dr. Costanza recommends requiring dam builders to post a bond large enough to cover potential damages upfront or asking the international community and neighboring countries to pay Laos not to build any dams. The United States and the World Bank have already stated they support deferring construction.
A decision by the four countries is expected to be announced on Thursday.

HEADLINE: Safety Nets for Freelancers

BYLINE: DAVID BORNSTEIN


HIGHLIGHT: The Freelancers Union is working to provide protections for "contingent" workers that go beyond just health care. 

 BODY:
In this country, three subjects that are guaranteed to generate a heated debate are religion, politics and, you guessed it, health insurance. Of the first two, Mark Twain observed that "people's beliefs and convictions are in almost every case gotten at second-hand." When it comes to health insurance, people speak from direct experience - and pain. The numerous comments to Friday's column about the Freelancers Union - which brings together freelance workers to increase their power in markets and politics - reveal that many independent workers feel that the battle for affordable health insurance is one they are losing.
"I remember being a temp and having no access to health care," wrote Hen3ry, from New York. "The premiums for me were astronomical Then, when I was unemployed I had nothing. I stopped taking my [medications] which I needed." Another reader, Karen, from Minnesota, explained: "I have health insurance, but am seriously considering dropping it because even if I needed it for catastrophic care, the [premiums, deductibles, co-pays and co-insurance] would bankrupt me long before I ever got to the part where the health insurance actually pays most of my expenses!" And KA from California added: "I'm a young woman, and forget about having babies anytime soon! My health insurance premiums would rise by 500 percent if I were to elect maternity coverage (and that doesn't even include the cost of insuring the child)."

The Freelancers Union was founded to help address the problems faced by independent workers in today's economy - people who don't have traditional jobs, but rather work on a project-to-project, or part-time basis for different employers. There are 42 million Americans - one third of the labor force - who work this way and many of them lack the benefits that are assumed to come with employment - health insurance, unemployment insurance, pension plans, and a variety of job protections. The Freelancers Union launched the Freelancers Insurance Company (F.I.C.) in an effort to give its members insurance options equivalent to those that are accorded to other employees.
A number of its members wrote in to say that they were appreciative of the union's work. "I've had F.I.C. for the last three years and it's absolutely the most (maybe the only) affordable option available to me," explained Nickie from Brooklyn, N.Y. "Some may find their rates high, but compared to what?" Another reader added that F.I.C.'s health insurance was an "amazing benefit." Others found it too expensive, however. Bill from New York added that F.I.C. was "less expensive in terms of monthly premiums than going it alone, but make no mistake, it is no cure-all." And Louise Ann Noeth, from Creve Coeur, Mo., noted that the creation of F.I.C. was, itself, an achievement. "As a founding member of the Motor Press Guild, the largest automotive journalist professional organization in the world," she wrote. "I am painfully reminded how many times we attempted - and failed - to find a way to provide affordable health care for our freelance members."
There is no doubt that health insurance is simply beyond the means of many independent workers. The Affordable Care Act is designed to address this problem beginning in 2014 for people with incomes that fall below four times the federal poverty line (in 2011, that amounts to $43,560 for an individual and $89,400 for a family of four).
F.I.C.'s plans are substantially less expensive than most other options available to independent workers in New York, but they are not cheap. Individual plans range from $225 to $603 per month. (That's the main reason that, like many others, I went without health insurance for the first decade of my writing career.) For 2012, many health insurance companies requested permission to enact huge premium increases. For example, Aetna made a request to hike the rates for its individual and small-group plans from 8.9 to 53.6 percent. Freelancers Union's rates also went up, but only by 2.3 to 8.3 percent, well below the average. (In 2010, Aetna's chief executive, Ronald A. Williams, also received $72 million in compensation.)
Many readers noted that the problems faced by freelancers in the United States are not shared in other developed countries. In Canada, where I grew up, everyone is insured by the government. "My British fiancee and his colleagues went easily freelance," commented Rebecca, from Manhattan, "because they were living in a country with an exemplary and flourishing national health service." The majority of readers seemed to agree that a single-payer approach was the preferred national solution. "A single-payer system should be our ultimate goal," wrote Quio, from Brooklyn, an insurance broker. "Taxes would have to be adjusted, but, with everyone insured, health care costs would decrease."
I asked the founder of the Freelancers Union, Sara Horowitz, about this. "Many people believe that there are only two options for health care: the current, for-profit, dysfunctional, system where costs are spiraling out of control, and a single-payer system," she commented. "I believe there is another strategy where civil society (such as nonprofits, social-purpose businesses and other institutions) create a new support system to get their basic needs met. The reality is that government is subsidizing less and less, and this likely isn't going to turn around in the next few years. So it's unrealistic to think that government will be able to fund and operate a single-payer health care system in the next three to five years. And we don't have time to wait - we need an alternative immediately."
But Horowitz added that the government has a key role to play in supporting and subsidizing the development of these institutions - as governments do in many other countries. Several readers noted that the model of the Freelancers Insurance Company - a mission-driven, private insurer that represents a class of workers - is similar to the way health insurance is handled in Germany and France. Freelancers Union has also applied to run nonprofit Consumer Oriented and Operated Plans (CO-OPs) in a number of states. A provision of the Affordable Care Act, CO-OPs will be operated by their customers and will offer coverage on health insurance exchanges alongside for-profit companies. (In January, the government will be announcing the first round of recipients of $3.8 billion in loans slated to finance CO-OPs.)
The real culprit behind the high cost of health insurance is, of course, the high cost of health care. As has been extensively reported (in The Times, The New Yorker, The Atlantic and elsewhere), the incentives in our health system are all wrong: we pay doctors for prescribing and performing procedures, not for working together to get good results with patients. As I have noted in Fixes, we also fail to link the medical system with the causes of poor health - like lack of access to good food, decent housing and a healthy environment.
One area where Freelancers Insurance Company is trying to ameliorate the problem is by providing members with access to integrated health care and wellness models. It is also trying to educate members about costs they may not be aware of. For example, in New York City, colonoscopies are regularly performed with conscious sedation or full anesthesia. The latter introduces medical risk, costs about $3,000 more, and is usually unnecessary. "People go to the doctor and they don't know to ask about this and end up paying a lot more," notes Horowitz. She wants members to be informed and to have access to physicians who provide both options.
As I mentioned, Freelancers Union provides more than health insurance. In fact, some of its gains will probably come as a surprise to independent workers in New York City. For example, in 2009, the Freelancers Union played a key role getting the government of New York City to abolish the Unincorporated Business Tax (UBT) for independent workers earning less than $100,000 per year. The tax had never been intended for freelancers. The new policy saves many independent workers up to $3,400 a year.
Recently, the Freelancers Union introduced legislation to protect independent workers from nonpaying clients, a problem that has affected close to 80 percent of the union's members. (So far, a bill has passed the state assembly). It also developed a contract creator to make it easier for freelancers to draft legally binding contracts, and a client scorecard, so independent workers can rate clients. In 2009, it launched the first 401(k) pension plan for freelancers.
In the coming years, Horowitz hopes to add a variety of new services to help members. These include home exchanges, where freelancers could easily find other freelancers to stay with when they are on the road, thus avoiding hotel costs. She wants to connect members more effectively so they can find colleagues to outsource work to when they are busy, and to help them pull together teams for projects. Above all, she would love to develop a version of unemployment insurance for independent workers.
"We'd like to bring people together so they could save pretax for periods of unemployment," she said. "When you're a traditional worker, you will be unemployed infrequently, but for a long duration. For freelancers, it's frequent periods of unemployment for short duration. So if you could have a tax advantaged account that you could draw down on in tough times, it would allow you to plan and hedge against periods of drought."
That's something that the 42 million Americans currently classified as "contingent" workers should be able to agree on - politics and religion aside.

HEADLINE: In Nepal, Farmers Struggle as City Dwellers Fight Monsanto

BYLINE: ANDREW C. REVKIN


HIGHLIGHT: A look behind Nepali fears over Monsanto seed. 

 BODY:
Kashish Das Shrestha is a Nepal-born, New York-based photographer and writer who alternates between covering fashion shows and Maoist rebels, celebrities and refugees. In recent e-mail exchanges he alerted me to a building protest effort in Nepal following an announcement in September by the United States Agency for International Development that it was teaming up with Monsanto and Nepali agricultural agencies to promote the benefits of high-yielding hybrid corn varieties and to train Nepali farmers how to grow such crops.
He has written an article describing how anti-Monsanto sentiment built, prompting Nepal's new leadership to push back: 
"Policies must be shaped in our national interest. We will not allow anyone to work unchecked," Prime Minister Baburam Bhattarai, who had been in office for only about a month and was unaware of this particular case, told me in New York later that month.
Back in Kathmandu, things have become confusing since. An anti-Monsanto campaign has slowly gained momentum in the local press, the capital, and online, culminating in a silent protest near the U.S. embassy [on Nov. 25]. And the USAID and the Ministry of Agriculture and Cooperatives are in an awkward standoff.
The USAID, having initially declared a partnership and a pilot program, has backtracked and said they will do whatever the Ministry of Agriculture and Cooperatives decides, shifting the pressure squarely on the government.
They explained on a Facebook post: " no new programs have been entered into by the US Government with the Government of Nepal to introduce hybrid maize seed as some articles suggest."
Das Threstha noted that Monsanto and all manner of hybrid seeds from that and other companies are well established in the country. He also observed that farmers did not seem to be represented among the young Katmandu protestors:
The 'Stop Monsanto in Nepal' Facebook campaign that held a protest near the US embassy last week was almost 50 percent non-Nepalis, and essentially void of farmers.
There's more on Facebook that's worth exploring. On Friday, the United States ambassador to Nepal, Scott H. DeLisi, posted a Facebook note that describes in detail the merits of hybrid maize and attempts to clear up some of the misunderstanding about what's going on.
I encourage you to read the entire note, given that the issues explored by DeLisi are relevant around the world, and given the reality that a mix of technologies and techniques is going to be required in most places to satisfy growing human populations and appetites without consuming ever more land needed either for wildlife or human settlements.
Here are excerpts from his post, with a link to the rest:
There has been considerable discussion of late about U.S. agricultural development strategy in Nepal, Monsanto, and hybrid seeds. I'd like to set the record straight. Before addressing the specifics, however, I would like to highlight our strongly held belief that the critical discussion is not about the role of a single company but about the future of agricultural development in Nepal. If anything, the recent debates about Monsanto have led me to believe that what is truly needed is a carefully considered, fact-based policy dialogue among agriculturalists, agronomists, government officials and all other stakeholders on the best course for this nation, as a food-deficit country, when it comes to addressing the fundamental issues of food security and improved livelihoods for farmers across the nation....
[W]hile looking at seed technology to enhance agricultural productivity is important, it is only a small component of our food security partnership with the government. We are supporting organic production, working with farmers on irrigation techniques, better nursery programs for seedlings, and better insect control. We are, for example, working with farmers in the mid-hills on diversification of crop production to show them that instead of making 5,000 rupees from a half hectare of maize in monsoon season they can generate 130,000 rupees from best-practice irrigated vegetable farming during the same period. My request and my intent is to keep our discussion focused on what makes sense for Nepal's development, for farmers' livelihoods, for the economy and for the future and to not let it be diverted by those for whom focusing on a single company is more important than addressing Nepal's food security concerns or long-term agricultural development strategies.
With that in mind, let me try to frame as clearly as possible the focus of our efforts as well as the reasons we're puzzled by some of the issues being raised. First, I have urged before, and I emphasize again, the importance of being clear about the true issues we are discussing. Yesterday there was yet another op-ed that spoke about "GMO" maize. I am not aware of any GMO maize being grown in Nepal not has it been approved by the government, nor are there any proposals on the part of USAID or anyone else that I know to introduce it. This careless use of terminology only clouds the issues. There are very important differences between hybrids and GMO seeds and, although there can and should be dialogue about both, we need to be clear about what we are talking about.
I have also seen many Facebook posts and press statements that talk about "stopping" the introduction of hybrid maize into Nepal. There was another such statement today. These statements puzzle me, however, as they seem to ignore the current realities in agriculture here in Nepal. The Government of Nepal began researching the use of hybrid seed varieties in 1987 and today, approximately 75% of tomatoes, cauliflower, and many other vegetables in Nepal are grown from hybrid seed. The Nepal Agricultural Research Council (NARC) has also approved sixteen maize hybrids for sale in Nepal. Many of the approved varieties come from Monsanto, and four of them have been sold commercially here since 2004....
Several American and Indian companies sell the approved hybrid seed varieties in Nepal in response to the current - and increasing - market demand for them. There are also discussions of Nepali companies either developing their own hybrid lines or acquiring rights from companies like Monsanto for the parental lines of currently used hybrids. As noted earlier, however, I believe that those who want to focus the discussion to either a single company, or to the commercial hybrid seed providers in general, miss the key concern. What is important is that decision makers and stakeholders bring the focus of the debate back to the core question: the appropriate role of hybrids as part of a comprehensive strategy for Nepal's agricultural development. To single out Monsanto, or any other company, serves no useful purpose in this discussion and distracts from the critical issues to be addressed.
The simple fact is that Nepal's agricultural productivity across the board is low - very low. Meanwhile, the population is growing, while the amount of arable land is at best static but may be decreasing due to urbanization. This imbalance puts the food security of the entire nation in jeopardy. Malnutrition and under nutrition remain serious problems, undermining the health and affecting the future of Nepali children. In my view, these are issues that must be discussed soberly and carefully. These are the issues we want to work with the people and the government to address....
Although I believe there are many related issues that warrant discussion by and among Nepalis as you shape your agricultural future, I again urge that, as you do so, you seek to separate fact from fiction. Hear ALL sides of the discussion and recognize that there are many views and competing considerations. For example, there are those who repeatedly posit as absolute fact that the maize crop failures in 2009 were due to hybrid seeds. There are experts, however, including in the Government of Nepal, who will tell you that the problem was a weather-related issue (extreme cold) that affected OPV maize as well as hybrid.
Other opponents of hybrid seeds argue that hybrids encourage dependence and are part of a new form of economic imperialism by the developed world. I disagree, but at the end of the day what I believe is not important. Nepalis must make that decision for themselves. I urge, however, that you listen not just to the foes but that you give just as much consideration to the voice of the farmer who argues that greater productivity and increased incomes stemming from hybrid use can improve his life and the future of his children while transforming agriculture in Nepal.
The bottom line? Let facts, not conjecture, emotion or misinformation, inform this important debate. [Read the full post here.]

BYLINE: THE NEW YORK TIMES


HIGHLIGHT: Young Americans are less likely to obtain a license than their peers of 25 years ago, according to a research group at the University of Michigan. 

 BODY:
In which we bring you motoring news from around the Web:
 A team at the University of Michigan's Transportation Research Institute released a survey this month indicating that young Americans were less likely to obtain a driver's license than they were 25 years ago. The team members, from the institute's Human Factors research group, attributed the trend to the increasing ease with which young people could remain in contact with one another through the Internet. Citing copyright restrictions, Michael Sivak, the head of the group, said the paper was not searchable on the group's Web site, but the above graph summarized the findings. (U.M.T.R.I.)
 Subaru intends to enter its rear-wheel-drive BRZ coupe, introduced at the Tokyo auto show last week, in the GT300 class of the 2012 Japanese Super GT series, Car and Driver reports. The automaker exhibited a race-prepped version of the BRZ at its stand in Tokyo. The class sets a limit of 300 horsepower for competitors; the base BRZ generates 200 horsepower from its boxer 4-cylinder engine. Pricing for the production coupe has not been announced, but the 2+2 is expected to go on sale in the United States as a 2013 model in the spring. (Car and Driver)
Chuck Berry has donated his red 1973 Cadillac Eldorado convertible to the Smithsonian National Museum of African-American History and Culture. The museum, which is expected to open in Washington in 2015, is acquiring pieces for its permanent collection. In the 1987 documentary "Hail! Hail! Rock 'n' Roll," Mr. Berry drove the Cadillac onto the stage of the Fox Theater in St. Louis. (National Public Radio)
 Toyota announced Monday that about 6,000 Toyota Camry sedans built at its plant in Georgetown, Ky., will be exported annually to the automaker's subsidiary in South Korea. The automaker noted that its North American plants produce 100,000 vehicles annually for export. Akio Toyoda, the brand's president, said last month that a rising yen would force the automaker to export vehicles to Asian markets that, in a different economic climate, would receive cars built in Japan.

 Greg Martin, a spokesman for General Motors, said that a "couple dozen" owners of the Chevrolet Volt have taken advantage of the brand's buyback offer, extended after the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration began investigation into lithium-ion batteries, which was prompted by a fire involving a crash-tested Volt. According to a report by The Detroit News, more than 230 owners of the plug-in hybrid had written an open letter in defense of the car. (The Detroit News)

HEADLINE: Tax Deal Expected Between Cuomo and Lawmakers

BYLINE: THOMAS KAPLAN


HIGHLIGHT: An official said that the governor and legislative leaders had agreed on the principles of a tax package, and were hoping to announce the details shortly. 

 BODY:
.
ALBANY - Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo and legislative leaders were poised to announce Tuesday that they had agreed to an overhaul of the tax code that would raise taxes on the wealthy and reduce them for middle-class residents, according to an official briefed on the negotiations.
Lawmakers on Tuesday were returning to the Capitol to discuss the tentative agreement, and they could approve it as early as this week in a special session of the Legislature that Mr. Cuomo was expected to call.
The official said that Mr. Cuomo; Sheldon Silver, the Assembly speaker; and Dean G. Skelos, the Senate majority leader, had agreed on the principles of a tax package, and were hoping to announce the details shortly. It remained possible that a last-minute language disagreement could scuttle the deal, but the elected officials were optimistic Tuesday morning. 
The tentative agreement would create multiple new tax brackets and tax rates, and would replace some, but not all, of the revenue to be lost when the state's so-called millionaires' tax expires at the end of this month. Mr. Cuomo had called for "comprehensive reform" of the tax code on Sunday.
The deal was also likely to include a compromise on a much-contested plan to legalize the hailing of livery cabs on most New York City streets, according to the official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because the talks were private.
An agreement would end a yearlong battle over taxation of the wealthy, prompted by the pending expiration of the state's millionaires' tax, which is actually a tax surcharge for individuals who earn more than $200,000 a year and couples who earn more than $300,000. Any tax increase for the wealthy would mark a reversal for Mr. Cuomo, a Democrat, who ran for governor last year on a platform of opposing tax increases and said that increasing such taxes would hurt the state by motivating wealthy residents to move elsewhere.
But Mr. Cuomo has come under increasing pressure from Democrats and labor unions in recent weeks as the sluggish economy weakened the state's financial picture, widening next year's projected budget gap to as much as $3.5 billion, and the Occupy Wall Street movement directed more attention to the issue of income inequality.

HEADLINE: Council Committee Endorses Cuomo's Tax Plan

BYLINE: KATE TAYLOR


HIGHLIGHT: Some New York City Council members praised Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo, saying he restored fairness to the taxes levied on New Yorkers. 

 BODY:
As elected officials in Albany put the final touches on a deal to raise taxes on wealthy New Yorkers, they got a vote of support from the New York City Council finance committee, which passed a resolution Tuesday morning endorsing Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo's effort to institute a more progressive tax code.
Councilman Jumaane D. Williams of Brooklyn, one of the authors of the resolution, praised the governor for framing the issue as one of fairness, and said that the added revenue should be used to restore social programs.
"Under this plan, the rich will still be rich, the poor will still be poor," he said. "It will, however, give all New Yorkers a fighting chance in this economy."
The two City Council members who voted against the resolution, both Republicans from Staten Island, called it premature, since the governor had not yet presented a formal plan.
"Cart, horse; horse, cart - we all know what the order should be," James S. Oddo, the Council's minority leader, said.
Vincent Ignizio dismissed the meeting as "political theater" and compared it to an episode of the television show "Seinfeld."
"It's a meeting about nothing, because we don't have anything in front of us," he said, adding that he thought the Council should confine itself to city matters.
The chairman of the finance committee, Domenic Recchia, appeared to bristle at his colleague's remarks.
"This is not politically motivated," he said. "I am not Jerry Seinfeld. This committee is taken very seriously." He added that the issue of raising more revenue did affect the city, because, he said, the city had suffered in the most recent budget cycle.
"We, the City Council, feel very strongly that it's time for the state to step up to the plate and help the city," he said, adding, "The state legislators need to hear from us."
Mr. Oddo, while voting against the resolution, defended the governor, whom he praised for exerting control over the state budget, against another council member, Charles Barron.
Mr. Barron, a frequent critic of Mr. Cuomo, attended the meeting even though he is not a member of the finance committee, and spoke for several minutes, spending much of the time criticizing the governor for cuts he had instituted.
"Mario - I mean, Andrew Cuomo has been a disaster as a governor," Mr. Barron said. "He is trying to squeeze the unions; he is trying to freeze wages and hit their pensions."
Mr. Oddo responded: "I think the governor injected reality into Albany - no more monopoly money. I think the governor injected leadership."

HEADLINE: Is Gingrich This Year's Huckabee?

BYLINE: MICHAEL D. SHEAR


HIGHLIGHT: Just as Mike Huckabee did four years ago, Newt Gingrich is surging before the Iowa caucuses. Will the similarities end there? 

 BODY:
In 2007, Mike Huckabee snuck up on Mitt Romney. He surged in Iowa in December and ended up robbing Mr. Romney of a victory that he desperately needed.
So is Newt Gingrich the Mike Huckabee of this presidential season?
Like Mr. Huckabee, Mr. Gingrich has come on strong in the final few weeks of the year. Like Mr. Huckabee, who won the Iowa caucuses in January 2008, Mr. Gingrich has risen in the polls after being virtually ignored by Mr. Romney's campaign for months.
And just as in December 2007, it may be too late for Mr. Romney's campaign to shift gears and refocus its political fire on Mr. Gingrich in advance of the voting that will begin in Iowa in less than a month.
But Mr. Romney has designed Version 2.0 of his campaign to withstand exactly this scenario. The campaign has long embraced the possibility that one of his rivals might emerge - perhaps, like Mr. Huckabee, at the last moment - to capture Iowa, a state that has always seemed cool to Mr. Romney's political charms.
By playing down the importance of Iowa (until recently), Mr. Romney's campaign has diminished the impact of a victory in the state by someone like Mr. Gingrich. 
There are plenty of reasons to think that Mr. Gingrich's rise in the polls could play out very differently than it did for Mr. Huckabee four years ago. It appears that Mr. Gingrich has more resources in place in states like South Carolina and Florida than Mr. Huckabee did at the same point.
And yet there is an eerie feeling of history repeating itself in these last weeks of 2011.
Strategists in both campaigns are eager to learn from the similarities and the differences between then and now. Here are some of them:
The Similarities:
Perhaps the most compelling similarity between Mr. Huckabee and Mr. Gingrich is the way they spent months toiling in relative political obscurity.
For Mr. Huckabee, being a jovial ex-governor of a Southern state provided little evidence of prowess to members of the media, potential donors, his Republican rivals or the Democratic opposition. He did well at debates, but raised little money throughout most of 2007. It wasn't until mid-November that Mr. Huckabee began breaking out of the single digits in polls. 
For very different reasons, Mr. Gingrich suffered a similar fate for most of the 2011 campaign. After stumbling early, Mr. Gingrich lost most of his staff, struggled to raise money and was deemed largely irrelevant by members of the press and his rivals. 
At the beginning of November, though, Mr. Gingrich started gaining traction just as Rick Perry, the governor of Texas, and Herman Cain, the former chief executive of Godfather's Pizza, had stumbles of their own. In Iowa, in particular, Mr. Gingrich rose in the polls just as Mr. Huckabee did. Both men entered December as the heavy favorites in that state. 
In 2007, Mr. Romney's campaign struggled in the final weeks to slow Mr. Huckabee's momentum in Iowa - to no avail. Having spent much of the year in a battle with Senator John McCain of Arizona and Rudolph W. Giuliani, the former mayor of New York, Mr. Romney found it difficult to unleash fresh attacks on Mr. Huckabee - and they might have backfired if he had.
Mr. Romney has largely held back from attacking Mr. Gingrich in the last several weeks. Instead, the former Massachusetts governor has continued to criticize President Obama's handling of the economy, apparently hoping that Mr. Gingrich will falter on his own - or with the help of the media.
Also like Mr. Huckabee, Mr. Gingrich has struggled to quickly ramp up his campaign infrastructure once the surge came. And both men faced the financial challenge of a possibly protracted campaign against much-better financed candidate. 
The Differences:
But Mr. Gingrich brings a different background to the fight against Mr. Romney, especially in Iowa.
Unlike Mr. Huckabee, Mr. Gingrich does not have a close-knit network of supporters in Iowa's evangelical community. In 2007, Mr. Huckabee - a former pastor - used his connections in the state's churches and homeschooling community to drive people to show up at the caucuses. In mid-December, he ran an ad wishing Iowans a merry Christmas that was seen as helping to drive home his connection to those voters.
Mr. Huckabee also benefited from being a relative unknown to the media and to the Washington establishment. He flew under the radar for months, and when he finally entered the spotlight at the end of 2007, it took some time before reporters and others began digging into his time as governor of Arkansas.
By contrast, Mr. Gingrich is the epitome of the known quantity. His tenure as the speaker of the House in the mid-1990s is well-known to Washington reporters and political operatives. And his presence in the nation's capital as a political commentator and advocate has been nearly constant since he left office.
That means that Mr. Gingrich is now facing scrutiny about his record without Mr. Romney having to push attacks on his rival.
That scrutiny could yet undermine Mr. Gingrich's standing in Iowa, especially among conservatives who are the most likely to show up during the state's voting. Mr. Gingrich's work on behalf of Freddie Mac, his positions on climate change and questions about his personal life are all vulnerabilities that Mr. Huckabee did not have.
On the other hand, if Mr. Gingrich wins Iowa next month, he could be better positioned than Mr. Huckabee was to make a deeper run for the nomination.
Mr. Gingrich has started to build up campaign staff in South Carolina, which will hold its primary 10 days after New Hampshire. And he has begun to organize in Florida, which will be a critical early-voting state at the end of January. In 2007, Mr. Huckabee had little organization outside of Iowa.
Presidential campaigns are never perfect reruns. And candidates often discover that they have drawn the wrong lessons from what appears to be similar circumstances.
But in his second attempt at securing the Republican nomination for president, Mr. Romney once again faces a late surge by a candidate whose prospects had been largely discounted for most of the year.
It will be several months before we know how it turns out this time around.

HEADLINE: Myths of the Hispanic Vote

BYLINE: ROSS DOUTHAT


HIGHLIGHT: Why Latinos aren't likely to put Newt Gingrich in the White House. 

 BODY:
Not every liberal is publicly chortling over the prospect of facing Newt Gingrich in the general election. According to the Washington Post, some Democratic strategists fear Gingrich's ability to ... win Hispanic voters:
Where Romney, the former business executive and Massachusetts governor, poses a threat in his ability to win independents and conservative Democrats attracted to his image as an economic Mr. Fix-It, Gingrich could pursue a strategy that combines energizing the conservative base and chipping away Democratic support among Hispanics - an electoral formula that helped George W. Bush win in 2004.
... "He does not carry Wall Street baggage," said one Democratic strategist working on the Obama reelection effort, speaking on the condition of anonymity to freely discuss his thinking. "He's really smart. He's definitely authentic."
Perhaps most significantly, Gingrich has an extensive Hispanic outreach organization, which he has been building for years. Unlike anything in the Romney playbook, that network could give Gingrich a head start slicing into Obama's base in key states in the Mountain West, where Hispanics are a fast-growing swing voting bloc. Polls show Hispanic voters, two-thirds of whom backed Obama in 2008, still favor the president - but GOP strategists believe that winning 40 percent of that vote could disrupt Obama's electoral college strategy by putting Colorado, Arizona and Nevada in the Republican column.
I would not be surprised in the slightest if this strategist "speaking on the condition of anonymity" is engaged in an extended exercise in spin, since I find it difficult to imagine that anyone who's paid for his political advice could actually fear a Gingrich-Obama matchup more than a Romney-Obama matchup. But it's worth taking this argument seriously for a moment, because it reflects a common misconception about the Hispanic vote: Namely, that it contains a large bloc of voters that can be easily woo'd and won by any Republican who takes a liberal line on immigration, picks a Hispanic running mate, and engages in a little Spanish-language outreach.
In reality, Hispanics are a relatively normalswing constituency: They tilt Democratic overall and then tend to move toward one party or the other in much the same way that the country as a whole does, rather than swinging wildly left or right depending on whether the Republican candidate is willing to whisper the words "comprehensive immigration reform" at the correct frequency. For Hispanics as for most voters, pocketbook issues matter more than identity politics, and a candidate's overall ideological profile matters more than his positioning on a single issue. (Yes, a Republican who runs a nakedly xenophobic campaign is likely to have a particular problem with Latinos - but then again a nakedly xenophobic campaign is likely to turn off non-Hispanic swing voters as well.) George W. Bush won a larger-than-average share of the Hispanic vote because he campaigned as a center-right figure , not because of his particular focus on amnesty for illegal immigrants. John McCain won a smaller-than-average share because the Republican brand was tarnished in 2008 , not because the failure of comprehensive immigration reform had poisoned the well with Hispanic voters. And in 2012, there's no reason to think that a more polarizing candidate like Gingrich will be able to compensate for turning off swing voters by cleaning up among Hispanics: If he can't win white independents and white conservative Democrats, he probably won't be able to win Latino independents either.
I haven't been able to find a lot of polling on Hispanics and the G.O.P. primary field, but here's one poll that bears this point out. It shows Gingrich with higher name recognition than Romney among Hispanic voters, but weaker approval ratings: Romney gets a 28/25 favorable/unfavorable split, while Gingrich is underwater at 32/36. This probably reflects the fact that even though Romney is to Gingrich's right on immigration policy, he's perceived as more centrist overall - and that broad perception matters more than the details of their respective positions on border security and E-Verify and paths to citizenship. There isn't some clever double-secret "Hispanic path" to winning the White House, in other words. With Latinos as with whites, the more electable candidate is the more electable candidate, regardless of his stance on immigration.

HEADLINE: Bipartisan Push for Vast Transportation Bill

BYLINE: JENNIFER STEINHAUER


HIGHLIGHT: A bipartisan cadre of House members has quietly been coalescing around a large-scale, long-term transportation bill to address the country's myriad infrastructure needs. 

 BODY:
While Republicans and Democrats fight over how to pay for the extension of a payroll tax cut -- or whether to let it continue at all -- a bipartisan cadre of House members has quietly been coalescing around the notion of a large-scale, long-term transportation bill to address the country's myriad infrastructure needs.
In a letter to President Obama, more than 110 House members from both sides of the aisle are asking the White House to support a six-year transportation measure that would cover a wide array of transportation projects.
The letter does not specify how much those projects would cost.
In a nod to the austerity measures currently in vogue on the Hill when it comes to new projects, the letter says that "given our fiscal challenges, we recognize that a six-year transportation authorization will need to be paid for."
"We stand willing to work with your administration on a variety of funding options," it said. 
Transportation funding is popular across party lines, as most districts have significant needs, and transportation projects create jobs, help attract businesses and reduce traffic.
The letter is signed by an unusual array of lawmakers, including Representative Jerrold Nadler, a liberal Democrat from New York, and Representative Tim Scott of South Carolina, one of the most conservative Republican freshmen.
The idea for the letter belongs to two Democratic representatives, John Carney of Delaware and Jim Cooper of Tennessee, and two Republicans, Aaron Schock of Illinois and Pat Meehan of Pennsylvania.
Speaker John A. Boehner of Ohio has resisted transportation authorization bills, because they are known vehicles for earmarks, but earlier this year offered a bill without earmarks that would authorize transportation funding for five years. The legislation would be paid for by expanding domestic energy production, including opening the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge in Alaska for drilling and shale oil exploration.
Transportation authorization funding - one of a series of short-term extensions -- is set to run out early next year.
The letter follows:
Dec. 5, 2011
President Obama
The White House
1600 Pennsylvania Avenue, NW
Washington, DC 20500
Dear President Obama:
We are writing to respectfully urge your full support for a long-term transportation reauthorization. Such legislation will address our urgent transportation and infrastructure needs, create jobs for Americans and give the private sector important incentives to locate, invest and hire here in the United States.
The need for a long-term transportation authorization is clear to any American who drives a car or truck, rides the rails or flies in an airplane. First, our aging infrastructure risks creating a safety hazard for Americans. The American Society for Civil Engineers (ASCE) gives our transportation infrastructure a grade of "D," and a recent federal report estimated that more than 11 percent of the nation's bridges need timely repairs to avoid unsafe structural deficiencies.
Second, transportation backlogs increase costs for small businesses and hurt job creation and economic growth. The ASCE reports that the cost of failing to invest in the nation's roads and bridges would total $2.1 trillion in lost economic growth by 2020, costing 877,000 jobs. The ASCE went on to find that congestion by 2020 could cost us $276 billion a year in lost time and inefficiencies. As a result of using more fuel, lost productivity and accelerated auto-wear on worsening roads, the overall cost to a family's household budget would be $1,060 a year.
To address these urgent economic, transportation and safety needs, we believe our country needs a six-year, fully funded and paid-for transportation reauthorization with investments above current funding. Short-term extensions fail to recognize that meaningful, large-scale transportation projects take years to plan, approve and implement. The traditional six-year time-frame allows state departments of transportation to prepare for substantial infrastructure projects.
A modern, safe and efficient transportation authorization will not only create jobs now for the construction industry - facing a 13.3 percent unemployment rate - but it will also set the table for long-term job creation and economic growth. Global employers considering a presence in the United States will require a modern transportation infrastructure that enables them to move their finished products to the global market place in a timely and cost-efficient manner. Our aging and congested system is a strong disincentive for firms to expand their presence in the United States and create jobs here at home. A long-term transportation authorization will help make America more competitive in the global marketplace and create jobs in all sectors of our economy.
Given our fiscal challenges, we recognize that a six-year transportation authorization will need to be paid-for. We stand willing to work with your Administration on a variety of funding options. We have many ideas, but realize they are just a start and are happy to discuss others with you as well.
Thank you in advance for your help in supporting a long-term transportation reauthorization that will create a modern, safe and efficient infrastructure system and create jobs and promote long-term economic growth. We look forward to working with you further on this issue.
Sincerely,

HEADLINE: Campaign Ads Show Sharp Declines From 2008

BYLINE: JEREMY W. PETERS


HIGHLIGHT: More debates and fewer deep-pocketed candidates mean fewer campaign ads. 

 BODY:
At this point in 2007, Iowa residents had been subjected to 26,037 television commercials from presidential candidates and political groups in a barrage of advertising that was unparalleled.
So far this year? Iowans have been hit with just 8,697 television ads.
In New Hampshire the story is the same. In 2007 there had been 12,940 commercials. This year there have been 4,588. These figures were compiled by Kantar Media's Campaign Media Analysis Group.
The reasons for the decline are many. For starters, only one side of the race is competitive this time around. In the 2008 presidential election, both Democrats and Republicans had nominating fights. But there are other issues at play, too, like the lack of big bank accounts by a few of the Republican candidates (Rick Santorum and Michele Bachmann) and the decision by others to delay running active campaigns in certain early states (Mitt Romney in Iowa; Gov. Rick Perry in New Hampshire). And there have been an abundance of televised debates this year, which gives candidates the kind of wide exposure they would otherwise likely seek through advertising.
The money spent in both years also shows a wide disparity. Campaigns and political groups had spent $21.6 million in Iowa by this point in 2007, and another $13 million in New Hampshire. This year they have spent just $2.4 million in Iowa and $1.3 million in New Hampshire.
But even when compared to 2003, the last year only one party had a contested primary, the figures are smaller (and they don't take inflation into account). In Iowa, $2.7 million had been spent for a total of 13,957 spots. In New Hampshire the numbers were $1,597,760 spent on 4,588 spots.
Mr. Romney, Mr. Perry, Representative Ron Paul of Texas and Newt Gingrich are all running television ads at the moment. Mr. Gingrich was the latest to join the fray, with a $220,000 buy in Iowa. His 60-second commercial, which features him talking about rebuilding the economy as bucolic images of the American landscape flash on the screen, will run there through Dec. 19 on broadcast television and Fox News.
A Fox News-only buy is a popular strategy among the candidates. Mr. Perry and Mr. Romney have also purchased airtime exclusively on the cable network, including $40,000 worth of time that the former Massachusetts governor reserved on Monday in New Hampshire. That marked his first use of cable advertising in that state, which holds its primary on Jan. 10.

HEADLINE: When Will We Stop the Scapegoating?

BYLINE: DEEPA IYER


HIGHLIGHT: It is discouraging that ten years after the Sept. 11th attacks our communities are still seen as disloyal, foreign, automatically suspect and un-American. 

 BODY:
As the 2012 presidential election approaches, it has been difficult for me to listen to the political scapegoating of Muslims and those perceived to be Muslims. A decade ago, as an attorney at the Department of Justice, I worked with colleagues in the civil rights division to address the unprecedented backlash in the wake of the 9/11 attacks. We investigated complaints of brutal hate crimes in neighborhoods, vandalism at places of worship, bullying at schools, and discrimination in the workplace aimed primarily at those who traced their origins to South Asia and the Middle East, or those who practiced Islam, Sikhism and Hinduism.
After leaving government service, I joined a community of advocates who have been working to reaffirm our country's ideals of inclusion and respect for people of all backgrounds. As an immigrant from India who grew up in a Hindu household in Kentucky, my choice to participate in this work after 9/11 was clear. I believed then as I do now that our country would overcome the bigotry and xenophobia that followed the 9/11 attacks. At my current position at South Asian Americans Leading Together (SAALT), which includes individuals of various South Asian backgrounds and religious faiths, we have seen progress on many levels. But when it comes to the level of political discourse, it is discouraging that even though a decade has passed, our communities are still seen as disloyal, foreign, automatically suspect and un-American.
Some seem to think that the terrorist attacks of 9/11 and the "war on terror" give them free rein to indulge in biased and discriminatory speech directed at American Muslims and Americans of South Asian and Arab heritage. This openly bigoted speech reached a fever pitch with the Park51 controversy last year, with elected leaders from both parties playing a role in exacerbating Islamophobic sentiment. The ongoing congressional hearings on Muslims in America organized by Representative Peter King and the misguided attempts to ban Shariah law in several states have also contributed to this national climate.
It is uniquely disappointing to hear this type of prejudiced language coming out of the mouths of those seeking the presidency. Many of the Republican presidential candidates have either exploited the prejudice against Muslims or ducked the issue, apparently afraid of antagonizing a vocal minority of their party. Former House Speaker Newt Gingrich has suggested that Muslims are akin to Nazis. In the most recent CNN debate, former Senator Rick Santorum expressed his opinion that it would be acceptable to use ethnic and racial profiling against Muslims. Not to be outdone, Herman Cain (before his recent campaign suspension announcement) declared that the majority of Muslims hold extremist views, while Michele Bachmann has warned (before she became a presidential candidate) of the "tribalism" of Muslims.
Among the major presidential candidates, few have pushed back against the anti-Muslim statements emerging on the campaign trail. Mitt Romney has offered a mild response to the anti-Muslim proponents, saying, "We're not going to have Shariah law applied in U.S. courts. That's never going to happen. We have a Constitution and we follow the law. No, I think we recognize that the people of all faiths are welcome in this country." Ron Paul countered Santorum's comments regarding profiling, stating, "That's digging a hole for ourselves. What if they look like Timothy McVeigh?" Others, thus far, have been silent.
Biased political rhetoric is not limited to the presidential election. , a primary candidate challenging Democratic Representative Keith Ellison, one of two Muslims in Congress, recently tried to question Ellison's loyalty by pointing out that he had been sworn into office with a Koran.
SAALT's 2010 report, From Macacas to Turban Toppers: The Rise in Xenophobic and Racist Rhetoric in American Political Discourse, documents the steady rise in this type of language regardless of political persuasion. For those who feel targeted, everyday acts become fraught with anxiety. Just this summer, as the ten-year anniversary of 9/11 approached, people around the country spoke at community hearings about the ongoing isolation, fear and concern they have about practicing their faith, sending their children to school, turning to law enforcement or government agencies for assistance, or becoming the victims of hate crimes.
In fact, according to recent FBI reports, anti-Muslim hate crimes shot up a staggering 50% between 2009 and 2010. This ongoing trend of violence against community members affects non-Muslims as well, including recent potential hate crimes involving a turbaned Sikh man who was stabbed at the airport in Fresno and a Hindu man who was assaulted by a group of men at a grocery store in San Jose while being called a "terrorist."
Elected officials can play a role in reversing the tide. Presidential candidates ought to demonstrate their capacity for leadership by standing up against the voices of prejudice.
To his great credit, while the nation was reeling from the attacks of 9/11, President Bush spoke up strongly: "Here in the United States our Muslim citizens are making many contributions in business, science and law, medicine and education, and in other fields. Muslim members of our Armed Forces and of my administration are serving their fellow Americans with distinction." Later, in 2002, when the voices of prejudice arose again, President Bush reaffirmed his position: "Some of the comments that have been uttered about Islam do not reflect the sentiments of my government or the sentiments of most Americans. Islam, as practiced by the vast majority of people, is a peaceful religion, a religion that respects others. Ours is a country based upon tolerance and we welcome people of all faiths in America."
President Obama, just months into his presidency, made similar comments. "America and Islam are not exclusive," he said, "and need not be in competition. Instead, they overlap, and share common principles of justice and progress, tolerance and the dignity of all human beings."
As with all debates that involve political scapegoating and targeting of particular communities, there are essentially three camps - those who fan the flames of division, those who stand up against it, and those who adopt the path of staying on the sidelines. Every day, teachers, students, advocates and people from every walk of life make the right choice: to stand up against hatred, discrimination and negative rhetoric in our country's classrooms, workplaces and neighborhoods. Shouldn't we expect the same from our politicians?

HEADLINE: In Kansas, Obama Relishes His 'Deep' Roots

BYLINE: ASHLEY SOUTHALL


HIGHLIGHT: Following Theodore Roosevelt's footsteps in Kansas, Mr. Obama used his personal family narrative to appeal to the middle class. 

 BODY:
On a trip to his mother's home state to discuss the economy, President Obama showcased his Kansas lineage on Tuesday.
"As many of you know, I have roots here," he said to an effusive crowd in the gymnasium of Osawatomie High School. "I'm sure you're all familiar with the Obamas from Osawatomie." 
In fact, it was his mother's family, the Dunhams, that lived in Kansas until 1955.
Mr. Obama has never lived in Kansas, but he told the crowd that his mother, Stanley Ann Dunham, was born in Wichita to parents from the outlying suburbs: a mother from Augusta and a father from El Dorado. "So my Kansas roots run deep," he said.
The president used his speech on Tuesday to emphasize responsibility and fairness, declaring this a "make or break moment" for the middle class. It was a theme similar to that of a speech President Theodore Roosevelt gave in the same town in 1910.
By emphasizing his family's history on the United States mainland, which is less familiar to the public than his Kenyan ancestry and his childhood in Hawaii and Indonesia, Mr. Obama tried to tie his background to that of the mainstream middle class.
His grandparents, who raised him for a time in Hawaii, met and married in Wichita. When his mother was 18, she married his Kenyan father after they had met at the University of Hawaii. His father left the family when Mr. Obama was a toddler, visiting only once, in 1971, before he was killed in a car accident 11 years later.
Making an oblique reference to his father's absence, Mr. Obama said, "I got my name from my father, but I got my name and my values from my mother."
On Tuesday, he told the crowd that his grandfather had served in the Army in World War II while his grandmother worked on an assembly line making bombers as the United States recovered from the Great Depression and fought Axis powers abroad.
"They believed in an America where hard work paid off and responsibility was rewarded, and anyone could make it if they try, no matter who you were, where you came from -- no matter how you started out," he said. "And these values gave rise to the largest middle class and the strongest economy that the world has ever known. It was here in America that the most productive workers, the most innovative companies turned out the best products on earth."
It's not the first time that Mr. Obama has carried the family theme with him to Kansas. As a presidential candidate in 2008, he traveled to El Dorado during the Democratic primaries, where he told a crowd, "We're family." He lost the primary to Hillary Rodham Clinton, who is now secretary of state; he later picked its governor, Kathleen Sebelius, to be his health secretary.

HEADLINE: Poll Shows Age Gap in G.O.P. on Immigration

BYLINE: JULIA PRESTON


HIGHLIGHT: Younger Republicans are more in favor of establishing a path to citizenship for those immigrants in the country illegally. 

 BODY:
 With immigration now a front-burner issue in the Republican presidential contest, a new pollshows a substantial age gap among Republican voters over whether there should be a path to citizenship for immigrants who are in the country illegally. 
 A majority - 57 percent -- of Republicans who are 65 and older say that tighter border security and tough law enforcement should be the only focus of immigration policy, with no path to citizenship for illegal immigrants, according to a poll released Tuesday by the Pew Research Center for the People and the Press, a nonpartisan group in Washington. Only about one-quarter of this group, or 24 percent, favor combining strict enforcement with a path to citizenship for illegal immigrants. 
 Among Republicans who are younger than 30, the poll found, 42 percent favor a combined approach of tough enforcement against illegal immigration with a path to citizenship, while 30 percent wanted only enforcement. Among these younger Republicans, another 26 percent said that opening a path to citizenship should be the immigration priority, with or without tougher enforcement.
 The poll showed other differences. Among Republican voters who agreed with the Tea Party, 52 percent favored a policy based only on tougher enforcement. Among Republicans who disagreed with the Tea Party or had no opinion, 36 percent wanted only enforcement, while 44 percent favored policies pairing enforcement with a path to citizenship. 
 According to the poll, Republicans as a whole were about evenly divided between those who want only border security and tough enforcement - 43 percent - and those who want both enforcement and legalization for illegal immigrants- 41 percent. Only 14 percent of Republicans said the priority should be only on creating a path to citizenship. 
 The Pew findings seem to present a quandary for the Republican candidates, who have been working to frame the divisive issue of immigration to appeal to the largest number of primary voters. Older Republicans tend to be more engaged and turn out in larger numbers than younger voters, and though the Tea Party's popularity has shown a decline recently, its voters are active and remain influential within Republican ranks. 
Mitt Romney has tuned his strategy to respond to these conservative voters, rejecting any path to citizenship for illegal immigrants as an amnesty that would be a magnet to draw more illegal immigration. Newt Gingrich broke away from his rivals to say he would consider a path to legal status for some illegal immigrants who have lived in the United States for many years. 
 The Pew poll appears to point to a silent but substantial minority of Republicans who could support a legalization program for illegal immigrants if it were combined with rigorous enforcement. 
 Despite persistent high unemployment and the intensifying debate over illegal immigration, views among the general public have not changed over the last year, the Pew poll found. A plurality of 43 percent favors combining enforcement with a path to citizenship; 24 percent said the priority should be on a path to citizenship alone; and about 29 percent want only enforcement with no legalization program. 
 The poll is based on telephone interviews conducted Nov. 9 to 14 among a national sample of 2,001 adults 18 or over.

HEADLINE: The Tempting of the Christian Right

BYLINE: ROSS DOUTHAT


HIGHLIGHT: The real question for religious conservatives isn't whether they can trust Newt Gingrich; it's whether they can afford to be associated with him. 

 BODY:
More than any other Republican constituency, religious conservatives have good reasons to be wary of Newt Gingrich. As the leader of a right-wing insurgency in the early 1990s, he often kept their causes at arm's length - deliberately excluding issues like abortion and school prayer from the Contract With America, for instance. As Speaker of the House, he undercut their claim to the moral high ground by carrying on an extramarital affair even as his party was impeaching Bill Clinton for lying under oath about adultery.
During his years in the political wilderness, though, Gingrich found religion - both as a convert to the Roman Catholic Church and as a born-again champion of socially conservative causes. He's spent the last decade producing books and documentaries about America's Christian heritage. He raised money for a referendum to recall the judges who legalized same-sex marriage in Iowa. His public rhetoric borrows the tropes of the religious right - emphasizing the dangers of secularism, attacking the usurpations of activist judges, and so on. And when he talks about his checkered personal life, it's always in the language of sin, repentance and redemption.
Now his path to the nomination depends on this conversion paying off. If Gingrich hopes to outlast Mitt Romney, he needs to win over evangelicals wary of Mormonism and social conservatives worried about Romney's many flip-flops on their issues. He needs the Republican Party's values voters to forgive his past indiscretions and embrace him as their champion. And his rise in the polls has prompted a lively debate among religious conservatives, both in Iowa and nationally, about whether they should do just that - whether he's really changed, whether his various conversions are sincere, and whether they can trust him.
But these are the wrong questions. The real issue for religious conservatives isn't whether they can trust Gingrich. It's whether they can afford to be associated with him.
Conservative Christianity in America, both evangelical and Catholic, faces a looming demographic challenge: A rising generation that is more unchurched than any before it, more liberal on issues like gay marriage, and allergic to the apocalyptic rhetoric of the Pat Robertson-Jerry Falwell era. To many younger Americans, religious conservatism as they know it often seems to stand for a kind of institutionalized hypocrisy - a right-wing Tartufferie that's incensed by the idea of gay wedlock but tolerant of straight divorce, forgiving of Republican sins but judgmental about Democratic indiscretions, and eager to apply moral litmus tests only on issues that benefit the political right.
Rallying around Newt Gingrich, effectively making him the face of Christian conservatism in this Republican primary season, would ratify all of these impressions. It isn't just that he's a master of selective moral outrage whose newfound piety has been turned to consistently partisan ends. It's that his personal history - not only the two divorces, but also the repeated affairs and the way he behaved during the dissolution of his marriages - makes him the most compromised champion imaginable for a movement that's laboring to keep lifelong heterosexual monogamy on a legal and cultural pedestal.
For some religious conservatives, the big question for 2012 seems to be whether Gingrich has done enough to show contrition for these sins. Richard Land, the president of the Ethics and Religious
Liberty Commission of the Southern Baptist Convention, recently published an open letter urging the former Speaker to "address this issue of your marital past directly and transparently and ask folks to forgive you and give you their trust and their vote," suggesting that he should "pick a pro-family venue and give a speech (not an interview) addressing your marital history once and for all."
But repentance isn't the issue here. Of course Christians are obliged to forgive a penitent, whatever his offenses - though a cynic might note that it's easy for an adulterer to express contrition once he's safely married to his mistress. But one can forgive a sinner without necessarily deciding that he should be anointed as the standard bearer for the very cause that he betrayed. Contrition is supposed to be its own reward. There's no obligation to throw in the presidency as well.
In a climate of culture war, any spokesman for conservative Christianity is destined to be a polarizing figure. (Just ask Tim Tebow.) But a religious right that rallied around Gingrich would be putting the worst possible face on its cause and at the worst possible time.
His candidacy isn't a test of religious conservatives' willingness to be good, forgiving Christians. It's a test of their ability to see their cause through outsiders' eyes, and to recognize what anointing a thrice-married adulterer as the champion of "family values" would say to the skeptical, the unconverted and above all to the young.

HEADLINE: Markets Optimistic a Resolution To the Euro Crisis Will Be Found

BYLINE: By BLOOMBERG NEWS

 BODY:
Stocks rose on Tuesday, sending the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index higher a second day, on speculation that European leaders may act to contain the debt crisis after S.& P. put 15 euro nations on review for possible downgrade.
Shares of 3M rose, after it said revenue might increase as much as 6 percent next year as a result of acquisitions. General Electric shares rose more than 2 percent after Sanford C. Bernstein & Company raised its recommendation. And stock in Darden Restaurants, which operates the Olive Garden and Red Lobster chains, tumbled 12 percent after it cut its full-year sales and profit growth forecasts. 
The S.& P. 500 advanced 1.39 points, or 0.11 percent, to 1,258.47. The Dow Jones industrial average added 52.30 points, or 0.43 percent, to 12,150.13. And the Nasdaq composite index fell 6.20 points, or 0.23 percent, to 2,649.56.
The German finance minister, Wolfgang Schauble, said S.& P.'s warning would help force European leaders to redouble efforts to resolve the crisis. S.& P. said on Tuesday that the European Financial Stability Facility might lose its top credit rating if the debt grade of any of its guarantors was cut.
''Europe is going to be an ongoing story,'' said Thomas Garcia, head of equity trading at Thornburg Investment Management in Santa Fe, N.M. ''It seems like every day they've got a new solution of the problem. I hear at least one new story of a bailout package every day. Is this really what's going to bail them out?''
Shares of 3M rallied 1.5 percent, to $82.13. Sales for 2012 may be $30.2 billion to $31.5 billion, according to a presentation on the company's Web site, in line with the $30.6 billion average estimate from analysts surveyed by Bloomberg. The company expects earnings per share of $6.25 to $6.50 next year, also tracking estimates.
G.E. shares rose 2.4 percent, to $16.72. Sanford C. Bernstein raised its recommendation for the company to outperform, from market perform, citing rising dividends and energy orders starting in 2012.
Shares of Eli Lilly & Company increased 3.9 percent, to $38.86, their highest price since Nov. 8. The company's stock could rise more than 50 percent should its drug for Alzheimer's disease succeed, Sanford C. Bernstein said in a note to clients.
A gauge of 12 home builders in S.& P. indexes rallied 1.2 percent. Toll Brothers shares gained 2.7 percent, to $21.30. The company, the nation's largest luxury-home builder, reported earnings that beat analysts' estimates as prices rose and sales improved at its East Coast communities.
MetroPCS Communications shares jumped 7.8 percent, to $9, for the biggest gain in the S.& P. 500. A pay-as-you-go wireless carrier, MetroPCS was raised to outperform, from market perform, at William Blair & Company, which said the stock's price did not reflect the company's ''healthy balance sheet.''
Stock in Darden, the restaurant operator, slid 12 percent after it said sales and profit this year would grow more slowly than previously forecast as it worked to revive its Olive Garden chain.
A measure of transportation shares had the biggest decline in the S.& P. 500 among 24 industries, falling 0.8 percent. Union Pacific lost 1.7 percent, to $102.84.
Interest rates were higher. The Treasury's benchmark 10-year note fell 15/32, to 99 8/32, and the yield rose to 2.09 percent, from 2.03 percent.

HEADLINE: A Reluctant Enemy

BYLINE: By IAN W. TOLL. 
Ian W. Toll is the author of ''Pacific Crucible: War at Sea in the Pacific, 1941-1942.''

 BODY:
San Francisco
ON a bright Hawaiian Sunday morning 70 years ago today, hundreds of Japanese warplanes appeared suddenly over Pearl Harbor and laid waste to the United States Pacific Fleet. The American people boiled over in righteous fury, and America plunged into World War II. The ''date which will live in infamy'' was the real turning point of the war, which had been raging for more than two years, and it opened an era of American internationalism and global security commitments that continues to this day.
By a peculiar twist of fate, the Japanese admiral who masterminded the attack had persistently warned his government not to fight the United States. Had his countrymen listened, the history of the 20th century might have turned out much differently. 
Adm. Isoroku Yamamoto foresaw that the struggle would become a prolonged war of attrition that Japan could not hope to win. For a year or so, he said, Japan might overrun locally weak Allied forces -- but after that, its war economy would stagger and its densely built wood-and-paper cities would suffer ruinous air raids. Against such odds, Yamamoto could ''see little hope of success in any ordinary strategy.'' His Pearl Harbor operation, he confessed, was ''conceived in desperation.'' It would be an all-or-nothing gambit, a throw of the dice: ''We should do our best to decide the fate of the war on the very first day.''
During the Second World War and for years afterward, Americans despised Yamamoto as an archvillain, the perpetrator of an ignoble sneak attack, a personification of ''Oriental treachery.'' Time magazine published his cartoon likeness on its Dec. 22, 1941, cover -- sinister, glowering, dusky yellow complexion -- with the headline ''Japan's Aggressor.'' He was said to have boasted that he would ''dictate terms of peace in the White House.''
Yamamoto made no such boast -- the quote was taken out of context from a private letter in which he had made precisely the opposite point. He could not imagine an end to the war short of his dictating terms in the White House, he wrote -- and since Japan could not hope to conquer the United States, that outcome was inconceivable.
In fact, Yamamoto was one of the most colorful, charismatic and broad-minded naval officers of his generation. He had graduated from the Japanese Naval Academy in 1904, during the Russo-Japanese War. As a 21-year-old ensign, he fought in one of the most famous sea battles in history -- the Battle of Tsushima, in 1905, a lopsided Japanese victory that shocked the world and forced Czar Nicholas II to sue for peace. Yamamoto was wounded in the action and wore the scars to prove it -- his lower midsection was badly pockmarked by shrapnel, and he lost two fingers on his left hand.
In the course of his naval career, he traveled widely through the United States and Europe, learning enough English -- mostly during a two-year stint at Harvard soon after World War I -- to read books and newspapers and carry on halting conversations. He read several biographies of Lincoln, whom he admired as a man born into poverty who rose to become a ''champion'' of ''human freedom.''
From 1926 to 1928 he served as naval attache in Washington; while in America, he journeyed alone across the country, paying his way with his own meager salary, stretching his budget by staying in cheap hotels and skipping meals. His travels revealed the growing power of the American industrial machine. ''Anyone who has seen the auto factories in Detroit and the oil fields in Texas,'' he would later remark, ''knows that Japan lacks the national power for a naval race with America.''
Yamamoto didn't drink; for vices, he preferred women and gambling. He played shogi (Japanese chess), poker and bridge aggressively, and for high stakes. In Tokyo, Yamamoto spent his nights among the geishas of the Shinbashi district, who nicknamed him 80 sen. (A manicure cost one yen, equivalent to 100 sen; since he had only eight fingers he demanded a discount.)
When Yamamoto appeared in uniform, on the deck of his flagship or before Emperor Hirohito, he was the picture of hatchet-faced solemnity. But in other settings he was prone to sentimentality, as when he freely wept at the death of a subordinate, or poured out his heart in letters to his geisha lover.
During the political turmoil of the 1930s, Yamamoto was a leading figure in the navy's moderate ''treaty faction,'' known for its support of unpopular disarmament treaties. He criticized the mindlessly bellicose rhetoric of the ultranationalist right and opposed the radicals who used revolutionary violence and assassinations to achieve their ends. He despised the Japanese Army and its leaders, who subverted the power of civilian ministers and engineered military adventures in Manchuria and other parts of China.
As navy vice minister from 1936 to 1939, Yamamoto staked his life on forestalling an alliance with Nazi Germany. Right-wing zealots condemned him as a ''running dog'' of the United States and Britain and vowed to assassinate him. A bounty was reportedly placed on his head. He received letters warning him of an impending punishment ''on heaven's behalf,'' and authorities discovered a plot to blow up a bridge as he passed over it.
In August 1939, Yamamoto was named commander in chief of the Combined Fleet, the highest seagoing command in the Japanese Navy. (As it placed him beyond the reach of his enemies, the appointment probably saved his life.) From his flagship, Nagato, usually anchored in Hiroshima Bay, Yamamoto continued to warn against joining with the Nazis. He reminded his government that Japan imported around four-fifths of its oil and steel from areas controlled by the Allies. To risk conflict, he wrote, was foolhardy, because ''there is no chance of winning a war with the United States for some time to come.''
But Japan's confused and divided government drifted toward war while refusing to face the strategic problems it posed. It signed the Tripartite Pact with Germany and Italy in Berlin in September 1940. As Yamamoto had predicted, the American government quickly restricted and finally cut off exports of oil and other vital materials. The sanctions brought events to a head, because Japan had no domestic oil production to speak of, and would exhaust its stockpiles in about a year.
Yamamoto realized he had lost the fight to keep Japan out of war, and he fell in line with the planning process. But he continued to ask critical questions. Two decades of strategic planning for a war with the United States had envisioned a clash of battleships in the western Pacific -- a decisive battle like that at Tsushima. But Yamamoto now asked: What if the American fleet declined to play its part? What if the Americans instead chose to bide their time and build up their strength?
IN 1940, President Franklin D. Roosevelt ordered the fleet to Pearl Harbor. He had intended to signal that the United States Navy was in striking distance of Japan -- but ''conversely,'' Yamamoto observed, ''we're within striking distance, too. In trying to intimidate us, America has put itself in a vulnerable position. If you ask me, they're just that bit too confident.'' Therein lay the germ of his plan to launch a sudden carrier air attack on the Hawaiian stronghold.
Adm. Osami Nagano, chief of the Naval General Staff, stiffly resisted the proposed raid. His planners worried that it would expose the Japanese aircraft carriers to devastating counterstrikes. Yamamoto countered that the American Fleet was a ''dagger pointed at Japan's heart,'' and surmised that the attack might even cause the Americans to recoil in shock and despair, ''so that the morale of the U.S. Navy and the American people goes down to such an extent that it cannot be recovered.'' At last, he threatened to resign unless his operation was approved, and Admiral Nagano capitulated: ''If he has that much confidence, it's better to let Yamamoto go ahead.''
Yamamoto appreciated the irony: having risked his life to prevent war with the United States, he was now its architect. ''What a strange position I find myself in,'' he wrote a friend, ''having been assigned the mission diametrically opposed to my own personal opinion, with no choice but to push full speed in pursuance of that mission. Alas, is that fate?''
And yet even in the final weeks of peace, Yamamoto continued to urge that the wiser course was not to fight the United States at all. ''We must not start a war with so little a chance of success,'' he told Admiral Nagano. He recommended abrogating the Tripartite Pact and pulling Japanese troops out of China. Finally, he hoped that the emperor would intervene with a ''sacred decision'' against war. But the emperor remained silent.
On Dec. 7, 1941, all eight battleships of the Pacific Fleet were knocked out of action in the first half hour of the conflict. More than 180 American planes were destroyed, mostly on the ground, representing about two-thirds of the total American military aircraft in the Pacific theater. The Japanese carriers escaped with the loss of just 29 planes.
The Japanese people exulted, and Yamamoto was lifted in their eyes to the status of a demigod. Now he could dictate his wishes to the Tokyo admirals, and would continue to do so until his death in April 1943, when American fighters shot down his aircraft in the South Pacific.
And yet, Pearl Harbor aside, Yamamoto was not a great admiral. His strategic blunders were numerous and egregious, and were criticized even by his own subordinate officers.
Indeed, from a strategic point of view, Pearl Harbor was one of the most spectacular miscalculations in history. It aroused the American people to wage total, unrelenting war until Japan was conquered. Yamamoto was also directly responsible for Japan's cataclysmic defeat at the Battle of Midway, and for the costly failure of his four-month campaign to recapture the island of Guadalcanal.
But perhaps the most important part of Yamamoto's legacy was not his naval career at all, but the part he played in the boisterous politics of prewar Japan. He was one of the few Japanese leaders of his generation who found the moral courage to tell the truth -- that waging war against the United States would invite a national catastrophe. As Japan lay in ashes after 1945, his countrymen would remember his determined exertions to stop the slide toward war. In a sense, Isoroku Yamamoto was vindicated by Japan's defeat.
Correction: December 16, 2011, Friday
This article has been revised to reflect the following correction: An Op-Ed essay on Dec. 7 about Adm. Isoroku Yamamoto, the architect of the Pearl Harbor attack, misstated the proportion of American military aircraft destroyed in the assault. It was two-thirds of the aircraft based on the island of Oahu, not two-thirds of the aircraft based in the Pacific theater.

HEADLINE: China's Allure in Drug Research

BYLINE: By ROBERT CYRAN and GEORGE HAY

 BODY:
Drug research tends to follow spending. Take Merck's pledge on Tuesday to invest $1.5 billion in research and development in China over five years. Citizens of emerging economies are growing wealthier and living longer, while the fiscal health of their governments is robust. Merck's step suggests that the pharmaceutical industry's center of gravity is shifting eastward accordingly.
Growth in developed markets, where drug companies make most of their sales, is slowing to a crawl. The blockbusters of a few years ago are losing patent protection while cash-starved governments are clamping down on the prices they're willing to pay for state-financed medical programs. In the United States, which accounts for more than a third of total revenue for the sector, drug sales increased only 2 percent last year, according to IMS Health. 
In some faster-growing economies, by contrast, drug sales are increasing 20 percent a year or faster. And China's importance cannot be overstated. It will become the second-biggest pharmaceuticals market in the world by 2020, IMS reckons, as the government carries out its $125 billion basic health care plan for all citizens.
It makes sense for drug companies to follow the money. R.& D. is cheaper in emerging markets, partly because places like India and China are pumping out lots of science and engineering graduates. The quality of these researchers and the clinical trials they perform can fall short of the rigorous standards established in developed markets. But both seem to be improving. Also, Merck and its rivals have a better chance of success fighting diseases like hepatitis B and esophageal cancer -- both far more common in China than elsewhere -- if they conduct research and trials on the ground.
Western worries over intellectual property theft haven't gone away. Merck's move is modest: a $300 million annual R.& D. budget in China would equal only 4 percent of the $8 billion the company is on track to spend this year. But by investing in China, Merck and competitors like Novartis are establishing bridgeheads in an important market. They won't be alone. For drug companies, ''Go East'' is likely to be a reliable refrain for some time.
British Bank Help
The Bank of England is preparing for the worst. It announced on Tuesday a new facility to help domestic lenders if the euro zone crisis causes a full-fledged freeze in short-term financing markets. But lenders may still need more help.
The central bank already has two ways to combat liquidity squeezes. It allows banks to borrow against liquid collateral for three or six months through its indexed long-term repo auctions. And it allows desperate banks to swap illiquid collateral for gilts for up to a year using its Discount Window Facility -- in return for a fat fee and big haircuts.
In some senses, the new Extended Collateral Term Repo facility is a halfway house. It uses a similar auction structure to the long-term repo auctions but allows banks to pledge discount-window-style collateral for a minimum fee of 1.25 percentage points over the bank's base rate. As such, it goes some way to filling the gap left by the now-defunct Special Liquidity Scheme, the crisis facility that allowed British banks to swap illiquid mortgage-backed securities for liquid Treasury bills for up to three years.
The extended collateral plan, however, will last only 30 days at a time.
That may help avoid a collapse but won't provide much long-term reassurance. Contrast the Bank of England's approach with that of the European Central Bank, which is being pressured to offer facilities that last for two or even three years.
Even though Britain is not in the euro zone, its banks are suffering from the same long-term funding drought as rivals on the Continent. That's worrying because, according to the bank's own figures, British lenders have to roll over $:140 billion of term financing next year.
But the Bank of England has rightly judged that providing long-term funding is not its job. That's a task for the government, which could reopen its Credit Guarantee Scheme, a $:250 billion program that allowed banks to weather the 2008 crisis by issuing new long-term debt insured by the state.
In Britain, many European countries, a sovereign guarantee still carries credibility -- 10-year gilts are now yielding just 2.3 percent.
Now that the bank has readied itself, the British Treasury should follow suit.

HEADLINE: Rising Foot Traffic Redefines 'Crowded'

BYLINE: By SAM ROBERTS

 BODY:
-Feeling congested? Not your nose, your toes. City surveys confirm that sidewalks are becoming more crowded. And transportation officials say that's good for the economy, the environment and for your physical, if not necessarily emotional, health.
-Since the city began keeping score at 50 of the busiest intersections five years ago, its ''pedestrian volume index'' has climbed steadily, except for one year, from 2008 to 2009, perhaps because of the recession. Fixing the volume in 2007 at a base of 100, the index rose by more than 10 percent, to 113.2, last May.
They surveys are taken each May and September. Preliminary figures for September suggest a greater increase again. The volume on West 14th Street between Hudson Street and Eighth Avenue soared by 58 percent from the year before. New Yorkers not only talk the talk - they walk the walk. 
-''Everybody is a pedestrian at some point,'' said Janette Sadik-Khan, the transportation commissioner. ''It's staggering when you think how many people are walking the streets of New York City at any given time.''
-How many? About 350,000 a day in Times Square, 97,000 on Main Street in Flushing, Queens, and 80,000 on East Fordham Road in the Bronx, according to a 2007 study.
-Surveyors wielding hand-held counters found 31,701 people on West 34th Street between Broadway and Seventh Avenue from 4 p.m. to 7 p.m. on May 10 and 26,106 on Fifth Avenue between East 54th and 55th Streets during the same time period two days later. On West 14th between Hudson and Eighth, the volume was 11,166 in September, according to preliminary figures, compared with 8,911 in May and 7,0555 the previous September.
-The least crowded of the 50 corridors in all five boroughs was Victory Boulevard between Bay Street and Van Duzer Street on Staten Island, which was traversed by 1,215 pedestrians between 4 p.m. and 7 p.m. on May 19.
-''These include millionaires who like to walk and people without the wherewithal to get around any other way,'' Ms. Sadik-Khan said, referring to the city's strollers.
-The Transportation Department has been widening sidewalks where possible and expanding pedestrian malls to make room for more pedestrians because streets that are too crowded can become unsafe and hamper business. Pedestrian volume has increased 12 percent in Times Square since vehicular traffic on parts of Broadway was curbed.
-The problem is defining ''too crowded.'' A department consultant, Gehl Architects, says the maximum volume for comfortable pedestrian movement is 12 people per minute per yard of sidewalk width. By that measure, Main Street in Flushing is overcrowded 83 percent of the day. Is there a saturation point?
''People like to be around people,'' Ms. Sadik-Khan said. ''With 8.4 million people, you don't live here unless you like people. And with 6,000 miles of streets, the challenge is re-engineering the real estate to deliver attractive, safe and sustainable streets.''
That includes adding benches - the city is installing 1,000 new ones - and signs to guide pedestrians.
-''At any given time,'' Ms. Sadik-Khan said, ''you have 10 percent of New Yorkers who will admit they were lost in the previous week.''
By some measures, pedestrians are more likely to spend money than drivers.
''There's a direct relation between how people get around and how much money they spend,'' Ms. Sadik-Khan said. ''A pedestrian can just stop and walk into a store, which means more feet in the door and across the threshold.''
-Walking, she said, ''is the most affordable way to get around, better for your health, for the planet. We continue to engineer our streets to make them safer for pedestrians.''
In fact, having more people walking the streets has not made them more dangerous.
Traffic fatalities involving pedestrians have declined 21 percent over the past decade, transportation officials say.
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

HEADLINE: Big Firms Limit Paying State Taxes, Study Finds

BYLINE: By MICHAEL COOPER

 BODY:
As states have struggled to balance their budgets by cutting services, laying off workers and raising taxes, a study to be released on Wednesday suggests that many profitable Fortune 500 companies have not been paying as much in state corporate income taxes as the average levied on American companies, with some big firms paying none at all in recent years. 
A few companies, including DuPont, reported paying no state corporate income taxes from 2008 to 2010 even as they reported profits, according to the study, which was conducted by Citizens for Tax Justice and the Institute on Taxation and Economic Policy, nonprofit research organizations in Washington that advocate a more progressive tax code. (A spokeswoman for DuPont said that she had not seen the study, but that ''DuPont complies with all tax laws and regulations'' wherever it operates.)
This year, there has been a great deal of discussion about whether corporations are paying their fair share of federal taxes. But the issue resonates at the state level as well, where corporate taxes have long been a shrinking share of state revenues. While corporate income taxes made up 9.7 percent of state revenues in 1980, according to the Nelson A. Rockefeller Institute of Government, they now make up only an estimated 5.7 percent.
To gauge how much Fortune 500 companies are paying in corporate income taxes, the study looked at the 265 of them that are both profitable and disclose their state tax payments. It found that 68 reported paying no state corporate taxes in at least one year between 2008 and 2010. All together, the study found that the companies reported $1.33 trillion in domestic profits from 2008 to 2010, but paid states only about half of what they would have if they had paid at the average corporate income tax rate of all states -- reducing their state taxes by some $42.7 billion.
Matthew Gardner, the executive director of the Institute on Taxation and Economy Policy, said that state corporate-tax collections have dwindled for several reasons. Many states calculate their taxes based on federal corporate taxes, so some recent federal corporate tax breaks have lowered their collections. Other states have granted their own tax breaks to try to promote economic development, or to lure companies from other states. Companies, meanwhile, have grown adept at reducing taxes and finding tax shelters.
''The math is different at the state level than it is at the federal level,'' Mr. Gardner said in an interview. ''State lawmakers don't have the luxury of cutting taxes and not worrying how to pay for it -- they've got balanced budget requirements, which mean, inexorably, that if you cut a tax you have to pay for it either by hiking another tax or by cutting spending.''
Mr. Gardner said one limit of the study was that it showed only how much companies paid in total state taxes, not what they paid in each state. He said that for state officials to judge whether their tax codes are effective and fair, they should analyze what big companies are paying.

HEADLINE: The Defense Department in Their Midst

BYLINE: By FRED A. BERNSTEIN

 BODY:
ALEXANDRIA, Va. -- On a recent Friday afternoon, employees trickled out of two new office buildings here; some waited at bus stops, while others retrieved cars from a sprawling above-ground garage. Traffic leaving the office complex and turning onto public streets was light.
The orderly scene belied a controversy -- which has reached even the halls of Congress -- over the two buildings in the multiuse development known as the Mark Center. They were built as a result of a recommendation by the Base Realignment and Closure Commission that Defense Department workers move out of leased spaces in parts of Northern Virginia by Sept. 15 of this year.
The idea was to consolidate Defense Department offices in Northern Virginia, saving the government money and protecting employees from terrorist attacks like the one that destroyed the Alfred P. Murrah Federal Building in Oklahoma City in 1995.
But critics of the project, which has cost nearly $1 billion, say it is unclear whether it has achieved either of those goals. 
A publicly held company, Duke Realty, developed the 1.75-million-square-foot project and turned it over to the government. The department paid Duke $105 million for the land under the buildings, and an additional $848 million for the structures themselves. Some 3,600 employees have moved into the towers, and 2,800 more are expected by September 2012, said Kawanza Yates, a strategic communications officer for the Washington Headquarters Services. The headquarters services, which performs administrative functions for the Pentagon, is the main occupant of the buildings.
Representative James P. Moran, Democrat of Virginia, whose district includes Alexandria, has predicted that all those new workers would bring traffic chaos to Interstate 395 and other roads. Mr. Moran and other members of Virginia's Congressional delegation sought legislation limiting the number of cars that could be parked at the Mark Center. When that failed, they wrote to the defense secretary, Leon E. Panetta, asking him to delay the move. Ms. Yates said the department ''phased the final move-ins'' to the extent possible.
But others have concerns far more serious than traffic. In April, the Project on Government Oversight, a nonprofit watchdog group, warned Mr. Panetta's predecessor, Robert M. Gates, in a letter that a truck bomb ''could easily be detonated in close proximity to the proposed new building, killing hundreds to thousands of D.O.D. and contractor support employees.'' The department has not responded to the letter, said Nick Schwellenbach, the group's director of investigations.
In September, Mayor William D. Euille of Alexandria wrote to President Obama, saying he was ''disturbed'' by potential security vulnerabilities at the Mark Center.
And the nonprofit research group CNA, which includes the Center for Naval Analyses and has offices at the Mark Center, asserts that its facilities ''are now considered a magnet for terrorist or criminal activity'' as part of a $45 million suit against Duke Realty and other defendants.
Six years ago, the Base Realignment and Closure Commission concluded that Defense Department offices in commercial buildings in the section of Arlington called Crystal City, near the Pentagon and Reagan National Airport, presented easy targets for terrorists.
The panel first called for moving the Crystal City workers to Fort Belvoir, an Army installation in southern Fairfax County. But after it became clear that there was not enough room there, the department began looking for other locations.
In 2008, it issued a request for proposals. The owners of the Victory Center, a development in Alexandria, and Duke Realty, which has owned much of the Mark Center since 2006, responded.
The Mark Center, unlike the Victory Center, is miles from the nearest Metro station. To local officials worried about congestion in Alexandria, the lack of Metro access seem to doom the Mark Center proposal. ''We didn't think that it would be selected because it lacked the transportation,'' Mayor Euille said.
But in September 2008, the government announced that it had chosen the Mark Center. According to Mayor Euille, ''The only answer we've gotten out of D.O.D. is that it was more economical for them to be at this site than the other site.''
Once the decision was made, the land was transferred by Duke Realty to the federal government, which made it, officially, a part of Fort Belvoir. That means that it has been removed from Alexandria's tax rolls. Safety was left to the Defense Department. According to the department's Minimum Antiterrorism Standards for Buildings, issued in 2003 and revised in 2007, ''The primary design strategy is to keep terrorists as far away from inhabited D.O.D. buildings as possible.'' But the Mark Center buildings loom over Interstate 395, one of the most heavily trafficked highways in the country, and access roads within the center are in close proximity to the buildings.
In April, Reuters reported that a study of the impact of a truck bomb on the Mark Center, found on an Army Corps of Engineers Web site, indicated that the buildings were designed to withstand an explosion equivalent to 220 pounds of TNT, far less than what was used to nearly demolish the Murrah Building.
Ms. Yates wrote in an e-mail that the Mark Center buildings were designed and constructed to meet applicable antiterrorism standards. She added, ''In addition to the outward and visible signs of force protection forces and facilities protective measures, there are also extensive, less visible, physical force protection features.''
In the suit filed by CNA, which is at 4825 Mark Center Drive, the group says its 750 employees no longer feel safe at Mark Center, and that the value of its leasehold, for about 160,000 square feet, has been seriously diminished.
The center pays about $4.7 million in rent, along with $1.9 million in building costs, each year, for a total rent of about $41 a square foot, according to its spokeswoman, Constance Custer. In its complaint, it said that Duke Realty and other defendants ''are reaping the benefits of the new buildings and all the new development, while CNA is stuck paying the tab through degraded conditions, lost productivity and a rent far higher than the market would support for this property.''
Peter S. Scholz, the senior vice president of Duke Realty's Washington operations, said that he would not comment on the allegations but that he hoped the matter would be resolved at a hearing on Dec. 14.
As for traffic, the predicted jams have not occurred, even though a new report from the Pentagon's inspector general said the Army used flawed traffic data in justifying the employee transfers.
Traffic-reduction measures taken by the Department of Defense include incentives for car pooling and increasing the frequency of buses to the nearest Metro station. And the Virginia Department of Transportation plans to spend $80 million to construct an off-ramp from Interstate 395.
To keep employees on the grounds, the buildings include a cafeteria, a barber shop, a fitness center, a medical clinic and a credit union. On the recent Friday, Defense Department employees praised the bus service and said the car pooling incentives were working.
Even Mayor Euille said, ''Right now, other than some minor traffic hiccups, things seem to be going along pretty smoothly.''
But he was not entirely sanguine. ''One would have to question why any of it was done, to be very frank,'' he said of the move to the Mark Center. ''A lot of silly things happen with the BRAC.''

HEADLINE: Back at Cubicle After a Break, To Run Somalia

BYLINE: By JOHN LELAND

 BODY:
BUFFALO -- At his cubicle at the State Transportation Department building here, Mohamed Abdullahi Mohamed recounted what he did during a recent leave of absence. He trimmed the size of the federal government. He instituted regular paychecks for the military. He campaigned against corruption. And he avoided being shot.
''Every morning when I was brushing my teeth I heard bullets hitting the metal over my window,'' Mr. Mohamed said. ''It was like, pop pop pop pop. The first day I was shocked. But after that I knew the bullets would not get through, so I continued brushing.''
Mr. Mohamed, 49, smiled genially over the neutral-toned cubicle dividers and file cabinets of the state office building. For eight months, starting last November, he was the prime minister of his native country, Somalia, one of the most chaotic nations on earth. And then, as suddenly as he had left, he was back in his cubicle at the Transportation Department, where he makes sure the department's contracts and contractors comply with nondiscrimination and affirmative action requirements. 
''This is my life,'' he said.
Mr. Mohamed, who has lived in the United States since 1985, said he had no plan to join the Somali government when friends helped him arrange a meeting with the country's president, Sheik Sharif Sheik Ahmed, in September 2010 during a meeting of the United Nations General Assembly in New York. Mr. Mohamed said he talked to the president about how factions in government might cooperate, drawing on his own experience working with difficult contractors in Erie County. At the time, the president had just dismissed his previous prime minister.
As soon as Mr. Mohamed returned to Buffalo, he said, his friends called to say the president liked his ideas -- and would he consider submitting his resume to be prime minister?
''My wife was not supportive of the idea,'' he said. ''But I told her, if I don't do it, who will? I said, violence comes from conflicts, and I've learned how to resolve conflicts. That's exactly what I do here.''
Richard Downie, deputy director of the Africa program at the Center for Strategic and International Studies in Washington, said that because so many Somali professionals had left the country, emigres working in other countries were sometimes tapped for high government positions. One chief of staff in the Somali military had been working as an assistant manager in a McDonald's in Germany, Mr. Downie said.
On Oct. 14, 2010, after a meeting with Somalia's president in Mogadishu, Mr. Mohamed was appointed prime minister, and by November he was on the job, governing a country ravaged by terrorism and on the brink of dire famine.
''I called my wife every other night so she would know I'm still here,'' he said. His interior minister was killed by a suicide bomb carried by the minister's niece.
''It was a risk,'' he said. ''But if you want to do good things, a position like that comes with a level of personal risk.'' His salary was the same as what he earns at the Transportation Department, from which he took a one-year leave of absence.
Mr. Mohamed grew up in the capital city, Mogadishu, the son of a government airline administrator. He joined the Somali ministry of foreign affairs in 1982, and was transferred to Washington in 1985. After he criticized the Somali government in 1988, he applied for asylum in the United States, fearing for his safety if he returned to Somalia.
''I knew if I went home anything could happen,'' he said.
Because he had relatives in Toronto, he moved to Buffalo, where he earned a bachelor's degree and a master's in political science at the State University of New York at Buffalo and became part of a local expatriate community of about 1,000 Somalis, he said.
The culture shock was profound.
''Take appointments,'' he said. ''Here you have to be on time. Back home that was not a huge issue. Maybe you could be one and a half hours late. That's why the diaspora can make a big difference in Somalia, because we can take back what we learned in the first world.''
As prime minister, Mr. Mohamed assembled a cabinet of technocrats to run the country, reducing the cabinet's size to 18 from 39, most from outside the country. He campaigned against corruption and set up a regular payroll for the military.
''He came in talking tough on corruption,'' Mr. Downie said. ''And there was quite a lot of public demonstration of support for him. But there's little evidence of any improvement made. The ultimate verdict is that his heart was in the right place; he went in and was immediately fed to the sharks.''
The sharks in this case were the president and the speaker of Parliament, Sharif Hassan Sheik Adan, who in June settled a long and bitter fight for power by sacrificing Mr. Mohamed, who was allied with the president. ''That was the downfall of Mohamed,'' Mr. Mohamed said. ''Temporary, I hope.''
Government soldiers and civilians rioted in protest, saying Mr. Mohamed was the government's only honest leader. He was replaced by his former deputy, Abdiweli Mohamed Ali, who was an economics professor at Niagara University, near Buffalo. By June, Mr. Mohamed was back in Buffalo. ''My job here was always something to fall back on if Somalia didn't work out,'' he said.
Mr. Mohamed said he was enjoying not having to look over his shoulder for assassins and to be living at home with his wife and four children.
Some critics have questioned Mr. Mohamed's public stance against corruption, and an audit of the transitional government recommended forensic investigations of his office as well as of those of the president, speaker and other officials. A United Nations report in July called ''endemic corruption of the leadership'' in Somalia the ''greatest impediment'' to a working government.
''If the argument is that he fought corruption, it's either a smoke screen or he's absurdly incompetent,'' said J. Peter Pham, director of the Michael S. Ansari Africa Center at the Atlantic Council in Washington. ''Corruption grew during his tenure as prime minister.''
Mr. Mohamed said he tried to combat corruption from inside the government. ''That's why we won the hearts and minds of people,'' he said.
Some of the challenges in Somalia were the same as they are at the Transportation Department, he said. ''When I'm here, I'm helping minorities,'' he said. ''And over there, it's a different capacity and responsibility, but the purpose is the same.''
But he said he hoped to return to Somalia, perhaps even to run for president. ''It's a mixed feeling to be here,'' he said. ''I believe I have some duty to go back one day and play some role. I don't know what that role will be.''
Janine Shepherd, who works in the next cubicle, said she was glad to have him back. ''We were all surprised,'' she said, ''when he became prime minister: 'What? Our Mohamed?' '' When he came back, she said, they made him a cake.
''We weren't sure he'd return to D.O.T.,'' she said, ''because once you do something grand like that, to come back to this humble work is something else.''

HEADLINE: Japan Split on Hope for Vast Radiation Cleanup

BYLINE: By MARTIN FACKLER

 BODY:
FUTABA, Japan -- Futaba is a modern-day ghost town -- not a boomtown gone bust, not even entirely a victim of the devastating earthquake and tsunami that leveled other parts of Japan's northeast coast.
Its traditional wooden homes have begun to sag and collapse since they were abandoned in March by residents fleeing the nuclear plant on the edge of town that began spiraling toward disaster. Roofs possibly damaged by the earth's shaking have let rain seep in, starting the rot that is eating at the houses from the inside.
The roadway arch at the entrance to the empty town almost seems a taunt. It reads:
''Nuclear energy: a correct understanding brings a prosperous lifestyle.'' 
Those who fled Futaba are among the nearly 90,000 people evacuated from a 12-mile zone around the Fukushima Daiichi plant and another area to the northwest contaminated when a plume from the plant scattered radioactive cesium and iodine.
Now, Japan is drawing up plans for a cleanup that is both monumental and unprecedented, in the hopes that those displaced can go home.
The debate over whether to repopulate the area, if trial cleanups prove effective, has become a proxy for a larger battle over the future of Japan. Supporters see rehabilitating the area as a chance to showcase the country's formidable determination and superior technical skills -- proof that Japan is still a great power.
For them, the cleanup is a perfect metaphor for Japan's rebirth.
Critics counter that the effort to clean Fukushima Prefecture could end up as perhaps the biggest of Japan's white-elephant public works projects -- and yet another example of post-disaster Japan reverting to the wasteful ways that have crippled economic growth for two decades.
So far, the government is following a pattern set since the nuclear accident, dismissing dangers, often prematurely, and laboring to minimize the scope of the catastrophe. Already, the trial cleanups have stalled: the government failed to anticipate communities' reluctance to store tons of soil to be scraped from contaminated yards and fields.
And a radiation specialist who tested the results of an extensive local cleanup in a nearby city found that exposure levels remained above international safety standards for long-term habitation.
Even a vocal supporter of repatriation suggests that the government has not yet leveled with its people about the seriousness of their predicament.
''I believe it is possible to save Fukushima,'' said the supporter, Tatsuhiko Kodama, director of the Radioisotope Center at the University of Tokyo. ''But many evacuated residents must accept that it won't happen in their lifetimes.''
To judge the huge scale of what Japan is contemplating, consider that experts say residents can return home safely only after thousands of buildings are scrubbed of radioactive particles and much of the topsoil from an area the size of Connecticut is replaced.
Even forested mountains will probably need to be decontaminated, which might necessitate clear-cutting and literally scraping them clean.
The Soviet Union did not attempt such a cleanup after the Chernobyl accident of 1986, the only nuclear disaster larger than that at Fukushima Daiichi. The government instead relocated about 300,000 people, abandoning vast tracts of farmland.
Many Japanese officials believe that they do not have that luxury; the area contaminated above an international safety standard for the general public covers more than an estimated 3 percent of the landmass of this densely populated nation.
''We are different from Chernobyl,'' said Toshitsuna Watanabe, 64, the mayor of Okuma, one of the towns that was evacuated. ''We are determined to go back. Japan has the will and the technology to do this.''
Such resolve reflects, in part, a deep attachment to home for rural Japanese like Mr. Watanabe, whose family has lived in Okuma for 19 generations. Their heartfelt appeals to go back have won wide sympathy across Japan, making it hard for people to oppose their wishes.
But quiet resistance has begun to grow, both among those who were displaced and those who fear the country will need to sacrifice too much without guarantees that a multibillion-dollar cleanup will provide enough protection.
Soothing pronouncements by local governments and academics about the eventual ability to live safely near the ruined plant can seem to be based on little more than hope.
No one knows how much exposure to low doses of radiation causes a significant risk of premature death. That means Japanese living in contaminated areas are likely to become the subjects of future studies -- the second time in seven decades that Japanese have become a test case for the effects of radiation exposure, after the bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki.
The national government has declared itself responsible for cleaning up only the towns in the evacuation zone; local governments have already begun cleaning cities and towns outside that area.
Inside the 12-mile ring, which includes Futaba, the Environmental Ministry has pledged to reduce radiation levels by half within two years -- a relatively easy goal because short-lived isotopes will deteriorate. The bigger question is how long it will take to reach the ultimate goal of bringing levels down to about 1 millisievert per year, the annual limit for the general public from artificial sources of radiation that is recommended by the International Commission on Radiological Protection. That is a much more daunting task given that it will require removing cesium 137, an isotope that will remain radioactive for decades.
Trial cleanups have been delayed for months by the search for a storage site for enough contaminated dirt to fill 33 domed football stadiums. Even evacuated communities have refused to accept it.
And Tomoya Yamauchi, the radiation expert from Kobe University who performed tests in Fukushima City after extensive remediation efforts, found that radiation levels inside homes had dropped by only about 25 percent. That left parts of the city with levels of radiation four times higher than the recommended maximum exposure.
''We can only conclude that these efforts have so far been a failure,'' he said.
Minamisoma, a small city whose center sits about 15 miles from the nuclear plant, is a good place to get a sense of the likely limitations of decontamination efforts.
The city has cleaned dozens of schools, parks and sports facilities in hopes of enticing back the 30,000 of its 70,000 residents who have yet to return since the accident. On a recent morning, a small army of bulldozers and dump trucks were resurfacing a high school soccer field and baseball diamond with a layer of reddish brown dirt. Workers buried the old topsoil in a deep hole in a corner of the soccer field. The crew's overseer, Masahiro Sakura, said readings at the field had dropped substantially, but he remains anxious because many parts of the city were not expected to be decontaminated for at least two years.
These days, he lets his three young daughters outdoors only to go to school and play in a resurfaced park. ''Is it realistic to live like this?'' he asked.
The challenges are sure to be more intense inside the 12-mile zone, where radiation levels in some places have reached nearly 510 millisieverts a year, 25 times above the cutoff for evacuation.
Already, the proposed repatriation has opened rifts among those who have been displaced. The 11,500 displaced residents of Okuma -- many of whom now live in rows of prefabricated homes 60 miles inland -- are enduring just such a divide.
The mayor, Mr. Watanabe, has directed the town to draw up its own plan to return to its original location within three to five years by building a new town on farmland in Okuma's less contaminated western edge.
Although Mr. Watanabe won a recent election, his challenger found significant support among residents with small children for his plan to relocate to a different part of Japan. Mitsue Ikeda, one supporter, said she would never go home, especially after a medical exam showed that her 8-year-old son, Yuma, had ingested cesium.
''It's too dangerous,'' Ms. Ikeda, 47, said. ''How are we supposed to live, by wearing face masks all the time?''
She, like many other evacuees, berated the government, saying it was fixated on cleaning up to avoid paying compensation.
Many older residents, by contrast, said they should be allowed to return.
''Smoking cigarettes is more dangerous than radiation,'' said Eiichi Tsukamoto, 70, who worked at the Daiichi plant for 40 years as a repairman. ''We can make Okuma a model to the world of how to restore a community after a nuclear accident.''
But even Mr. Kodama, the radiation expert who supports a government cleanup, said such a victory would be hollow, and short-lived if young people did not return. He suggested that the government start rebuilding communities by rebuilding trust eroded over months of official evasion.
''Saving Fukushima requires not just money and effort, but also faith,'' he said. ''There is no point if only older people go back.''

CORRECTION-DATE: December 14, 2011

 CORRECTION:
This article has been revised to reflect the following correction: Because of an editing error, an article last Wednesday about problems in cleaning up land contaminated by the nuclear disaster in Japan misstated, at one point, the amount of Japan's land mass covered by the evacuation zone around the stricken Fukushima Daiichi nuclear plant. The zone is 0.3 percent -- not 3 percent -- of the land mass. (The article correctly described the area as a 12-mile zone.)

GRAPHICS: Radiation Exposure: In the United States, the average person gets six millisieverts of radiation a year. Around the Fukushima plant, officials evacuated areas where people would have gotten an estimated 20 millisieverts in the year after the accident. One area about twice the size of Manhattan was predicted to have a level of 100 millisieverts in the first year. The most contaminated parts of this area will be uninhabitable for at least three decades, experts say, though steps like removing soil could shorten that time.
Inside the Plant: Reactor temperatures have fallen. Tepco, the plant's operator, expects to reach ''cold shutdown'' by year's end. But decommissioning the plant could take 30 years.
Where Evacuees Have Gone: More than 60,000 people have left Fukushima Prefecture. By comparison, about 200,000 households had not returned to the New Orleans area a year after Hurricane Katrina. (Sources: Edwin Lyman, senior scientist at the Union of Concerned Scientists

HEADLINE: Lehman Case Closes Chapter

BYLINE: By REUTERS

 BODY:
Lehman Brothers Holdings on Tuesday won court approval for its reorganization plan, allowing it to end the largest bankruptcy in American history, which helped lead to the 2008 global financial crisis. 
The approval was granted by Judge James M. Peck at a Federal Bankruptcy Court hearing in Manhattan. Lehman expects to begin payouts of an estimated $65 billion to creditors early next year.
Lehman may now wind down its remaining operations, Judge Peck said at a hearing in New York. Once a mammoth investment bank and brokerage house, Lehman is now a collection of assets including real estate, private equity and banking investments.
The judge spent more than three years overseeing the bankruptcy of Lehman, which filed for protection from creditors on Sept. 15, 2008. He said that while Lehman may have been ''too big too fail,'' it was not too big to make it through Chapter 11.
Lehman proposed to the court that its bankruptcy exit occur after Jan. 31, giving it time to prepare to stand on its own, and paving the way for payouts to creditors to start in 2012.
The company had $639 billion in assets when it went bankrupt. Some of that money was returned to brokerage customers in a separate proceeding. There remains $65 billion to be returned to creditors who have $450 billion in claims, a group that includes debt investors and trading partners from before the bankruptcy, like Goldman Sachs.
The reorganization has cost Lehman's bankruptcy estate more than $1.5 billion to cover fees for lawyers and advisers, as well as other expenses.

HONG KONG -- An interest rate cut in Australia and lowered economic growth estimates by the Asian Development Bank on Tuesday highlighted the extent to which the economic woes of Europe and the United States are spilling into the Asia-Pacific region.
Economic growth in much of Asia remains robust, the Asian Development Bank said. But trade and financial activity have already started to be eroded by the turmoil in Europe, and they risk being undermined further if the European debt crisis evolves into a full-blown financial and economic crisis like the one spurred by the collapse of Lehman Brothers in September 2008. 
''Things are changing very rapidly -- not just weekly and daily, but hourly,'' Iwan J. Azis, head of the development bank's office of regional economic integration, said at a news conference in Hong Kong, as he presented the bank's latest update on emerging East Asian nations.
The bank lowered its 2012 growth forecast for the emerging East Asia region -- which includes China and much of Southeast Asia, but not India and Japan -- to 7.2 percent, from a previous estimate of 7.5 percent.
It also cautioned that growth could be as low as 5.4 percent if the West's troubles escalated and tipped the United States and Europe back into recession.
Hopes of at least a modest upturn in the United States have risen after some better-than-expected manufacturing and job data in recent weeks, though unemployment remains stubbornly high.
The outlook for Europe, however, is grim, as austerity budgets and tighter lending by beleaguered banks constrain growth. Analysts at Nomura, for instance, said they expected the euro zone to contract 1 percent next year.
Top European policy makers are to assemble in Brussels on Thursday and Friday to fashion a solution to the region's sovereign debt woes. Over the last weeks, the crisis has spilled beyond small peripheral euro zone nations and begun to undermine investors' confidence in larger economies like Italy and even France.
The rapid deterioration has prompted a succession of support measures from international financial institutions in recent weeks. The European Central Bank lowered interest rates last month and is widely expected to do so again on Thursday.
In another bid to restore confidence, the two main leaders of the euro zone -- Chancellor Angela Merkel of Germany and President Nicolas Sarkozy of France -- said on Monday that they would work together to remake the European Union into a more integrated political and economic federation, with tight legal restraints on how much debt national parliaments could issue.
The changes would effectively subordinate economic sovereignty to collective discipline enforced by European technocrats in Brussels.
The Asia-Pacific region is for the most part not burdened with the high government and household debt levels that are weighing on Europe and the United States. Asian banks also have little exposure to European debt, meaning that any defaults would not cause huge write-downs.
Still, much of the region depends on the West as a market for its products, and slowing demand in the United States and Europe has caused export growth from Asia to ease in recent months.
Economic growth in China has also slowed as Beijing's efforts to cool down excessively rapid growth earlier this year have borne fruit.
The Australian central bank highlighted those concerns with its decision to lower interest rates on Tuesday. The cut, the second in two months, took the main cash rate to 4.25 percent, from 4.5 percent.
Trade in Asia is now ''seeing some effects of a significant slowing in economic activity in Europe,'' Glenn Stevens, the governor of the Reserve Bank of Australia, said in a statement. ''The sovereign credit and banking problems in Europe, to which European governments are still seeking to craft a full response, are likely to weigh on economic activity there over the period ahead.''
Analysts have also recently grown increasingly worried that beleaguered European banks could sharply scale back their lending in Asia.
Although there is little evidence at this stage of a full-scale withdrawal by such lenders, ''there is a lot of scope for that to happen if the European situation worsens,'' Rob Subbaraman, chief Asia economist at Nomura, said in a conference call Tuesday.
Asian stock and bond markets have also experienced portfolio outflows as nervous United States and European investors put their funds closer to home.
The good news, however, is that policy makers in Asia have more flexibility than their Western counterparts to prop up flagging growth through interest rate cuts or tax incentives.
Moreover, Mr. Azis of the development bank said, banks in Asia have ample liquidity and could help fill financing shortfalls caused by a withdrawal of loans from European banks in the region.
Despite the turmoil in the West, ''Asia is in for a soft landing -- not a hard landing,'' he said.

HEADLINE: Outrage Grows Over Air Pollution and China's Response

BYLINE: By EDWARD WONG; Li Bibo and Edy Yin contributed research.

 BODY:
BEIJING -- The statement posted online along with a photograph of central Beijing muffled in a miasma of brown haze did not mince words: ''The end of the world is imminent.''
The ceaseless churning of factories and automobile engines in and around Beijing has led to this: hundreds of flights canceled since Sunday because of smog, stores sold out of face masks, and many Chinese complaining on the Internet that officials are failing to level with them about air quality or make any improvements to the environment.
Chronic pollution in Beijing, temporarily scrubbed clean for the 2008 Summer Olympics, has made people angry for a long time, but the disruptions it causes to daily life are now raising questions about the economic cost, and the government's ability to ensure the safety of the population. 
''As a Chinese citizen, we have been kept in the dark on this issue for too long,'' said Yu Ping, the father of a 7-year-old boy, who has started a public campaign to demand that officials report more accurately about Beijing's air quality. ''The government is just so bureaucratic that they don't seem to care whether we common people live or die. And it's up to us, the common people, to prod them and to put pressure on them so that they can reflect on their actions and realize that they really just have to do something.''
When the frustration of parents boils over, Communist Party leaders start worrying about their legitimacy in the eyes of the people. That was the case in 2008 when parents vented anger over deadly school collapses in the Sichuan earthquake and over adulterated milk.
The motionless cloud of pollution that has smothered the capital and its surroundings in recent days has frayed tempers. Long stretches of highway have been shut down because of low visibility, hobbling transportation of people and goods. Workers at Capital International Airport have faced crowds of irate travelers whose flights have been grounded. From Sunday to 11 a.m. Tuesday, more than 700 outbound and inbound flights were canceled, one airport official said. A tour guide, Wang Lanhuizi, 23, clutched dozens of passports from a stranded group. ''I'm really worried, but there's nothing we can do,'' she said.
An announcement at the airport made no mention of pollution, attributing the cancellations and delays to ''the weather condition.'' That has long been the government line: the haze is fog, not fumes. But increasingly, Chinese know better. People like Mr. Yu, a newspaper editor, are lobbying officials to stop whitewashing their air quality reports.
Many people now follow a Twitter feed from the United States Embassy that gives hourly updates on air quality; gauges on top of the embassy in central Beijing measure, among other things, the amount of fine airborne particles, which are extremely damaging to the lungs. Since Sunday, the air has been rated ''very unhealthy'' or ''hazardous,'' meaning that people should avoid any outdoor activity; on Sunday, the particulate measurement exceeded the scale's maximum of 500, a reading that the embassy once called ''crazy bad'' on its @BeijingAir Twitter feed.
The fine particles, called PM 2.5 because they are 2.5 microns in diameter or smaller, make up much of the pollution in the city, but they are not included in the air quality ratings issued by the Chinese government. The published ratings take into account only a larger class of particles (up to 10 microns in diameter) called PM 10. As a result, Beijing officials have announced good or excellent air quality nearly 80 percent of the time over the last two years, while the embassy's assessment says the air was unhealthy more than 80 percent of the time, according to an analysis by Steven Q. Andrews, an American environmental consultant, that was published Monday on the Web site China Dialogue.
Experts say the filthy air shortens lives in the capital. One authoritative study ''indicates that if Beijing's fine particulate concentration even reached the polluted levels of Los Angeles, life expectancy may increase by over five years,'' Mr. Andrews wrote.
The air readings from the embassy mysteriously stopped on Tuesday afternoon. ''We're checking on it,'' the embassy spokesman, Richard L. Buangan, said on Twitter. (Although Twitter is blocked in China, the embassy's air quality ratings are reposted by many Chinese on unblocked sites.)
In July 2009, a Chinese Foreign Ministry official, Wang Shu'ai, told American diplomats to halt the embassy's air quality Twitter feed, saying that the data ''is not only confusing but also insulting,'' according to a State Department cable obtained by WikiLeaks. The embassy's data, Mr. Wang said, could lead to ''social consequences.''
Chinese officials recently acknowledged that Beijing and other cities have the equipment to measure PM 2.5, the smaller particles, but do not reflect that data in their air quality ratings.
Prominent Beijing residents have called for changes. One is Pan Shiyi, a real estate magnate who asked his seven million microblog followers last month to vote on whether the authorities should use a stricter standard to assess air quality. Officials have not been helped by news reports that revealed that a Chinese manufacturer, the Broad Group, advertises that more than 200 of its pricey air purifiers are in the offices and homes of China's top leaders.
Ma Jun, an environmental advocate, said officials made some progress this year by committing to ensuring that cities report PM 2.5 data starting in 2016. But that is too far away, he said.
Mr. Yu, the editor, is pushing for immediate disclosure of the data. His campaign has attracted attention online this week as Beijing residents cough and squint in the haze. Mr. Yu said he filed an application to the Beijing Environmental Protection Bureau last month to have the bureau release PM 2.5 data, and was turned down; he posted the bureau's answer on his microblog. He said he was considering suing the bureau or asking the Ministry of Environmental Protection for a review. ''With the government not being totally open about this issue,'' he said, ''many people don't realize how bad the situation is.''
On Tuesday, the English-language China Daily published an article under the headline ''Exposure to Smog Is Severe Hazard.'' It said the lung cancer rate in Beijing had increased by 60 percent in the last decade even though the smoking rate did not change.

HEADLINE: Albany Tax Deal To Increase Rate For Top Earners

BYLINE: By THOMAS KAPLAN; Michael M. Grynbaum contributed reporting from New York.

 BODY:
ALBANY -- Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo and legislative leaders announced on Tuesday that they had reached an agreement to overhaul New York State's income tax, creating a higher tax bracket for the highest-income residents and reducing the tax rate for millions of middle-class residents.
The deal came together just 25 days before the expiration of the state's so-called millionaires' tax -- actually a surcharge on all individuals earning over $200,000 a year. The proposed tax overhaul would result in most residents' being taxed next year at a lower rate than this year.
The long-term impact on the wealthy was described by some as a cut and others as an increase: beginning next year, the highest-income earners will be taxed at a lower rate than at present, but at a higher rate than had been expected with the expiration of the surcharge. 
The changes, which the Legislature could vote on as early as Wednesday, would net $1.9 billion in annual revenue; the expiring surcharge had been generating about $4 billion a year.
It was a piece of political craftsmanship that allowed both Democrats and Republicans to declare victory.
Mr. Cuomo, who as governor has repeatedly opposed tax increases as well as proposals to renew the surcharge, released a video message on Tuesday saying that the new top bracket would help address the projected $3.5 billion budget gap that the state is facing next year.
''While I am against higher taxes, and I believe our long-term economic future for this state is enhanced by in fact lowering taxes to make us more competitive, to deal with this emergency, short-term, we do need additional revenue,'' Mr. Cuomo, a Democrat, said. ''If I were to close the entire gap by budget cuts, it would decimate essential services, doing real harm to the state's economy and strangling local governments all across this state.''
On Tuesday, the governor called for a special session to begin on Wednesday at which legislators would debate and vote on the tax package.
The Assembly speaker, Sheldon Silver, a Manhattan Democrat, told reporters, ''I think this is a big victory for New Yorkers. People who make $50,000 a year will no longer be paying the same marginal tax rate as people who make $500,000 a year.''
The State Senate majority leader, Dean G. Skelos, a Long Island Republican, offered his support in a written statement, saying, ''This comprehensive plan will reduce the tax rate for middle-class families to their lowest levels in more than 50 years, create thousands of new private sector jobs and begin to turn our economy around.''
The agreement drew praise from an unlikely combination of business groups, which applauded the governor for devoting himself to job creation, and labor unions, which said the new revenue would help ensure that Mr. Cuomo would follow through with his promise to increase education and health care spending in the budget next year.
''We participated very heavily in reaching out to legislators to strike a deal that provided adequate revenues,'' said Richard C. Iannuzzi, the president of New York State United Teachers. ''It looks like they've done that.''
Some Democrats lauded the Occupy Wall Street movement for changing the political climate in Albany, where lawmakers had planned to allow the millionaires' tax to simply expire.
''It's a credit to the courage of the Occupy protesters on Wall Street, in Albany, in Buffalo and Rochester, and across the country,'' said Michael Kink, the executive director of the labor-backed Strong Economy for All Coalition. ''Albany is taxing the rich to create jobs, to allow better budgets and to provide tax relief for the middle class. Those are the things we were trying to make happen.''
But some liberals, inside and outside the Legislature, were dissatisfied. Billy Easton, the executive director of the Alliance for Quality Education, said the money to be raised by the new tax bracket was ''not enough.'' And Kenneth Brynien, the president of the Public Employees Federation, said the deal ''falls short in obtaining the goal of a fair tax system.''
Some conservatives were also critical, including the Assembly minority leader, Brian M. Kolb, Republican of Canandaigua. ''The bottom line is that taxes are being raised in New York State and we are still not dealing with our state's serious spending problem,'' Assemblyman Kolb said. ''Tax hikes have never been the answer for creating more private sector jobs and long-term prosperity for New Yorkers.''
The deal was also criticized because it had been developed without debate, hearings or any form of public review. Mr. Cuomo announced his plans to seek an overhaul of the tax code on Sunday, via an essay he offered for publication to newspaper editorial pages, and the negotiations between the governor and legislative leaders took place behind closed doors.
Three government watchdog groups released a statement condemning the process, saying ''matters of this magnitude should not be decided in secret, during the legislative hiatus and without a formal process.'' Susan Lerner, the executive director of one of the groups, Common Cause New York, called the secret negotiations an ''abuse of the process'' that was ''breathtaking in its scope.''
The state's current income tax rates are relatively flat, taxing any individuals who earn $20,000 or more, as well as couples who earn $40,000 or more and file joint tax returns, at the same 6.85 percent rate.
But for the last three years, individuals who earned more than $200,000 a year have also been subject to the tax surcharge, paying 7.85 percent on income from $200,000 to $500,000, and 8.97 percent on income over $500,000. For couples filing jointly, the surcharge kicked in at $300,000.
Under the proposal announced on Tuesday, newly created tax rates would range from 6.45 percent for income between $40,000 and $150,000 (for married couples) to 8.82 percent for income over $2 million. Tax brackets would be indexed to the rate of inflation and would take effect next year. The new top tax bracket would extend through 2014; the others would be permanent.
Under the new brackets, New York's top income tax rate of 8.82 percent would rank among the highest in the country, according to the Federation of Tax Administrators. It would be significantly higher than the top rate in Connecticut, which was raised earlier this year to 6.7 percent, but just under New Jersey's top rate of 8.97 percent.
The agreement would also seek to lower unemployment by financing job-creation programs. It would allocate $50 million to help stricken areas repair flood damage, create an infrastructure fund to finance a new program of road and bridge construction and support job-training programs.
The agreement also reduces a payroll tax that helps finance the Metropolitan Transportation Authority. Mr. Cuomo and the legislative leaders said that the changes would cut taxes by $250 million, and that the state would compensate the transportation authority for the lost revenue.

HEADLINE: Text: Obama's Speech in Kansas

 BODY:
Following is a text of President Obama's prepared remarks in Osawatomie, Kan., as released by the White House on Tuesday:
Good afternoon. I want to start by thanking a few of the folks who've joined us today. We've got the mayor of Osawatomie, Phil Dudley; your superintendent, Gary French; the principal of Osawatomie High, Doug Chisam. And I've brought your former governor, who's now doing an outstanding job as our Secretary of Health and Human Services, Kathleen Sebelius.
It is great to be back in the state of Kansas. As many of you know, I've got roots here. I'm sure you're all familiar with the Obamas of Osawatomie. Actually, I like to say that I got my name from my father, but I got my accent and my values from my mother. She was born in Wichita. Her mother grew up in Augusta. And her father was from El Dorado. So my Kansas roots run deep. 
My grandparents served during World War II -- he as a soldier in Patton's Army, she as a worker on a bomber assembly line. Together, they shared the optimism of a nation that triumphed over a Depression and fascism. They believed in an America where hard work paid off, responsibility was rewarded, and anyone could make it if they tried -- no matter who you were, where you came from, or how you started out.
These values gave rise to the largest middle class and the strongest economy the world has ever known. It was here, in America, that the most productive workers and innovative companies turned out the best products on Earth, and every American shared in that pride and success -- from those in executive suites to middle management to those on the factory floor. If you gave it your all, you'd take enough home to raise your family, send your kids to school, have your health care covered, and put a little away for retirement.
Today, we are still home to the world's most productive workers and innovative companies. But for most Americans, the basic bargain that made this country great has eroded. Long before the recession hit, hard work stopped paying off for too many people. Fewer and fewer of the folks who contributed to the success of our economy actually benefitted from that success. Those at the very top grew wealthier from their incomes and investments than ever before. But everyone else struggled with costs that were growing and paychecks that weren't and too many families found themselves racking up more and more debt just to keep up.
For many years, credit cards and home equity loans papered over the harsh realities of this new economy. But in 2008, the house of cards collapsed. We all know the story by now: Mortgages sold to people who couldn't afford them, or sometimes even understand them. Banks and investors allowed to keep packaging the risk and selling it off. Huge bets and huge bonuses made with other people's money on the line. Regulators who were supposed to warn us about the dangers of all this, but looked the other way or didn't have the authority to look at all.
It was wrong. It combined the breathtaking greed of a few with irresponsibility across the system. And it plunged our economy and the world into a crisis from which we are still fighting to recover. It claimed the jobs, homes, and the basic security of millions innocent, hard-working Americans who had met their responsibilities, but were still left holding the bag.
Ever since, there has been a raging debate over the best way to restore growth and prosperity; balance and fairness. Throughout the country, it has sparked protests and political movements from the Tea Party to the people who have been occupying the streets of New York and other cities. It's left Washington in a near-constant state of gridlock. And it's been the topic of heated and sometimes colorful discussion among the men and women who are running for president.
But this isn't just another political debate. This is the defining issue of our time. This is a make or break moment for the middle class, and all those who are fighting to get into the middle class. At stake is whether this will be a country where working people can earn enough to raise a family, build a modest savings, own a home, and secure their retirement.
Now, in the midst of this debate, there are some who seem to be suffering from a kind of collective amnesia. After all that's happened, after the worst economic crisis since the Great Depression, they want to return to the same practices that got us into this mess. In fact, they want to go back to the same policies that have stacked the deck against middle-class Americans for too many years. Their philosophy is simple: we are better off when everyone is left to fend for themselves and play by their own rules.
Well, I'm here to say they are wrong. I'm here to reaffirm my deep conviction that we are greater together than we are on our own. I believe that this country succeeds when everyone gets a fair shot, when everyone does their fair share, and when everyone plays by the same rules. Those aren't Democratic or Republican values; 1% values or 99% values. They're American values, and we have to reclaim them.
You see, this isn't the first time America has faced this choice. At the turn of the last century, when a nation of farmers was transitioning to become the world's industrial giant, we had to decide: would we settle for a country where most of the new railroads and factories were controlled by a few giant monopolies that kept prices high and wages low? Would we allow our citizens and even our children to work ungodly hours in conditions that were unsafe and unsanitary? Would we restrict education to the privileged few? Because some people thought massive inequality and exploitation was just the price of progress.
Theodore Roosevelt disagreed. He was the Republican son of a wealthy family. He praised what the titans of industry had done to create jobs and grow the economy. He believed then what we know is true today: that the free market is the greatest force for economic progress in human history. It's led to a prosperity and standard of living unmatched by the rest of the world.
But Roosevelt also knew that the free market has never been a free license to take whatever you want from whoever you can. It only works when there are rules of the road to ensure that competition is fair, open, and honest. And so he busted up monopolies, forcing those companies to compete for customers with better services and better prices. And today, they still must. He fought to make sure businesses couldn't profit by exploiting children, or selling food or medicine that wasn't safe. And today, they still can't.
In 1910, Teddy Roosevelt came here, to Osawatomie, and laid out his vision for what he called a New Nationalism. ''Our country,'' he said, '' means nothing unless it means the triumph of a real democracy of an economic system under which each man shall be guaranteed the opportunity to show the best that there is in him.''
For this, Roosevelt was called a radical, a socialist, even a communist. But today, we are a richer nation and a stronger democracy because of what he fought for in his last campaign: an eight hour work day and a minimum wage for women; insurance for the unemployed, the elderly, and those with disabilities; political reform and a progressive income tax.
Today, over one hundred years later, our economy has gone through another transformation. Over the last few decades, huge advances in technology have allowed businesses to do more with less, and made it easier for them to set up shop and hire workers anywhere in the world. And many of you know firsthand the painful disruptions this has caused for a lot of Americans.
Factories where people thought they would retire suddenly picked up and went overseas, where the workers were cheaper. Steel mills that needed 1,000 employees are now able to do the same work with 100, so that layoffs were too often permanent, not just a temporary part of the business cycle. These changes didn't just affect blue-collar workers. If you were a bank teller or a phone operator or a travel agent, you saw many in your profession replaced by ATMs or the internet. Today, even higher-skilled jobs like accountants and middle management can be outsourced to countries like China and India. And if you're someone whose job can be done cheaper by a computer or someone in another country, you don't have a lot of leverage with your employer when it comes to asking for better wages and benefits especially since fewer Americans today are part of a union.
Now, just as there was in Teddy Roosevelt's time, there's been a certain crowd in Washington for the last few decades who respond to this economic challenge with the same old tune. ''The market will take care of everything,'' they tell us. If only we cut more regulations and cut more taxes especially for the wealthy our economy will grow stronger. Sure, there will be winners and losers. But if the winners do really well, jobs and prosperity will eventually trickle down to everyone else. And even if prosperity doesn't trickle down, they argue, that's the price of liberty.
It's a simple theory one that speaks to our rugged individualism and healthy skepticism of too much government. It fits well on a bumper sticker. Here's the problem: It doesn't work. It's never worked. It didn't work when it was tried in the decade before the Great Depression. It's not what led to the incredible post-war boom of the 50s and 60s. And it didn't work when we tried it during the last decade.
Remember that in those years, in 2001 and 2003, Congress passed two of the most expensive tax cuts for the wealthy in history, and what did they get us? The slowest job growth in half a century. Massive deficits that have made it much harder to pay for the investments that built this country and provided the basic security that helped millions of Americans reach and stay in the middle class things like education and infrastructure; science and technology; Medicare and Social Security.
Remember that in those years, thanks to some of the same folks who are running Congress now, we had weak regulation and little oversight, and what did that get us? Insurance companies that jacked up people's premiums with impunity, and denied care to the patients who were sick. Mortgage lenders that tricked families into buying homes they couldn't afford. A financial sector where irresponsibility and lack of basic oversight nearly destroyed our entire economy.
We simply cannot return to this brand of your-on-your-own economics if we're serious about rebuilding the middle class in this country. We know that it doesn't result in a strong economy. It results in an economy that invests too little in its people and its future. It doesn't result in a prosperity that trickles down. It results in a prosperity that's enjoyed by fewer and fewer of our citizens.
Look at the statistics. In the last few decades, the average income of the top one percent has gone up by more than 250%, to $1.2 million per year. For the top one hundredth of one percent, the average income is now $27 million per year. The typical CEO who used to earn about 30 times more than his or her workers now earns 110 times more. And yet, over the last decade, the incomes of most Americans have actually fallen by about six percent.
This kind of inequality a level we haven't seen since the Great Depression hurts us all. When middle-class families can no longer afford to buy the goods and services that businesses are selling, it drags down the entire economy, from top to bottom. America was built on the idea of broad-based prosperity that's why a CEO like Henry Ford made it his mission to pay his workers enough so that they could buy the cars they made. It's also why a recent study showed that countries with less inequality tend to have stronger and steadier economic growth over the long run.
Inequality also distorts our democracy. It gives an outsized voice to the few who can afford high-priced lobbyists and unlimited campaign contributions, and runs the risk of selling out our democracy to the highest bidder. And it leaves everyone else rightly suspicious that the system in Washington is rigged against them that our elected representatives aren't looking out for the interests of most Americans.
More fundamentally, this kind of gaping inequality gives lie to the promise at the very heart of America: that this is the place where you can make it if you try. We tell people that in this country, even if you're born with nothing, hard work can get you into the middle class; and that your children will have the chance to do even better than you. That's why immigrants from around the world flocked to our shores.
And yet, over the last few decades, the rungs on the ladder of opportunity have grown farther and farther apart, and the middle class has shrunk. A few years after World War II, a child who was born into poverty had a slightly better than 50-50 chance of becoming middle class as an adult. By 1980, that chance fell to around 40%. And if the trend of rising inequality over the last few decades continues, it's estimated that a child born today will only have a 1 in 3 chance of making it to the middle class.
It's heartbreaking enough that there are millions of working families in this country who are now forced to take their children to food banks for a decent meal. But the idea that those children might not have a chance to climb out of that situation and back into the middle class, no matter how hard they work? That's inexcusable. It's wrong. It flies in the face of everything we stand for.
Fortunately, that's not a future we have to accept. Because there's another view about how we build a strong middle class in this country a view that's truer to our history; a vision that's been embraced by people of both parties for more than two hundred years.
It's not a view that we should somehow turn back technology or put up walls around America. It's not a view that says we should punish profit or success or pretend that government knows how to fix all society's problems. It's a view that says in America, we are greater together when everyone engages in fair play, everyone gets a fair shot, everyone does their fair share.
So what does that mean for restoring middle-class security in today's economy?
It starts by making sure that everyone in America gets a fair shot at success. The truth is, we'll never be able to compete with other countries when it comes to who's best at letting their businesses pay the lowest wages or pollute as much as they want. That's a race to the bottom that we can't win and shouldn't want to win. Those countries don't have a strong middle-class. They don't have our standard of living.
The race we want to win the race we can win is a race to the top; the race for good jobs that pay well and offer middle-class security. Businesses will create those jobs in countries with the highest-skilled, highest-educated workers; the most advanced transportation and communication; the strongest commitment to research and technology.
The world is shifting to an innovation economy. And no one does innovation better than America. No one has better colleges and universities. No one has a greater diversity of talent and ingenuity. No one's workers or entrepreneurs are more driven or daring. The things that have always been our strengths match up perfectly with the demands of this moment.
But we need to meet the moment. We need to up our game. And we need to remember that we can only do that together.
It starts by making education a national mission government and businesses; parents and citizens. In this economy, a higher education is the surest route to the middle class. The unemployment rate for Americans with a college degree or more is about half the national average. Their income is twice as high as those who don't have a high school diploma. We shouldn't be laying off good teachers right now we should be hiring them. We shouldn't be expecting less of our schools we should be demanding more. We shouldn't be making it harder to afford college we should be a country where everyone has the chance to go.
In today's innovation economy, we also need a world-class commitment to science, research, and the next generation of high-tech manufacturing. Our factories and their workers shouldn't be idle. We should be giving people the chance to get new skills and training at community colleges, so they can learn to make wind turbines and semiconductors and high-powered batteries. And by the way if we don't have an economy built on bubbles and financial speculation, our best and brightest won't all gravitate towards careers in banking and finance. Because if we want an economy that's built to last, we need more of those young people in science and engineering. This country shouldn't be known for bad debt and phony profits. We should be known for creating and selling products all over the world that are stamped with three proud words: Made in America.
Today, manufacturers and other companies are setting up shop in places with the best infrastructure to ship their products, move their workers, and communicate with the rest of the world. That's why the over one million construction workers who lost their jobs when the housing market collapsed shouldn't be sitting at home with nothing to do. They should be rebuilding our roads and bridges; laying down faster railroads and broadband; modernizing our schools all the things other countries are already doing to attract good jobs and businesses to their shores.
Yes, businesses, not government, will always be the primary generator of good jobs with incomes that lift people into the middle class and keep them there. But as a nation, we have always come together, through our government, to help create the conditions where both workers and businesses can succeed. Historically, that hasn't been a partisan idea. Franklin Roosevelt worked with Democrats and Republicans to give veterans of World War II, including my grandfather, the chance to go to college on the GI Bill. It was Republican President Dwight Eisenhower, a proud son of Kansas, who started the interstate highway system and doubled-down on science and research to stay ahead of the Soviets.
Of course, those productive investments cost money. And so we've also paid for these investments by asking everyone to do their fair share. If we had unlimited resources, no one would ever have to pay any taxes and we'd never have to cut any spending. But we don't have unlimited resources. And so we have to set priorities. If we want a strong middle class, then our tax code must reflect our values. We have to make choices.
Today that choice is very clear. To reduce our deficit, I've already signed nearly $1 trillion of spending cuts into law, and proposed trillions more including reforms that would lower the cost of Medicare and Medicaid.
But in order to actually close the deficit and get our fiscal house in order, we have to decide what our priorities are. Most immediately, we need to extend a payroll tax cut that's set to expire at the end of this month. If we don't do that, 160 million Americans will see their taxes go up by an average of $1,000, and it would badly weaken our recovery.
But in the long term, we have to rethink our tax system more fundamentally. We have to ask ourselves: Do we want to make the investments we need in things like education, and research, and high-tech manufacturing? Or do we want to keep in place the tax breaks for the wealthiest Americans in our country? Because we can't afford to do both. That's not politics. That's just math.
So far, most of the Republicans in Washington have refused, under any circumstances, to ask the wealthiest Americans to go the same tax rates they were paying when Bill Clinton was president.
Now, keep in mind, when President Clinton first proposed these tax increases, folks in Congress predicted they would kill jobs and lead to another recession. Instead, our economy created nearly 23 million jobs and we eliminated the deficit. Today, the wealthiest Americans are paying the lowest taxes in over half a century. This isn't like in the early 50s, when the top tax rate was over 90%, or even the early 80s, when it was about 70%. Under President Clinton, the top rate was only about 39%. Today, thanks to loopholes and shelters, a quarter of all millionaires now pay lower tax rates than millions of middle-class households. Some billionaires have a tax rate as low as 1%. One percent.
This is the height of unfairness. It is wrong that in the United States of America, a teacher or a nurse or a construction worker who earns $50,000 should pay a higher tax rate than somebody pulling in $50 million. It is wrong for Warren Buffett's secretary to pay a higher tax rate than Warren Buffett. And he agrees with me. So do most Americans Democrats, Independents, and Republicans. And I know that many of our wealthiest citizens would agree to contribute a little more if it meant reducing the deficit and strengthening the economy that made their success possible.
This isn't about class warfare. This is about the nation's welfare. It's about making choices that benefit not just the people who've done fantastically well over the last few decades, but that benefits the middle class, and those fighting to get to the middle class, and the economy as a whole.
Finally, a strong middle class can only exist in an economy where everyone plays by the same rules, from Wall Street to Main Street. As infuriating as it was for all of us, we rescued our major banks from collapse, not only because a full blown financial meltdown would have sent us into a second Depression, but because we need a strong, healthy financial sector in this country.
But part of the deal was that we would not go back to business as usual. That's why last year we put in place new rules of the road that refocus the financial sector on this core purpose: getting capital to the entrepreneurs with the best ideas, and financing to millions of families who want to buy a home or send their kids to college. We're not all the way there yet, and the banks are fighting us every inch of the way. But already, some of these reforms are being implemented. If you're a big bank or risky financial institution, you'll have to write out a ''living will'' that details exactly how you'll pay the bills if you fail, so that taxpayers are never again on the hook for Wall Street's mistakes. There are also limits on the size of banks and new abilities for regulators to dismantle a firm that goes under. The new law bans banks from making risky bets with their customers' deposits, and takes away big bonuses and paydays from failed CEOs, while giving shareholders a say on executive salaries.
All that is being put in place as we speak. Now, unless you're a financial institution whose business model is built on breaking the law, cheating consumers, or making risky bets that could damage the entire economy, you have nothing to fear from these new rules. My grandmother worked as a banker for most of her life, and I know that the vast majority of bankers and financial service professionals want to do right by their customers. They want to have rules in place that don't put them at a disadvantage for doing the right thing. And yet, Republicans in Congress are already fighting as hard as they can to make sure these rules aren't enforced.
I'll give you one example. For the first time in history, the reform we passed puts in place a consumer watchdog who is charged with protecting everyday Americans from being taken advantage of by mortgage lenders, payday lenders or debt collectors. The man we nominated for the post, Richard Cordray, is a former Attorney General of Ohio who has the support of most Attorneys General, both Democrat and Republican, throughout the country.
But the Republicans in the Senate refuse to let him do his job. Why? Does anyone here think the problem that led to our financial crisis was too much oversight of mortgage lenders or debt collectors? Of course not. Every day we go without a consumer watchdog in place is another day when a student, or a senior citizen, or member of our Armed Forces could be tricked into a loan they can't afford something that happens all the time. Financial institutions have plenty of lobbyists looking out for their interests. Consumers deserve to have someone whose job it is to look out for them. I intend to make sure they do, and I will veto any effort to delay, defund, or dismantle the new rules we put in place.
We shouldn't be weakening oversight and accountability. We should be strengthening them. Here's another example. Too often, we've seen Wall Street firms violating major anti-fraud laws because the penalties are too weak and there's no price for being a repeat offender. No more. I'll be calling for legislation that makes these penalties count so that firms don't see punishment for breaking the law as just the price of doing business.
The fact is, this crisis has left a deficit of trust between Main Street and Wall Street. And major banks that were rescued by the taxpayers have an obligation to go the extra mile in helping to close that deficit. At minimum, they should be remedying past mortgage abuses that led to the financial crisis, and working to keep responsible homeowners in their home. We're going to keep pushing them to provide more time for unemployed homeowners to look for work without having to worry about immediately losing their house. The big banks should increase access to refinancing opportunities to borrowers who have yet to benefit from historically low interest rates. And they should recognize that precisely because these steps are in the interest of middle-class families and the broader economy, they will also be in the banks' own long-term financial interest.
Investing in things like education that give everybody a chance to succeed. A tax code that makes sure everybody pays their fair share. And laws that make sure everybody follows the rules. That's what will transform our economy. That's what will grow our middle class again. In the end, rebuilding this economy based on fair play, a fair shot, and a fair share will require all of us to see the stake we have in each other's success. And it will require all of us to take some responsibility to that success.
It will require parents to get more involved in their children's education, students to study harder, and some workers to start studying all over again. It will require greater responsibility from homeowners to not take out mortgages they can't afford, and remember that if something seems too good to be true, it probably is.
It will require those of us in public service to make government more efficient, effective, and responsive to people's needs. That's why we're cutting programs we don't need, to pay for those we do. That's why we've made hundreds of regulatory reforms that will save businesses billions of dollars. That's why we're not just throwing money at education, but challenging schools to come up with the most innovative reforms and the best results.
And it will require American business leaders to understand that their obligations don't just end with their shareholders. Andy Grove, the former CEO of Intel put it best: ''There's another obligation I feel personally,'' he said, ''given that everything I've achieved in my career and a lot of what Intel has achieved were made possible by a climate of democracy, an economic climate and investment climate provided by the United States.''
This broader obligation can take different forms. At a time when the cost of hiring workers in China is rising rapidly, it should mean more CEOs deciding that it's time to bring jobs back to the United States not just because it's good for business, but because it's good for the country that made their business and their personal success possible.
I think about the Big Three Auto companies who, during recent negotiations, agreed to create more jobs and cars in America; who decided to give bonuses, not just to their executives, but to all their employees so that everyone was invested in the company's success.
I think about a company based in Warroad, Minnesota called Marvin Windows and Doors. During the recession, Marvin's competitors closed dozens of plants and let go hundreds of workers. But Marvin didn't lay off a single one of their four thousand or so employees. In fact, they've only laid off workers once in over a hundred years. Mr. Marvin's grandfather even kept his eight employees during the Depression.
When times get tough, the workers agree to give up some perks and pay, and so do the owners. As one owner said, ''You can't grow if you're cutting your lifeblood and that's the skills and experience your workforce delivers.'' For the CEO, it's about the community: ''These are people we went to school with,'' he said. ''We go to church with them. We see them in the same restaurant. Indeed, a lot of us have married local girls and boys. We could be anywhere. But we are in Warroad.''
That's how America was built. That's why we're the greatest nation on Earth. That's what our greatest companies understand. Our success has never just been about survival of the fittest. It's been about building a nation where we're all better off. We pull together, we pitch in, and we do our part, believing that hard work will pay off; that responsibility will be rewarded; and that our children will inherit a nation where those values live on.
And it is that belief that rallied thousands of Americans to Osawatomie maybe even some of your ancestors on a rain-soaked day more than a century ago. By train, by wagon, on buggy, bicycle, and foot, they came to hear the vision of a man who loved this country, and was determined to perfect it.
''We are all Americans,'' Teddy Roosevelt told them that day. ''Our common interests are as broad as the continent.'' In the final years of his life, Roosevelt took that same message all across this country, from tiny Osawatomie to the heart of New York City, believing that no matter where he went, or who he was talking to, all would benefit from a country in which everyone gets a fair chance.
Well into our third century as a nation, we have grown and changed in many ways since Roosevelt's time. The world is faster. The playing field is larger. The challenges are more complex.
But what hasn't changed what can never change are the values that got us this far. We still have a stake in each other's success. We still believe that this should be a place where you can make it if you try. And we still believe, in the words of the man who called for a New Nationalism all those years ago, ''The fundamental rule in our national life the rule which underlies all others is that, on the whole, and in the long run, we shall go up or down together.''
I believe America is on its way up. Thank you, God bless you, and may God bless the United States of America.

HEADLINE: Obama Sounds a Populist Call on G.O.P. Turf

BYLINE: By A. G. SULZBERGER; Helene Cooper and Robert Pear contributed reporting.

 BODY:
OSAWATOMIE, Kan. -- Laying out a populist argument for his re-election next year, President Obama ventured into the conservative heartland on Tuesday to deliver his most pointed appeal yet for a strong governmental role through tax and regulation to level the economic playing field.
''This country succeeds when everyone gets a fair shot, when everyone does their fair share and when everyone plays by the same rules,'' Mr. Obama said in an address that sought to tie his economic differences with Republicans into an overarching message.
Infusing his speech with the moralistic language that has emerged in the Occupy protests around the nation, Mr. Obama warned that growing income inequality meant that the United States was undermining its middle class and, ''gives lie to the promise that's at the very heart of America: that this is the place where you can make it if you try.''
''This is a make-or-break moment for the middle class, and all those who are fighting to get into the middle class,'' Mr. Obama told the crowd packed into the gym at Osawatomie High School. 
''At stake,'' he said, ''is whether this will be a country where working people can earn enough to raise a family, build a modest savings, own a home, and secure their retirement.''
Mr. Obama purposefully chose this hardscrabble town of 4,500 people, about 50 miles south of Kansas City, Kan., where Theodore Roosevelt once laid out the progressive platform he called ''the New Nationalism'' to put forth his case for a payroll tax cut and his broader arguments against the Republican economic agenda in what his aides hoped would be viewed as a defining speech.
Though it was lacking in specific new policy prescriptions, the hourlong speech, and the days of buildup that preceded it, marked the president's starkest attack on what he described as the ''breathtaking greed'' that contributed to the economic turmoil still reverberating around the nation. At one point, he noted that the average income of the top 1 percent -- adopting the marker that has been the focus of the Occupy movement -- has gone up by more than 250 percent, to $1.2 million a year.
The new tack reflected a decision by the White House and the president's campaign aides that -- with the economic recovery still lagging and Republicans in Congress continuing to oppose the president's jobs proposals -- the best course for Mr. Obama is to try to present himself as the defender of working-class Americans and Republicans as defenders of a small elite.
Republicans, though, portrayed the visit to Osawatomie (pronounced oh-suh-WAHT-ah-mee) as an effort by the president to paper over his failed stewardship of the national economy. Though unemployment levels dropped to 8.6 percent last month, they remain higher than the level at which any president has been re-elected since the Great Depression.
Mitt Romney, one of the contenders for the Republican presidential nomination, dismissed the president's address. ''I thought, 'In what way is he like Teddy Roosevelt?' '' Mr. Romney said. ''Teddy Roosevelt founded the Bull Moose Party. One of those words applies when the president talks about how he's helped the economy.''
The trip was Mr. Obama's third out of Washington in as many weeks to press for passage of the payroll tax break, which would reduce the how much employees pay for Social Security to 3.1 percent from the already reduced level of 4.2 percent. Under the Democratic proposal, which Republicans have blocked, the cut that would go to most working Americans would be offset in the budget by a 1. 9 percent surtax on those with modified adjusted gross incomes of more than $1 million. If Congress takes no action, the tax will revert back to 6.2 percent next month.
In Washington, the two parties remained at an impasse in their efforts to write legislation to extend the tax cut, with Senate Republicans rejecting the latest Democratic proposal and House Republicans still writing their own plan.
Though the earlier speeches on the payroll tax took place in swing states, the fact that the president brought the message to one of the most reliably Republican states in the country shows that he and his party are increasingly confident that they have found a message that resonates with voters.
This speech, however, was cast in broad historical terms, with Mr. Obama declaring that that after a century of struggle to build it, the middle class has been steadily eroded, even before the current economic turmoil, by Republican policies intended to reduce the size and scope of government -- ranging from tax cuts for the wealthy to deregulation of Wall Street.
''Fewer and fewer of the folks who contributed to the success of our economy actually benefited from that success,'' he said. ''Those at the very top grew wealthier from their incomes and investments than ever before. But everyone else struggled with costs that were growing and paychecks that weren't -- and too many families found themselves racking up more and more debt.''
Mr. Obama sought to pre-empt a Republican response that he was engaging in class warfare. ''This isn't about class warfare,'' he said. ''This is about the nation's welfare.''
The visit was unusual for its setting in a state that he lost decisively despite his own family roots -- his mother was born in Kansas. The vast majority of his visits as president have been to swing states like Pennsylvania that are expected to play an important role in next year's election. But it was here, 101 years ago, that Theodore Roosevelt laid the intellectual framework for his unsuccessful bid for a third term after leaving the Republican party. That speech, which Mr. Obama referred to repeatedly, touched on many of the same themes -- often in similar language -- like concentration of wealth and the need for government to ensure a level playing field. Central to progress, Mr. Roosevelt said, was the conflict between ''the men who possess more than they have earned and the men who have earned more than they possess.''
Mr. Obama, to laughter from those familiar with attacks against him, noted: ''For this, Roosevelt was called a radical, he was called a socialist, even a communist.''
After the speech, one woman in the audience, Debra Harrison said the president put voice to her concerns about this community, which has been eroded by job losses and depopulation.
''We're doing what the middle class has always done in this country,'' said Ms. Harrison, 51, who works at a nearby bank, shaking her head. ''We work hard. We teach our kids to work hard. But it's very hard for us to keep our heads above water these days. And it's even harder for our kids.''

HEADLINE: Gingrich Gains Favor in Iowa, New Poll Finds

BYLINE: By JEFF ZELENY and MARJORIE CONNELLY; Jeff Zeleny reported from Des Moines, and Marjorie Connelly from New York. Reporting was contributed from New York by Dalia Sussman, Allison Kopicki and Marina Stefan.

 BODY:
DES MOINES -- Newt Gingrich enters the final four weeks of campaigning before the Iowa caucuses with Republican voters in the state viewing him as more prepared to be president than Mitt Romney, more attuned to their concerns and just as capable of defeating President Obama, according to the latest New York Times/CBS News Poll.
Mr. Gingrich is rated more favorably than any of the other six remaining candidates in the race among voters who say they are likely to attend the Republican caucuses in Iowa. He would be supported enthusiastically as his party's presidential nominee by more voters than any of his rivals, the poll found, and is leading in the head-to-head competition as the campaign here builds.
But two-thirds of likely voters remain open to changing their minds, the poll found, with even more saying they are willing to embrace a candidate who is less conservative than they are in order to win the White House. And a large majority of voters say economic concerns are more important than social issues or immigration, suggesting that Mr. Romney has ample opportunity to make his case to voters. 
A presidential race that has seen candidates abruptly rise and sharply fall is still remarkably unsettled here in Iowa, where the Republican nominating contest opens on Jan. 3. The outcome of the caucuses is likely to trim the field of candidates and help shape the contours of the primary race as it moves to New Hampshire, South Carolina and beyond.
As the campaign intensifies through television advertising and get-out-the-vote efforts, the contest is hardly a Gingrich-Romney duel. Representative Ron Paul of Texas is essentially tied with Mr. Romney for second place, creating a combustible atmosphere as he and other rivals urgently work to slow the rapid ascent of Mr. Gingrich.
The voters who will render the first judgment on the Republican field have been carefully following the race -- 7 in 10 say they have watched recent televised debates -- and appear unified around the pursuit of beating Mr. Obama. Of the nearly 4 in 10 likely caucusgoers who say they get most of their information from Fox News, Mr. Gingrich is the overwhelming choice.
Mr. Gingrich, who is scrambling to build a campaign structure that can capitalize on his surging popularity, holds considerable advantages over his rivals. The poll found that he is winning support from 31 percent of likely caucusgoers, who rate him as the most empathetic, the strongest commander in chief and best prepared for the job by a 2-to-1 ratio. Mr. Romney had the support of 17 percent and Mr. Paul 16 percent.
The poll found that Mr. Gingrich is drawing more than twice as much support as Mr. Romney among men and those who identify themselves as conservative. He receives three times more support than Mr. Romney from evangelical Christians. Mr. Romney receives more support from voters who call themselves moderate.
Yet only 30 percent of likely caucusgoers say that they had been contacted by the Gingrich campaign, raising questions about his ability to identify his supporters and lure them to more than 1,600 precinct caucus locations on a winter night. By comparison, 60 percent say that they have been contacted by the Paul campaign and 47 percent by the Romney campaign, underscoring a stealth operation that has been under way for months.
''He's always been at the back of my mind,'' said Dennis Halsne, 65, a retired salesman from the central Iowa town of Woodward, speaking of Mr. Gingrich in a follow-up interview. He added: ''Is he a perfect candidate? Absolutely not. None of them are. But right now, he is the one who I would back.''
The rise of Mr. Gingrich comes after a year in which a forceful anti-Washington sentiment has driven the agenda of the Republican Party. A leading attribute cited in interviews with voters here is his deep experience in Washington. He does better among those who say candidates should only be judged based on their political record -- he is supported by 39 percent of those voters -- but among those who say candidates should also judged on their personal life, he gets 27 percent support.
For now, Mr. Gingrich's three marriages and some of the moderate positions he has taken do not appear to be dragging down his candidacy. But a variety of polls released here this week solidifies his role as the front-runner, and it remains an open question how prepared his campaign is to defend him as scrutiny increases over all aspects of his long public record.
''He's kind of mellowed with age,'' said Carolyn Hein, 58, a retired clerical worker from Humboldt. ''I'm on the fence a little about it, but he's still the most intelligent candidate out there.''
The survey provides a snapshot of the unsettled Republican nominating contest during a period when Herman Cain was weighing whether to continue his candidacy and ultimately decided to drop out on Saturday. The poll, which was conducted last Wednesday through Monday, included one question with Mr. Cain and another without. His standing was at 7 percent.
The rest of the Republican lineup found that Gov. Rick Perry of Texas has 11 percent, Representative Michele Bachmann of Minnesota is at 9 percent and Rick Santorum, a former senator from Pennsylvania, has 4 percent. Former Gov. Jon M. Huntsman Jr. of Utah, who is not actively campaigning in Iowa, received 1 percent.
The telephone poll was conducted in Iowa among 642 registered Republican and independent voters who said they were likely to take part in the Republican caucuses on Jan. 3. The poll has a margin of sampling error of plus or minus four percentage points.
About 3 in 10 of Mr. Gingrich's supporters said Mr. Romney was their second choice, while just over a quarter of Mr. Romney's supporters said Mr. Gingrich was their second choice. The Republicans are nearly equally divided over whether to select a nominee whom they agree with on issues or who stands the best chance of defeating Mr. Obama.
Mr. Romney is viewed favorably by 43 percent of Republicans, compared with 57 percent in a Times/CBS News Poll that was taken two months before the 2008 caucuses. Yet this time, voters say the economy is the overriding issue of the campaign and they are more interested in a candidate with business experience. Nearly two-thirds of voters say that it was not disqualifying to change positions on issues, as Mr. Romney has done.
''Why should we expect the politician to pick a viewpoint back in 2001, and now in 2011 he should have the same viewpoint?'' said Karen Anderson, 56, a college administrator from West Des Moines. ''Maybe the facts have changed. I think changing your mind is a strength.''

HEADLINE: Obama in Osawatomie

 BODY:
After months of Republican candidates offering a cascade of bad ideas about the economy, President Obama's speech in Osawatomie, Kan., Tuesday came as a relief. He made it clear that he was finally prepared to contest the election on the issues of income inequality and the obligation of both government and the private sector to enlarge the nation's shrinking middle class.
The economic downturn, combined with ideological gridlock, has created a ''make-or-break moment'' for the middle class and for those trying to enter it, he said. Mr. Obama correctly framed the choice for voters: The country can return to policies that stacked the deck for the wealthy and left everyone else to fend for themselves, creating what he called ''you're on your own economics.'' Or elected officials can step in to keep competition fair and ensure the government has enough money to protect the vulnerable and invest in education and research. 
The speech felt an awfully long time in coming, but it was the most potent blow the president has struck against the economic theory at the core of every Republican presidential candidacy and dear to the party's leaders in Congress. The notion that the market will take care of all problems if taxes are kept low and regulations are minimized may look great on a bumper sticker, but, he said: ''It doesn't work. It has never worked.'' Not before the Great Depression, not in the '80s, and not in the last decade.
The president repeated his calls for the rich to pay higher taxes, for financial institutions to be more closely regulated and for education to become a national mission. What set this speech apart was the newly forceful explanation of why those policies are necessary. Incomes of the top 1 percent, he noted, have more than doubled in the last decade while the average income has fallen by 6 percent.
The chances of a poor child making it into the middle class have severely diminished since World War II, he said. That, he said, ''flies in the face of everything that we stand for.''
It is rare for a president to be so explicit about a national income gap, but it is hardly ''un-American'' to think about it, as Newt Gingrich said recently. In fact, it is a pressing issue that goes back more than a century. Mr. Obama spoke in the same town where Theodore Roosevelt issued his call for a square deal in 1910. In demanding ''a new nationalism,'' Roosevelt supported strong government oversight of business, a ''graduated income tax on big fortunes,'' an inheritance tax and the primacy of labor over capital. For that, he was called a socialist and worse, as Mr. Obama observed, having endured the same.
Mr. Obama was late to Roosevelt's level of passion and action on behalf of the middle class and the poor, having missed several opportunities to make the tax burden more fair and demand real action on the housing crisis from the big banks that he excoriated so effectively in his speech.
But he has fought energetically for a realistic plan to put Americans back to work and has been stymied at every step by Republicans. That seems to have burned away his old urge to conciliate and compromise, and he is now fully engaged against the philosophy of his opponents.
Tuesday's speech, in fact, seemed expressly designed to counter Mitt Romney's argument that business, unfettered, will easily restore American jobs and prosperity. Teddy Roosevelt knew better 101 years ago, and it was gratifying to hear his fire reflected by President Obama.

HEADLINE: The Robin Hood Tax

BYLINE: By STEVEN GREENHOUSE and GRAHAM BOWLEY

 BODY:
They call it the Robin Hood tax -- a tiny levy on trades in the financial markets that would take money from the banks and give it to the world's poor.
And like the mythical hero of Sherwood Forest, it is beginning to capture the public's imagination.
Driven by populist anger at bankers as well as government needs for more revenue, the idea of a tax on trades of stocks, bonds and other financial instruments has attracted an array of influential champions, including the leaders of France and Germany, the billionaire philanthropists Bill Gates and George Soros, former Vice President Al Gore, the consumer activist Ralph Nader, Pope Benedict XVI and the archbishop of Canterbury.
''We all agree that a financial transaction tax would be the right signal to show that we have understood that financial markets have to contribute their share to the recovery of economies,'' the chancellor of Germany, Angela Merkel, told her Parliament recently. 
On Sunday, Mario Monti, the new prime minister of Italy, announced plans to impose a tax on certain financial transactions as part of a far-reaching plan to fix his country's budgetary problems, and he endorsed the idea of a Europewide transactions tax.
So far, the broader debt crisis engulfing the euro zone nations has pushed discussion of the tax into the background. But if European leaders can agree on a plan that calms the financial markets, they would be in a stronger position to enact a levy, analysts said.
''There is some momentum behind this,'' said Simon Tilford, chief economist of the Center for European Reform in London. ''If they keep the show on the road, they probably will attempt to run with this.''
The Robin Hood tax has also become a rallying point for labor unions, nongovernmental organizations and the Occupy Wall Street movement, which view it as a way to claw back money from the top 1 percent to help the other 99 percent. Last month, thousands of demonstrators, including hundreds in Robin Hood outfits with bright green caps and bows and arrows, flooded into southern Franceto urge the leaders of the Group of 20 nations to do more to help the poor, including passing a financial transactions tax.
Enacting such a tax still faces many hurdles, however -- most notably, skepticism from leaders in the United States and Britain, home to some of the world's most important financial exchanges.
The day after the Robin Hood protest, for example, Mr. Gates, the chairman of Microsoft and one of the world's wealthiest men, presented a report to a closed-door meeting of the G-20 leaders that laid out his ideas on how rich countries could aid poor ones. One of his proposals was a modest tax on trades of financial instruments that could generate $48 billion or more annually from the G-20 countries.
Ms. Merkel and France's president, Nicolas Sarkozy, quickly piped up, enthusiastically endorsing the tax. But Britain's prime minister, David Cameron, expressed serious reservations, saying Britain would embrace it only if it were adopted globally. British officials fear that unless the tax is worldwide, trading will flee London's huge markets to countries with no tax.
The Obama administration has also been lukewarm, expressing sympathy but saying it would be hard to execute, could drive trading overseas and would hurt pension funds and individual investors in addition to banks.
Administration officials say they would prefer a tax on the assets of the largest banks as a way to discourage them from risky activities. ''The president is sympathetic to the goals that a financial transactions tax is trying to achieve and he is pushing for a financial crisis responsibility fee and closing other Wall Street loopholes as the best and most feasible way to achieve those goals,'' an administration official said.
Still, support is growing for the idea, which has been largely dormant since the 1970s, when a version was first proposed by the economist James Tobin, later a Nobel Prize winner.
''The tax is a good idea because banks are where the money is. It's the same reason Jesse James robbed banks,'' said Rose Ann DeMoro, executive director of National Nurses United, which recently held demonstrations at the offices of 60 members of Congress in support of the levy. ''The thing about the financial transactions tax is it's stunning how quickly people get it and how fast they embrace it.''
Labor groups like the nurses' union and the A.F.L.-C.I.O. see the tax as a way to finance job creation programs to fight high unemployment in the United States and Europe.
Other advocates hope it will slow the speculation that many blame for undermining the euro and causing wild swings in financial markets. Mr. Gates and Mr. Sarkozy would like to use the money to finance development in the world's poorest nations. And leaders like Ms. Merkel and some members of Congress are eyeing it as a relatively painless source of money to help plug government deficits.
On Nov. 16, the French Senate passed a bill supporting a financial transactions tax. And the European Commission in Brussels has said it would like to put a tax of $10 per $10,000 of transactions in place throughout the European Union by 2014, predicting it would raise 57 billion euros ($77 billion) a year in European countries alone.
Last month, Representative Peter DeFazio, an Oregon Democrat, and Senator Tom Harkin, an Iowa Democrat, proposed an American version of the tax that they said could raise $350 billion over 10 years.
Their legislation would impose $3 in taxes for each $10,000 in transactions. Other proposals, including those from the nurses' union, call for a tax of $50 per $10,000.
Mr. DeFazio said his tax plan would ''raise money to invest in the real economy,'' but he acknowledged that it faced an uphill battle in Washington, especially within the antitax Republican caucus.
Opponents say that even at the rate in the DeFazio-Harkin bill, the tax would add significantly to the cost of trading, exceeding what institutional investors pay in commissions.
''At a time when we face a slow economic recovery, such a tax will impede the efficiency of markets and impair depth and liquidity as well as raise costs to the issuers, pensions and investors who help drive economic growth,'' Kenneth E. Bentsen Jr., executive vice president for public policy at the Securities Industry and Financial Markets Association, said in a statement.
George Osborne, the British chancellor of the exchequer, described the proposed tax as ''economic suicide'' for Europe. In this time of economic crisis, he said, the European Union ''should be coming forward with new ideas to promote growth, not undermine it.''
And Glenn Hubbard, who was chairman of the Council of Economic Advisers under President George W. Bush, said the Robin Hood tax is a ''monstrously bad idea.''
''Such a tax isn't really going to get at the banks,'' added Mr. Hubbard, who is now an adviser to the Republican presidential candidate Mitt Romney. ''It's going to hit the people who own the assets that are traded,'' like investors.
Supporters of a financial transactions tax note that Britain already imposes a levy of $50 per $10,000 of stocks traded, while Hong Kong and Singapore, with fast-growing financial markets, impose fees of $10 to $20 per $10,000 of the value of certain transactions.
The United States imposed a tiny tax on stock trades from 1914 to 1966.
The British actor Bill Nighy, who has made online videos promoting the tax, calls it a beautiful idea. ''It would raise enough money to solve problems at home and overseas, and it could do it without hurting ordinary people,'' he said.

HEADLINE: Media Wars: 'I Approved This Message,' but Just Not as Many of Them

BYLINE: By JEREMY W. PETERS

 BODY:
At this point in 2007, Iowa residents had been subjected to 26,037 television commercials from presidential candidates and political groups in a barrage of advertising that was unparalleled.
So far this year? Iowans have been hit with just 8,697 television ads. 
In New Hampshire the story is the same. In 2007 there were 12,940 commercials. This year there have been 4,588. These figures were compiled by Kantar Media's Campaign Media Analysis Group.
The reasons for the decline are many. For starters, only one side of the race is competitive this time around. In the 2008 presidential election, both Democrats and Republicans had nominating fights. But there are other issues at play, too, like the lack of big bank accounts by a few of the Republican candidates (Rick Santorum and Michele Bachmann) and the decision by others to delay running active campaigns in certain early states (Mitt Romney in Iowa; Gov. Rick Perry in New Hampshire). And there have been an abundance of televised debates this year, which gives candidates the kind of wide exposure they would otherwise likely seek through advertising.
The money spent in both years also shows a wide disparity. Campaigns and political groups had spent $21.6 million in Iowa by this point in 2007, and another $13 million in New Hampshire. This year they have spent just $2.4 million in Iowa and $1.3 million in New Hampshire.
But even when compared to 2003, the last year only one party had a contested primary, the figures are smaller (and they don't take inflation into account). In Iowa, $2.7 million had been spent for a total of 13,957 spots. In New Hampshire the numbers were $1,597,760 spent on 4,588 spots.
Mr. Romney, Mr. Perry, Representative Ron Paul of Texas and Newt Gingrich are all running television ads at the moment. Mr. Gingrich was the latest to join the fray, with a $220,000 buy in Iowa. His 60-second commercial, which features him talking about rebuilding the economy as bucolic images of the American landscape flash on the screen, will run there through Dec. 19 on broadcast television and Fox News.
A Fox News-only buy is a popular strategy among the candidates. Mr. Perry and Mr. Romney have also bought airtime exclusively on the cable network, including $40,000 worth of time that Mr. Romney reserved on Monday in New Hampshire. That was his first use of cable advertising in the state, which holds its primary on Jan. 10.
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

HEADLINE: The Wrong Fix

 BODY:
Chancellor Angela Merkel of Germany and President Nicolas Sarkozy of France issued an ultimatum on Monday demanding that all 17 nations using the euro agree to a change in European treaties that would force them to move toward balanced budgets or face sanctions. 
The deal, which they want approved this week, could buy temporary stability for the euro zone if Germany finally drops its objections and the European Central Bank quickly buys enough Italian and Spanish bonds to force their yields down to sustainable levels. But the Franco-German recipe will exacerbate Europe's fundamental problem: lack of growth. While German officials insist that budget discipline will restore markets' confidence, markets understand that a deepening recession will make it even harder for weak nations to repay their debts.
Europe's deeply indebted nations certainly must get their budgets under control, reform labor markets, sell state properties and become more competitive. But that can't be done without any growth. Germany could provide some of the needed boost: saving less and spending more; absorbing more imports from neighbors. But the plan provides for no German stimulus. In fact, the International Monetary Fund expects Germany to spend less: cutting its budget deficit to just over 1 percent of gross domestic product next year.
Germany and France argue that they are fixing the euro's original flaw: creating a monetary union without fiscal coordination. But, by removing members' control over spending (they surrendered the power to cut interest rates or devalue their currencies when they joined the euro), the plan will take away the last tool these countries have to manage their economies and respond to shocks.
A real fiscal union with centralized taxation would address this problem by transferring money from areas that were growing to regions that were struggling -- much like the federal government moves money across the United States. But Mrs. Merkel and Mr. Sarkozy have even opposed the creation of a European bond, backed by a central authority, to help finance those in distress.
It would be great if every country could be as economically successful as Germany. That cannot happen by fiat, not the least because Germany's success comes in part from exporting to its weaker neighbors and it has no plan to return the favor now. Instead of trying to re-engineer the euro zone overnight, Germany should use its wealth -- and that of the E.C.B. -- to back up foundering countries, alleviate Europe's economic slump and give its weak neighbors more time to grow and reform.

HEADLINE: Congress Discusses Enacting Stricter Insider-Trading Laws

BYLINE: By BLOOMBERG NEWS

 BODY:
Democrats and Republicans on the House Financial Services Committee on Tuesday advocated new restrictions on insider trading to help lift waning public trust in Congress.
Previous efforts to pass restrictions on insider trading have not advanced in Congress. The issue re-emerged after a report last month by the CBS News program ''60 Minutes,'' which said members of Congress bought stock in companies during debates on legislation that might affect the businesses. 
None of the investments by members of Congress was illegal, the report said.
''This is about restoring faith,'' said Representative Tim Walz, a Minnesota Democrat who is sponsoring legislation to explicitly ban insider trading. ''If you think a 9 percent approval rating is bad, don't do anything, drag it out and watch what happens,'' he said referring to polling on Americans' approval of Congress.
The committee's chairman, Spencer Bachus, an Alabama Republican, said the panel would vote on legislation next week. ''It is absolutely essential that we do restore the public's trust,'' Mr. Bachus said. ''If this is the answer, so be it.''
Mr. Bachus was among the lawmakers mentioned in the ''60 Minutes'' report.
In the segment on Nov. 13, CBS reported that, during the 2008 financial crisis, Mr. Bachus, then the ranking Republican on the Financial Services Committee, bet stock prices would fall while being briefed privately that a global crisis might be imminent.
In a statement at the time, Mr. Bachus's office said he never traded on nonpublic information.
The CBS report generated interest by lawmakers in legislation first introduced in 2006 by Representative Louise Slaughter, a New York Democrat.
That measure was reintroduced this year by Mr. Walz. It would label as securities fraud any trading on legislative information by lawmakers or their staff members. The bill would require any trades of more than $1,000 to be reported within 90 days.
The bill would require regulators to draft rules barring individuals and political intelligence firms, which use their contacts in Washington to provide financial firms with market-related information, from selling nonpublic information obtained from federal employees. It also would require firms or individuals involved in political intelligence to register in the same way as federal lobbyists.
The Senate's Homeland Security Committee, meanwhile, is examining bipartisan proposals to restrict certain trading by lawmakers and their aides, who often have access to nonpublic information as part of their jobs.

HEADLINE: In Foreign Policy, G.O.P. Candidates Search for Obama's Vulnerable Spot

BYLINE: By RICHARD A. OPPEL Jr.

 BODY:
A small but revealing episode unfolded in the closing minutes of the last Republican presidential debate. After the candidates were asked to name the national security issue they most worry about, which had not yet been discussed, Rick Santorum cited radical Islamists in Central and South America.
Mitt Romney agreed, saying that Hezbollah, a militant Shiite group in Lebanon that is backed by Iran and Syria, was working in Mexico, Venezuela and throughout Latin America, posing an ''imminent threat.'' Earlier in the night, Gov. Rick Perry of Texas warned that Hezbollah, as well as Hamas, the Palestinian militant organization that controls Gaza, also were working in Mexico. 
That the candidates would cite the same threat -- one denied by the Mexican government, and which seemed to contrast with a State Department report that there are no Hezbollah-related operational cells in this hemisphere -- was not a coincidence.
Now that several months of full-throated campaigning are on the books, a major thrust of the Republican foreign-policy argument has emerged: that President Obama has not strongly supported Israel and that he has been too soft on its adversaries, Iran, Hezbollah and the Palestinians. That softness, they say, extends to other parts of the world.
The Republicans are expected to press this case on Wednesday at a Republican Jewish Coalition forum in Washington, just as they have stepped up attacks in recent days, demanding that Howard Gutman, the ambassador to Belgium, be recalled after he said that some anti-Semitism was fueled by continuing tensions with Palestinians.
But attacking the Obama administration on foreign policy may prove challenging. The administration can point to the overthrow of Muammar el-Qaddafi, its efforts opposing United Nations recognition for Palestinian statehood, the killing of Osama bin Laden and the weakening of Al Qaeda on the Afghan-Pakistani border.
Mr. Obama's approval ratings on foreign policy are healthy, and the president asserted before an audience at a New York fund-raiser last week that he has the best record on Israel of any president.
Republicans, however, say Mr. Obama's successes are far outweighed by his failures.
''On Israel, he has a pretty consistently weak record, and on Iran he has a pretty consistently naive approach,'' said Richard Williamson, a top foreign policy adviser to Mitt Romney and diplomat during the past three Republican administrations.
Support for Israel has become something of a litmus test for evangelical Christians in early voting states like Iowa and South Carolina, where large numbers of voters and caucusgoers describe themselves as evangelical. And in the general election, Jewish voters may be critical in swing states like Florida and Pennsylvania.
When it comes to Iran, Republicans describe a long list of mistakes: they say that Mr. Obama did not do enough to support protesters in Iran two years ago, as they battled the government; that he put too much faith in international agreement on sanctions against the country to keep it from building a nuclear bomb, an effort set back last month after China and Russia refused to go along with tougher measures; and that he erred in refusing to sanction the Iranian Central Bank.
Several leading Republican candidates, including Mr. Romney and Newt Gingrich, say they favor military action if all else fails to prevent Iran from building a nuclear device.
But supporters of the administration say that robust covert actions -- though it's not clear by whom -- have slowed the nuclear program, while economic sanctions have put pressure on the regime, even without going after the central bank, an action the administration fears would further destabilize the European economy.
The administration and some senior Israeli security officials have also warned that a military strike would do little to slow the program over the long term, and could lead to war and give Iran rationale to build weapons. Meir Dagan, the recently retired chief of Mossad, the Israeli intelligence service, called an attack a ''stupid idea.'' The White House says a military option remains on the table.
On Israel, Republicans have focused criticism on a speech Mr. Obama gave in May in which he said a starting point for a two-state solution should be the pre-1967 borders, adjusted through swaps of land agreed to by both sides. President Obama, Mr. Romney said, ''has thrown Israel under the bus.''
Republican candidates seem to be suggesting that Mr. Obama cannot be trusted to work with Israel's leaders. They noted that in November, in a private conversation that was overheard, he appeared to sympathize with President Nicolas Sarkozy of France when Mr. Sarkozy described Mr. Netanyahu as a ''liar.''
''I thought the conversation between Sarkozy and the president the other day was really disgraceful,'' Mr. Gingrich said. ''I mean, to be unhappy with Benjamin Netanyahu, who is trying to survive in a dangerous neighborhood, struck me as just flagrantly inappropriate. To have our president agree with Sarkozy I thought was really disgusting, frankly.''
Administration supporters say the White House has firmly backed Israel, opposing efforts to win United Nations recognition for Palestinian statehood and increasing military assistance, including more than $200 million for a missile defense system to counter rockets fired from Gaza.
They also note that Mr. Obama's speech in May tracks what other administrations have used to pursue negotiations between the two sides. Mr. Obama has won strong praise from the Israeli defense minister, Ehud Barak, and a recent poll by the Brookings Institution found that a majority of Israeli Jews had a favorable view of Mr. Obama.
Some analysts say the Republican candidates' efforts to be Israel's biggest supporter have made the party more hawkish on Israel than Israeli Jews in general.
''There is far more division of opinion and lively debate in Israel on these very questions than here in the U.S., where support for Israel gets equated with a much narrower view, which is to say support for the current rightist government,'' said Paul R. Pillar, a professor at Georgetown University and former intelligence analyst specializing in the Middle East.
While many Republican analysts support the candidates' focus on the Middle East, some say they could expand their foreign policy approach.
Roger Noriega, an assistant secretary of state during the Bush administration, is a visiting fellow at the American Enterprise Institute who wrote the analysis of Hezbollah activity in Latin America, which the Romney and Perry campaigns cited as their source for their debate comments.
''There is strong support for Israel, strong concern about Iran, but I don't know whether there is much vision beyond that,'' Mr. Noriega said.

HEADLINE: Bank Settles Securities Case

BYLINE: By THE ASSOCIATED PRESS

 BODY:
Bank of America has agreed to pay $315 million to settle claims by investors that they were misled about mortgage-backed investments sold by its Merrill Lynch unit. 
The settlement was disclosed in court papers filed late Monday in Federal District Court in Manhattan. It is subject to approval by a judge.
The lawsuit, a class action, was led by the pension fund of the Public Employees' Retirement System of Mississippi. The fund said the investments had been backed by poor-quality mortgages written by the subprime lenders Countrywide Financial, First Franklin Financial and IndyMac Bancorp, a bank that failed in 2008.
The settlement is another attempt by Bank of America to put its legal issues behind it. In the first half of the year alone, the bank put up $12.7 billion to settle similar claims from different groups of investors.
The settlement is subject to the approval of Judge Jed S. Rakoff, which could prove difficult because it includes no admission of guilt from Bank of America.
Last week, Judge Rakoff struck down a $285 million settlement that Citigroup had reached with the Securities and Exchange Commission.
The settlement would have imposed penalties on Citigroup without requiring it to admit or deny accusations that it misled investors.
The judge said the public had a right to know what had happened in cases that touch on ''the transparency of financial markets whose gyrations have so depressed our economy and debilitated our lives.''
In 2009, Judge Rakoff rejected a $33 million settlement between the S.E.C. and Bank of America on similar grounds, calling it a breach of ''justice and morality.''

HEADLINE: Despite Economic Slump, Europe Gets More Tech Start-Ups

BYLINE: NICK BILTON


HIGHLIGHT: While Europe continues to suffer major economic troubles with slow fiscal growth and high unemployment rates, its technology industry continues to grow. For example, Angry Birds, Spotify, SoundCloud, Last.fm and Cut the Rope are all incredibly successful start-ups that began in different European cities and are now succeeding in the United States. 

 BODY:
While Europe as a whole continues to suffer major economic troubles with slow fiscal growth and abnormally high unemployment rates, one industry continues to grow steadily: tech.
This is apparent at the annual LeWeb conference, a gathering of more than 3,500 - up from 2,800 last year - entrepreneurs, programmers and journalists gathering in Paris this week to meet with hundreds European start-ups, and a few American ones, too.
It's also illustrated throughout Europe with the dozens of start-ups that are successfully becoming part of the wider cultural fabric. For example, Angry Birds, Spotify, SoundCloud, Last.fm and Cut the Rope are all incredibly successful start-ups that began in Europe and are dominating in the United States.
Yet until recently, there were very few technology products that made their way across the pond to the United States. Most innovations only traveled in the opposite direction.
"There has been a dramatic shift in the last few years with European entrepreneurs who are no longer trying to be copycats of American tech, which was pretty sad. Europeans are now really innovating on their own." said Loic Le Meur, a co-founder of the LeWeb conference, during a phone interview from Paris. For several years, European start-ups tried to emulate Silicon Valley, he said, creating products similar to Twitter, Facebook and the whatever was the hot new tech theme of the year in the United States.
Innovation is happening all across Europe. Dublin, for example, has seen the growth of its own mini-Silicon Valley, with Google and Facebook opening up European headquarters there. This is partly driven by the country's low corporate tax rates.
"It's completely countercyclical to what's happening with the rest of the European economy. Technology here is completely uncorrelated and is growing rapidly," Mr. Le Meur said. "Last year, for example, we had 300 start-up submissions at LeWeb; this year it's already up to 600," he said, referring to the new European tech companies that will make presentations at the show this week.
Venture investments have also been on the rise in recent years. And there is incentive for start-ups to begin in Europe. For example, some European countries, including Ireland and Germany, impose fewer restrictions on new companies than the United States does, as the Economix blog reported earlier this year.
European technology and economic experts also note that technology innovation is not centralized in one European country.
Joe Haslam, a professor of entrepreneurship at IE Business School in Madrid, describes the European growth of technology start-ups as a "cluster rather than a hub."
"Science has eliminated distance. It is now possible to be plugged into what is happening in the Valley without actually being there," he wrote in an e-mail interview. "The success stories out of France, Spain or the Nordic countries are the result of the leadership of exceptional individuals rather than something nurtured by an ecosystem."
Although Mr. Haslam sees exciting new European entrepreneurship in recent years, he still believes there is a long way to go to.
"I very much regret how Europe has lost the clear lead she had in mobile. I expected that we would be much further along the way in things like cashless payments and location awareness," he wrote. "Maybe it's the carriers' fault, not the start-ups. But billion-dollar companies should have come out of that."
Mr. Haslam also said that he hopes entrepreneurs stop looking for fame as their goal, but should look for other affirmations. He pointed to Israel, where the ultimate goal of start-ups is to be on the Nasdaq exchange.

HEADLINE: Tax Cut or Tax Increase?

BYLINE: THE NEW YORK TIMES


HIGHLIGHT: Will the rich pay more or less in taxes under a new tax code being considered in Albany? 

 BODY:
The overhaul of the state's income tax structure agreed to by Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo and legislative leaders will tax income over $2 million (for married couples filing jointly) at 8.82 percent. That is significantly higher than the state's highest base income tax rate, which is 6.85 percent, but slightly lower than the 8.97 percent rate that for the last three years has been imposed on high incomes under a surcharge that was set to expire Dec. 31. 
So the state's wealthiest will be taxed next year at a slightly lower rate than this year, but a higher rate than they expected. Politicians and editorial writers have differed over whether that change constitutes a tax hike, or a tax cut, for the rich. What do you think?

HEADLINE: A Deer and a Minivan: A Holiday Travel Story

BYLINE: ANN CARRNS


HIGHLIGHT: A holiday travel saga featuring deer and a minivan. 

 BODY:
I wrote recently about an apparent decline in the number of deer-car collisions, possibly because the slow economy had reduced the volume of cars on the road. Over the Thanksgiving holiday, my family did its part to boost those numbers.
We hit a deer. Or more accurately, a deer hit us as we drove through rural Arkansas on our way to visit family and friends in Georgia. Once you've experienced a large, horned animal smashing through the window of your car, the statistics take on new significance (as does the meaning of the word "deductible").
The incident began with a simple error. We'd left later than expected, so when we drove through Little Rock, it was getting dark. We weren't using a GPS and managed somehow to get off the main highway. We drove about 20 minutes until we realized our mistake and turned onto a wooded secondary road that would get us back on course toward Memphis.
As we headed down the dark, two-lane highway, I urged my husband, who was driving our minivan, to use the high beams. "There might be deer." (Cue ominous music.)
While our children watched a video in the back seat, I fiddled with my smartphone, trying to find a place to eat. So I was completely unprepared when the van lurched violently to the left. A jarring whomp from behind came next, accompanied by the tinkling of shattering glass, followed by the whistling of wind and, after a second of shocked silence, the screams of my children.
My husband had spotted a large buck running toward the van from the side of the road and had swerved into the oncoming lane to avoid it (That's usually what gets drivers in trouble, because they tend to end up hitting other cars. Luckily, no vehicles were driving from the other direction.) But the deer kept coming and blundered into the side of our van.
The best we can tell, his antlers broke the window (the far rear passenger-side panel, just behind where my 8-year-old was sitting) and his hooves made a big dent in the side of the van. None of us was hurt. (I don't know for sure what happened to the deer. It was dark, and we couldn't see anything on the road. But I assume he died.)
After climbing into the back seat to calm my daughters and to assure them that there wasn't a deer carcass lying in the cargo area, we drove to the next town, where a helpful auto shop owner kept his lights on late to help us duct tape the window and vacuum up the broken glass before we limped to a hotel.
Our insurance representative helpfully found us a glass company that repaired our window once we arrived in Atlanta. (The repairman, by the way, shared his own deer tale. A friend was attacked by a buck in north Georgia while riding his motorcycle, suffering a sliced leg and a $5,000 repair bill to his bike.) The cost of the new window is mostly out of our pocket because of a $500 deductible. I expect that the body work, to fix the dent, will be covered by our insurance policy.
One step we didn't take, and should have, was to call the local police to report the deer strike. Sometimes, wounded deer can stumble back onto the road, causing a hazard to other drivers, so alerting authorities is a good idea. In the confusion after our collision, we didn't think to do that.
We've now adopted a "no driving at night" policy, at least, during deer mating season, which apparently occurs in the fall and leads to a spike in deer-auto accidents in October and November. And we're rethinking that deductible.
Have you ever hit a deer? What sort of damage did it cause, and how much did it cost you in repairs?

HEADLINE: More on Labor Force Dropouts

BYLINE: CATHERINE RAMPELL


HIGHLIGHT: A closer look at why women have accounted for a majority of workers dropping out of the labor force during the recovery. 

 BODY:
On Tuesday I wrote about how the entirety of the net decline in the labor force last month could be explained by women dropping out. I also puzzled over why a majority of women who left the labor force happened to have been employed before they opted out, because the stereotypical labor force dropout is usually an unemployed worker who got discouraged and gave up looking for a new job.
Since then I've dug into the history of labor force dropouts and what workers usually do right before they leave the labor force. As it turns out, November's breakdown was not terribly unusual; a majority of women who leave the labor force each month are usually coming directly from a job (perhaps because they're retiring, going on maternity leave or are laid off and not seeking re-employment):
Note, however, that the number of women who leave the labor force directly from a job has actually fallen in the last few years, while the number of women leaving the labor force after having been recently unemployed has risen. This supports the discouraged-worker explanation of recent trends.
The same is true for men. As with female dropouts, typically most of the men who leave the labor force each month have been leaving directly after holding a job:
But while the number of men dropping out directly after holding a job (e.g., retirees) has stayed relatively flat in recent years, the number of men dropping out of the labor force after a spell of unemployment has risen.
Part of last month's bizarre dropout pattern has been solved, then: In any given month of the last decade most of the people dropping out of the labor force have been leaving jobs, but the reason the total number of dropouts has risen more is that more unemployed workers have given up applying for jobs. Again, it's the discouraged-worker narrative.
That still leaves some gender dynamics to be explained, though.
During the recession, which technically lasted from December 2007 to June 2009, some men dropped out of the labor force, and many times more women joined it. Many of these new female workers were probably stepping up as breadwinners when their husbands were laid off.
During the recovery, which extends from June 2009 to the present, both men and women have dropped out of the labor force, but many more women have dropped out than men.
Probably female dropouts have exceeded male dropouts lately because state and local government layoffs have disproportionately hit women. And as those women are laid off, they may become too discouraged by the sorry job market to even apply for new positions.

HEADLINE: A Master Plan for N.J.'s Energy Needs

BYLINE: MIREYA NAVARRO


HIGHLIGHT: There are no surprises, but environmentalists and some legislators are still disappointed by the scaling back of renewable energy goals. 

 BODY:
The final version of Gov. Chris Christie's master plan on energy for New Jersey is in, reflecting only minimal tweaks since a draft was released over the summer.
The plan is not binding, but sets forth the Republican governor's vision of how the state will meet its electricity needs over the next decade. It scales back New Jersey's goals for renewable energy, calling for 22.5 percent of electricity to be generated from such sources by 2021, down from the previous administration's goal of 30 percent.
Governor Christie had called the lower amount more realistic. On Tuesday, he said that the plan would manage the state's energy needs in a way that saves money, creates jobs and protects the environment.
"This plan represents my administration's commitment to changing the way we produce, distribute and use energy as part of a broader emphasis on renewable sources of energy and economic growth," he said in a written statement.

The plan recommends some changes to help stabilize the market for the state's solar incentive program, which has made New Jersey one of the top states in solar power capacity. But environmentalists and some state legislators are still smarting over the scaling back of renewable energy goals and a decision by the governor earlier this year to withdraw New Jersey from a regional trading system - the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative - that provides participating states with hundreds of millions of dollars for investments in clean energy and energy efficiency projects.
"The previous Energy Master Plan, which included New Jersey as a member of the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative, created thousands of good-paying jobs as it moved us toward a renewable future," said John F. McKeon, a Democrat who is chairman of the state Assembly's Environment and Public Waste Committee. He called the final plan "regressive" and "shortsighted" and said it would prolong the state's reliance on fossil fuels.
The plan puts a greater emphasis on electricity powered by natural gas, which has become an issue in parts of the Northeast because of the increasing use of a controversial extraction process known as horizontal hydraulic fracturing. Although New Jersey, unlike New York, will not undergo such drilling because it lacks natural gas reserves, it is seeking to build three new plants powered by natural gas.
The state has set an overall goal of meeting 70 percent of its electricity needs with clean energy sources, but it defines such sources not just as renewables but also nuclear power, natural gas and hydroelectric plants.
The energy master plan is subject to revisions at least once every three years.

HEADLINE: In Quebec, Winter Tire Law Reaps a Modest Measure of Success

BYLINE: IAN AUSTEN


HIGHLIGHT: A Quebec law enacted in 2008 that mandates snow tires on passenger vehicles over the winter months has been credited for a reduction in serious car accidents. 

 BODY:
OTTAWA - It's the annual crunch time at tire shops and garages throughout the province of Quebec. Drivers must fit passenger vehicles with four winter tires by Dec. 15 and keep them on until March 15, or risk fines of 200 to 300 Canadian dollars.
Despite the threat of financial penalties, the tire law enjoys considerable popular support in Quebec, largely because its potential penalties would affect so few drivers. Before the law was enacted in 2008, 90 percent of motorists already used winter tires. An analysis of accident data over the law's first two winters, however, suggests that the measure nevertheless contributed to reduced accident rates across the province.
The study (PDF, in French only) by the Quebec Ministry of Transport concludes that all winter accidents fell by 17 percent compared with the five winters preceding the enactment of the law, while accidents causing deaths or serious injuries fell by 36 percent. In Montreal, which held the lowest rate of winter tire use before the law was enacted, serious accidents fell by 46 percent.
The report's authors noted that since the tire law came into being, road accidents in all four seasons had declined for a variety of reasons. But even after controlling for the factors that improved year-round road safety, the ministry attributed a net accident reduction of 5 percent to the winter-tire law.
The results did not surprise the Transport Ministry.
"We noticed before that the 10 percent of motorists using all-season tires were implicated in 33 percent of accidents in winter," said Caroline Larose, a Montreal-based spokeswoman for the ministry. At temperatures below roughly 45 degrees, the rubber compounds in all-season tires harden, reducing both traction and tire handling, whereas the winter tires remain supple. The study attributed the reduction of the accident rate to the better handling characteristics afforded by winter tires, even on dry roads.
Ms. Larose said that several other Canadian provinces have contacted Quebec about the efficacy of the tire law, but no inquiries have come from state or federal government agencies in the United States.
The specialized tires are mandatory for all passenger cars and taxis registered in the province, as well as rental cars picked up from locations in Quebec, irrespective of their registration. Motorists with cars registered in the United States are exempted. Quebecers who flee to the American Southeast each winter can receive a permit exempting them from the law for seven days if they return home without snow tires during the mandatory period.
While the law may make motorists safer, Quebecers are faced with an aesthetic issue. Owners of cars that ride on alloy wheels may opt for less costly, and more robust, steel rims for the winter, and may economize further by not buying wheel covers.
Some drivers, particularly those with all-wheel-drive crossovers, initially were not so accepting of the law. Ralph E. Warner, the director of operations for the Rubber Association of Canada, an industry trade group, said that although all-wheel-drive vehicles can often start in snowy conditions when shod with only all-season tires, after the vehicle gets going, "you need winter tires to remain on the part of the road you want to be on."
As of 2014, only tires that carry a symbol of a snowflake inside a three-peaked mountain will qualify as winter tires. These tires must provide at least 10 percent more grip in medium-packed snow than an all-season tire, although most models generally exceed that requirement while also providing improved ice traction. The ministry will not accept models labeled "M+S," indicating mud and snow, on the sidewall.
It does not appear that there are any immediate plans to enact similar laws elsewhere in Canada. Last month, the government of Saskatchewan, a particularly wintry province, rejected a similar mandate.

HEADLINE: Foreclosed in Brooklyn: House Repairs as Protest

BYLINE: MEREDITH HOFFMAN


HIGHLIGHT: Some members of Occupy Wall Street are making a house in East New York livable for a needy family. 

 BODY:
With a soggy cluster of balloons floating beside him, a shaggy-haired demonstrator kept watch on Wednesday inside the front gate of a dilapidated two-story home in East New York, Brooklyn. The residential block was mostly empty, except for a police car idling at the curb.
It was quite the contrast from Tuesday night's street party as members of the Occupy Wall Street movement moved into the foreclosed house. The goal was to restore the home to a suitable condition so that a needy family could move in. 
On Wednesday, the reality of the task was clear: the ceiling was covered in mold, the carpets were mildewed, walls were partially knocked down, and there were a pile of sleeping bags and a beer bottle on the floor. 
And so the work began. 
"This is not a new occupation for occupiers -- this is about the family," said Max Berger, 26, of Brooklyn. "We're trying to fix up the home for the family."
The campaign in Brooklyn is part of a national effort that started on Tuesday in more than 20 states to take over foreclosed houses and turn them over to needy people. The police have taken no action against the occupiers at the house on Vermont Avenue in Brooklyn, but are there to keep the peace, according to a department spokeswoman. 
The property was foreclosed on in 2008 by Countrywide, which was acquired by Bank of America, according to Sean Barry of Vocal-NY, a community organizing group that is working with the Occupy movement. The bank has not issued an eviction notice to force the demonstrators out. 
The most daunting challenge, for now, seems the renovation. Construction and architecture experts are evaluating the house, but certain needs are already obvious: running water and electricity, for instance, which Mr. Berger said the group was working to restore. The mold, which he said "is not toxic," must be removed (he said they were beginning that work on Wednesday), and the mountain of dingy items (like a bed frame and mattress) will need to go. 
Eventually, all the work is meant to turn the house into a new home for Tasha Glasgow, 30, her companion and their two young children. Ms. Glasgow said the move would "change everything." Since her 9-year-old daughter, who has severe autism, was a baby, Ms. Glasgow said she had been in and out of shelters. For the moment she is squatting in an apartment in Far Rockaway, Queens. 
She moved into that apartment in 2007, but two years ago the landlord and superintendent left, she said - so now she pays no rent, but lacks water and heat. She added that the building was "falling apart." Meanwhile, her children's father is sleeping on his sister's couch.
"I think the new place will be better, because when I saw it the place wasn't all that, but people were already fixing it up," she said of the Vermont Avenue house.
The demonstrators are trying. 
On Wednesday a man wearing a mask was on the first floor breaking up old drywall, preparing to replace it. Wires snaked along the floor so demonstrators could broadcast what was happening in the house online. The live stream was the occupiers' "only defense," Mr. Berger said, should the police try to evict them. 
Some of the neighbors peeked at the work from their windows. 
Joyceleen Burnett, 69, surveyed the scene from her house across the street. She said the occupation attracted media attention to her "quiet neighborhood and this street you never see in the news."
"The banks need a waking up," she said. She and her husband, Gladford Bryant, have lived on the block since 1974, and recalled repeated problems with drugs and crime in the vacant building. 
"We need the house to be occupied by somebody," Mr. Bryant said. "Put a decent, nice family there."

HEADLINE: Canadians Deny a Wallenda's Bid to Wire-Walk Across Niagara Falls

BYLINE: ANDY NEWMAN


HIGHLIGHT: The local authority on the Canadian side of the falls cited safety concerns, but Nik Wallenda said he would not give up the fight. 

 BODY:
You can't tightrope-walk across Niagara Falls if only one side says yes. And on Wednesday, local authorities on the Canadian side said no to Nik Wallenda, the seventh-generation funambulist who had sought to be the first man, woman or child to tiptoe above the rushing gorge in more than a century.
The Niagara Parks Commission, which controls the parkland on the Ontario side of the falls, rejected Mr. Wallenda's proposal to traverse 1,800 feet on a two-inch steel cable, citing concerns about safety and copycats.
"These types of activities are risky and can result in tragic consequences for performers, spectators and emergency personnel," the commission said in a statement, adding that granting Mr. Wallenda permission could "encourage other individuals to attempt unsanctioned acts." 
Mr. Wallenda, 32, said he found the news "a little bit disheartening" but said he would appeal to Canada's national tourism officials.
New York State and the authorities in Niagara Falls, N.Y. -- a considerably more rundown municipality than its Canadian counterpart that could use the publicity the crossing could bring -- had thrown their support behind Mr. Wallenda's bid. In September, Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo approved legislation to give Mr. Wallenda a permit.
But the Canadian authorities have been frowning upon "stunting" at the falls since at least 1885, when the parks commission was formed to correct the "increasingly carnival atmosphere" cheapening the cataract's natural majesty.
Mr. Wallenda had engaged in months of tightrope diplomacy. In August, he presented his case to the parks commission, which asked him to submit a proposal to see if his plan met "the best interests of the park."
Last month he appeared before the commission again, noted a consultant's report that the event would draw at least 60,000 spectators and bring in up to $20 million, and told the panel, "To deny that seems a little bit arrogant and foolish." The commission's chairwoman, foreshadowing Wednesday's decision, said at the time, "Over many years, it has been the mission of the commission that stunting is not the means to create long-term economic investment."
The last tightrope walker to cross the falls was James Hardy of Toronto in 1896, according to the Niagara Tourism and Convention Corporation, the tourism agency on the American side.
Mr. Wallenda said from his home in Florida that he was used to getting turned down the first time around.
"I broke six world records last year and every one of those venues initially said no," he said. He noted that he had support of the mayor of Niagara Falls, Ontario and a member of Ontario's provincial parliament and said he planned to press his case to Ontario's tourism minister, Michael Chan.
"Hopefully, he'll see something in the proposal that the parks didn't," Mr. Wallenda said. "Just because I hear a 'no' doesn't mean I'll pack my bags and go home."

HEADLINE: Naomi Klein's Inconvenient Climate Conclusions

BYLINE: ANDREW C. REVKIN


HIGHLIGHT: A critic of capitalism argues that climate progress can only come through a global economic reboot. 

 BODY:
Naomi Klein, the author of a string of provocative and popular books including "The Shock Doctrine," recently took on global warming policy and campaigns in "Capitalism vs. the Climate," a much-discussed cover story for The Nation that has been mentioned by readers here more than once in the last few weeks.
The piece begins with Klein's conclusion, reached after she spent time at a conclave on climate sponsored by the libertarian Heartland Institute, that passionate corporate and conservative foes of curbs on greenhouse gases are right in asserting that a meaningful response to global warming would be a fatal blow to free markets and capitalism.
She challenges the environmental left to embrace this reality instead of implying that modest changes in lifestyle and shopping habits and the like can decarbonize human endeavors on a crowding planet.
Please dive in. The piece is particularly relevant this week given the continued standoffs and disconnect between stated goals and behavior at the climate treaty talks in Durban, South Africa. Whether you embrace or dispute her conclusions, the article is a worthy and substantive provocation. I disagree with her in pretty profound ways, yet some of her points echo my assertion awhile back that greenhouse-driven climate change is "not the story of our time" but a symptom of much deeper issues. I contacted Klein, who kindly spent quite a bit of time engaging in an e-conversation about her argument. Here's our chat: 
Q.
First, I was happy to see you dive into the belly of the many-headed beast challenging the need for greenhouse-gas cuts (as was clear from your piece, you recognize that there's no single species called "deniers"). There are lots of slings and arrows awaiting anyone exploring this terrain, as was the case with the Heartland meeting in 2008. What prompted you to do an in-depth look at global warming stances and the issues underlying this "crisis"?
A.
I got interested after attending the UN climate summit in Copenhagen in 2009. Like a lot of people who watched that train wreck up close, I came away wanting to understand the massive gap between the euphoric expectations of the environmental movement and the real political outcomes. When I got home, I was stunned by a new Harris poll that showed that the percentage of Americans who believed in anthropogenic climate change had plummeted from 71 per cent to 51 per cent in just two years. So here we were thinking that the world was on the verge of some kind of climate breakthrough while a large segment of the U.S. population was rejecting the science altogether. I wanted to understand how that could have happened.
I had a bit of an "a-ha" moment reading this paper by the excellent Australian political scientist Clive Hamilton, in which he argues that a great many American conservatives have come to see climate science as a threat to their core ideological identity. Then I read Merchants of Doubt by Naomi Oreskes and Erik Conway, which explains that many of the key scientists behind the denier movement hold a similar point of view - they are old-school Cold Warriors who came to see fighting environmentalism as a battle to protect "freedom" and the American way of life.
But as I read all this, I found myself thinking that from within the hard-right worldview, these responses were entirely rational. If you really do believe that freedom means governments getting out of the way of corporations and that any regulation leads us down Hayek's road to serfdom, then climate science is going to be kryptonite to you. After all, the reality that humans are causing the climate to warm, with potentially catastrophic results, really does demand radical government intervention in the market, as well as collective action on an unprecedented scale. So you can understand why many conservatives see climate change as a threat to their identity. Too often the liberal climate movement runs away from the deep political and economic implications of climate science, which is why I wrote the piece. I think we need to admit that climate change really does demand a profound interrogation of the ideology that currently governs our economy. And that's not bad news, since our current economic model is failing millions of people on multiple fronts.
Q.
Your examination of liberals' views appropriately reveals the unwillingness - at least of "mainstream" liberals? - to acknowledge the full scope of what would need to happen on a world heading toward 9 billion people seeking decent lives. Certainly others -- e.g., Growthbusters and the Post Carbon Institute -- have not.
But you also seem to presume that the only strategy that can work is "radical government intervention," when there are other approaches that have gained some traction -- including no-brainers like strengthening standards and incentives for energy efficiency and conservation (which surveys show have very wide support, including among Republicans outside the obstructionist fringe, see p.5 here) while reviving long-eroded basic research and development in basic energy-related sciences. (Even George Will has warned the new Republican power brokers against neglecting science.)
A.
I agree that some market incentives and R&D investments are part of the solution, and I say so in the piece. But do I think they can get us to 80 per cent emissions reduction by mid-century? No. Not everything is win-win, some very powerful players are going to have to lose if we ever decide to get serious about climate change, which is why the denial movement is so well funded. A recent example is the fight against the Keystone XL pipeline, which I have been a part of. We all know that real solutions lie in shifting to renewable energy. But in the meantime we also need to ask our governments to say 'no' to the dirtiest extraction projects on the planet - projects that, if fully realized, would make catastrophic climate change far more likely. And since the eighties, our governments have gotten really bad at saying no to corporations, in large part thanks to the triumph of the no-intervention (except when we need a bailout) "free-market" ideology represented by the Heartland Institute.
Investment in public infrastructure is another form of government intervention in the market - not just R&D but building public transit systems and smart grids, and shoring up levees and sea walls and the like. There is no question that robust public infrastructure is key to both reducing emissions and preparing for the heavy weather that we cannot avoid. Yet for the right-wing think tanks that sponsor the Heartland conferences (not to mention the modern-day Republican party), this is ideological heresy. Their whole reason for being is to shrink the public sphere in the name of low taxes and the benefits of privatization. What I'm arguing is that the idea that we can win the climate fight without engaging in ideological battle over these core questions about the role of government has always been a fantasy. Trying to dodge this fight is a big part of why we lose, and we need to get over it. It's no coincidence that the countries with the most enlightened climate policies are also, overwhelmingly, the most social democratic.
And by the way, it's not just that most of the big green groups avoid the growth question (with notable exceptions, as you point out). It's that the solutions that groups like EDF (Environmental Defense Fund) have pushed are very often consumption based: buy these light bulbs, drive a hybrid, etc... And often these changes make sense. But the not-so subtle impact of putting so much emphasis on individual shopping habits has been to reinforce both consumerism and individualism. Tom Crompton and Tim Kasser have written some wonderful stuff on this. In this report, for example, Crompton argues that environmentalists need to do more to challenge the individualistic worldview in their campaign work.
This is particularly salient in light of the social science I reference in my article, particularly the research coming out of Yale's Cultural Cognition Project, which has found that the major determinant of whether a person rejects the scientific consensus on climate change is whether they have a strongly "hierarchical" or "individualistic" worldview. One set of stats that didn't make it into my piece: 78 per cent of subjects who display an "egalitarian" and "communitarian" worldview believe that most scientists agree climate change is happening (which is true) - compared with only 19 per cent of those with a "hierarchical" and "individualist" worldview.
For me, it follows from this that part of being an effective environmentalist is trying to win more people over to a worldview in line with the laws of physics and chemistry, rather than offering shopping advice and touting "market-based solutions." Put another way: if we know that aggressive regulation and rebuilding the public sphere through collective action are integral to meeting this challenge, then we have a responsibility to say so, and to defend the worldview behind those policies.
Q.
You note that China, to which much of the world has ceded its manufacturing, is unabashed about its thirst for coal and other resources. But when that reality is combined with China's (and India's) prime imperative of sustaining growth, and with projections showing that nearly all of the growth in emissions of CO2 in the next couple of decades is coming in fast-emerging developing countries, it's hard to see your prescription having any impact where it matters -- in the atmosphere.
A.
I'm not sure why you think my prescriptions wouldn't have an impact. A big part of what I'm arguing for is a major rethink of so-called free trade. China and India's massive spike in emissions are intimately linked to their governments' frenetic embrace of this export model of development, which always sacrificed environmental and labor standards in the name of rapid economic growth. (Arundhati Roy's latest collection, "Broken Republic," is indispensible for understanding how much resistance there is to this model within India.) If we in the Global North slow down trade by re-localizing our economies in sensible ways, that kind of meteoric rise in emissions slows down too.
Of course the need for a higher standard of living is painfully real in China and India, which is why another piece of the puzzle that I touch on in the piece is "climate debt," something I've been writing about for several years now. Basically the argument is that we who live in the industrialized countries that emitted most of the carbon that created the climate crisis have to acknowledge our historical responsibility, first by leading the way on emission reductions, then by offering assistance to countries that did little or nothing to cause the crisis but are suffering the worst effects. That assistance can take many forms, from debt forgiveness to technology transfers, to direct economic support (perhaps through a tax on financial transactions). This assistance will provide opportunities for poor countries to meet their development goals in ways less ecologically costly than extraction-based exports.
Once again, the right understands this reality very well, which is why the Heartland crowd likes to claim that climate change is a socialist conspiracy to redistribute wealth. It's not a conspiracy, but it's absolutely the case that climate change raises very troubling questions about the true costs of the wealth that has accumulated in the Global North. It's also the case that climate talks will remain virtually deadlocked until our governments deal with this thorny issue of historical responsibility. Again and again, this is the issue over which the talks stall.
Q.
Back in 2007, I conceived and spearheaded our "climate divide" package documenting how rich emitters were already insulating themselves from climate risk through wealth and technology, so I'm very cognizant of that issue.
But in 2009, as I reported more and more on the inherent threat of climate extremes in some of the world's poorest places (sub-Saharan Africa, particularly) I became concerned that the uncertain impact of greenhouse-driven warming paled beside other drivers of risk (persistent poverty, doubling populations, and the existing pattern of super-drought). [These factors] would completely dominate, or at least obscure, a greenhouse contribution for decades to come.
As a result, Somalia is emblematic of what could be coming, but in no way is the human devastation there of greenhouse-driven disruption.
Even if real, new adaptation money ever shows up, this guarantees intense competition for it among nations with differing levels of confidence in the source of their climate-related injuries, as described here and here.
Thoughts?
A.
There is no doubt that climate assistance can be highly divisive, especially if countries are fighting over scraps. But in a way, I think you've just made the argument for why climate change forces us to have a deeper discussion about failed paradigms. The countries that are most vulnerable are those that have been laboratories for neo-liberal economics and Cold War (or "War on Terror") dirty wars, leaving behind non-existent public infrastructure and lots of angry guys with guns (as Christian Parenti shows so well in his new book, "Tropic of Chaos"). This is precisely why I argue that climate change isn't an issue, it's "a message," telling us that we need radically new ways of thinking about progress and power. Otherwise we are just dealing with the symptoms.
Q.
On us leading the way, it's fine to think this would result in others de-carbonizing, and I'm all for the moral imperative of the established emitters leading the way, but a lot of discussions with folks in (or deeply analyzing) developing countries over the years provide me with little confidence that the Alphonse-Gaston stasis would be broken by us stepping first.
A.
I'm slightly more optimistic. China and India have already invested heavily in emission reducing technologies, despite the fact that they are not required to do so under Kyoto. In fact China has been doing so much, the U.S. has challenged its renewable energy policies at the WTO (another argument for why "free trade" is a menace to climate action). I'm convinced that if the U.S. had come to Copenhagen with science-based emission targets, it would have been a game changer. Partly because when the U.S. refuses to accept its historical responsibility, it strengthens the hand of developing country politicians who want to cloak polluting, destructive and often corrupt development practices in anti-imperialist rhetoric.
But it's also the case that these governments are under intense popular pressure within their own countries to adopt less ecologically damaging policies. (This will be very clear during the upcoming summit in Durban, a city with a highly mobilized and militant movement against environmental racism. See: groundwork.org.za.) China's environmental movements are also formidable, as are India's, though they often express themselves as battles against mining or mega-dams. If developing country governments are no longer able to play the anti-imperialist card to defend dirty development, these movements will be much better positioned to win significant environmental victories.
A great recent example is Bolivia: Evo Morales's government has championed the idea of "climate debt" at the UN, but at home Morales has been pursuing development projects that don't match his rhetoric of environmental concern. Over the past few months, Morales has faced an internal uprising, led by indigenous groups, and was forced to make significant concessions. So part of what we need to be thinking about is: what policies are most likely to empower environmental defenders in the Global South? And one of them is for us to stop being such easy villains. When it comes to politics, I guess I don't believe in any kind of stasis, as this autumn's "Occupy Wall Street" explosion attests 
Q.
[This question was posed yesterday, considering Klein's argument along with similar prescriptions from David Roberts of Grist and Joe Romm at the Center for American Progress (read Romm's capping thought in the linked post).] One question that's bubbled up for me is whether your (and David Roberts' and Joe Romm's) push for a drastic approach could be seen as simply a looking-glass version of "shock doctrine"?
A.
I think we're all trying to avoid the really big shocks that would likely come with the temperature increases we are locking in, and that we aren't calling for targets that are more drastic than those many countries have already agreed to in principle, then betrayed with their actions (certainly that's the case with my own country's actions -- Canada).
Shock Doctrine, as I define it, is a purely opportunistic, anti-democratic tactic, designed not to solve problems but to exploit them. We are trying to solve the problems, at their root. Moreover, I would argue that Obama won an electoral mandate in 2008 for serious climate action, and simply lacked the courage and commitment to follow through with the leadership necessary to turn his promises into policy. He can blame Congress, but we know he has never led, so we don't know what real leadership would have produced.
Any notion that Roberts, Klein or Romm will come up with a communication approach or political innovation or "Occupy"-style campaign that could produce the pace of change they seek where it matters (think, again, of India, China and regions with energy choices outside of firewood, dung or kerosene) is as doubtful to me as my notions of fostering a culture of innovation, care and connectedness may be to them.
And we're all almost certainly wrong in one way or another in any case, given how both nature and technological leaps continue to surprise the best planners and analysts. I also don't share former Scientific American editor John Rennie's confidence that politicians, led by public conern, will someday set their agendas based on the "objective facts" on climate risk.
This is how Prime Minister Tony Blair of Britain described the climate policy challenge in 2005 and, if anything, his statement is more germane now given prospects for prolonged international financial ills: "The blunt truth about the politics of climate change is that no country will want to sacrifice its economy in order to meet this challenge."
In a situation like this, as I wrotein a reaction to Rennie, I see powerful logic in taking steps on energy and resource conservation that are no brainers, while building the capacity for people to be adaptive, alert, innovative, caring and connected and thus capable of sustaining the human adventure with a mix of resilience and inventiveness as signals shift.
Here's a closing thought.
In her piece, Klein, spends a lot of time focused on the valuable body of social science research I've also explored here showing the normal nature of the wide range in human perceptions of global warming (and other kinds of risks saddled with complexity and uncertainty).
Getting comfortable with that reality means getting comfortable with differingviews, and with a picture of the path forward that is utterly human -- meaning variegated, imperfect, the result of pushing, nudging and pulling, of activism and resistance, invention and inertia, argument and, hopefully occasionally, common purpose.

HEADLINE: Always a Bed-Wetter, Never a Bride

BYLINE: LAVANYA SUNKARA


HIGHLIGHT: How New York City, my family (and some sound medical advice) helped me stop wetting the bed. 

 BODY:
As a travel writer for a luxury magazine, I get to sleep in exotic locations on top of memory-foam mattresses with 800-thread-count sheets. It is a major indulgence, since for most of my childhood and my early teens, I slept on the floor on wet sheets and a rubber mat. 
I grew up in a town called Garividi, on the outskirts of Visakhapatnam, a steel port city on the eastern coast of India. Garividi was slightly more advanced than a village because it had an iron ore factory that brought businesses, schools and a hospital there when I was a kid in the 1980s. But it didn't have pharmacies selling Pull-Ups or doctors providing medication for chronic bed-wetters like me. And so, four to five nights a week, until high school, I woke up with a wet blanket under me and guilt over my head. 
We lived in a small one-bedroom apartment, next to a noisy movie theater and opposite a dairy farm. My father, a college professor and the head of the household, occupied the only bed we had while my mother slept next to my little brother and me on the floor. She wanted to make sure we didn't feel neglected. But before she put me to sleep, she gave me a nightly warning, "You better not be lazy and wet the bed again!"
Almost every morning she woke up cursing. After sending my dad off to work, she dragged the soaked linens out and washed them by hand while the neighbors watched. Everyone knew about my "condition." "Who would marry someone who wets the bed every night?" she'd ask me. As loving as she was, staying up late to help me with my homework and cooking my favorite meals, she was just as harsh about my humiliating nocturnal habit. Neither of my parents could understand that I had no control over it.
The older I got, the harder it became. My best friend, Niru, who was among the few who accepted me, had no clue why I could never sleep over. I rarely spoke up at school, never played sports, failed at singing and dancing, sat in the back of the class and hid my low grades from my parents. 
Then, when I was 15, my family moved to the United States. During the weeks we spent packing our things and the long hours on the plane, I convinced myself that my condition wouldn't be a problem in America. Somehow the change in time or climate would solve it. I was eager to leave my past behind. When we moved in with my mom's older sister - my pedamma - in Astoria, Queens, my mother warned me: "Don't shame our family here. They don't know about your problem. If they find out, they could kick us out sooner than we could afford to leave." 
For the first few weeks, things went smoothly - either because I was too scared of falling asleep or I was hardly drinking any water. Yet, one night, when I crashed on my aunt's lavish living room couch after a long day of exploring the Museum of Natural History, my bladder emptied itself. There was no rubber mat underneath to stop the urine from seeping through the fancy, cream-colored cushions. I woke up early and panicked, rubbed the soiled area with a wet cloth, sprayed air freshener and flipped the cushion upside down, praying no one would find out. 
But that afternoon, as I was reading the latest horror by R.L. Stine in the Queens library next to my dad, who was browsing the help wanted section of the newspaper, his cellphone rang. "They found what you did and we must go home immediately," he told me.
Blood rushed to my head and my cheeks burned. My secret was out. I sweated through my blouse during the 20 minute walk of shame back home. Both families sat down around the dining table to discuss my problem. My mother's gaze was hotter than the chai she poured into our cups. Then Uncle Murthy, a generous man and my only sympathizer, looked at my sorry face and broke the silence. "How come you never took her to a urologist?"
We had come from a place where it was hard enough to get a doctor to take care of the most serious health issues, let alone something as private (and embarrassing) as bed-wetting. The doctors in our extended family just told my parents to be patient until I grew up, when my bladder would be bigger. But my uncle's words gave me hope.
The next week, I took the 7 train to a clinic near Flushing to meet with a urologist my father had found. After running tests and taking my medical history, the doctor diagnosed primary nocturnal enuresis, involuntary nightly urination that continues past the age of 5. I was one of only a few adolescents to have this condition continue into the mid-teens. 
Since behavioral-based treatments like nightly wakeups failed and bedwetting alarms held little hope at this later stage, the doctor put me on a common drug used to curb bed-wetting. Within a few months, I started to wake up dry.
The relief that came with the end of my bed-wetting era afforded me a new life. I started feeling more confident; I made friends; I joined moot court. Teachers started to like me, and encouraged me to apply for college scholarships. When I got into Fordham University, my parents couldn't have been prouder. It seemed all my problems were behind me. 
Upon graduation, I moved to Berkeley, worked for the Sierra Club, and eventually went back to school with hopes of becoming an environmental lawyer. Through an Indian outdoor group, I met and fell in love with an aspiring software entrepreneur. Although he came from a completely different world, growing up upper middle class in Silicon Valley, with an Indian father and a white mother, we bonded over our progressive values and love of nature. 
But after we had dated for two years, he cheated on me, and then said he couldn't marry me - he had always imagined that his wife would be white as well. I was devastated. I felt like my mother's warnings had come back to haunt me. One morning, instead of waking up with a wet blanket underneath me, I woke up with a dark cloud above. The mild depression I had suffered for years turned clinical. I dropped out of law school when a mental breakdown landed me in the hospital. 
This time, my family came to my rescue. They didn't criticize me for my "condition." They didn't think it was my fault. They flew out to California and brought me back to New York, to their new home on Long Island. And this time they sought medical assistance. They took me to a psychiatrist and waited patiently for my recovery. They were everything they weren't when I was growing up. My father said he believed in me when I was struggling to find a job in the tough economy. My mother listened and offered to help when I worried about my law school debt. Some nights, when I couldn't bear to fall asleep, she would get in bed beside me and tell me Indian folk tales. My favorite one was about a father who teaches his sons that a single twig is far easier to break than a bunch of them together.
Five years later, I'm happy and healthy, and still in New York - the city that became my family's home; the city that saved me twice.

HEADLINE: 2 on Madison Avenue See Good Signs for 2012

BYLINE: STUART ELLIOTT


HIGHLIGHT: The leaders of two advertising agency holding companies are expressing relative optimism about the outlook for next year. 

 BODY:
The leaders of two advertising agency holding companies, WPP and MDC Partners, are expressing relative optimism about the outlook for next year.
The leaders are Martin Sorrell, chief executive at the WPP Group, the world's largest ad agency holding company based on revenue, and Miles S. Nadal, chairman and chief executive at MDC Partners, a smaller rival of WPP's with an entrepreneurial bent.
The chief executives spoke on Wednesday morning during separate presentations at the 39th annual UBS global media and communications conference in Midtown Manhattan.

"We feel a little bit more comfortable" about 2012 than was the case recently, Mr. Sorrell said, and, "We think we're very well placed."
"We've just seen our 'flash,' as we call it, for November," Mr. Sorrell said, referring to an early look at how WPP agencies fared last month, and, "The top line and bottom line were stronger than we anticipated."
"We continue to see good momentum," he added.
Mr. Nadal said, "I'm more bullish on '12 than I would have been a month ago or six weeks ago."
A reason, he added, is because he feels "more comfortable today in clients' confidence in 2012" than he did previously.
Mr. Nadal cited a conversation with a client who "said to us, 'Our business is doing well. It's just the television that tells us it's not.' "
In markets like the United States that have slower economic growth, Mr. Nadal said, companies are concluding they can achieve "a more superior rate of return" by increasing their marketing spending than by leaving that money in the bank to earn minuscule rates of interest.
Mr. Nadal said he expected the current economic conditions in the United States - "slow growth, high unemployment, low interest rates" - to continue "for the next five to 10 years."
"I see this as a normalized economic environment," he added.
Mr. Sorrell said that in mature markets like the United States and Western Europe, companies that are nervous about the economy have decided not to spend money on expanding manufacturing capacity.
Rather, Mr. Sorrell said, they are increasing budgets for brand advertising, buoying agencies like WPP's.
And in faster-growing markets like Brazil and China, there is "a positive double whammy," he added, in that companies are investing in both adding capacity and increasing ad spending.
Turning to the European debt crisis, Mr. Sorrell said, "I really hope the Germans will ride to the rescue before an accident happens."
He defined an "accident" as "a bank failure in Spain or Italy," where the governments would have a much harder time providing support, he said, than in, say, France or Germany.
WPP owns agencies like Grey, JWT, Mindshare, Ogilvy & Mather Worldwide and Y&R.
MDC owns all or part of agencies like Anomaly, Crispin Porter & Bogusky, Kirshenbaum Bond Senecal & Partners and 72 and Sunny.

HIGHLIGHT: The life reports are in. Meet Charles D. Snelling. 

 BODY:
A Love Story and Redemption
Sometimes, one has a story inside that just has to be put down on paper. In this case, a very personal story and a love story. One does not embark on such an exercise without considerable trepidations. Life stories and love stories are so personal. Still, I had a friend who always said, "What is most personal is most general," meaning that the things that each of us thinks is unique in ourselves may, more often than not, be part of the universal experience, or at least the universal awareness.
To get to my love story, I will have to drag my reader through a hundred years of family history and 80 years of my own. I'm sorry to burden the reader with slogging through all this, but I can't get to where I want to go unless I do.
I am my father's son; same genes and chromosomes. We have shared the same interests in knowledge, in science, in innovation, and in invention. We have shared the same desire to make the world a little better place because of our work. Oh yes, his career was much more significant and contributing than mine. He had more inventions, better inventions, and had a pivotal role in vital developments, some of which affect our lives very much after more than 100 years. This is a story, not about the similarities of my father's and my lives, but the differences. This is a story about how my wife Adrienne changed my life so that it would be so very different from my father's life. This is a story about how my life became, for me at least, much more human, much more satisfying, and much happier than it otherwise would have been. It is a love story.
Prologue:
My father, Dr. Walter O. Snelling, PhD, was born on December 13, 1880, the product of two very distinguished families: the Snelling's, New England Protestants who arrived in America in 1649 one step ahead of Cromwell, the bastard, because they were royalist and Cromwell had a price on their heads; and the Horner's, my grandmother's family, who were Philadelphia Quakers. Indeed, my grandmother, Alice West Horner Snelling Moque, was remarkable for her age. She was a college graduate in the 1870s, studied the law and medicine, and was a leading suffragette, editor of the leading suffragette magazine "La Pot Boullie" (the boiling pot), and an author. She was the first woman who was ever invited to address the American Medical Association, which she did, and her address is recorded in their proceedings, The Journal of the American Medical Association.
My father was a remarkable man. He was well educated. He was a graduate of Colombian University, Yale University and Harvard University, and received his PhD from George Washington University in 1904. Guess what, there were only 167 PhDs granted in the entire country in 1904! A truly educated man was a rarity.
My father went on to be a great scientist. He had 150 patents. A dozen of them were truly valuable. He invented high-pressure, high-temperature oil cracking, the patent of which he sold to John D. Rockefeller for $200,000 in 1910. Multiply that by 50 in today's dollars. Prior to my father's invention, the relatively new oil industry took whatever came out of the ground and distilled it. They really only wanted "coal oil" or kerosene in the beginning, and then later gasoline. They didn't get too much of either. When they finished distilling what they wanted from the crude oil, they dumped the heavy fractions on the ground or in rivers! And they burned off the light fractions as flares. My father discovered that if you took the leftover gunks from the first distillation and put them in a very strong retort and heated them at very high pressure and temperature, the gunks reformed themselves into pretty much what had come out of the ground in the first place, like new crude oil. His reformed material could be re-distilled to get another batch of kerosene and gasoline. This could be done a couple of times. Most of the gasoline in the world was made by my father's process for a few years. Then along came Houdry with catalytic reforming. He basically took my father's process and added a catalyst. Of course, that was a much better process than my father's. After Houdry, you could make almost as much of anything as you wanted, and his process replaced my father's almost immediately.
In 1912 my father identified propane in the waste gasses, which was burned off as waste in those days, and discovered that he could recover it and it could be put in a pressure bottle, as a liquid, with a regulator and piped into the house as a gas main. Now, in those days 90% of the lighting was gas light. So my father founded the propane industry, giving people beyond the gas mains good lighting for the first time. Of course, no one used propane in those days for gas stoves and furnaces, as they do now. Next year the propane industry will be celebrating, big time, my father's founding of the propane industry with his patents and the founding of the American Gasol Company, which he sold to Mr. Frank Phillips of Phillips Petroleum Company in 1914 for $50,000. You can also multiply that by 50 if you like. Unfortunately, my father did not believe in inheritance; he knew too many Harvard bums, as he used to say, so he gave all his money away, and I had to start over!
So I was born into a prosperous, educated, intellectual and comfortable family. My father married my mother, Marjorie, in 1918 when he was 38 and she was 18. I was raised in a beautiful mansion next to a park. From all outward appearances, you would think that I had a charmed life, but that was not the case. It looked that way from the outside, of course. We had Packard's and 16 cylinder-Chryslers. We traveled at least six weeks every year. But things were not what they seemed.
In the 1930s and 1940s a man of my father's stature could do no wrong. He was world-famous. He was in Who's Who in America when only five people in the entire Lehigh Valley were. He was Mein Herr Doctor. He was wealthy. But he was also a perfectionist beyond all imagination. He had nine children. Each of us was expected to be, not good, but perfect. I have previously written about our summer trips.
They consisted of a lecture in the morning from the good Doctor, for us to write an essay in the afternoon and, depending on my father's evaluation of the essay, dinner or no dinner.
Dinner conversations at home were formal. No talk about the weather, no talk about school, just talks about serious subjects. And each of us was expected to participate without question or exception. In stark truth, my dad was a martinet; abusive and a bully.
My father, I am sure, intended to be a loving and good father. The problem was he simply didn't have a clue about how to be a loving and good father. His perfectionist instincts overruled everything else. Love was measured, very measured. If you got an A+, I love you. If you got a B; maybe I love you; if you got a C; I certainly don't love you, nor should I. What should have been fun, work and achievement, were made onerous and hateful chores. No joy in Mudville.
My response to all this was to escape to prep school at Phillips Academy at Andover. Andover is an exceptional place and, besides all the wonderful things that other students also found there, I found a haven. Never did I return to the parental roof.
Now, the upbringing that I had did not make me into a comfortable or normal human being, sorry to say. First of all (and humility has no great place in this essay, as I am trying to be honest), I often knew more than other people did, and I am sure that I was overbearing about it. Secondly, I was a very eccentric student. Because I hated work and responsibility so much as I did, I never, never really studied in the normal sense. If I liked something, I devoured it, became an expert in it and got A's. If I didn't like something, I didn't pay any attention to it, regardless of the consequences.
Parenthetically, nothing drives schoolmasters crazier. If you're brilliant and always perform well, they love you and admire you. If you are dull and incompetent, they feel sorry for you. But if you are brilliant where you feel like being brilliant and disdainful where you feel like being disdainful, they hate you. You are giving them the finger, and they know it.
At University I was my old self. They wanted me to take prerequisites, which I didn't feel like taking. They wanted me to concentrate in one curriculum or another, which I didn't feel like doing. I solved this problem by saying that I would not be a candidate for a degree and that I would take what I wanted when I wanted. And that's what I did. It really annoys professors and departments when you take courses without the required prerequisites. It really annoys professors and departments when you study mechanics, but you don't want to bother to learn to build bridges. It really annoys professors and departments when you study physics, but you don't bother learning how to design chips. And it bothers everybody if you study whatever you damn well please, a lot of science, but also plenty of history, literature and economics.
I did end up getting a degree though because of a wonderful and sympathetic Dean. Actually, to the amusement of some, I have since picked up an honorary doctorate along the way, but, as we all know, they don't count.
The short synopsis of how I got a degree is that what I was actually doing was taking a survey course in science and the arts. There was no such program at the time at my university. But the Dean knew that in a few years the university was going to give not one but two degrees (a BS and an AB) for the work that I had done. He also knew that I had so annoyed the establishment at the university that they were never going to reward me by letting me get away with breaking the rules. Thanks to Dean Leith, he saw to it that I got a degree. Since I promptly started my own company, no one has ever seen my degree! Amid all questions of my checkered educational history, I have been a trustee of my wife Adrienne's alma mater, Cedar Crest College, these past 30 years.
Now to the good part, the love story:
When I was a sophomore I went on a double date, to a Cedar Crest College sophomore prom, with a girl whom I had never seen before, and who was, shall we say, not to my liking. At our table was a simply marvelous young lady: ravishingly beautiful, bright, well-groomed, well-spoken, mannerly, disciplined and circumspect. Her name was Adrienne Celeste Angeletti.
What a wonder. She was, unfortunately, on the arm of the Yalie who had come to Cedar Crest College for the dance as her date. That Adrienne was the girl that I wanted, the girl that I needed to bring into my life, and the girl that I had to marry became very clear to me quite soon. So I began an energetic pursuit of this sweet young lady. She was a psych major and she used to say that I was her case study! She was diligent and very suspicious of my undisciplined ways. I pursued her with all the vigor at my command. First I had to get rid of the Yalie, and I did. Adrienne was studious, so I had to pretend to study. She used to go with a blanket and her books into Trexler Park to study. I would bring my blanket, books and notebooks to pester her. -"You're not studying," she would say, to which I would retort: "I'm studying you." Not a good answer, according to her. Usually we would make a treaty. Adrienne would study that afternoon if I would go away and leave her alone and be profligate, and then we would meet for dinner. Perfect!
To cut a long story short, I wooed and won this wonderful lady. We were married on March 21, 1951, the first day of our spring break, and rushed off to Bermuda for a quick honeymoon. Of course, sophomores did not get married in those days. Cedar Crest College was a United Church of Christ College with a PhD minister as President. He wasn't amused, but it wasn't against the rules either. Ten months later (that's right, not seven months, not eight months, not nine months, but 10 months later) our first child was born, Adrienne C. Snelling II (Penny). We bought a little tract house in Alton Park, halfway between Cedar Crest College and Lehigh University. We arranged our classes so that one of us would always be there to take care of Penny. Adrienne took one year off to be a mother, and then finished her senior year and graduated from college, although she was by then well pregnant with our second child, Jonathan C. Snelling, when she marched in the academic procession to get her degree. The President was apoplectic that a pregnant lady would be marching, though there were no rules against it, fearing that some of the parents there might fear the worst for their little darlings.
Now seems the right time to tell you a little about Adrienne's family. Her family was quite different than mine, but no less remarkable. Her father, Adrian William Angeletti, always called "Will," was an Italian immigrant who arrived in the United States at Ellis Island when he was 12 years old in 1913. He spoke no English when he arrived. Here is how it came to pass that he came to America. Will's father, born in Rome, was a skilled marble craftsman. In the late 19th century he was employed by the famous German pencil family, Eberhard Faber, to help build a great castle outside Nuremburg Germany. Will's father spent a few years in Germany and decided that he wanted to go to America to make a new life for himself and his family So, he did go to America in 1909 and worked at his trade, without his family, until he had the money to bring his family over to America.
Will Angeletti practiced the marble trade, starting off in the Bronx, New York City, with his father and then went on his own, starting his own business, the Angeletti Marble Company. Such was Will's skill, industry and ability, that in no time, Depression and World War II notwithstanding, Will became one of the principal interior marble contractors in New York City. Will did the interior marble work at such exciting buildings as the UN building, CBS building, the World Trade Towers and many other great New York City projects. Indeed, every time you see a world statesman at the podium in the UN General Assembly great hall, you will notice the really beautiful green marble behind the podium. Will's work. Indeed, he did such a good job that he got to know Secretary General Trygve Lie. The Secretary General, himself, took a beautiful photo of Will at the podium as though Will were addressing the General assembly, and gave it to Will. It hangs, to this day, in the living room of our guest house.
During World War II, Will managed to keep his business healthy by building mausoleums for the Catholic Church in the New York area. Such were Will's skills that he prospered in his new country and through the most difficult of times. In 1940 Will moved his family to Westchester County New York in a lovely suburban setting near the Village of Hartsdale. Adrienne's mother was half-Irish and half-Scots and her family had arrived in this country in the last half of the 19th century. Her name was Marjorie Somerville. Adrienne's mother died of breast cancer when Adrienne was only 12 years old, so I never met her mother. Adrienne was promptly enrolled in Good Council Academy, in White Plains New York, a Catholic convent boarding school. Then, Adrienne went to Cedar Crest College, in Allentown Pennsylvania, where I was lucky enough to meet her. We were married in the Hitchcock Memorial Church in Scarsdale, New York.
Although I never knew Adrienne's mother, I did get to know an uncle and a few cousins. The uncle, Dr. John Somerville, was a professor of philosophy at Hunter College in New York City. He was famously left-wing! He was an avowed socialist and pacifist, to put it generously, who spent several years living in the Soviet Union under Stalin. He wrote several books, the most interesting of which was "The Philosophy of Peace". Dr. John Somerville essentially recommended that the appropriate solution to the Cold War was capitulation on our part! While we were civil to one another, his and my views on the world could not have been further apart. Most of our discussions and correspondence were political. Neither one of us was able to convince the other, no surprise.
When I met Adrienne she was as well spoken as anyone I ever met, with a wonderful vocabulary, beautiful unaccented diction and perfect grammar. When I found out that her father was a recent immigrant I could hardly believe the perfection of her assimilation.
I worried about how my family would react to my choice of a bride. No doubt about it, my family had a distinctly north Europe preference. In all the family's European travels they always involved only England, Scotland, Denmark, Holland Germany and Switzerland. Never did we set foot in a "Latin" country. I need not have worried. Everybody in the family took to Adrienne with warmth and enthusiasm. Indeed, just before were married, my mother told her "don't worry, Adrienne, if there's ever any trouble, we will take your side!" I believed it. But there never was any trouble.
Let me tell a quick funny story on Nordic versus Latin. I first took Adrienne to Europe in 1955. When I was planning that trip she asked me where we were going. I told her, of course, "well, North Europe." "Why not Italy," she asked? "Oh, I answered, we never go to Latin countries." "We are going to Italy," she responded! And so we did, along with the North. Thus began a lifelong love affair with Florence, Venice, Milan and Lake Como.
Adrienne was never rude or abrasive but often firm and determined. The first year we were married, as summer was approaching, I asked Adrienne "where shall we travel this summer?" "What on earth are you talking about," she answered. "Don't you travel in the summer," I asked. Her response: "you are a married man now; get a job you lazy bum." Which I wasn't, but still, I got a job.
The love affair was only beginning. Adrienne was teaching me something about which I never had even a clue. She was teaching me about unconditional love! I could hardly imagine such a thing. The lady loved me, good or bad. She did not measure her love for me by performance. She discouraged me from being bad, and encouraged me to be good, but she loved me just as much, good or bad. Who could imagine such a thing?
We had a child every two years with a total of 10 years and five children. Adrienne, when she wasn't taking care of me, was nobly taking care of our five children. And she was teaching me to be a parent. I was deeply inculcated in the Walter O. Snelling school of parenting. It's all I knew. But Adrienne would look at me in horror when I would think of being a Walter O. Snelling parent and say, "You are not going to do that to my children!!" It wasn't easy, but over the years she made some progress with me. And she was always an adoring, loving, generous and giving mother. Thank goodness. It should have been no surprise, because she was always an adoring, loving, generous and giving wife.
So we lived a charmed life together. Really charmed! Now, I do not wish for our accomplishments to be presented in a way that comes off boastful. Truly, that is not my intention. I just really want to present our charmed life together as it really seemed to me. I became an entrepreneur and a pretty successful one. Not perfect, mind you, but pretty good. Ups and downs, but more ups than downs.
My first venture was in the field of artificial insemination of dairy cattle, using semen carefully frozen to -320 degrees F by a process I developed and patented. We sold our products all over the world, and within 10 years the average dairy cow, bred to the best bulls, gave twice as much milk as before. This process was a great boon to the world. In due time I sold this company (Frozen Semen Products Company) to Union Carbide Corporation. Cryo-Therm, Inc. (in the applied thermodynamics business) was the next company. Innovations followed. Patented products developed at Cryo-Therm were sold to 3M (energy storage electric heat baseboard); to Armstrong Cork Co. (continuously molded urethane pipe insulation); to the Melpar Division of Westinghouse Airbrake (our military division, and several patents); and to New Brunswick Scientific (our Fermentation Design Corp.).
Busy, busy, but still we had time for a great life together. Indeed, we are right now nearing the end of our 61st year of marriage. Not bad. Adrienne was always modest and conservative. One day she told me, you can have any two houses you want, but not four. I'm a nomad, and I don't know which way to head for the bathroom at night half the time. So, gone were Aspen and St Croix.
I was collecting antique wooden boats when I got out one of the old Packard's that I had saved from my courting days and had stored in a barn. It was a 1937 12-cylinder Packard convertible coupe, spare wheels on the side, with a rumble seat and golf bag doors and a luggage rack on the back. What are you going to do with that Packard, my sweetie asked. "Why, I'm going to restore it," I answered. Well, said Adrienne, "you can have antique boats and a wife, or you can have antique cars and a wife, or you can have antique cars and antique boats, but what you can't have is antique cars and antique boats and a wife!" The Packard went away.
Still, we had a great life. Adrienne has traveled on every continent and we have enjoyed and treasured so many wonderful places in the world that we love. We had real freedom and mobility. We flew together, in our twin, more than a million miles without a Band-Aid or a scratch.
When woman's lib came along with a vengeance, Adrienne's friends began casting gentle aspersions at the fact that she was a stay-at-home housewife, and with help at home. Get out and do something, they urged. So Adrienne became a wonderful, prize-winning fine arts photographer. She took the pictures for and did the art editing for two books. In due time Governor Tom Ridge appointed her to membership on the Pennsylvania Council for the Arts. She served on many a board, as she was supposed to.
But most important to our charmed life was our five children. They are good and happy children. One lawyer, one businessman, one banker, one artist and one doctor, all good and happy people. We have 11 grandchildren. Such a joy! Watching them prosper, go to prep school, graduate from college and university, and take up their professions is all so glorious.
My career has been somewhat unusual because so much of it has been spent in public service. My father always said that you should spend the first 25 years of your life getting ready, the second 25 years of your life doing well for yourself, and the third 25 years of your life putting back into the pot. In my case, by the time I was 40 I had sold my businesses and was on to public service and entrepreneurship. A group of five of us started an enterprise venture capital fund. It was fabulously successful. Meanwhile I was doing other things which weren't so successful, like building a new town, a financial disaster; then, much better, running a great orchard as well as a series of stores and a chain of restaurants - lots of fun and interesting. Finally, back again to real estate development.
My public service career began when I was 21 and was elected a Republican ward committeeman. In 1969 I was elected to the Allentown City Council and elected by that Council four times as its president. In the mid-70s I became finance chairman of the Republican Party in Pennsylvania. I am proud to have helped to raise money to elect several great governors, senators, congressmen and presidents. Along the way I have received four presidential appointments, some of them significant. In my 70th year, I was appointed by the President to the Board of Directors of The Metropolitan Washington Airports Authority (which manages Reagan and Dulles Airports, plus the Dulles toll road). And in due time, I was elected by that board to be their chairman, a post I still hold. At 80 I was still working 24/7. A nice way, if I do say so myself, to bow out.
So, if this has been a charmed life, and I think it has, why is there need for redemption, an important part of my title? Now, it is not easy to sit in judgment of one's own life. Adrienne and I have made our marriage work, and work well. As she always says, good marriages are not made in heaven; they're made by hard work. And work hard at her marriage is something at which Adrienne has always excelled. She has, for these some 60 years, been steadfastly loving, sweet, kind, generous and forgiving.
There's no doubt in my mind that I was not an easy husband. I was impatient, demanding, headstrong, willful and cantankerous. Parenthetically, I have several books in my library given to me by smiling children, all of which have the description curmudgeon in their titles. My mantelpieces and library shelves have three or four lovely ceramic and plaster gargoyles. (You know, that mystical demon always portrayed munching on a human thighbone? Were my children telling me something?!)
Redemption:
Six years ago tragedy struck our household. My dear, sweet Adrienne was diagnosed with Alzheimer's disease. This relentless wasting disease destroys the mind. I have now seen many people with Alzheimer's, and it is a terrible disease. Many, besides losing their memories and their cognitive abilities, also get downright ugly and hostile. Not my sweetie. Although she is a very, very sick puppy, she remains to this day a sweet, happy, loving and generous person. How lucky for both of us. To have such an affliction in the household is a very learning experience. Some people quite promptly disappear from your life. But others, indeed most, rally around in caring and support. It's quite touching.
So, here comes the redemption. It never occurred to me for a moment that it would not be my duty and my pleasure to take care of my sweetie. After all, she took care of me in every possible way she could for 55 years. The last six years have been my turn, and certainly I have had the best of the bargain. So I have dug in with the will. Adrienne likes to be with me so, everywhere I go Adrienne goes as well. We have wonderful helpers here in Allentown, at Estrellita, and in Washington. Certainly they have helped me enormously, but real care for a loved one with Alzheimer's cannot be delegated. I did not need to be told that; I felt it in my bones.
Truly, I've been simply amazed at the support I have received, indeed, more than support, downright approval and approbation from onlookers. How often people have said to me, sweetly and lovingly, "ten years ago we never would have believed in our wildest imagination that you would care for Adrienne the way you do." That half makes me feel good, and it half makes me feel terrible. I'm glad that they think I'm doing the right thing, but I'm very sorry that they didn't think that I would.
It's not noble, it's not sacrificial, and it's not painful. It's just right in the scheme of things. After all, this lady rescued me from a fate worse than death, and for a long, long time. What I am doing for her pales beside all that she has done for me for more than half a century. We continue to make a life together, living together in the full sense of the word; going about our life, hand in hand, with everyone lending a hand, as though nothing was wrong at all.
Andover was not only a refuge and intellectual haven for me; it was a place where values, human and personal values, were first and foremost. My Andover experience came at just the right time in my life, and the values I was exposed to there have been with me all of my life.
Nearly 250 years ago, Paul Revere designed and engraved, at Phillips Academy, Andover's Great Seal. It shows a beehive with a swarm of busy bees. On the sun is written "Non Sibi," in Latin "Not for self alone." The motto, also in Latin, is "Finis Origine Pendet," "The Beginning Foretells the End."
So it is. Sixty-one years ago, a partner to our marriage who knew how to nurture, nurtured a partner who needed nurturing. Now, sixty-one years later, a partner who is learning how to nurture is nurturing a partner who needs nurturing.

HEADLINE: Iowa and New Hampshire Stand Apart

BYLINE: ALLISON KOPICKI


HIGHLIGHT: Economic and demographic information, as well as this week's polling data, can be a reminder to voters and candidates that these early nominating contests are quite different than the rest of the country. 

 BODY:
With much of the political field focused on the testing grounds of Iowa and New Hampshire, it's easy to forget that these two early states -- in economic and demographic makeup -- are markedly different from much of the rest of the country. 
Even as voters nationwide struggle to recover from the deep recession, Iowa's and New Hampshire's economies have remained somewhat steady, with lower unemployment, less housing foreclosures and fewer personal bankruptcies than the national average.
 In October, using the most recent data available, Iowa's unemployment rate was 6 percent and New Hampshire's was 5.3 percent, much healthier than the nation's 8.6 percent employment rate. 
Not surprisingly, this week's New York Times/CBS News Poll of likely Iowa caucusgoers found that only 19 percent were very concerned about job loss in their household, compared to 27 percent of likely Republican primary voters surveyed in a nationwide poll by The Times and CBS News. And 88 percent of likely Iowa caucusgoers said the financial situation for their individual households was fairly or very good, compared with 75 percent of national Republican primary voters.
Iowa and New Hampshire also had two of the lowest poverty rates in 2010, according to Census data, and New Hampshire currently has the highest median income, at $66,707 in 2010. 
In other states, Republican candidates (and President Obama) will have to curry favor with voters whose families and neighborhoods are confronting very different economic realities. South Carolina and Florida, where voters head to the polls on Jan. 21 and Jan. 31, respectively, have unemployment rates over 10 percent. Nevada, with the highest unemployment rate in the nation at 13.4 percent, holds its nominating contest on Feb. 4. 
Granted, Republicans and Democrats do not agree on whether taxes should be increased for the wealthy. The latest Times/CBS News Poll shows that 59 percent of Iowa's likely caucusgoers oppose a "millionaire tax;" reflecting the sentiments of Republican primary voters nationwide. 
Nevada also suffers from the highest foreclosure rate in the country, with one in every 180 housing units in foreclosure, according to RealtyTrac. And in 2010, Nevada had the highest number of personal bankruptcy filings per capita in the nation, up 38 percent from 2008.
 Florida is also hurting from the collapse of the housing market, with one in every 268 housing units in foreclosure. South Carolina, Florida and Nevada all had more individuals in 2010 falling below the poverty level than the national average of 15.1 percent. 
Voters in these states are likely to demand economic answers and ideas for generating new growth from visiting candidates. This week's Times/CBS News poll found that caucusgoers in Iowa trusted Mitt Romney and Newt Gingrich about evenly to deal with the economy. 
At this week showed Mr. Gingrich well ahead of Mr. Romney among likely Republican primary voters, and over six in 10 Republican respondents said the nation's economy was getting worse, not better. Mr. Romney is likely to increasingly remind these voters of his business experience and economic proposals.
New Hampshire and Iowa are also two of the least diverse states in the country. New Hampshire is 93 percent white, and Iowa is 88 percent white. Now with Herman Cain having suspending his race, the all-white group of Republican candidates will have to sell their messages to voters of varying racial and ethnic backgrounds in South Carolina, Florida and Nevada. In South Carolina, nearly three in 10 residents are black. Florida and Nevada have two of the largest Hispanic populations in the country. Hispanics make up 23 percent and 20 percent of Nevada's and Florida's populations, respectively, and blacks make up 15 percent of Florida's population. 
All these early voting states have very different needs for the candidates to address. Seventeen percent of Florida's population is over 65, whereas Nevada is a relatively young state, with only 11 percent of its population over 65, with 27 percent of its population under 18. Mr. Gingrich's suggestions for a child labor force may resonate quite differently in Nevada, as well as in Florida. 
The candidates' views on government services and layoffs of state employees may also ripple across these states in myriad ways. For fiscal year 2012, the governments of New Hampshire, South Carolina and Florida are facingrevenue shortfalls that are at least 10 percent of their general fund budget. 
Iowa, however, has a budget shortfall of just 2.4 percent for fiscal year 2012. But then again, Iowa is different.

HEADLINE: The Early Word: Populist

BYLINE: JADA F. SMITH


HIGHLIGHT: Political news from today's Times and around the Web, plus a look at what's happening in Washington. 

 BODY:
Today's Times

        
President Obama on Tuesday delivered his most pointed appeal yet for a strong governmental role to level the economic playing field, A.G. Sulzberger writes. The populist message reflected a White House decision that with the economic recovery still lagging and Republicans in Congress continuing to oppose the president's jobs proposals, the best course for Mr. Obama was to try to present himself as the defender of working-class Americans.

        
The Obama administration will begin using the tools of American diplomacy to promote gay rights around the world, Steven Lee Myers and Helene Cooper report. Raising the issue to such prominence on the president's foreign policy agenda is symbolically important in the international arena; at home, it could bolster support among gay voters.

        
Newt Gingrich is rated more favorably than any of the other six remaining candidates among voters who say they are likely to participate in the Republican caucuses in Iowa, Jeff Zeleny and Marjorie Connelly report. But two-thirds of likely voters remain open to changing their minds, the poll found.

        
Now that several months of campaigning are on the books, Richard A. Oppel Jr. writes, a major thrust of the Republican foreign policy argumenthas emerged: that President Obama has not strongly supported Israel and that he has been too soft on its adversaries -- the Palestians, Iran and the militant Shiite group Hezbollah.
Around the Web

        
Lobbyists with offices on K Street in Washington are preparing to go on lockdown on Wednesday, Politico reports, as protestors are expected to "track down those responsible for crashing the economy and causing millions of 99 percent-ers to lose their jobs and homes - while failing to pay their fair share of taxes," according to the Web site of one of the groups involved in the protests, the Service Employees International Union.
Happenings in Washington

        
President Obama will host Prime Minister Stephen Harper of Canada in the White House.

        
A variety of events will mark the 70th anniversary of the Japanese bombing of Pearl Harbor, including a public wreath-laying ceremony at the World War II Memorial.

HEADLINE: Opinion Report: European Austerity

BYLINE: ANDREW ROSENTHAL


HIGHLIGHT: A summary of what's on today's editorial page. 

 BODY:
At a speech in Osawatomie, Kan., President Obama provided a newly forceful explanation for why the rich should pay higher taxes and why the government should protect the vulnerable, noting that incomes in the top 1 percent have more than doubled in the last decade while the average income has fallen by 6 percent.
Gov. Andrew Cuomo and Republican legislators in Albany have agreed to a supposedly fairer tax structure, which will bring in about $2 billion in new revenue for New York. But the details are troubling, with the biggest tax cut going to those earning between $300,000 and $2 million a year.
The youngest Pearl Harbor survivors are in their late 80s now, but we continue to remember the price of peace.

The latest Franco-German proposal for the 17 nations using the euro, which insists on budget discipline, will exacerbate Europe's fundamental problem: Lack of growth.
The Guardian is also wary of the Franco-German proposal, and for much the same reason, noting that it "doesn't devote more than lip service to the need to spur growth in Europe, when this crisis was brought on by a slump."
"If France and others want to prop up their banks," the Guardian argues, "they should do so through recapitalisation, not by forcing ordinary Europeans to bear the brunt of austerity."

HEADLINE: On Climate Change, a Gloat and a Warning

BYLINE: JOHN M. BRODER


HIGHLIGHT: "I'm happy to bring you the good news about the complete collapse of the global warming movement and the failure of the Kyoto process, as world leaders meet for the United Nations global warming conference," Senator James Inhofe says in a video message. 

 BODY:
 DURBAN, South Africa -- If anyone at the United Nations climate change conference here wondered why the United States is unwilling or unable to take decisive action on the warming of the planet, they could tune in to the Web site of the Senate Environment and Public Works Committee on Wednesday morning.
 The committee's Democratic chairman, Senator Barbara Boxer of California, and its top Republican, Senator James Inhofe of Oklahoma, laid out in the starkest terms the gulf dividing the two parties on climate change.
 Neither lawmaker flew the 8,400 miles to South Africa to attend. In fact, no member of Congress is here, nor is any member of President Obama's cabinet. In fact, few heads of state are here, befitting the modest ambitions most hold for this 17th meeting of the signatories of the United Nations climate change treaty.
 Ms. Boxer urged the delegates to take strong action and said the United States was taking steps to reduce greenhouse gas emissions through regulation of factories and vehicles. She said that evidence of dangerous climate change was growing by the day and blasted those who denied it.

 "The message I have for climate deniers is this: you are endangering humankind. It is time for climate deniers to face reality, because the body of evidence is overwhelming and the world's leading scientists agree."
 She went on, "The U.S. National Academy of Sciences has recently confirmed once again: climate change is real, human activities are the primary cause, and the warming planet poses a significant risk to people and the environment. Wishing that climate change will go away by clinging to a tiny minority view is not a policy - it is a fantasy. 
"Problems do not go away by pretending they do not exist," she said. And the longer that vocal minority insists on keeping their heads in the sand, the more it endangers billions of people around the globe and threatens to dramatically and negatively reshape the world as we know it."
 Mr. Inhofe, the most outspoken climate change skeptic in Congress, gloated in a video message shown in a conference room here over the difficulties facing the international negotiations.
 "Today, I'm happy to bring you the good news about the complete collapse of the global warming movement and the failure of the Kyoto process, as world leaders meet for the United Nations global warming conference in Durban, South Africa," he said. 
"For the past decade, I have been the leader in the United States Senate standing up against global warming alarmism and cap and trade, which would have been the largest tax increase in American history. 
"This victory is especially important today, as families in America and around the world continue to face tough economic times. Tossing out any remote possibility of a U.N. global warming treaty is one of the most important things we can do for the economy."
 He said a new batch of hacked e-mails from climate scientists had undermined their work and bolstered his case that climate change is a hoax perpetrated by an insular group of experts. He called the e-mails "the final nail in the coffin" for those advocating urgent action on climate.
 "The message from Washington to the U.N. delegates in South Africa this week could not be any clearer: you are being ignored," Mr. Inhofe said. "And you are being ignored by your biggest allies in the United States: President Obama and the Democratic leadership in the Senate."
 And the delegates here thought their deliberations were tough.

HEADLINE: Gingrich Surge Brings Added Scrutiny

BYLINE: JEFF ZELENY


HIGHLIGHT: Newt Gingrich's newfound status as a leading Republican presidential contender has brought an added level of attention to all aspects of his personal and political life. 

 BODY:
 DES MOINES - A year ago, as Newt Gingrich was beginning to seriously explore whether to seek the Republican presidential nomination, he bristled a bit when asked how his three marriages would be viewed by conservative voters.
 "We'll find out," Mr. Gingrich said in an interview with The New York Times a week before Christmas. "What people want to know is, 'Are you who you seem to be?'"
 As he settles into his new role as a leading Republican presidential contender, that question is being posed anew as Mr. Gingrich's rivals study and scrutinize all aspects of his life. No candidate carries a more abundant Washington record, and even though Mr. Gingrich's triumphs and faults have been closely documented, the bull's-eye of a front-runner is inviting a closer examination.
 The latest New York Times/CBS News Pollof voters who say they are likely to attend the Republican caucuses in Iowa next month found that Mr. Gingrich had the highest ranking of any candidate when asked whether he was prepared to be president, ready to handle an international crisis and understood the problems facing ordinary people.
His ranking falls when asked whether he represents the values people try to live by, with 11 percent saying he does, compared with 16 percent for Mitt Romney and 19 percent for Representative Michele Bachmann.
A series of follow-up interviews with Republican and independent voters in Iowa who responded to the poll and said they plan to take part in the caucuses on Jan. 3 offers a window into how Mr. Gingrich is viewed and why he has ascended to the top of the field. 
 "I don't agree with his personal life, and it has had an effect on me, but I try to distinguish between the two," said Virginia Farus, 80, a retired teacher and librarian from DeWitt. "Romney, who was my second choice, has a much better personal life, but I think he hasn't had the foreign experience Gingrich has had."
In conversations with voters here, the subject of Mr. Gingrich's two divorces often comes up. Some people recall specific details of his extramarital affair, which took place while he was trying to impeach President Bill Clinton for lying about his own sexual transgressions. But in most cases, the discussions turn to what people know about Mr. Gingrich since he resigned from the House in 1998, particularly during his time as a frequent commentator on Fox News.
"The three marriages do cause me problems, but all of the candidates have something," said Loren Hass, 68, a semiretired farmer from Delmar. "I'm not happy with the Republican choices at this point, but I find him the lesser of the evils. I guess he's handled the situation better than any or all or most of the other candidates that have found themselves between a rock and a hard place as far as personal relations go."
This year, Mr. Gingrich has spent the majority of the time on the campaign trail with his wife, Callista, at his side. He frequently talks about how they have been married for more than a decade. He tells audiences how his grandchildren - the children of his daughters from his first marriage - are his best debate coaches.
The poll found that Mr. Gingrich fares better among voters who say candidates should be judged only on their political record - he's supported by 39 percent of those voters. But among people who say candidates should also judged on their personal life, he gets 27 percent support.
"First of all, everybody makes mistakes. It's important they own up to it, and from what I can tell Newt Gingrich has owned up to whatever mistakes or choices he's made in the past," said John Criss, 39, a mechanic from Council Bluffs. "The question is whether as president, those mistakes are going to prohibit or keep him from doing the job."
The other Republican candidates are increasingly stepping up their efforts to draw distinctions with Mr. Gingrich. The most aggressive, so far, is Representative Ron Paul of Texas, who has highlighted Mr. Gingrich's evolution on a variety of issues.
The Iowa caucuses are less than four weeks away and the time for making an argument is even shorter when factoring in the Christmas and New Year's holidays.
So far, there have only been quiet rumblings about Mr. Gingrich's past. But with two-thirds of Republican caucusgoers saying they could still change their minds, the 31 percent of support that Mr. Gingrich enjoys provides only a snapshot of the race. It is not a predictor of the outcome.
The telephone poll was conducted last Wednesday through Monday in Iowa among 642 registered voters who said they were likely to take part in the Republican caucuses on Jan. 3. The poll has a margin of sampling error of plus or minus four percentage points.
 "Going by what he says, Gingrich seems to have made a change," said Elizabeth Smith, 69, a part-time cashier from Truro. "He seems to have acknowledged that he did wrong and that he has changed his ways."
For now, at least, Mr. Gingrich is finding out the answer to the question he asked himself a year ago. Voters say they are most concerned about the economy and the direction of the country, including a majority of evangelical voters. 
 "I do think the candidates' personal life is their personal life," said Sheila O'Riley, 69, a retired secretary from Pleasant Hill. "I don't think he's done anything terribly wrong, like murder, or anything."
She added, "It might bother some people, but as far as I'm concerned, it shouldn't be taken into consideration."

HEADLINE: Gingrich's Unimpeachable Conservative Credential

BYLINE: NATE SILVER


HIGHLIGHT: Why Republicans have so far overlooked the former speaker's lapses from conservative orthodoxy. 

 BODY:
I have seen a lot of other commentators bring up versions of this point, but there is a reason why Republicans, especially conservative Republicans, see Newt Gingrich as by far their most qualified nominee and why they have been willing so far to excuse his periodic lapses from conservative orthodoxy.
The reason is simply that under Mr. Gingrich's Congressional leadership, the Republican Party finally broke the New Deal coalition that had dominated American politics for more than a half-century, moving policy substantially to the right. That is a pretty impressive credential.
The chart below shows the DW-Nominate score for the median member of the House of Representatives dating back to the 1930s. DW-Nominate is a statistical system that evaluates the liberalness or conservatism of a member of Congress on economic policy based on his voting record. Positive scores indicate a more conservative member and negative scores a more liberal one. I have portrayed these as moving in the intuitive direction from left (liberal) to right (conservative) in the chart.
The two large red circles in the chart represent the 104th and 105th Congresses, during which Mr. Gingrich was the Speaker of the House. As you can see, they were associated with an extremely large conservative shift. Part of this is because Republicans had gained 53 seats at the preceding midterm elections and so represented the swing votes in the chamber. But the newly elected Republicans also tended to be quite disciplined in their conservative voting even if they came from moderate districts. The typical Republican member of Congress was conservative in the 104th Congress than in the 103rd Congress, something that traditionally had not happened when a party does well at an election and expands its coalition. 
In other words, Republicans were having their cake and eating it too, winning more seats having to compromise their conservative principles. This is not to say that Mr. Gingrich's Republicans never compromised with Bill Clinton and the Democrats - but when they did, they usually won major policy concessions like welfare reform. (The tax increase that Mr. Clinton enacted came in 1993, when Democrats were still in control of Congress and before Mr. Gingrich took over).
What has happened since then? Mr. Gingrich resigned under the cloud of an ethics scandal in 1999. But there was no backlash to speak of; instead, the Republicans' score card since then has looked pretty good. They have won two of three presidential elections and retained control of the House of Representatives in three of the five elections. And they have continued to move toward the right on economic policy. The current 112th House is probably the most conservative since the New Deal on economic policy.
It is hard to say how much of this shift is because of Mr. Gingrich. Like the quarterback for a winning football team, he is probably given somewhat more responsibility for his party's wins and losses than he truly deserves. Nevertheless, no other Republican candidate can come close to matching his record. It is also one that older voters in particular - with whom Mr. Gingrich performs extremely well - may be inclined to appreciate. Those older voters may have a keener sense of history and would have remembered that the House of Representatives had been dominated by Democrats for their entire adult lifetimes until Mr. Gingrich came into power.

HEADLINE: Obama's Tribute to a Company That Preserved Jobs

BYLINE: ANDREW MARTIN


HIGHLIGHT: In his speech Tuesday offering his vision for defending the middle class, the president singled out a company in Minnesota that cut back hours, pay and perks -- rather than jobs and benefits. 

 BODY:
In President Obama's populist speech in Kansas on Tuesday on rebuilding the middle class, he urged business leaders to realize that their obligations extended beyond the desires of their shareholders.
In citing an example of the type of ethos he envisioned, Mr. Obama cited Marvin Windows and Doors, a midsize, privately held manufacturing company based in Warroad, Minn. Hard hit by the decline in the construction trade, Marvin executives vowed not to lay off any of their workers or cut their health insurance benefits, a credo detailed in a Sept. 25 article in The New York Times. Instead, they cut back hours and pay, including their own, and eliminated some perks.
Mr. Obama quoted Marvin's president, Susan Marvin, who told The Times, "You can't grow if you're cutting your lifeblood - and that's the skills and experience your work force delivers."
"That's how America was built," Mr. Obama said. "That's why we're the greatest nation on Earth. That's what our greatest companies understand. Our success has never been about survival of the fittest. It's been about building a nation where we're all better off."
In Warroad, Marvin executives were thrilled with the shout-out from the president, even if they are reliable contributors to Republican campaigns, including John McCain, Mr. Obama's Republican opponent in 2008.
"We're honored that the president took notice of our longstanding efforts to strengthen our communities as we keep our work force intact," said John Kirchner, a Marvin spokesman (and family member), in a prepared statement. "As a family-owned and operated company, our philosophy is simple: Do the right thing. If we stay focused on doing the right thing for our customers, our employees and our communities, then our business will be just fine. It's been a tough few years, but by pulling together, we've survived - and we believe we're poised to thrive."

HEADLINE: Romney Faults Obama's Focus on 'Entitlement'

BYLINE: ASHLEY PARKER


HIGHLIGHT: Mitt Romney takes a sharper tone against the president in a speech before Jewish Republicans. 

 BODY:
Mitt Romney used an address before the Republican Jewish Coalition on Wednesday to draw a contrast between himself and President Obama, accusing the president of seeking to transform the nation into both an "appeasement" and an "entitlement" society.
 "American prosperity is fully dependent upon having an opportunity society - I don't think President Obama understands that," Mr. Romney told the crowd. "I don't think he understands why our economy is the most successful in the world. I don't think he understands America."
 Mr. Romney's speech, which also focused on the importance of keeping Israel as a strong ally, served as something of a rebuttal to a speech Mr. Obama gave Tuesday in Kansas, in which the president warned that a trickle-down economic policy simply did not work.
 "A merit-based opportunity society is one that gathers and creates a citizenry of pioneers - a people who invent, who build, who create," Mr. Romney said. "And as these people exert the effort, and take the risks inherent in inventing and creating things, they employ and lift the rest of us, creating prosperity for all of us. The rewards they earn don't make the rest of us poorer - they make us all better off."
 His view ran counter to Mr. Obama's assertion a day earlier that while trickle-down economics appeals to the nation's "rugged individualism and our healthy skepticism of too much government," it is not an effective economy policy.
 "That theory fits well on a bumper sticker," Mr. Obama said, to laughter. "But here's the problem: It doesn't work. It has never worked. It didn't work when it was tried in the decade before the Great Depression. It's not what led to the incredible postwar booms of the '50s and '60s. And it didn't work when we tried it during the last decade."
 Mr. Romney's counter-argument - that the president "is seeking to replace our merit-based society with an entitlement society" - offers a glimpse of the dueling economic visions the two men would offer should Mr. Romney become the Republican nominee.
"And in an entitlement society, everyone receives about the same rewards, regardless of the education they pursue, regardless of their effort, regardless of the willingness they have to take risks," Mr. Romney said. "You see, they replace opportunity with certainty, certainty that everyone in the entitlement society will enjoy nearly the same rewards. Well, there's another certainty - we'll all be poor."
David Axelrod, a strategist for the president, told reporters in Manhattan that Mr. Romney's use of the term "entitlement nation" was deeply offensive.
In his address, Mr. Romney kept his focus largely on the president, though in recent days he has found himself fending off a challenge from Newt Gingrich, who, in the latest New York Times/CBS News Poll was rated more favorably than the other six Republican candidates by voters who say they are likely to attend the party's caucuses in Iowa.
But Mr. Romney did make a point of invoking his "42-year marriage" during the remarks, a line that seemed somewhat out of place in a foreign policy address and that appeared to be a subtle dig at Mr. Gingrich, who has been married three times.
Referring to his years as the governor of Massachusetts, as well as his time heading the 2002 Salt Lake City Olympics, Mr. Romney said: "My perspective is informed by those experiences, and of course by the defining constants in my life -my 42-year marriage to my wife, Ann, the life that we built with our five sons, five daughters-in-law and 16 grandkids, and of course the faith that sustains us."
In addition to economics, Mr. Romney drew another contrast with Mr. Obama on Israel, reiterating a promise he made at a foreign policy debate last month that his first foreign trip as president would be to Israel. 
"I will reaffirm as a vital national interest Israel's existence as a Jewish state, and I want the world to know that the bonds that exist between Israel and the United States are unshakeable," Mr. Romney said.
Mr. Romney also warned against what he called Mr. Obama's "appeasement strategy abroad."
"Appeasement betrays a lack of faith in America, in America's strength, and in America's future," he said. "Like others among the Washington elite, he believes America's role as the leader of the world is a thing of the past, that this is going to be a post-American century, perhaps an Asian century."
Mr. Romney added: "He seems to be more generous to our enemies than he is to our friends, and that is the natural tendency of someone who is unsure of their own strength, or of America's rightful place as a leader of the world. The course of appeasement has long been the path chosen by the weak and the timid, and history shows that it is a path that a nation chooses at its own peril."
Ben LaBolt, a spokesman for Mr. Obama's re-election campaign, accused Mr. Romney of changing his tactics to reflect the views of some of his fellow Republicans.
"In a transparent shift in strategy, Mitt Romney today echoed Newt Gingrich, Herman Cain and Sarah Palin in stating that middle-class Americans who are struggling - no matter if they work hard and play by the rules - are at fault for the challenges they face," Mr. LaBolt said in an e-mail. "Instead of believing that Americans are greater together, he believes the middle class and those fighting to enter it are on their own." I

HEADLINE: Flops Pile Up in the Tablet Market

BYLINE: BRIAN X. CHEN


HIGHLIGHT: It's been a gloomy holiday season for tablet makers, unless you're Apple, Amazon or Barnes &#038; Noble. Stories of tablet failures are piling up. Dell, for one, killed its Streak 7 tablet. 

 BODY:
 It's been a gloomy holiday season for tablet makers - unless, that is, you are Apple, Amazon or Barnes & Noble.
The stories of tablets hitting the market and failing to sell are piling up. This week, Dell discontinued its Streak 7 tablet, after the death of the Streak 5 in August due to poor sales. The move marks Dell's departure from the tablet market in the United States, at least for now. A Dell representative said the device will still be available in China and elsewhere overseas.
And last week, Research in Motion said it would take a $485 million write-down related to poor sales of its BlackBerry PlayBook tablet. A financial analyst estimated that RIM had 1.4 million unsold BlackBerry tablets left in its inventory.
Then of course there is Hewlett-Packard's TouchPad tablet, which was pulled off shelves after 48 days, followed by a fire sale of the device for just $100, down from $500. The fate of the TouchPad is uncertain, awaiting a decision from H.P. on what to do with the tablet's software, WebOS.
Why is it so hard to make a successful tablet? Companies are failing for the same reasons that a string of tablet devices flopped before the iPad came to market, says Sarah Rotman-Epps, an analyst with Forrester Research. Lack of content and capability are the key reasons.
"It's the same story as it has been from the beginning," Ms. Rotman-Epps said. "They're all trying to sell tablets as if they were PCs. Verizon marketed all these tablets with 4G and gigabytes of storage. What consumers care about is what they can do with the device."
Meanwhile, Apple made roughly 42 million of the 58 million tablets sold worldwide in 2011, according to estimates by Gartner, a market research firm.
And Amazon's new Kindle Fire, a seven-inch tablet priced at $200, is having a promising start as well. Based on shipments of the Fire from Taiwan, Forrester estimates the retailer will sell five million of them over the holiday season.
The Nook Tablet from Barnes & Noble, a $250 seven-inch tablet released two days after the Fire, has a chance to take off as well. Forrester projects that up to two million Nook Tablets will sell in the fourth quarter.
Propelling the success of the iPad is the iTunes store, which offers applications, books, games, music, movies and more. Fire customers, too, can download e-books, apps and movies from Amazon, and Nook Tablet customers can grab media from Barnes & Noble's digital store.
Amazon and Barnes & Noble's tablet numbers are not shaping up to be nearly as big as Apple's iPad sales, but all three devices can succeed on different scales, Ms. Rotman-Epps said.
She noted that the lower price tags on the Fire and Nook would appeal to customers wanting a pure media-consumption experience. Apple will continue to have the edge, especially in the world of business, as many companies are opting to purchase iPads for their ease of use and flexibility, Ms. Rotman-Epps added.
"Today iPad is still synonymous with tablets, but with the introduction of the Kindle Fire and the Nook Tablet, that's starting to change," she said.

HEADLINE: 10 Questions for Jon Corzine

BYLINE: STEVEN M. DAVIDOFF and PETER J. HENNING


HIGHLIGHT: If the former chief executive of MF Global does not invoke his Fifth Amendment right before the House Agriculture Committee, there will be many issues worth discussing. 

 BODY:
Jon S. Corzine, the former chief executive of MF Global Holdings and a former Democratic senator from New Jersey, is being forced to return to Capitol Hill on Thursday morning. 
The House Agricultural Committee subpoenaed Mr. Corzine after he resisted the committee's request that he voluntarily answer questions. 
It's a reversal of fortune for the man once mentioned as a potential Treasury secretary. Mr. Corzine's pain may be brief. Mr. Corzine is likely being advised by his lawyers to invoke his Fifth Amendment right against self-incrimination. We'll soon find out if he listens to his lawyers. 
 If Mr. Corzine turns out to be more voluble, here are some questions the committee may want to ask:
1. You were chief executive of MF Global with day-to day responsibility for the entire operation. Yet, it appears that you were personally responsible for structuring and monitoring the $6.35 billion trade in sovereign European debt of Italy, Spain, Portugal, Ireland and Belgium -- a bet that spooked investors and the ratings agencies, ultimately bringing down the firm.
You took on this responsibility despite the fact you had been a politician for more than a decade and were likely not as familiar with markets as you were when you were at Goldman Sachs. Why did you feel the need to personally trade for MF Global instead of having a trader or trading group do it? Who did you speak to structure and monitor this trade, particularly since you were preoccupied with running this entire business? 
2. Your chief risk officer, Michael Roseman, warned you against this bet on troubled sovereign European debt, according to The Wall Street Street Journal. Mr. Roseman reportedly thought that the trade was too risky because MF Global did not have sufficient liquidity to sustain its positions if the firm was downgraded by the ratings agencies. Can you tell us what Mr. Roseman told you, whether his concerns were relayed to the board of directors and why you ignored his warnings?
3. As a follow-up, MF Global was heavily leveraged. After the experience of the financial crisis, when firms with high leverage ratios failed, why did you undertake a trade that appeared to consume more than half of your remaining capital? 
4. MF Global was largely a brokerage firm when you took over. It did not regularly trade in sovereign debt for its own profit, at least not in the manner you did. Why did you feel the need to enter into large trading positions that the company had previously never taken, and do you think trading the firm's capital in this manner was appropriate and expected by shareholders? 
5. You apparently had significant contact with the Commodity Futures Trading Commission and its chairman, Gary Gensler, about whether the agency should adopt regulations restricting broker use of client money to trade. Helped in part by your opposition, these rules were not adopted until after the collapse of MF Global. 
Mr. Gensler worked for you at Goldman Sachs, and he has now recused himself from the investigation of MF Global. stating that he did not want to become a "distraction." Can you describe your earlier conversations with Mr. Gensler, and do you believe that you had special access to the agency because of your history with Mr. Gensler? 
6. There is still as much as $1.2 billion estimated to be missing in client money entrusted to MF Global. Were you aware that client money was being used to support MF Global's trades, and if so, why did you not stop it? Who do you think is responsible for this misuse of client money? 
7. Another follow-up. As MF Global's chief executive, you had to sign off on its quarterly financial statements and attest to the firm's internal controls. How could so much client money apparently be missing, and the records be described by a C.F.T.C. commission as a "disaster," when you said the internal controls met all legal requirements? 
8. Your board reportedly signed off on these trades. In fact, it appears that the board had sole oversight of these investments. What did you tell the board about this trade and do you think directors comprehended the risks? 
9. Some 3,000 people have lost their jobs at MF Global, and customers will likely lose significant money. You resigned from MF Global, passing up a pay package of $12.1 million, but if Interactive Brokers Group had acquired your firm, you would have automatically received this amount. Your pay package appears to be a case of heads I win, tails I break even. Do you think that your compensation was appropriate in terms of incentives? 
10. This trade was only a multiyear one but could have generated up to $750 million in profit. MF Global lost almost $79 million in 2010. Was it your intent to continue to engage in large trades like this one again to generate MF Global's profits and, if not, what was your business plan for MF Global?

HEADLINE: Intellectuals and Politics

BYLINE: GARY GUTTING


HIGHLIGHT: Good politicians don't need to be intellectuals, but they should at least have intellectual lives. 

 BODY:
The rise of Newt Gingrich, Ph.D.- along with the apparent anti-intellectualism of many of the other Republican candidates - has once again raised the question of the role of intellectuals in American politics.
In writing about intellectuals, my temptation is to begin by echoing Marianne Moore on poetry: I, too, dislike them. But that would be a lie: all else equal, I really like intellectuals. Besides, I'm an intellectual myself, and their self-deprecation is one thing I really do dislike about many intellectuals.
What is an intellectual? In general, someone seriously devoted to what used to be called the "life of the mind": thinking pursued not instrumentally, for the sake of practical goals, but simply for the sake of knowing and understanding. Nowadays, universities are the most congenial spots for intellectuals, although even there corporatism and careerism are increasing threats.

Intellectuals tell us things we need to know: how nature and society work, what happened in our past, how to analyze concepts, how to appreciate art and literature. They also keep us in conversation with the great minds of our past. This conversation may not, as some hope, tap into a source of enduring wisdom, but it at least provides a critical standpoint for assessing the limits of our current cultural assumptions.
In his "Republic," Plato put forward the ideal of a state ruled by intellectuals who combined comprehensive theoretical knowledge with the practical capacity for applying it to concrete problems. In reality, no one has theoretical expertise in more than a few specialized subjects, and there is no strong correlation between having such knowledge and being able to use it to resolve complex social and political problems. Even more important, our theoretical knowledge is often highly limited, so that even the best available expert advice may be of little practical value. An experienced and informed non-expert may well have a better sense of these limits than experts strongly invested in their disciplines. This analysis supports the traditional American distrust of intellectuals: they are not in general highly suited for political office.
But it does not support the anti-intellectualism that tolerates or even applauds candidates who disdain or are incapable of serious engagement with intellectuals. Good politicians need not be intellectuals, but they should have intellectual lives. Concretely, they should have an ability and interest in reading the sorts of articles that appear in, for example, Scientific American, The New York Review of Books, and the science, culture and op-ed sections of major national newspapers - as well as the books discussed in such articles.
It's often said that what our leaders need is common sense, not fancy theories. But common-sense ideas that work in individuals' everyday lives are often useless for dealing with complex problems of society as a whole. For example, it's common sense that government payments to the unemployed will lead to more jobs because those receiving the payments will spend the money, thereby increasing demand, which will lead businesses to hire more workers. But it's also common sense that if people are paid for not working, they will have less incentive to work, which will increase unemployment. The trick is to find the amount of unemployment benefits that will strike the most effective balance between stimulating demand and discouraging employment. This is where our leaders need to talk to economists.
Knowing how to talk to economists and other experts is an essential skill of good political leaders. This in turn requires a basic understanding of how experts in various fields think and what they might have to offer for resolving a given problem. Leaders need to be intelligent "consumers" of expert opinions.
Our current electoral campaigns are not very good at determining candidates' understanding of relevant intellectual issues. "Pop quizzes" from interviewers on historical or geographical facts don't tell us much: those who know the answers may still have little grasp of fundamental policy questions, whereas a good grasp can be consistent with a lack of quick factual recall. Nor does reading sophisticated policy speeches that others have written or reciting pre-programmed talking points in interviews or news conferences tell us much about a candidate's knowledge. Even quick-thinking responses in debates may indicate glibness rather than understanding.
The best evidence of how capable candidates are of fruitfully interacting with intellectuals would be to see them doing just this. Concretely, I make the follow suggestion for the coming presidential election: Gather small but diverse panels of eminent, politically uncommitted experts on, say, unemployment, the history of the Middle East, and climate science, and have each candidate lead an hour-long televised discussion with each panel. The candidates would not be mere moderators but would be expected to ask questions, probe disagreements, express their own ideas or concerns, and periodically summarize the state of discussion. Such engagements would provide some of the best information possible for judging candidates, while also enormously improving the quality of our political discourse.
A utopian fantasy? Very likely - but imagine a race between Barack Obama and Newt Gingrich, two former college professors, and who knows?

HEADLINE: The Breakfast Meeting, Dec. 7

BYLINE: NOAM COHEN


HIGHLIGHT: Advertisers are bullish on video, networks are anxious about the NFL and Mitt Romney changes his mind about Fox News. 

 BODY:
One of the takeaways from the annual UBS global media and communications conference in Midtown Manhattan, Stuart Elliott and Amy Chozick report, is the primacy of video content "regardless of the type of screen on which it is watched." Based on the talks there, "marketers remain keen on buying commercial time during video programming despite the uncertain outlook for the economy." Spending on TV ads around the world next year will increase 6.7 percent from 2011, said one forecaster, Vincent Letang, as compared with a predicted overall 5 percent increase in advertising. (Online ads will have the greatest growth, he predicted, 11.2 percent.)

        
TV rights to the National Football League will become significantly more expensive when three broadcast outlets extend their deals, The Wall Street Journal reported. The contracts with News Corp.'s Fox, Comcast's NBC and CBS end in 2013, and the extensions would run through 2021 and total $3.2 billion a year, a 60 percent increase. "The price of poker is going up," said CBS's chief executive, Leslie Moonves, at the UBS conference. Others at the conference complained that N.F.L. fees were making cable bills prohibitively expensive.
After being criticized for keeping reporters at bay and for his testiness during a recent Fox News interview, Mitt Romney has agreed to sit for a Dec. 18 interview on "Fox News Sunday With Chris Wallace," The Caucus blog reported. It will be Mr. Romney's first Sunday morning interview in roughly 20 months. Politico quoted Mr. Romney as saying his approach to the news media would change: "With regards to media, you're going to see me on a lot more shows than I've been on in the last several months."

        
However, Mr. Romney on Tuesday turned down an opportunity for TV exposure, becoming the third Republican presidential candidate to decide to skip the much-mocked debate being hosted by Donald Trump, Jeremy W. Peters and Jim Rutenberg reported. So far, only Newt Gingrich and Rick Santorum have said they will appear at the Dec. 27 debate. Jon M. Huntsman Jr. and Representative Ron Paul of Texas have said no; Gov. Rick Perry of Texas and Representative Michele Bachmann of Minnesota are undecided.
        
Perhaps in a sign of superior tech experience among supporters of the libertarian Ron Paul, when you type in the Web address www.rickperry.com, you are sent to Mr. Paul's campaign site, as was noted by The New Yorker's Ryan Lizza via Twitter. (However, www.rickperry.org gets you where you expected.)
On The New Yorker's News Desk blog, the veteran media reporter Ken Auletta looked back at 2011 and wrote that his thoughts turned to death: His top story, the phone-hacking scandal, which means "it's almost a certainty that Rupert Murdoch's dream of keeping News Corp. a family-run enterprise is dead." The other stories of note were literal deaths. Predictably, the death of Steve Jobs, and, much less obviously the death of Daniel Burke, who, "with Thomas Murphy, built Cap Cities from a small group of TV stations to become owner of ABC and ESPN."
A declaration of freedoms in cyberspace, proposed at a European security conference in Lithuania, has become a proxy "for a broader debate within the organization over basic freedoms," Steven Lee Myers reported from Vilnius. The proposal is expected to be vetoed by Russia, and came only two days after parliamentary elections in that country "that included a crackdown on dissent before and after the vote, with computer attacks reported on Web sites of election observers and the news media," he writes. Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton said in remarks to the other delegations: "Fundamental freedoms of expression, peaceful assembly, association and religion apply as much to a Twitter conversation and a gathering organized by N.G.O.'s on Facebook as they do to a demonstration in a public square."

        
Ed Wong reports on the growing public anger at the chronic pollution in Beijing as Chinese take to the Internet to complain that officials "are failing to level with them about air quality or make any improvements to the environment." A Twitter feed from the United States Embassy that gives hourly updates on air quality, which are reprinted on local microblogs, helps spread the word in the city, he writes. It was down on Tuesday, but back up this morning.

HEADLINE: Sharing Life, Love and a Hope for a Return to Work

BYLINE: By STEVE KENNY

 BODY:
Even in the days when the American economy was running smoothly, before Mindy Shapiro lost her dream career and then a backup job, her heart was never far from home.
In those days, Ms. Shapiro, 51, would spend her working hours supervising multimillion-dollar contracts and arranging advertising and catalog production in the fashion industry. Her everyday contacts included names familiar to Americans who wear anything from classic white briefs to little black cocktail dresses.
But the name most important to her was, and still is, Olivia March, her partner in life, love and laughter since 1982. While Ms. Shapiro toiled on Fashion Avenue in Manhattan, Ms. March, 55, was running a business of her own, selling electronics to the aviation industry.
Ms. March often had to work from a bed in the apartment she shared with Ms. Shapiro in Bay Ridge, Brooklyn, connected to her clients by telephone and fax machine while she battled illness after illness, including a progressive autoimmune disease known as relapsing polychondritis, kidney problems and, finally, esophageal cancer. 
For Ms. Shapiro, taking care of Ms. March was ''like a full-time job,'' she said. And since 2008, when Ms. Shapiro was laid off, it is the only job she has had.
''Olivia has been at the brink of death 10 times,'' Ms. Shapiro said. ''She's been on a ventilator, and she's here still smiling. She makes it easy. She always finds light from the deepest dark.''
The bond between the two women has been tested numerous times since they met at a cabaret in Greenwich Village. Ms. March was a 5-foot-8 aspiring nightclub singer. Now, after hundreds of days in the hospital, dozens of surgeries -- including one last month to remove an infected kidney stone -- and repeated steroid treatments, she is five inches shorter and has trouble getting out of bed even on her good days.
When she was 24, Ms. March received the diagnosis of relapsing polychondritis, and it has shadowed her life. The disease causes inflammation of the body's cartilage, including the trachea, and can be excruciating.
''The performing thing got put on hold,'' Ms. March said. But she had a backup plan. ''I'm a master salesperson,'' she said. ''I can sell anyone anything at any time.''
While Ms. March carved out a new business despite her health problems, working the phones from her hospital bed, Ms. Shapiro, who has a bachelor's degree in marketing, was making a name for herself. She eventually earned close to $100,000 a year to help bring fashion designers' ideas to the public's attention.
But in December 2006, a change in management led to the elimination of her job. She received unemployment benefits though July 2007, but the economy was already beginning to soften and she could not find a position to match her old one. In May 2008, she took a job for less money at a printing company, but that disappeared, too, when the economy collapsed at year's end.
By that time, Ms. March's health problems had forced her to stop working, too. With their bank balance approaching zero, Ms. Shapiro applied for public assistance. She receives $381 a month, and $200 in food stamps. Ms. March receives $932 a month in Social Security disability benefits and $200 a month in food stamps.
That was not enough for them to keep their Bay Ridge apartment, and they found a cozy one-bedroom place in the Port Richmond neighborhood on Staten Island. But this June, after doctors found five cancerous lesions in Ms. March's esophagus, the medical expenses grew -- the supplements she needs just to maintain her weight at 100 pounds can run more than $100 a month. They fell behind on rent.
A relative referred them to the Metropolitan Council on Jewish Poverty, a beneficiary of UJA-Federation of New York, one of the seven agencies supported by The New York Times Neediest Cases Fund. Met Council used Neediest Cases money to provide Ms. Shapiro and Ms. March with $1,220 to pay one month's rent and $80 for a powdered supplement that provides Ms. March with much-needed calories and protein.
An unexpected benefit was the friendship of their Met Council social worker, Devorah Weiss. ''They have such a sense of devotion,'' she said, ''and I don't think one would have survived without the other.''
Ms. March is recovering from her latest operation, and she and Ms. Shapiro are both looking for work. They have turned their breakfast nook into a home office, although the yellowed Dell personal computer and dot-matrix printer might not be up to current business standards.
''I would love to do something that would show I'm a smart, dedicated employee,'' Ms. Shapiro said. ''I would love to do something to make a difference.''
For her part, Ms. March wants to see if her sales pitch still packs punch.
''All I need,'' she said, ''is a phone and a computer and I'm fine.''

HEADLINE: The French Flock to a Feel-Good Movie

BYLINE: By MAIA DE LA BAUME

 BODY:
PARIS -- When it was released last month, ''Intouchables'' seemed an unremarkable, lowbrow French comedy, a small-budget film with actors little known outside France hamming it up in a story about a stodgy, disabled aristocrat and the good-humored ex-con whom he hires as his aide.
But only four weeks after its release the movie has attracted about 11 million viewers, almost 17 percent of the French population, and critics say it is on course to unseat ''Welcome to the Sticks'' as one of France's largest-ever box office success. Since its debut the sometimes slapstick, sometimes poignant, always audience-friendly comedy has led the box office in France, ahead of movies that are already hits, including Steven Spielberg's ''Tintin'' and ''The Twilight Saga: Breaking Dawn -- Part 1.'' 
''It was an enormous surprise,'' said Eric Toledano who directed ''Intouchables'' with Olivier Nakache. The movie was released without fanfare, and ''we didn't expect that it would create such buzz,'' Mr. Toledano added.
''Intouchables,'' or ''The Untouchables,'' is based on the true story of Philippe Pozzo di Borgo, a wealthy businessman who was left a quadriplegic after a paragliding accident, and his aide, Abdel Sellou, an unemployed, Algerian-born resident of a lower-class suburb, or banlieue, near Paris. (The film recreates Mr. Sellou as a young black man from the housing projects.)
The script is centered on the bond that grows between the two. Philippe, played by Francois Cluzet, is a cultured, well-mannered man who listens to classical music and writes love letters filled with poetry. His counterpoint, Driss, played by Omar Sy, is a hotheaded sort who smokes marijuana, likes Earth, Wind and Fire, and enjoys massages from Chinese prostitutes. For different reasons the characters are lost and lonely, and they end up helping to enrich each other's lives.
''This epic of the tall black and the little white guy is tenderly funny and a true achievement,'' said a recent editorial in Le Monde. Some commentators even compared the buoyant humor of ''Intouchables'' to Frank Capra's movies.
''It's well written and well told,'' Emmanuel Ethis, a sociologist who specializes in cinema and is the president of the University of Avignon, said in an interview. ''It tells a lot about the permanent value of living together in harmony.''
Distribution rights for the film have now been sold in 40 countries, including the United States, where the movie is to be released next summer. Harvey Weinstein, the producer who brought ''The Artist,'' another French film, to American screens last month, recently purchased remake rights.
''The movie galvanized people,'' Mr. Ethis said. ''People came out of the movie deeply moved, and with the impression that they had met wonderful human beings.''
Critics have praised the movie for its combination of broad humor and a humanist message, and its ability to poke mild fun at a physical disability. But the film also largely relies on the cheeky nature of Driss, who plays on the stereotyped image of the ignorant loser from the banlieue. In one scene Philippe asks Driss if he knows who Hector Berlioz is. Driss sarcastically answers that Berlioz is a neighborhood in his hometown, playing on the rich man's expectation that his friend would not have heard of the composer.
Critics here have praised ''Intouchables'' for its spirited punch lines and Mr. Sy's remarkable, energetic performance, calling the film an antidote to the doldrums of economic recession, a feel-good movie ''a la francaise'' in a country rarely viewed -- from the outside at least -- as having mastered the art of comedy.
Many acknowledged that the film's narratives and lively pace contrasted with the easy humor and often messy scripts of traditional French comedies.
''Neglected since the Nouvelle Vague, screenplays have become essential again,'' Le Figaro's reviewer wrote.
That was a reference to the traditional codes of the 1960s New Wave, in which filmmakers ''praised the absolute supremacy of the mise en scene and made no secrets that they despised screenplays,'' as Philippe Labro, a columnist at Le Figaro put it, noting that ''Intouchables'' is ''far from the lazy and vulgar comedies such as 'Camping,' '' a 2006 film about campers in southern France. For more ambitious critics ''Intouchables'' is an example of a new type of French comedy, with the rise of a generation of filmmakers and producers eager to tell a story in a realistic way and gently mock often dramatic themes.
In recent years several bittersweet comedies -- ''comedies dramatiques'' -- with strong narratives have met with considerable success, including ''Little White Lies,'' from last year, about friendship, set at a vacation home, and this year's ''Declaration of War,'' which features an atypical couple struggling with their child's cancer and is France's entry for best foreign-language Oscar.
For Mr. Toledano, the director, French audiences are being drawn to more audacious, even cheeky comedies. ''They are tired of American series that are more of an entertainment than a challenge.''
But ''Intouchables'' has also been criticized for its idealistic vision of a world without social gaps, where an aristocrat can befriend an ex-con. The newspaper Liberation denounced ''the dictatorship of emotion as a camouflage to the total absence of thought,'' while Variety pointed at what it called the film's primitive racism, describing Driss as ''a role barely removed from the jolly house slave of yore.''
The movie, Variety's writer added, ''flings about the kind of Uncle Tom racism one hopes has permanently exited American screens.''

To the Editor:
''Miami, City of Sun and Beaches, Is Now About Art'' (Arts pages, Nov. 30), about Miami's Art Basel, drove home the principle that the arts and the cultural tourists who flock to them are good for the economy. 
Cultural and heritage travel is consistently ranked as one of the top three travel activities in the United States, according to data tracked by the Department of Commerce/Office of Travel and Tourism Industries and the United States Travel Association. And Art Basel provides a great example of what the arts can do to benefit the community economically.
This year's event drew a record 50,000 visitors. These visitors significantly boost the city's economy, as they stay in Miami's hotels and buy goods and services in the community. And local businesses benefit.
For example, according to the Greater Miami Convention and Visitors Bureau, between 2001 and 2010, Miami-Dade hotel room rates increased by 81.5 percent for December, and Miami Beach rates grew by 141.8 percent during the first week of December.
Arts and culture are magnets for tourists, and tourism research repeatedly shows that cultural travelers stay longer and spend more, resulting in local businesses' reaping the financial rewards. Simply put, the arts and culture industry is the cornerstone of tourism and economic development.

HEADLINE: From Vacant to Vibrant

BYLINE: By NICK BUNKLEY

 BODY:
DETROIT -- Shuttered auto plants have been a surprising beneficiary of the gloomy economy, with developers buying as many closed plants over the last three years as during the previous 26, according to the first comprehensive study of plants closed by American automakers since 1979.
Helped by lower property values and a rash of closings that suddenly put many more sites on the market, developers have bought 32 properties since 2008. Many have welcomed smaller manufacturers as tenants, while some have been turned into housing developments, offices and research centers. Eight are now schools or colleges, the study found. 
Over all, nearly half of the 263 plants that automakers have closed in the United States have been revived in some form, according to the study, which was commissioned by the Labor Department's Office of Recovery for Auto Communities and Workers.
The new developments have helped communities regain considerable tax revenue lost when the plants closed, but only a fraction of the jobs that were lost. Almost three-quarters of the closed plants had been one of their county's top three employers, and nearly one-third had more than 2,000 workers. In contrast, 55 percent of the repurposed sites have or will have fewer than 100 employees, and only 17 percent have or will have more than 800 employees.
''These communities are often defined by these facilities in terms of employment and of their identity, and there's an emotional and psychological benefit'' to the new developments, said Jay Williams, executive director of the office.
Mr. Williams said the study could help communities with vacant plants understand which approaches had been successful as well as provide hope that more prosperous times might still be ahead. But he cautioned that with so many closures, bringing in new users was not always feasible and the best use for some sites might ultimately be green space. The study found that 135 former plants remain unused, including 24 that closed more than two decades ago.
''They're not all going to be repurposed,'' he said. ''Not every community is going to find a pot of gold at the end of this pathway.''
The study, conducted for the Labor Department by the Center for Automotive Research in Ann Arbor, Mich., found a plant's location and the local economy significantly influenced its fate after being closed. Sites near the coasts and in the South are cited as having been most successful. All 14 former plants in California and Texas have been repurposed, but in Michigan, the state most affected by closures, only 43 of 105 have been.
The study identified regional cooperation, government financing or incentives, and close proximity to mass transit and other transportation infrastructure as common factors in plants that were redeveloped.
Part of a transmission plant in Batavia, Ohio, that closed in 2008 as part of the Ford Motor Company's restructuring became a new satellite campus for the University of Cincinnati last year. The college and two manufacturing tenants employ nearly 150 people and occupy about one-quarter of the plant, which had 1,700 workers under Ford. But local officials are happy that the site is creating some jobs rather than staying empty, and they say having multiple, smaller tenants there helps diversify the economy.
''It's so far succeeded better than we could have hoped for,'' said Andy Kuchta, the economic development director for Clermont County, where the plant is located. ''It would have been a true blight on the community if it would have sat there abandoned.''
The Ohio plant's new owner, the Industrial Realty Group, is a firm based in California that specializes in redeveloping closed factories. It has purchased numerous former auto plants, as so many were cast aside in recent years, and found new, generally smaller tenants, including a beer distributor, a fireworks company and green manufacturers.
''These things are so big that finding a user for the entire building is like finding a needle in a haystack,'' said Stuart Lichter, the company's president.
In many cases, redevelopment has not occurred quickly or easily even with local efforts to move it along. Fifteen years after General Motors closed its minivan plant on the Hudson River in North Tarrytown, N.Y., the 99-acre site about 20 miles from Manhattan remains empty. The village, which even changed its name to Sleepy Hollow to help fill the void left by G.M. with tourists, is hopeful that work on a $1 billion housing and commercial development could begin next year, after previous plans fell through.
''We're starting to get back on our feet and not be dependent on General Motors anymore, but our downtown still has a lot of vacant properties,'' the village administrator, Anthony Giaccio, said. ''It's been many years that the village has suffered from that.''
The study recommends that the government focus its efforts on regions with numerous closed plants because those regions have more difficulty finding new users. Counties with only one or two closed plants were successful in reviving them nearly twice as often as counties with at least 10 such sites.
In Flint, Mich., the study lists only three of 24 sites abandoned by G.M. since 1979 as having a new use. A specialty pharmacy last year brought hundreds of jobs to the site of the former Fisher Body 1 plant, where workers staged a famous sit-down strike in the 1930s. But across town, the 452-acre former home of G.M.'s sprawling Buick City complex remains deserted.
The Buick City site is among more than 7,000 acres of property owned by the Revitalizing Auto Communities Environmental Response Trust, which a bankruptcy court judge created in March to sell off former G.M. assets. The trust owns 66 buildings totaling 44 million square feet of space in 14 states. Its Web site, racertrust.org, lists 14 properties as fully or partly sold and three others as under contract with a buyer, though none are in Flint.
''The need in Flint is to have new jobs and employment opportunities, so that industrial corridor is critical for our community's future,'' said the city's mayor, Dayne Walling, ''but we can only do so much to drive investment.''

HEADLINE: Old-Time New York Pleasure Faces Growing Storm of Opposition

BYLINE: By EMILY B. HAGER

 BODY:
A ride through Central Park in a horse-drawn carriage is one of New York City's most storied attractions, the rhythmic clip-clop offering a respite from the hustle of everyday life.
But now this old-fashioned industry is facing unprecedented turmoil.
After campaigning for decades, animal rights advocates are gaining support for legislation that would ban the hansom cabs, including endorsements from mayoral candidates and celebrities.
The carriage owners say they are being harassed, but they also acknowledge carrying out a campaign to infiltrate the activist groups and secretly record their strategy sessions.
Both the animal rights advocates and the carriage owners say they have been subjected to threats of violence by the other side. 
The struggle is so tense that when an accident last summer left a carriage driver in a coma, the hospital where he was recovering was not immediately disclosed, out of concern that activists would stage protests there.
The American Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals has become ensnared in the debate over the carriages. The group's chief equine veterinarian, Dr. Pamela Corey, said her supervisors pushed her to slant her conclusions about the death of a carriage horse, to generate sympathy for a ban.
Besides the animal rights campaigners, the industry is facing a classic New York peril: rising real estate values. Developers covet the stables on the Far West Side where the horses have long been kept.
New York City's carriage horses have long been a cause celebre for animal rights advocates. Now, though, even the trade's staunchest defenders say its survival is threatened as never before.
''People in our business probably think that we probably won't survive forever and are asking, 'How long will we last,' '' said Conor McHugh, a carriage driver and the manager of Clinton Park Stables, one of four stables in the city that house the horses.
''But we will keep fighting,'' Mr. McHugh added.
The city's licensed carriage horse industry -- 68 carriages, 216 horses and 282 drivers -- brings in roughly $15 million annually, officials estimate.
Drivers charge $50 for a 20-minute ride through Central Park, and $20 for each additional 10 minutes. On a good day, they can make 15 trips, grossing at least $750 plus tips.
Drivers' earnings are said to range from $40,000 to $100,000 annually, depending primarily on whether they own their horses, what shifts they work (day shifts are better) and how bad the weather and the economy are.
So far this year, seven incidents involving carriage horses have been reported, including a collision with a taxi. With each accident, animal rights campaigners raise alarms. They say carriage horses work under cruel conditions: nine-hour shifts, wading through Manhattan traffic, in almost any weather, with no space to frolic in a pasture.
The activists have rounded up endorsements from celebrities like the designer Calvin Klein and the actresses Pamela Anderson and Lea Michele, while lawmakers allied with them have introduced bills at the state and city levels to abolish the industry.
Last year, the City Council approved a measure to improve working and living conditions for the horses but would not pass a ban.
Many weekends, one group or another gathers across from the Plaza Hotel, where carriages congregate at an entrance to Central Park, to hold a protest.
''Horses frighten very easily,'' said Edita Birnkrant, the New York director of one of the advocacy groups, Friends of Animals. ''The noises of New York City, the chaos -- it is all just an inherently dangerous environment, and they don't belong here.''
Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg has been an ardent supporter of the carriages. After a horse fell Sunday in Midtown Manhattan, Mr. Bloomberg dismissed criticism of the industry.
''Carriage horses have traditionally been a part of New York City,'' he said. ''The tourists love them, and we've used from time immemorial animals to pull things. They are well treated, and we'll continue to make sure that they are well treated.''
The American Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals is one of the groups leading the effort to ban the carriages. It is also one of the three entities -- along with the city's health department and the Department of Consumer Affairs -- that regulate the industry.
''I don't see it as a conflict,'' the society's president, Ed Sayres, said last month on the steps of City Hall after a rally against the carriages. ''If we don't bring forward the risk factor that we are observing, then it would be negligent.''
In 2008, Mr. Sayres teamed up with Stephen Nislick, chief executive of the development company Edison Properties, which owns Manhattan Mini Storage, to develop a plan to replace the carriage horses with electric-powered replicas of antique cars.
''The cars provide an economic win for the drivers, owners and for the city,'' Mr. Nislick said.
With $400,000 from the A.S.P.C.A., and a contribution from Mr. Nislick, the two men started NY-Class, a nonprofit organization that has collected more than 55,000 signatures backing city legislation that would carry out their plan.
Their campaign has been roiled, however, by a dispute over the death of a carriage horse named Charlie in October. The A.S.P.C.A. at first quoted its chief equine veterinarian, Dr. Corey, as saying the horse ''was not a healthy horse and was likely suffering from pain.''
Soon after, Dr. Corey retracted her statement and said the society had pushed her to distort her findings to turn public opinion against the carriages. ''I was under a lot of pressure during the writing of that press release,'' she said.
She said there was no evidence that Charlie was experiencing pain or had been abused.
The society suspended Dr. Corey after she spoke out. She then filed a complaint with the state attorney general's office, contending that on several occasions she had been pressured to slant her professional opinion to help achieve a ban.
A spokeswoman for the A.S.P.C.A., Elizabeth Estroff, said it was baffled by Dr. Corey's claims, adding that Dr. Corey had ''ultimately reviewed, edited and approved the final statement'' about the horse.
The carriage industry has filed its own complaints with city and state agencies against the A.S.P.C.A. and NY-Class. Some carriage owners have gone to NY-Class meetings, without disclosing their identities. They have recorded discussions that they maintain show that the activists are bent on distorting the carriage industry's record.
On one recording, Mr. Nislick describes efforts to gain the support of city politicians by giving them campaign contributions.
The politicians ''want money from people and they want your vote,'' Mr. Nislick said, according to the recording.
Asked about the recordings, Mr. Nislick declined to comment.
The carriage owners also assert that Mr. Nislick wants to be able to gain control of the land under the carriage horse stables.
Two of the stables are on a prime block between West 37th and 38th Streets in the heart of Hudson Yards, a sprawling commercial and residential development.
Mr. Nislick denied being interested in the land, but other developers envision transforming the lots into hotels and office buildings.
If the stables were sold and then closed, the carriage horses could end up homeless, and their owners could go out of business. Relocating uptown, and closer to Central Park, may not be an option with real estate scarce.
The stables on 37th and 38th Streets are in the district of the City Council speaker, Christine C. Quinn, a Democrat who is expected to run for mayor. Like Mr. Bloomberg, Ms. Quinn has supported the carriage industry, though she has called recently for increased oversight of the horses.
Two other likely Democratic mayoral candidates -- Scott M. Stringer, the Manhattan borough president, and William C. Thompson Jr., the former city comptroller -- have supported the ban, as well as the electric car initiative.
NY-Class and other animal rights groups pledge that if the carriages are eliminated, they will find safe pastures for the 216 horses. But many veterinarians say horse sanctuaries around the country are full, and facing difficulties because of the economy.
''If we banned the carriage horse industry tomorrow, they would go straight to slaughter,'' said Dr. Nena Winand, an upstate New York veterinarian who is a member of the American Society of Equine Practitioners. ''There is no big field out there, there is no one to pay the bills.''

 CORRECTION:
This article has been revised to reflect the following correction: An article on Thursday about a push to ban horse-drawn carriage rides in Central Park misstated the year that two advocates teamed up to develop a plan to replace hansom cabs with electric-powered replicas of antique cars, in a group called NY-Class. It was 2008, not 2009.

HEADLINE: 94 Indicted In Scheme Exploiting A Bank

BYLINE: By NOAH ROSENBERG

 BODY:
It was the latest in a string of electronic crimes to be prosecuted in New York, and it was rather low-tech by comparison, absent of the credit-card-skimming devices and hidden cameras used in recent schemes.
Even the rewards to some of the participants, prosecutors said, were modest: after each successful crime, the officials said, low-level runners were given a few hundred dollars and a meal at McDonald's. 
But the operation, which resulted in the indictments of 94 people, was nonetheless a ''crossover between economic crime, identity theft and cybercrime,'' the Manhattan district attorney, Cyrus R. Vance Jr., said on Wednesday. Mr. Vance called the enterprise the ''modern version of a check-kiting scheme'' and said it took in at least $450,000 from TD Bank, and possibly as much as $1 million.
According to Mr. Vance, the operation relied on the deposit of fraudulent checks, from closed accounts or non-TD Bank accounts with insufficient funds, into TD Bank savings accounts created by dozens of people recruited to carry out the scheme. A loophole, he said, allowed new account holders, who used their real names, to transfer the fraudulent money immediately from their new savings accounts into their checking accounts -- bypassing the typical waiting period, even though no money had cleared.
Joel Luciano, 30, and Freddie Mercado, 25, of the Bronx, and Jose M. Cruz, 34, whose address was unknown, as well as six additional defendants working under them, are accused of recruiting 85 people between August 2009 and May 2011 to write the fraudulent checks and open the accounts that acted as clearinghouses for their scheme.
After the money transfers, Mr. Vance said, the defendants used their A.T.M. cards issued by TD Bank to withdraw cash -- as much as $5,000 in some cases -- from Western Union branches in Manhattan or casinos in Atlantic City and Connecticut, which offered either high- or no-limit withdrawals. Typical A.T.M.'s, Mr. Vance noted, have withdrawal limits that are substantially lower.
He said that the essence of the scheme was ''straightforward'' and that the ringleaders, some of whom had arrest records for more traditional street-level crimes, had exposed ''a peculiar weakness'' in TD Bank. A spokeswoman for the bank, Rebecca Acevedo, said that it had conducted an internal investigation, and that ''no customer data was ever compromised.''
Mr. Vance told reporters, ''It's a small group of actors who have an imaginative and profitable criminal idea.''
The indictments include charges of second-degree conspiracy to commit grand larceny; grand larceny in the second, third and fourth degrees; and criminal possession of a forged instrument in the second degree.
The charges are just the latest in a string of electronic crimes prosecuted by the district attorney's office in the past month.
In early November, two men were indicted in the theft of credit card information from 237 New York hotel guests, whose credit authorization forms were used to buy $840,000 in airline tickets and other goods and services.
Two weeks later, 28 people were accused of operating a fake-credit-card ring in which they stole and replicated restaurant patrons' credit card information using card-skimming devices and other equipment; the fake cards were used to buy and resell over $1 million in luxury goods, officials said. Also in mid-November, three men were accused of employing hidden cameras and card-reading devices to steal more than $285,000 from 15,000 accounts at Chase A.T.M.'s in Manhattan.
Mr. Vance noted that street-level criminals were gravitating to electronic crimes and financial crimes. ''Because the money is easier,'' he said, ''the risk is less.''

HEADLINE: A Little Confection Behind the Ear

BYLINE: By KAYLEEN SCHAEFER

 BODY:
TWENTY years ago, when a roomful of perfumers smelled the sweet scent Thierry Mugler Angel for the first time, most of them were crinkling their noses in disgust.
''They said: 'What is this thing? It's not a perfume. It's a flavor. It's awful,' '' said Pierre Aulas, now the olfactive artistic director of Thierry Mugler, who worked for another company at the time but was in the room. ''They were all saying, 'Oh, I'm sure it will be on the market six months.' ''
Today, Angel, a heavy dose of patchouli with a candy center that conjures an image of Janis Joplin holding a lollipop, is the fifth best-selling scent in the United States, according to the NPD Group, the market research company. Its sweet heart -- a vanilla, praline and caramel accord that made it stand out from the floral and powdery scents of the 1980s and early '90s, and arguably created the ''gourmand'' perfume category -- is copied by so many fragrance makers you could be forgiven for confusing a perfume counter with a confectionery, at least if your eyes are closed. 
Mr. Aulas estimates there are at least 50 fragrances similar to Angel now on the market, including Calvin Klein Euphoria (a woody Angel), Viktor & Rolf Flowerbomb (a flowery, powdery Angel) and Chanel Coco Mademoiselle (an Angel with a marine note on top).
The newest sugar-heavy creations include Diesel Loverdose (with notes of vanilla and licorice); a ''diet'' (eau de toilette) version of Angel, with less patchouli and more red berry juice, that took two years to develop; and Prada Candy, which smells like a vanilla-caramel sundae made with artisanal ice cream. The designer Miuccia Prada, whose previous forays into the field emphasized amber and iris, told the scent's creators that she was in the mood for something sweet. ''She gave very clear instructions,'' said one of them, the perfumer Daniella Andrier. ''A caramel, but not half of a caramel. Uncompromised and daring.''
Other designers have also been craving dessert of late. ''In general, I prefer sweet ingredients that are whimsical and modern like lady apple, dark chocolate and pink frosting,'' Vera Wang wrote in an e-mail. Her 2006 Princess is a gourmand fragrance with these notes.
Like York Peppermint Patties or Mast Brothers Chocolate bars, sweeter fragrances tend to be addictive (perhaps in part because they offer the experience of sweet without the calories). Lev Glazman, who founded the cosmetics line Fresh with his wife, Alina Roytberg, used the word ''addictive'' when talking about his Sugar line of perfumes. In addition to the original Sugar, which was inspired by his Russian mother's using sugar to keep his childhood scrapes from becoming infected, there's Sugar Lemon, Sugar Lychee and Brown Sugar. ''I wanted that addictive property to come through,'' Mr. Glazman said. ''When I'm surrounded by people who wear sugar, I understand why they like it and why those sitting around them like it. It's very warm. You want to smell a person's neck. How long can you sit in front of a gorgeous chocolate cake before you want to take a bite?''
The appeal of Angel, however, was not so obvious. When Bloomingdale's salesclerks first spritzed it on customers' wrists, many raced to the restroom to wash their hands, Mr. Aulas said.
''A lot of people hated it, but that's what we liked,'' he said. ''With fragrance we always want people to love it and hate it because those who love it adore it.''
Ann Gottlieb, the president of the fragrance consulting company Ann Gottlieb Associates, who helped develop scents like Calvin Klein Obsession and all of the Axe body sprays, said that the current trend toward sweet is not just because of Angel but also a result of inexpensive vanilla and coconut body lotions and bath gels that women scoop up at places like Bath and Body Works, for which she was once a consultant.
''I think Bath and Body Works created the category even more than fine fragrances,'' Ms. Gottlieb said. ''It gave women permission to love things that were tasty and sweet, rather than floral and fruity.''
Even men are saying they want candy, especially if that's what women want, too. Axe Dark Temptation, which has a chocolate scent, is one of the brand's most popular body sprays because of what Ms. Gottlieb calls a ''lickable quality.''
''It's just so damn sexy that people can't stay away,'' she said.
Kilian Hennessy, the founder of By Kilian fragrances, created a gourmand scent, called Love, Don't Be Shy, when he started the line in 2007. The perfume is based on a recipe for homemade marshmallows. But Mr. Hennessy said sweet fragrances have even more resonance today because of the bad economy.
''You always see an emergence of sweet scents during difficult times,'' he said. ''They feel protective, and that's what you need when everything else loses its balance.''
However, some perfumers are burned out on sugar, especially as scents have grown increasingly sweeter since Angel.
Jean-Claude Ellena, the exclusive perfumer for Hermes and author of ''Perfume: The Alchemy of Scent,'' admires Angel for its structure. ''It has a strong shape,'' he said. ''People can recognize you in the street as somebody who wears Angel.''
But he refuses to use sugary notes in his own perfumes. ''When you use the sugary gourmand product, I know by experience that you please easily,'' Mr. Ellena said. ''And when you please easily, people are pleased for the moment, but after they forget. I prefer a perfume that is more difficult to understand.''
Instead, his new Hermes Santal Massoia, introduced in November, is made of the ''milky'' woods sandalwood and massoia. It smells sort of like a tree that's been through a brutal storm. ''I've never smelled anything like this before,'' he said, ''But it's strange, and I like it.''
Gourmand fragrances, on the other hand, are ''like an ice cream,'' Mr. Ellena said.
''You eat your ice cream, and you forget it,'' he said. ''For me perfumery isn't an ice cream. I like ice cream, but it's only a moment of pleasure, nothing more.''

HEADLINE: A Wallflower No More

BYLINE: By FARHAD MANJOO

 BODY:
A COUPLE of months ago, a Silicon Valley start-up invited me to review its new home thermostat. I wasn't expecting much.
Can you blame me? Thermostats are annoying. Many models require that you study a cryptic manual to set your heating and cooling schedule; on some models, even replacing the batteries can test your patience.
If you do go through all the trouble of setting up an ideal schedule, then when the weather or something else in your life changes (say, your cold-fearing relatives from Florida move in for a few weeks), the thermostat won't adjust to your new circumstances. Then you have to program it all over again -- or, more likely, forget about programming it and manually change the temperature a few times a day.
Over the last few weeks, though, I've become unreasonably excited over these devices. That's because I've tested several new models that all offer much-needed improvements over the run-of-the-mill thermostats that most of us have on our walls. 
Depending on the model, these new devices can accomplish several amazing feats. They connect to the Internet, which means they can be adjusted from afar, using the Web or your phone. The Internet connection also allows them to get information about your local weather and tailor their work accordingly.
Lastly, these thermostats all have more advanced, sometimes easier-to-use interfaces, to make programming less of a chore. Indeed, the device made by that Silicon Valley start-up, called the Nest Learning Thermostat, even promises to automatically create a schedule suited to your tastes.
Let's start with the Filtrete 3M-50 Wi-Fi Remote Programmable Thermostat, made by 3M. The Filtrete sells for about $100. A basic thermostat is $20 to $60, but $100 is much lower than the price of the other high-end thermostats I tried -- although this low price comes with a few disadvantages.
The 3M-50 does have the Web capability of the new crop of thermostats, but to connect it to your Wi-Fi network requires a special power cable that runs between your heating or cooling equipment and your thermostat. Many older homes, including mine, don't have this wire; I had to repurpose another wire to get it working, but you may need a professional to install the device.
I also found the 3M-50 operating manual to be convoluted and the touch screen not very precise; sometimes when I was trying to press one button, I wound up engaging another.
The 3M-50 comes programmed with a schedule designed to save money on energy. I found this preset schedule fairly comfortable; I just needed a few tweaks to achieve an ideal temperature. The manufacturer promises that if I stick closely to the preset program, I could save up to one-third on my energy bills.
More costly than the 3M-50 is the Honeywell Prestige HD thermostat, which can be combined with several add-on components. The Prestige isn't sold to the public; you must buy it from and have it installed by a professional contractor. It will cost $200 to $300, not including labor. And the added components -- like sensors to read temperatures in different rooms or a module to control the device over the Internet -- sell for more. Over all, the entire system can cost upward of $500.
My system was set up by Innovative Mechanical, a heating and air-conditioning company in the San Francisco area. Its technicians also installed an outdoor temperature sensor and an Internet module, and a Honeywell representative helped me program the temperature setting and showed me how to change it.
I liked the Prestige quite a bit. The touch screen gives you a general's view of your home's climate. The bright blue display and the readings of the temperature and humidity (inside and outside your house) make it look like a screen from the Weather Channel.
But my favorite feature was a small hand-held unit called the Portable Comfort Control.
When you set a standard thermostat to, say, 70 degrees, it will adjust the temperature until its own sensor reads 70 degrees. But in many homes, there's a vast difference between the temperature at the thermostat and the temperature in far-flung bedrooms. The portable control solves this problem by having its own temperature sensor; by tapping its screen, you can set the thermostat to use the controller's sensor as its main reading. If you set the thermostat to 70 and you bring the controller to your bedroom, the Prestige will see to it that your bedroom is heated to exactly 70.
This was a blessing for me. My home office, where I spend eight hours a day, usually gets much warmer than the rest of my house. Locating the portable control there during the day kept the heat off longer, saving energy.
My favorite of the new thermostats is the Nest. When I saw it, I swooned. A brushed-steel orb that resembles HAL from the film ''2001,'' the Nest looks like no other thermostat. Also unlike most of them, it promises to learn your temperature preferences, set itself up automatically, and, as your tastes change, strive to keep up.
The Nest costs $249 from the company's Web site or from Best Buy, though you have to wait: When the Nest went on sale a few weeks ago, it sold out immediately. The firm has declined to say when the Nest will become available again, but you can fill out contact information on the site to get an alert when it does.
You can install it yourself, or pay $120 to a Best Buy installer.
I popped it in myself, and found it easy. The instructions were clear and the device ships with all necessary parts, including a built-in level to help you install it straight. The firm says that the Nest is compatible with most heating and cooling systems; to see if it works with yours, there is a handy guide on the Web site.
I installed the Nest in 30 minutes, with another 5 to set it up and learn how to use it.
This is the Nest's best feature. Because it was designed by Tony Fadell, who headed the team that created the iPod, the Nest has a wonderfully intuitive user interface that even technophobes will quickly grasp.
You control the device by turning a wheel on its circumference, and you engage its main button by pushing on the face. Don't worry if this sounds complicated; once you touch it, it will be obvious how to use it.
The Nest requires no programming. It has a host of sensors and sophisticated algorithms for learning your temperature preferences. For the first few days, you set the temperature yourself; as with the other new thermostats, you can control it from afar through the Web or an iPhone or iPad app (an Android app is coming soon).
A few days after my installation, the Nest reported that, from my initial manual settings and other sensors, it had learned the family's habits and preferences. It would warm up early in the morning, cool down when my wife and son left for the day, heat up again in the evening, and cool down once more, at bedtime. This analysis was right on the money.
The Nest further encouraged efficiency through subtle persuasion: if you set your temperature to a slightly more environmental (and economical) setting, the Nest displays a leaf icon on its front panel.
The Nest also knows when you are traveling; if its motion sensor detects no movement, it enters ''away'' mode. Indeed, when we left for a week's vacation, the Nest noticed our absence and lowered the heat appropriately. (What if your thermostat is in an out-of-the-way place that you don't pass by often? It will figure that out, too -- if it finds that you're overriding its away mode, it begins to discount its own motion sensor.)
But when we had houseguests and I raised the temperature to make the guest room more comfortable, the device did not adjust to those changes. This forced me to manually tweak its schedule.
Because the Nest is connected to the Internet, though, the company says that it can periodically issue software updates to improve the thermostat's ability to learn your preferences. This is an amazing possibility. Not only did the Nest start out working pretty well, it promises to keep improving.

HEADLINE: Joining a Dinner in a Muslim Brotherhood Home

BYLINE: By NICHOLAS D. KRISTOF

 BODY:
CAIRO
If you want to understand the Islamic forces that are gaining strength in Egypt and scaring people here and abroad, let me tell you about my dinner in the home of Muslim Brotherhood activists.
First, meet my hostess: Sondos Asem, a 24-year-old woman who is pretty much the opposite of the stereotypical bearded Brotherhood activist. Sondos is a middle-class graduate of the American University in Cairo, where I studied in the early 1980s (''that's before I was born,'' she said wonderingly, making me feel particularly decrepit).
She speaks perfect English, is writing a master's thesis on social media, and helps run the Brotherhood's English-language Twitter feed, @Ikhwanweb. 
The Muslim Brotherhood has emerged as the dominant political party in parliamentary voting because of people like Sondos and her family. My interviews with supporters suggest that the Brotherhood is far more complex than the caricature that scares many Americans.
Sondos rails at the Western presumption that the Muslim Brotherhood would oppress women. She notes that her own mother, Manal Abul Hassan, is one of many female Muslim Brotherhood-affiliated candidates running for Parliament.
''It's a big misconception that the Muslim Brotherhood marginalizes women,'' Sondos said. ''Fifty percent of the Brotherhood are women.''
I told Sondos that Westerners are fearful partly because they have watched the authorities oppress women in the name of Islam in countries such as Saudi Arabia, Iran and Afghanistan.
''I don't think Egypt can ever be compared to Saudi Arabia or Iran or Afghanistan,'' she replied. ''We, as Egyptians, are religiously very moderate.'' A much better model for Egypt, she said, is Turkey, where an Islamic party is presiding over an economic boom.
I asked about female circumcision, also called female genital mutilation, which is inflicted on the overwhelming majority of girls in Egypt. It is particularly common in conservative religious households and, to its credit, the Mubarak government made some effort to stop the practice. Many worry that a more democratic government won't challenge a practice that has broad support.
''The Muslim Brotherhood is against the brutal practice of female circumcision,'' Sondos said bluntly. She insisted that women over all would benefit from Brotherhood policies that focus on the poor: ''We believe that a solution of women's problems in Egyptian society is to solve the real causes, which are illiteracy, poverty and lack of education.''
I asked skeptically about alcohol, peace with Israel, and the veil. Sondos, who wears a hijab, insisted that the Brotherhood wasn't considering any changes in these areas and that its priority is simply jobs.
''Egyptians are now concerned about economic conditions,'' she said. ''They want to reform their economic system and to have jobs. They want to eliminate corruption.'' Noting that alcohol supports the tourism industry, she added: ''I don't think any upcoming government will focus on banning anything.''
I told her that I would feel more reassured if some of my liberal Egyptian friends were not so wary of the Brotherhood. Some warn that the Brotherhood may be soothing today but that it has a violent and intolerant streak -- and is utterly inexperienced in managing a modern economy.
Sondos looked exasperated. ''We embrace moderate Islam,'' she said. ''We are not the ultra-conservatives that people in the West envision.''
I heard similar reassurances from other Brotherhood figures I interviewed, and I'm not sure what to think. But opinions vary, and I'm struck by the optimism I heard in some secular quarters: from Dr. Nawal El Saadawi, an 80-year-old leftist who is a hero of Egyptian feminism, and from Ahmed Zewail, the Egyptian-American scientist who won a Nobel Prize and is passionate about education.
Amr Moussa, a former foreign minister and Arab League secretary general who is a front-runner in the race for president, was similarly optimistic. He told me that whatever unfolds, Egypt will continue to seek good relations with the United States and will unquestionably stand by its peace treaty with Israel.
''You cannot conduct an adventurous foreign policy when you rebuild a country,'' he said. ''We must have the best of relations with the United States.''
When I raised American concerns that Egypt under the Muslim Brotherhood and the more extremist Salafis might replicate Iran, he was dismissive: ''The experience of Iran will not be repeated in Egypt.''
I think he's right. Revolutions are often messy, and it took Americans seven years from their victory in the American Revolution at Yorktown to get a ratified Constitution. Indonesia, after its 1998 revolution, felt very much like Egypt does today. It endured upheavals from a fundamentalist Islamic current, yet it pulled through.
So a bit of nervousness is fine, but let's not overdo the hand-wringing -- or lose perspective. What's historic in Egypt today is not so much the rise of any one party as the apparent slow emergence of democracy in the heart of the Arab world.

HEADLINE: Bringing High-Speed Internet to All

 BODY:
To the Editor:
Susan P. Crawford's Dec. 4 Sunday Review essay, ''The New Digital Divide,'' contributes to the perception that America's broadband marketplace is second tier. That is simply not so. 
About 95 percent of the United States population has access to broadband, with the vast majority having multiple competitors to choose from. The 2011 World Economic Forum global survey ranks the United States first in Internet competition. Through 2010 the number of American subscribers to fiber-based services was more than double that of Europe.
Broadband prices per megabyte have decreased 89 percent -- to about 5 cents per megabyte -- in the past three years, while at the same time broadband speeds have increased more than 20-fold.
The United States also leads the world in wireless broadband, with Americans accounting for 21 percent of all 3G subscribers. In this highly competitive, innovative market, prices for such services are declining.
America has a very good broadband story; someone just has to be willing to tell it.
IVAN G. SEIDENBERG Chairman, Verizon New York, Dec. 6, 2011
To the Editor:
The main problem with Susan P. Crawford's analysis is that her vision is almost entirely grounded in a rapidly disappearing reality: Internet access via wireline technologies. The International Data Corporation projects that the number of wireless-only small and medium-sized businesses in the United States will grow by about 13 percent annually over the next five years.
Wireless technologies, including smartphones and tablets, continue to replace landlines for millions of Americans, with this trend especially strong among the young.
This points up two problems with Ms. Crawford's call for a large federal program to spur wireline deployment. First, her solution is a technology that Americans are increasingly abandoning as unsuited to their (mobile) needs. It's yesterday's solution to today's problem.
More important, a wireline ''Marshall Plan'' would do absolutely nothing to address our most pressing broadband need -- freeing more spectrum to handle wireless data growth.
HAL SINGER Washington, Dec. 5, 2011
The writer is a managing director of Navigant Economics, a consulting firm.
To the Editor:
Kudos to Susan P. Crawford for recognizing the significance of regulatory policy in closing the digital divide. Ms. Crawford points out that all Americans need the advantages brought about through high-speed wired networks that are often expensive to deploy.
Local, community-based rural telecommunications companies are part of the solution. These companies are committed to serving the underserved and the unserved, but can do so only with regulatory certainty and sufficient support.
It is essential for the Obama administration to show a greater commitment to true universal service. That will encourage small, rural providers to invest in high-speed broadband networks and help ensure a brighter future for those most in need of affordable, high-quality broadband service.
SHIRLEY BLOOMFIELD Chief Executive Officer National Telecommunications Cooperative Association Arlington, Va., Dec. 5, 2011

HEADLINE: Reliance On Credit In Spending Rises in U.S.

BYLINE: By BLOOMBERG NEWS

 BODY:
Consumer borrowing in the United States rose in October to the highest level in two years, propelled by gains in nonrevolving debt like auto and student loans.
Credit increased by $7.65 billion, to $2.46 trillion, the most since October 2009, Federal Reserve figures released on Wednesday showed. The advance was in line with the median forecast of economists surveyed by Bloomberg News that projected a $7 billion gain. 
The data indicates consumers are relying more on credit to sustain spending as income gains fail to keep up with inflation and as home prices drop. At the same time, increasing employment may be making Americans more willing to take on more debt heading into the holiday shopping season.
''It's hard to determine whether spending on credit is a sign of optimism or a sign of distress, but just anecdotally we feel there is the beginning of tentative feelings of comfort in taking on slightly more debt,'' said Dana Saporta, a United States economist at Credit Suisse in New York.
Estimates in the Bloomberg survey of 34 economists ranged from gains of $1 billion to $16 billion.
Revolving debt, which includes credit cards, climbed by $366.2 million in October, according to the Fed's statistics.
Nonrevolving debt, including educational loans and loans for autos and mobile homes, increased by $7.28 billion in October, today's report showed. The Fed's report does not track debt secured by real estate, like home equity lines of credit.
Households may need to borrow more to sustain spending that climbed in the third quarter at the fastest pace this year alongside a drop in disposable income. The savings rate fell to 3.8 percent, the lowest since the last three months of 2007, to support the 2.3 percent advance in purchases last quarter, Commerce Department figures show.
In November, auto sales rose to a 13.6 million seasonally adjusted annualized rate, the best month since August 2009, according to Autodata Corporation. Americans spent a record $52.4 billion during the Thanksgiving weekend, kicking off the holiday shopping season, according to the National Retail Federation.

HEADLINE: A Business Ponders Whether Its Location Is Perfect, or a Disaster

BYLINE: By JOHN GROSSMANN

 BODY:
Pulling Down the Moon provides services like yoga classes, acupuncture, massage therapy and nutritional counseling to women undergoing fertility treatments. Based in Chicago, with satellite locations in Arlington Heights, Ill., and Rockville, Md., the nine-year-old company has grown to 35 employees with $1.3 million in annual revenue.
THE CHALLENGE To continue serving 200 patients after a July 24, 2010, deluge flooded its 1,850-square-foot offices and treatment rooms on the first floor of a repurposed Montgomery Ward warehouse along the Chicago River. The United States Department of Labor has estimated that 40 percent of businesses never reopen after experiencing a disaster. Of those that do, at least 25 percent close again within two years.
THE BACKGROUND In 2002, Tamara Quinn approached Beth Heller, a fellow yoga instructor, about starting a business. Ms. Heller was surprised; she had been thinking of starting the same kind of business: one offering yoga classes specifically for women going through fertility treatments. While not scientifically linked to higher pregnancy rates, yoga, the founders say, is known to decrease stress and help improve circulation and may therefore enhance fertility. 
Ms. Quinn had gotten off the fast track as Midwest ad sales manager for Martha Stewart Living Omnimedia to devote more time to her twins, who had been conceived with the aid of fertility treatments. Ms. Heller, a nutrition researcher who had suffered a stillbirth at 38 weeks, was then undergoing fertility treatments. (She has since given birth to two children.)
The partners opened Pulling Down the Moon -- named for a Buddhist meditation -- in the Chicago suburb of Wilmette, designing their own six-week series of six 90-minute classes. ''Lo and behold, if you build it, they will come,'' Ms. Quinn said.
In 2004, the business made a symbiotic move. To make referrals from one of the nation's largest fertility clinics as easy and convenient as pointing a finger, Ms. Heller and Ms. Quinn relocated their business down the hall from Fertility Centers of Illinois, settling in on the ground level of a landmark building on Chicago's Riverwalk. The floor-to-ceiling windows framed passing boats and Riverwalk strollers.
A sublease with the fertility clinic at what they considered ''really fair market value'' seemed just as salubrious to the health of the business -- until, that is, seven inches of rain swelled the Chicago River up over the walls of its engineered channel and throughout the clinic and Pulling Down the Moon, both located on the first floor.
When Ms. Quinn and Ms. Heller arrived early on a Saturday morning, ready to mop, they were not terribly alarmed. The water was only about an inch deep. ''It wasn't like on TV, where you see it six feet deep and things are floating,'' Ms. Quinn said. ''It was like, everything will be O.K. Let's light some candles, get the aromatherapy going.''
But it was not O.K. The building's drains and sewers backed up, adding to the inflow of river water. They were told it would take weeks, maybe months, of restoration work. This they knew: They had patients scheduled that day, and they owned a service business that tallied about 60 percent of its revenue from this now-unusable location.
That morning, Ms. Heller called the doctors at an upstairs OB-GYN practice to ask if she could relocate some of Pulling Down the Moon's operations and classes there temporarily. The upstairs doctors agreed, and yoga classes were held after hours in the reception area, with the furniture pushed aside. Ms. Quinn, meanwhile, e-mailed everyone in her local Women Presidents' Organization, asking: ''Do you know of a space where we can live?''
The business was lucky in other respects. Only one computer was ruined by the flood, and no data was lost because the company had no on-site servers. Patient information and schedules had been saved on the Web by outside providers.
Seven days later, Pulling Down the Moon moved into loft space a half-mile away. Not only was the search for a short-term lease made easier by the recession-fueled glut of commercial real estate, the relocation was smoothed by an operations manual the women had written to make the business scalable -- one already road-tested by the opening of the company's satellite centers.
Similarly, they were well served by having paid sufficient attention to business insurance when they founded the company. A business-interruption rider paid for the move to temporary quarters and reimbursed the ailing company month by month for lost revenue as patient visits slid by as much as 30 percent. Initially, it looked like all restoration costs would be covered by their general liability coverage. But the flood uncovered an overlooked potential downside to subleasing: being beholden to your landlord's disaster response, as if riding on the rear seat of a bicycle built for two.
Assessing the extensive damage to its quarters, Fertility Centers of Illinois decided the time was right to redesign its space and brought Ms. Heller and Ms. Quinn into the process, which meant moving their subleased quarters. This delayed the build-out and ended up costing Pulling Down the Moon an extra $60,000 because its insurance covered only the restoration of existing walls, not the building of new ones. The owners considered making a permanent move, Ms. Heller said, ''but we decided that we have this partnership with the doctors, and it's a big part of our market strategy.''
It took until mid-January, four and a half months after the flood, for Pulling Down the Moon to return to its Riverwalk home. The symbiotic relationship with the fertility clinic was re-established. Then, six months later, on the eve of the one-year anniversary of the flood, another storm sent water into the first floor of the building. This time the damage was not as bad, and the company was able to stay put while waiting for wallboard replacement and restoration work. But once again, Pulling Down the Moon's co-owners had to ask patients to put up with inconveniences until repairs were made. And once again, Ms. Heller and Ms. Quinn started asking themselves: Should we stay or should we go?
WHAT OTHERS SAY Ken Barnett, chief executive of MARS Advertising, a marketing agency based in Southfield, Mich., that lost everything in its 50,000-square-foot headquarters to a 2004 fire: ''The karma may be great along the river, the space may be perfect, but the fact is there are enough things in business that you cannot plan for. Why burden yourself with the uncertainty, lying in bed on a stormy night, that your business may not survive?''
Donna Childs, author of a book about disaster preparedness: ''The answer to the question of should they move to a new location is to be found in the mission of the business, providing stress-reducing yoga to aid fertility. Disruptions are stressful.''
Frank N. Darras, founding partner of DarrasLaw, an Ontario, Calif., firm specializing in insurance law said that ''Pulling Down the Moon enjoys 60 percent of its profit from their flagship headquarters location by being strategically located across the hall from the fertility clinic. With rent described as 'really fair market,' it's hard to imagine moving despite two floods.''
He added: ''Unlike 77 percent of small-business owners who have never heard of business-interruption insurance, purchased to recover lost profits due to loss of use or access, these smart insurance consumers had the right coverage in place.''
THE RESULTS Offer your thoughts on the decision on the You're the Boss blog at nytimes.com/boss. Next week, on the blog and in this space, we will give an update on what the company is doing.

HEADLINE: Canada Panel Rejects Tightrope Walk Over Falls

BYLINE: By ANDY NEWMAN

 BODY:
You can't tightrope-walk across Niagara Falls if only one side says yes. And on Wednesday, local authorities on the Canadian side said no to Nik Wallenda, the seventh-generation funambulist who had sought to be the first man, woman or child to tiptoe above the rushing gorge in more than a century.
The Niagara Parks Commission, which controls the parkland on the Ontario side of the falls, rejected Mr. Wallenda's proposal to traverse 1,800 feet on a two-inch steel cable, citing concerns about safety and copycats. 
''These types of activities are risky and can result in tragic consequences for performers, spectators and emergency personnel,'' the commission said in a statement, adding that granting Mr. Wallenda permission could ''encourage other individuals to attempt unsanctioned acts.''
Mr. Wallenda, 32, said he found the news ''a little bit disheartening'' but said he would appeal to Canada's national tourism officials.
New York State and the authorities in Niagara Falls, N.Y. -- a considerably more rundown municipality than its Canadian counterpart that could use the publicity the crossing could bring -- had thrown their support behind Mr. Wallenda's bid. In September, Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo approved legislation to give Mr. Wallenda a permit.
But the Canadian authorities have been frowning upon ''stunting'' at the falls since at least 1885, when the parks commission was formed to correct the ''increasingly carnival atmosphere'' cheapening the cataract's natural majesty.
Mr. Wallenda had engaged in months of tightrope diplomacy. In August, he presented his case to the parks commission, which asked him to submit a proposal to see if his plan met ''the best interests of the park.''
Last month he appeared before the commission again, noted a consultant's report that the event would draw at least 60,000 spectators and bring in up to $20 million, and told the panel, ''To deny that seems a little bit arrogant and foolish.'' The commission's chairwoman, foreshadowing Wednesday's decision, said at the time, ''Over many years, it has been the mission of the commission that stunting is not the means to create long-term economic investment.''
The last tightrope walker to cross the falls was James Hardy of Toronto in 1896, according to the Niagara Tourism and Convention Corporation, the tourism agency on the American side.
Mr. Wallenda said from his home in Florida that he was used to getting turned down the first time around.
''I broke six world records last year and every one of those venues initially said no,'' he said. He noted that he had support of the mayor of Niagara Falls, Ontario and a member of Ontario's provincial parliament and said he planned to press his case to Ontario's tourism minister, Michael Chan.
''Hopefully, he'll see something in the proposal that the parks didn't,'' Mr. Wallenda said. ''Just because I hear a 'no' doesn't mean I'll pack my bags and go home.''
An earlier version of this post misstated the tourism official to whom Mr. Wallenda plans to appeal. It is Ontario's tourism minister, Michael Chan, not Canada's national tourism minister, Maxime Bernier.
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

HEADLINE: At Climate Talks, a Familiar Standoff Between U.S. and China

BYLINE: By JOHN M. BRODER

 BODY:
DURBAN, South Africa -- China, the world's biggest greenhouse gas emitter, has once again emerged as the biggest puzzle at international climate change talks, sending ambiguous signals about the role it intends to play in future negotiations. This week, the nation's top climate envoy said that China would be open to signing a formal treaty limiting emissions after 2020 -- but laid down conditions for doing so that are unlikely ever to be met.
China's lead negotiator at the United Nations climate change talks here, Xie Zhenhua, said that China was prepared to enter into a legally binding agreement after current voluntary programs expire at the end of the decade, seemingly a major step. China has always contended that because of its rapid economic growth and the persistent poverty of millions of its citizens, it cannot be bound by the same emissions standards as advanced industrialized nations. 
Mr. Xie outlined five conditions under which China would consider joining such a treaty as a full partner, the major one being that China and other rapidly growing economies must be treated differently from the so-called rich countries. But that has been a deal-breaker for the United States for years and is the central reason that the Senate refused to even consider ratifying the Kyoto Protocol, a 1997 agreement whose goal, still unmet, is to limit global greenhouse gas emissions.
''These conditions are not new,'' Mr. Xie acknowledged at a briefing here where more than 190 nations are gathered for the 17th annual conference of parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change. ''These have been negotiated for the past 20 years.
''What is most important so far is to implement existing commitments and review efforts undertaken by the parties, and after that we can think about what should be done after 2020 and beyond.''
Todd D. Stern, the American climate change envoy, said that the United States would be happy to discuss a formal treaty and then spelled out his conditions, which also were not new and appeared to rule out any sort of deal like that envisioned by Mr. Xie.
For a legally binding agreement to take hold, ''it's going to be absolutely critical that it applies to all the major players, and China obviously is one of them,'' Mr. Stern said at a briefing.
''All the major players are going to have to be in with obligations, with commitments that have the same legal force,'' he added. ''And that means there's no conditionality, they're not conditional on receiving technology or financing, there's no trap doors, there's no Swiss cheese in that kind of an agreement.''
The dispute between the United States and China, the two largest sources of the carbon dioxide emissions that contribute to global warming, has come to be an enduring feature of these negotiations and a source of deep frustration for the other players.
Jo Leinen, the German Social Democrat who leads the delegation from the European Parliament, lashed out at both superpowers on Wednesday afternoon.
''What is really frustrating to see is this conference is again hijacked by the Ping-Pong game between the U.S. and China,'' he said. ''It is unacceptable and no more tolerable that this game is blocking the overall process. Now that China has done some moves, let's test their seriousness. I don't see the same commitment, the same signals from the U.S. The one is not yet ready; the other is not willing. We really have a problem.''
The standoff has threatened to derail the process in each of the past several years, but at the end of the two-week session the parties usually pull back from the brink and announce an incremental, face-saving deal. This year's talks appear headed for the same sort of conclusion.
Negotiators appear close to agreeing on how to structure a fund that is supposed to generate $100 billion a year in public and private financing for climate change programs by 2020. They have also made progress on programs to save tropical forests from clear-cutting, transfer clean-energy technology to emerging nations and refine systems for verifying that countries are taking steps to cut emissions.
The holy grail of these talks, a global treaty encompassing all nations and limiting temperature rise to 3.6 degrees Fahrenheit above pre-industrial levels, appears as elusive as ever.
Weary of the inconclusive jousting on a treaty with teeth, many delegates and observers say that small progress may not be a bad thing.
Elliot Diringer, executive vice president of the Center for Climate and Energy Solutions, a private research and advocacy group in Washington, said that while a legal treaty remained an important prod to action, it should not get in the way of more immediate steps.
''This preoccupation with 'binding' has become more an obstacle than a means of progress,'' he said in an e-mail. ''The reality is that key players including the United States and China are not prepared at this stage to take on binding commitments to reduce their emissions.
''Rather than arguing over that year after year, we should focus on strengthening the international climate framework step by step.''

CORRECTION-DATE: December 9, 2011

 CORRECTION:
This article has been revised to reflect the following correction: An article on Thursday about global climate change talks in Durban, South Africa, transposed the name of a group whose executive vice president was quoted on the status of the negotiations. It is the Center for Climate and Energy Solutions, not the Center for Energy and Climate Solutions.

HEADLINE: Phones Get Game Power In the Cloud

BYLINE: By NICK WINGFIELD

 BODY:
We can shop on our phones and read magazines on our tablets. But playing high-end video games on a mobile device has been out of the question.
That might be about to change.
OnLive, a Silicon Valley start-up, on Thursday plans to release software that will let people play the richest, most graphically intense games on Apple's iPhone and iPad, as well as on Amazon's Kindle Fire and other devices based on Google's Android software. In the past, these games have been far beyond the relatively anemic computing power of such devices, requiring the horsepower of a PC or a console. But OnLive runs all of the games on its service entirely on powerful server computers in its data centers and delivers them over the Internet, through so-called cloud computing.
Other companies are trying to do the same thing, including Gaikai, a start-up based in Los Angeles. If they succeed, a shift to cloud gaming could have big implications for the incumbent powers in the video game business, mainly the console makers Sony, Microsoft and Nintendo. That is because running games in data centers means that consoles in the home can be far less powerful, relieving consumers of the need to buy a new generation of hardware in the future. 
At the same time, moving gaming into the cloud could help push the boundaries of what cloud computing can do, even on relatively low-powered mobile devices.
Everything from FarmVille on Facebook to data backup services like Apple's iCloud to Netflix's streaming movie service are considered cloud applications. But playing high-end games in the cloud presents a much bigger technical challenge because of the importance of eliminating any lag between the moment a player takes an action in a game on his or her device, and when the game responds on the screen. Even split-second delays can turn serious gamers off.
OnLive says it has solved this problem by figuring out a method of efficiently packaging video images of a live game that it delivers over the Internet, and that allows for instantaneous response to actions by players as they control the movement of characters within a game.
In a recent demonstration in Seattle, Steve Perlman, the chief executive and founder of OnLive, showed a collection of well-known high-end games, including L.A. Noire and Unreal Tournament 3, on an iPad, Android phones and a Kindle Fire.
Although the games were running on computers in an OnLive data center in Northern California, they responded immediately when a player moved a character around. Some games on the service have been adapted to respond to fingers on a touch screen, but many work better with a $50 wireless controller sold by OnLive. That's cheaper than buying a traditional game console, which starts at about $150.
''It's amazing the performance he's getting out of all these tablets,'' said Richard Doherty, an analyst at Envisioneering Group.
Mr. Perlman said OnLive would also soon introduce a service that let people run a full Windows desktop on iPads and other mobile devices, including Web browsers that can show Web sites with Flash, an Adobe graphics technology that is not otherwise available on iPads.
Last year, OnLive introduced an earlier iteration of its service, letting people play games first on PCs, Macs and television sets through a small $99 device it calls the MicroConsole.
Mr. Perlman predicted that the growing capabilities of the cloud, along with the high costs of introducing a new console, would lead to big changes in the business. Hardware makers can lose billions of dollars on new game systems before eventually recouping their investments through royalties from game sales.
''It's our view that probably there won't be another console and that this current generation is the last,'' Mr. Perlman said. ''The economics can't support it anymore.''
However, even people who believe strongly that cloud gaming will become an important part of the market say they think that prediction is an overstatement. Michael Pachter, an analyst at Wedbush Securities, said cloud gaming was still too new for serious gamers to switch their habits. Internet connections in some areas are not fast and reliable enough for gamers to depend on a cloud gaming service all the time.
''Realistically, there's one more'' generation of consoles coming, Mr. Pachter said. ''It will take a while for people to trust the cloud and adapt.''
Nintendo has already announced plans for a new machine, the Wii U, expected to be released next year. But Sony and Microsoft don't appear to be in any rush to introduce new consoles. It has been five and six years, respectively, since the companies introduced the PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360, and neither company is talking about plans for a new system. Console makers used to introduce new game systems every five to six years. ''We've got a lot of life left in the current generation of PlayStation with PS3,'' said Patrick Seybold, a spokesman for Sony's United States games division.
Some cloud gaming proponents say they believe future consoles are likely to embrace the technology, rather than risk being replaced by it. ''Anyone making consoles for the future would be crazy not to have cloud gaming support,'' said David Perry, Gaikai's C.E.O.
Support from game publishers can make or break OnLive and it isn't clear how eager some of the more prominent ones are to join the service, which has a variety of payment plans for consumers, from a $10 monthly rental to an option for buying games for $2 to $50. The industry's biggest blockbuster, the Call of Duty series from Activision Blizzard, isn't available on the service, for example.
An executive of one publisher working with OnLive, Jason Kingsley, the chief executive of Rebellion, predicted that most game makers would warm to cloud gaming services over time.
''There will always be some people who say, 'We don't want to engage in this, it's horrible,' '' Mr. Kingsley said. ''I can't see why it shouldn't be part of the mix.''

HEADLINE: Dollar-Loan Demand Swells In Europe After Rate Cut

BYLINE: By BLOOMBERG NEWS

 BODY:
The European Central Bank said demand for three-month dollar loans surged after it cut the cost of the financing almost in half in a coordinated action last week with five other central banks including the Federal Reserve. 
The European Central Bank, based in Frankfurt, will lend $50.7 billion to 34 euro area banks on Thursday for 84 days at a fixed rate of 0.59 percent. That compares with the $395 million lent in the last three-month offering on Nov. 9 at a rate of 1.09 percent. The E.C.B. also lent five banks $1.6 billion in its regular weekly dollar operation, up from $352 million last week. The E.C.B. does not disclose the identity of the banks that borrow.
Six central banks including the Fed, the European Central Bank and the Bank of Japan cut the cost of emergency dollar loans by 50 basis points on Nov. 30 in an effort to ease a credit shortage worsened by Europe's sovereign debt crisis. A basis point is equal to 0.01 percent. On Tuesday, demand for seven-day dollar loans from the Bank of Japan surged to $25 million from $1 million.
''The reduction in the rate seems to have been enough to reduce the stigma in using the facility,'' said Vincent Chaigneau, rate strategist at Societe Generale in Paris. ''Banks have had a lot of difficulty in raising funding in dollars, but this amount is still much lower than what we had in 2009.''
European banks need dollars to finance their own lending in the United States as well as to clients elsewhere doing business in the world's leading reserve currency. On Sept. 15, global equity markets rallied after the E.C.B. said it would coordinate with the Fed to offer a series of three-month dollar loans to euro area banks to ensure they had enough of the currency for the rest of the year.
On Thursday, the E.C.B. is expected to cut its benchmark interest rate to 1 percent from 1.25 percent.

HEADLINE: That Tax Pledge? A Governor Who Believes in Government Changes His Mind

BYLINE: By MICHAEL POWELL. 
E-mail: powellm@nytimes.com

 BODY:
ALBANY
The inhabitants of the statehouse, that vast Romanesque pile of gray bricks that glowers over this river city, passed a day in near-suspended animation as they waited for Governor Mesmerizer to work his wiles.
At either end of the cavernous third-floor halls, Republican senators, Democratic assemblymen and varied lobbyists and hangers-on lounged about, waiting to approve -- as if on their leaders' command -- legislation that would reshape a nearly flat state tax code into something more progressive.
Albany may be a last bastion of democratic centralism, but this, too, is true: In a nation often dominated by its ideologues, Republican and Democratic legislators prepared to join in voting for a tax-increase package, while Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo smiled like the cat that had ingested the canary. 
This legislation, seemingly cobbled together on the drive north from Westchester County, has its anomalies. The biggest cuts go to those who earn $300,000 to $2 million a year, for whom rates fall to 6.85 from as much as 8.97 percent. People making $40,000 a week, which even on the far west Greenwich Village Gold Coast is nobody's definition of middle class, will see a sizable tax cut.
But over all, the tax code changes will force the truly wealthy to pay more and will raise $1.9 billion for a cash-poor state; there is a relatively more manageable billion-dollars-plus gap in the next budget year.
Through it all, the governor remains an intriguing piece of work. He insists he is a progressive, except when he insists he is a fiscal conservative, except when he insists he is not so easily categorized.
Perhaps it's best to describe the governor as someone who believes that government has a role to play in people's lives, and who is very willing to cut a deal to accomplish that.
So as to his former heartfelt pledge of no new taxes? The facts on the ground changed. Tax revenues fell off the table. And Washington's tribal dysfunctions not only held no promise of salve, but also threatened to tank the stock markets that generate so much tax revenue for New York.
And he could not keep his promises elsewhere -- like maintaining education financing -- without raising revenues. As much as the Jacobins at The New York Post's editorial page howled for the blood of union members, layoffs also seemed a grim way to end a first year in office.
So the governor changed his mind.
''What's most amazing,'' a liberal Democrat said with something like genuine admiration, ''is that he can seemingly completely change his mind and not ever acknowledge that.''
None of this looks good to civic advocates. This governor is as transparent as a blot of India ink. His on-the-record comments to the press are as scarce as his off-the-record conversations are plentiful. For days at a time, his public schedule states ''New York City,'' which narrows it down not at all. On a more fact-specific day, the schedule states: ''Albany.''
And he prides himself on keeping friends and enemies, allies and opponents (such distinctions are subject to hourly or daily change) in the loop and in the darkness in equal measure.
HE negotiates with the Republican Senate leader, Dean G. Skelos, and the Democratic Assembly speaker, Sheldon Silver, in a sort of four-dimensional chess game. Neither is precisely sure what Mr. Cuomo is whispering in the ear of the other. ''He is very adroit: He boxes you out, he boxes you in,'' said a labor organizer who has experienced both.
Assemblyman Keith L. T. Wright of Albany sprawled in a chair outside the Assembly chambers. Did he mind voting on a tax restructuring this way? I mean, he had yet to see the bill.
He shrugged. ''If it walks like a duck, if it talks like a duck, it is a duck,'' he said. ''Politics is ever evolving; the governor evolved on taxes.
''I applaud that.''
Not all are so pleased. The Post howled like a high school debutante whose date turned out to be a tax-made cad.
It dispensed with the boys for whom it had not hope: Dean Skelos? ''Dumb as a post.'' Sheldon Silver? ''Union-owned.'' And the governor, upon whom the editorial page had showered so much hope and praise? He has led a tax increase to sustain the state's ''spendocracy.''
Such opprobrium is survivable. The greater challenge is that the state and national economies remain whimpering dogs with little hope of quick cure.
Another year or two of declining revenues and chronic unemployment, and even the craftiest governor could find himself in an alley with no good way out.

HEADLINE: Shares Gain on Hope Euro Zone Can Find a Solution to Its Debt Crisis

BYLINE: By REUTERS

 BODY:
Hope that the euro zone will find a solution to its debt crisis inspired enough buying to push Wall Street stocks to a third day of gains on Wednesday.
Euro zone nations are expected to vote on Friday at their summit meeting on an agreement, reached by Germany and France, to tighten fiscal controls on them. 
Equities and other markets have hinged on euro zone sovereign debt crisis headlines for weeks, with markets expected to become increasingly volatile as more details leak before the meeting, which begins Thursday. Traders are looking to position themselves in preparation for an escalation of the crisis or a clear plan to control it.
''We are in a holding mode waiting to see if they can actually herd the kittens in the E.U. to come to something,'' said Ben Willis, director of floor operations for Sunrise Securities in New York. ''All we are looking for is progress, we are not looking for anything perfect, we are not looking for the ultimate solution.''
Financial companies were among the best performers, with JPMorgan Chase & Company up 2.3 percent to $34. The Standard & Poor's financial sector index rose 1.2 percent.
The market remained jumpy given previous European Union summit meetings that disappointed investors. Comments on Wednesday from an unnamed German official that Berlin was increasingly pessimistic about a deal hurt stocks early.
Bearish developments, including a warning on Monday by Standard & Poor's that it had put the euro zone on watch for a credit rating downgrade, did not prompt heavy selling.
The Dow Jones industrial average gained 46.24 points, or 0.38 percent, to 12,196.37. The S.& P. 500-stock index added 2.54 points, or 0.20 percent, to 1,261.01. The Nasdaq composite index fell 0.35 points, or 0.01 percent, to 2,649.21.
French officials said French and German leaders would not leave the two-day meeting until a ''powerful'' deal had been reached. They want to impose mandatory penalties on nations that exceed deficit targets, a plan backed by the United States Treasury secretary, Timothy F. Geithner, who is in Europe.
Among individual stocks, Martha Stewart Living Omnimedia jumped 33.3 percent to close at $4.16, after J. C. Penney agreed to buy a 16.6 percent stake.
Men's Wearhouse shares surged 19.6 percent to $32.51 a day after it reported quarterly profit that topped expectations.
Interest rates declined. The Treasury's benchmark 10-year note rose 15/32, to 99 23/32, and the yield fell to 2.03 percent from 2.09 percent late Tuesday.

HEADLINE: Old-Time New York Pleasure Faces Growing Storm of Opposition

BYLINE: By EMILY B. HAGER

 BODY:
A ride through Central Park in a horse-drawn carriage is one of New York City's most storied attractions, the rhythmic clip-clop offering a respite from the hustle of everyday life.
But now this old-fashioned industry is facing unprecedented turmoil.
After campaigning for decades, animal rights advocates are gaining support for legislation that would ban those horse-drawn carriages, including endorsements from mayoral candidates and celebrities.
The carriage owners say they are being harassed, but they also acknowledge carrying out a campaign to infiltrate the activist groups and secretly record their strategy sessions.
Both the animal rights advocates and the carriage owners say they have been subjected to threats of violence by the other side. 
The struggle is so tense that when an accident last summer left a carriage driver in a coma, the hospital where he was recovering was not immediately disclosed, out of concern that activists would stage protests there.
The American Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals has become ensnared in the debate over the carriages. The group's chief equine veterinarian, Dr. Pamela Corey, said her supervisors pushed her to slant her conclusions about the death of a carriage horse, to generate sympathy for a ban.
Besides the animal rights campaigners, the industry is facing a classic New York peril: rising real estate values. Developers covet the stables on the Far West Side where the horses have long been kept.
New York City's carriage horses have long been a cause celebre for animal rights advocates. Now, though, even the trade's staunchest defenders say its survival is threatened as never before.
''People in our business probably think that we probably won't survive forever and are asking, 'How long will we last,' '' said Conor McHugh, a carriage driver and the manager of Clinton Park Stables, one of four stables in the city that house the horses.
''But we will keep fighting,'' Mr. McHugh added.
The city's licensed carriage horse industry -- 68 carriages, 216 horses and 282 drivers -- brings in roughly $15 million annually, officials estimate.
Drivers charge $50 for a 20-minute ride through Central Park, and $20 for each additional 10 minutes. On a good day, they can make 15 trips, grossing at least $750 plus tips.
Drivers' earnings are said to range from $40,000 to $100,000 annually, depending primarily on whether they own their horses, what shifts they work (day shifts are better) and how bad the weather and the economy are.
So far this year, seven incidents involving carriage horses have been reported, including a collision with a taxi. With each accident, animal rights campaigners raise alarms. They say carriage horses work under cruel conditions: nine-hour shifts, wading through Manhattan traffic, in almost any weather, with no space to frolic in a pasture.
The activists have rounded up endorsements from celebrities like the designer Calvin Klein and the actresses Pamela Anderson and Lea Michele, while lawmakers allied with them have introduced bills at the state and city levels to abolish the industry.
Last year, the City Council approved a measure to improve working and living conditions for the horses but would not pass a ban.
Many weekends, one group or another gathers across from the Plaza Hotel, where carriages congregate at an entrance to Central Park, to hold a protest.
''Horses frighten very easily,'' said Edita Birnkrant, the New York director of one of the advocacy groups, Friends of Animals. ''The noises of New York City, the chaos -- it is all just an inherently dangerous environment, and they don't belong here.''
Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg has been an ardent supporter of the carriages. After a horse fell Sunday in Midtown Manhattan, Mr. Bloomberg dismissed criticism of the industry.
''Carriage horses have traditionally been a part of New York City,'' he said. ''The tourists love them, and we've used from time immemorial animals to pull things. They are well treated, and we'll continue to make sure that they are well treated.''
The American Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals is one of the groups leading the effort to ban the carriages. It is also one of the three entities -- along with the city's health department and the Department of Consumer Affairs -- that regulate the industry.
''I don't see it as a conflict,'' the society's president, Ed Sayres, said last month on the steps of City Hall after a rally against the carriages. ''If we don't bring forward the risk factor that we are observing, then it would be negligent.''
In 2008, Mr. Sayres teamed up with Stephen Nislick, chief executive of the development company Edison Properties, which owns Manhattan Mini Storage, to develop a plan to replace the carriage horses with electric-powered replicas of antique cars.
''The cars provide an economic win for the drivers, owners and for the city,'' Mr. Nislick said.
With $400,000 from the A.S.P.C.A., and a contribution from Mr. Nislick, the two men started NY-Class, a nonprofit organization that has collected more than 55,000 signatures backing city legislation that would carry out their plan.
Their campaign has been roiled, however, by a dispute over the death of a carriage horse named Charlie in October. The A.S.P.C.A. at first quoted its chief equine veterinarian, Dr. Corey, as saying the horse ''was not a healthy horse and was likely suffering from pain.''
Soon after, Dr. Corey retracted her statement and said the society had pushed her to distort her findings to turn public opinion against the carriages. ''I was under a lot of pressure during the writing of that press release,'' she said.
She said there was no evidence that Charlie was experiencing pain or had been abused.
The society suspended Dr. Corey after she spoke out. She then filed a complaint with the state attorney general's office, contending that on several occasions she had been pressured to slant her professional opinion to help achieve a ban.
A spokeswoman for the A.S.P.C.A., Elizabeth Estroff, said it was baffled by Dr. Corey's claims, adding that Dr. Corey had ''ultimately reviewed, edited and approved the final statement'' about the horse.
The carriage industry has filed its own complaints with city and state agencies against the A.S.P.C.A. and NY-Class. Some carriage owners have gone to NY-Class meetings, without disclosing their identities. They have recorded discussions that they maintain show that the activists are bent on distorting the carriage industry's record.
On one recording, Mr. Nislick describes efforts to gain the support of city politicians by giving them campaign contributions.
The politicians ''want money from people and they want your vote,'' Mr. Nislick said, according to the recording.
Asked about the recordings, Mr. Nislick declined to comment.
The carriage owners also assert that Mr. Nislick wants to be able to gain control of the land under the carriage horse stables.
Two of the stables are on a prime block between West 37th and 38th Streets in the heart of Hudson Yards, a sprawling commercial and residential development.
Mr. Nislick denied being interested in the land, but other developers envision transforming the lots into hotels and office buildings.
If the stables were sold and then closed, the carriage horses could end up homeless, and their owners could go out of business. Relocating uptown, and closer to Central Park, may not be an option with real estate scarce.
The stables on 37th and 38th Streets are in the district of the City Council speaker, Christine C. Quinn, a Democrat who is expected to run for mayor. Like Mr. Bloomberg, Ms. Quinn has supported the carriage industry, though she has called recently for increased oversight of the horses.
Two other likely Democratic mayoral candidates -- Scott M. Stringer, the Manhattan borough president, and William C. Thompson Jr., the former city comptroller -- have supported the ban, as well as the electric car initiative.
NY-Class and other animal rights groups pledge that if the carriages are eliminated, they will find safe pastures for the 216 horses. But many veterinarians say horse sanctuaries around the country are full, and facing difficulties because of the economy.
''If we banned the carriage horse industry tomorrow, they would go straight to slaughter,'' said Dr. Nena Winand, an upstate New York veterinarian who is a member of the American Association of Equine Practitioners. ''There is no big field out there, there is no one to pay the bills.''

This article has been revised to reflect the following correction: An article on Thursday about a push to ban horse-drawn carriage rides in Central Park misstated the year that two advocates teamed up to develop a plan to replace those carriages with electric-powered replicas of antique cars, in a group called NY-Class. It was 2008, not 2009.
This article has been revised to reflect the following correction: An article on Thursday about a push to ban horse-drawn carriage rides in Central Park misstated part of the name of an organization to which an upstate New York veterinarian belongs, and it described the carriages incorrectly at one point. The veterinarian, Dr. Nena Winand, is a member of the American Association of Equine Practitioners, not the American Society of Equine Practitioners. And the carriages have four wheels, and therefore are not ''hansom cabs,'' which are two-wheeled. An accompanying picture caption, as well as a subheading in some editions, and a correction in this space on Friday repeated the error about the cabs. (A reader pointed out this inaccuracy in a letter published in The Times in 1985, but this is the first correction of numerous such references through the years.)

HEADLINE: Obama's Kansas Speech About Income Inequality

 BODY:
To the Editor:
Re ''Obama in Osawatomie'' (editorial, Dec. 7), about President Obama's speech in Kansas on Tuesday about income inequality and the economy: 
I agree that the president's speech was late in coming, and late to Theodore Roosevelt's ''level of passion.''
I think that the president will find that his message will be welcomed by a majority of Americans.
The president's reluctance to state it sooner may be reflective of political misjudgment or timidity motivated by factors beyond my capacity to identify.
The issue with the president always seems to come back to conviction. Theodore Roosevelt exhibited great conviction that greatly influenced the destiny of our nation.
President Obama's message will also, provided that he sticks to his message.
JOHN A. VITERITTI Southold, N.Y., Dec. 7, 2011
To the Editor:
Re ''Obama Sounds a Populist Call on G.O.P. Turf'' (front page, Dec. 7):
Evoking Teddy Roosevelt's populist run for president in 1912, President Obama has unveiled the core theme for his 2012 re-election campaign: protection of the middle class against the ''breathtaking greed'' of the wealthiest Americans.
Progressive supporters, including The New York Times, cheer Mr. Obama's newfound enthusiasm to raise taxes on the rich, expand regulatory oversight and boost the government's responsibility to ''keep competition fair'' (editorial, Dec. 7).
The problem: setting aside debates over the wisdom of such policies, the American people remain deeply skeptical of expanding the role of government to ensure greater ''fairness'' in American society. Poll after poll shows that even after the dramatic greed-driven financial collapse of 2008, most Americans continue to distrust government more than they do corporations.
The White House has now committed to doubling down on a strategy that seeks to alter the way Americans view government. In a little less than a year, we will find out if Mr. Obama fares better on this front than his newfound role model did: Teddy Roosevelt lost the 1912 election.

HEADLINE: G.O.P. Candidates, at Jewish Coalition, Pledge to Be Israel's Best Friends

BYLINE: By RICHARD A. OPPEL Jr.; Ashley Parker contributed reporting.

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- The leading Republican candidates drew enthusiastic applause from Republican Jewish leaders here on Wednesday after accusing President Obama of falling short in his support of Israel while coddling its adversaries. But it remained to be seen how far those arguments will carry them, especially given the candidates' rightward tilt on other issues that have traditionally been important to American Jews.
The speeches to the Republican Jewish Coalition Presidential Candidates Forum suggested that the candidates would differ substantially from previous Democratic and Republican administrations on critical elements of the Middle East peace process. Some indicated they would put less pressure on Israel on issues like the contours of an independent Palestinian state. 
Newt Gingrich, the former speaker of the House, criticized a line of public discussion -- which he blamed on the Obama administration -- that he said holds that ''it's always Israel's fault no matter how bad the other side is.'' This, he added to sustained applause, ''has to stop.''
Mitt Romney, the former Massachusetts governor, said the White House had ''chastened'' Israel while pushing an appeasement strategy, a pointed allusion before a Jewish audience that harked back to the diplomacy that Neville Chamberlain, the British prime minister, pursued in the 1930s with Hitler.
Mr. Romney restated his pledge to make Israel the first country he would visit as president, and he added that ''Iran's ayatollahs will not be permitted to obtain nuclear weapons on my watch,'' though he did not detail how he would prevent it.
Mr. Gingrich starkly equated the United States' ''struggle with radical Islam'' to the country's relations with the Soviet Union just after World War II, on the eve of a cold war that would dominate American foreign policy for more than four decades.
The country is ''about where we were in 1946,'' he said.
Gov. Rick Perry of Texas, who stumbled from front-runner status to single digits in the polls over the last few months, added that ''whether you are old enough to remember the 1940s or not, you know the significance of that number'' -- six million, which he said was the number of Jews now living in Israel and the number murdered in the Holocaust.
One reason Republicans seek to sound serious on Israel is to appeal to evangelical Christians who make up large portions of the Republican primary voters in South Carolina and the caucusgoers in Iowa. Down the road, they also know that Jewish voters are critical to victory in general election swing states like Pennsylvania and Florida.
But just as the candidates have staked out hard positions on Israel, they have also moved to the right on other issues, a shift that Democrats say calls into question their appeal to a wide swath of Jewish voters.
''They can't talk about the environment. They can't talk about separation of church and state. And the American Jewish community is the most pro-choice demographic that you can design in America today, so they can't talk about that,'' said David Harris, chief executive of the National Jewish Democratic Council. ''So they have to spread misinformation,'' he said, about ''this president's stellar pro-Israel record.''
Allies of the Obama administration, which enjoys healthy public support for its record on terrorism and national security, also cite its high levels of military assistance to Israel and resistance at the United Nations to the Palestinians' efforts to win statehood recognition. They also point to national security successes under Mr. Obama's leadership, like the killing of Osama bin Laden and the decimation of Al Qaeda's ranks in the Pakistani frontier by drone strikes.
Mr. Romney used his speech to criticize President Obama on other fronts, saying that he was fostering an ''entitlement'' society.
''American prosperity is fully dependent upon having an opportunity society -- I don't think President Obama understands that,'' Mr. Romney told the crowd. ''I don't think he understands why our economy is the most successful in the world. I don't think he understands America.''
Mr. Romney's remarks served as something of a rebuttal to a speech that Mr. Obama gave on Tuesday in Kansas, in which the president warned that trickle-down economic policy did not work.
''A merit-based opportunity society is one that gathers and creates a citizenry of pioneers -- a people who invent, who build, who create,'' Mr. Romney said. ''And as these people exert the effort, and take the risks inherent in inventing and creating things, they employ and lift the rest of us, creating prosperity for all of us. The rewards they earn don't make the rest of us poorer -- they make us all better off.''
His view ran counter to Mr. Obama's assertion a day earlier that while trickle-down economics appeals to the nation's ''rugged individualism and our healthy skepticism of too much government,'' it is not an effective economy policy.

HEADLINE: Why the Fight Over the Payroll Tax Matters

BYLINE: By EUGENE A. LUDWIG. 
Eugene A. Ludwig, chief executive of the Promontory Financial Group, was the comptroller of the currency from 1993 to 1998.

 BODY:
Washington
THE payroll tax cut being debated in Congress is one of our last, best hopes to break the spell of unemployment that continues to hang over the economy. If both parties fail to reach an agreement, the economic and political consequences will be devastating. There is a way out, but it requires an understanding of why payroll taxes are particularly bad for economic growth.
Payroll taxes are the most regressive taxes most Americans pay with respect to current income, and one of the biggest drags on workers' pay. Cutting them stimulates demand by giving more money to more of those who spend it. (President Obama's proposed payroll tax cut -- part of his American Jobs Act -- would leave 161 million workers with larger paychecks in 2012, the Treasury Department estimates.) Employers would also benefit from payroll tax cuts, but only when they hire, so any cuts to the employer portion would be targeted to job creation alone. Over the past 75 years, with the creation and growth of Social Security and later Medicare, payroll taxes have ballooned from 10 percent to around 40 percent of federal revenue, rivaling income tax. 
Taxes on payrolls effectively encourage the overconsumption of resources like energy and land and the underutilization of labor. Historically, this increased labor productivity, but also decreased employment by tens of millions of jobs. To correct the imbalance, we must cut payroll taxes, as other advanced industrialized countries have done.
The payroll tax for Social Security is 6.2 percent of wages (up to an annual maximum of $106,800). This year, the employee's contribution was reduced to 4.2 percent, while the employer's portion stayed at 6.2 percent.
If Congress doesn't reach an agreement, the two-percentage-point payroll-tax holiday for employees will expire on Dec. 31. That would have a disastrous effect on our economic recovery.
So why is extending the cuts still contentious? Some Democrats worry that cutting payroll taxes crimps Social Security revenue. Some Republicans argue that temporary, partial cuts for employers wouldn't give them sufficient incentive to hire. Mitt Romney, the former Massachusetts governor who is seeking the Republican nomination for president, called temporary payroll tax cuts a ''Band-Aid'' and said he preferred permanent changes to the tax code (though he now says he supports a one-year extension in the payroll-tax cut).
Mr. Romney is right about the need for certainty -- and that's precisely why we should cut payroll taxes deeply and permanently, both for employers and employees. Extending current cuts for workers now is a necessary first step. But we should also deepen them, adding cuts to employer payroll taxes to stimulate jobs, and phasing in new taxes on sources other than labor that can permanently replace payroll tax revenues.
This would allay both sides' objections. Giving cuts to employers and making them permanent would provide the certainty businesses need to get off the sidelines and hire. And the payroll tax is not the best way to shore up the long-term future of Social Security.
Of course, the big question is, which revenues could both parties agree on to offset the payroll tax? The Democrats' proposed surtax on the wealthy was rejected by Republicans, who instead proposed freezing or cutting federal workers' pay, and raising Medicare premiums for the wealthy. Both parties floated new compromise proposals this week, but they may not be conducive to a deal.
It shouldn't be this hard. A study by the bipartisan group Get America Working, whose advisory council I serve on, identified 25 revenue sources that could offset payroll tax cuts: eliminating various subsidies (which could raise $54 billion), taxing pollution and waste ($212 billion), energy inefficiency ($135 billion), gasoline and other motor fuels ($83 billion) and value-added consumption ($790 billion, though more conservative estimates by the Urban Institute and the Brookings Institution put the figure at $355 billion).
These alternatives are certain to be controversial. But they would ultimately bring far more economic benefit than payroll tax.
Shifting the tax burden away from labor and toward consumption is an idea with a long bipartisan pedigree, so as politically difficult as new taxes might be, there is potential for compromise. A permanent cut in the payroll tax, offset by new sources of revenue, would be a first step to fundamental tax reform. As unemployment and economic uncertainty drag on, and the consequences close in, it's time we took it.

HEADLINE: Frenzy of Year-End Activity for Congress

BYLINE: By JENNIFER STEINHAUER and ROBERT PEAR; Mark Landler contributed reporting.

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- Election year has arrived on Capitol Hill. Please keep your seatbelts securely fastened for the duration of the flight.
While the first session of the 112th Congress was defined by bruising legislative fiscal battles, Congressional Democrats and Republicans have now moved to the election-year stage of governing, with each side scrambling to define itself as most deserving of support from embattled middle class voters, especially those coveted independents who helped hand Republicans control of the House last year.
House Republicans met on Wednesday with leaders of the Republican National Committee to discuss fund-raising and other re-election matters. About the same moment, Democratic leaders in the Senate met with President Obama at the White House, where they discussed tactics to pass year-end legislation in terms that favor Democrats. 
On Thursday, Republican House members will meet with Speaker John A. Boehner to search for ways to agree to a payroll tax holiday extension for the middle class, something Republican leaders in both chambers view as essential to blunting Democrats who are accusing them of favoring the wealthy.
The Senate is expected to vote this week on the latest version of the Democrats' payroll tax bill, which would reduce the employee's share of the payroll tax -- the tax paid by employees -- to 3.1 percent of wages, from the current 4.2 percent. The bill would also impose a surtax on income over $1 million. If Congress does nothing -- as many Republicans are advocating -- the payroll tax rate will revert to 6.2 percent in January.
Democrats feel certain that they have sunk their teeth into a hot election year issue. ''We're on the side of angels,'' said Senator Harry Reid of Nevada, the majority leader, in a news conference on Capitol Hill Wednesday.
Senator Charles E. Schumer of New York, the No. 3 Democrat, elaborated on this later. ''The focus will be on the middle class,'' he said. ''We are already beginning to focus on what we can do on jobs, the economy and income equality next year.''
Mr. Schumer said Democrats would use ''the same theme'' in pushing back on Republican efforts to block the appointment of Richard Cordray, Mr. Obama's nominee for head of the administration's new consumer protection agency.
''We're trying to protect the middle class in this instance so they're not taken advantage of by financial institutions,'' Mr. Schumer said.
While many Republicans are privately worried about the Democrats' assault, they feel confident that the sorry state of the economy and Mr. Obama will weigh down Democrats next year.
''How can you call yourself party of the middle class if you haven't passed a single jobs bill that wasn't originated by House Republicans,'' said Kevin Smith, a spokesman for Mr. Boehner, who pointed to over 25 bills, largely related to deregulation, that the House had passed this year.
Representative Eric Cantor of Virginia, the majority leader in the House, informed members on Wednesday that when they arrive at work next Monday they should plan to stay until their legislative business is complete.
Mr. Reid also said Wednesday that the Senate would stay in session until the payroll tax cut matter was resolved, and Mr. Obama told Senate Democrats that he, too, could forgo a holiday trip to see the matter through, according to those at the meeting Wednesday.
Republicans find their House divided over the payroll tax issue, with the election year backdrop fanning the flames of their disagreements.
Mr. Boehner is expected to present a plan that would pay for the tax cut extension with a pay freeze on federal workers and members of Congress, as well as an increase in Medicare premiums for higher-earning recipients, among other things.
To win Republican votes for a payroll tax bill, House Republican leaders said last week that they would probably include a proposal to speed construction of the Keystone XL oil pipeline from Alberta to the Gulf Coast. Mr. Obama said Wednesday that he would reject such efforts, though he stopped short of an explicit veto threat.
''Any effort to try to tie Keystone to the payroll tax cut, I will reject,'' Mr. Obama said in an appearance at the White House with Prime Minister Stephen Harper of Canada, which has pushed hard for the project.
Mr. Cantor and some others, would like to tack on a plan to bring back corporate profits socked away overseas at a low tax rate -- known as repatriation -- without paying for the $80 billion in projected costs of such a plan.
Other Republicans, notably Mr. Boehner, believe that approach will hurt their case against Democrats because that measure, which would add to the deficit long term, would not be paid for as the payroll tax cut is meant to be. In a letter to House Republicans leaders this week, over half the 89 Republican members of the freshman class urged some repatriation legislation.
Many Republicans in both chambers do not want the tax cut extended at all; two bills, one sponsored by the Republican leader, Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, to extend the holiday failed on procedural votes last week.
Congressional Republicans said Mr. Obama had been in campaign mode since Labor Day, and they have repeatedly asserted that a stalemate on Capitol Hill serves his political interests because he is running against Congress.
''The speeches he has been giving lately are clever political documents,'' said Senator Jeff Sessions of Alabama, the senior Republican on the Senate Budget Committee. ''It is pretty clear that his focus has shifted from governing to campaigning, with about a year from now until Election Day.''
House and Senate negotiators said they were close to agreement on spending bills for the remainder of the fiscal year, and scheduled a meeting for Thursday to discuss the legislation. Negotiators said they expected to complete their work early next week, so both houses could pass the measure by Dec. 16, when a stopgap spending bill expires.

HEADLINE: 7 Hotels. 23 Stakeouts. 100 Pizzas. 1 N.B.A. Deal.

BYLINE: By HOWARD BECK

 BODY:
This summer and fall, I spent 156 hours in some of New York's finest hotels. I did not sleep, or shower, or earn rewards points. I was not, in the vernacular of the service industry, a ''guest.'' At times, I felt more like a hostage, subsisting on a diet of stale pizza, trail mix and anonymous sources.
To be a reporter covering the N.B.A. lockout was to enter a parallel universe, where normalcy was suspended, truth was pliable and time had no meaning. Absurdity reigned.
There were news conferences at 4 in the morning, Betty White sightings, a Gregg Popovich jog-by and a cameo by former President Bill Clinton. 
Bargaining sessions stretched for 15 hours while we stood on sidewalks or loitered in chilled lobbies, or sweated in stuffy conference rooms with bad wallpaper.
Twitter turned into a newswire, a lifeline to the outside world and a catchphrase machine, all in one. A player's inadvertent text message became a universal lockout greeting: ''How u?''
For the dozen or so reporters who covered every meeting, it often felt like we were living in our own twisted reality show: ''Survivor: Lockout Edition.''
The show mercifully ended at 3 a.m. Nov. 26, when owners and players at last agreed to a new labor deal, on the lockout's 149th day. That deal is expected to be ratified Thursday, at yet another Midtown hotel, the final chapter of a dizzying stakeout saga.
To our great surprise, thousands of people joined us for the ride via Twitter, clicking and ''retweeting'' every trivial nugget (''Talks have broken for dinner''), every news conference quote (''Enormous consequences'') and every punch-drunk riff by reporters (''Mutant pizza''), no matter the hour.
During one late-night session at the Waldorf-Astoria, I heard from a Twitter follower in Australia. He was just getting out of work. My friend David Aldridge of TNT said he received Twitter responses from six continents that night. Everywhere but Antarctica, where I'm guessing the Wi-Fi is a little sketchy.
Covering a professional sports labor battle can be a thankless task. No one wants to hear about millionaire athletes and billionaire owners fighting over a $4 billion pie, especially in a depressed economy. The average fan wants to know only three things:
Is it over?
Who won?
How does it affect my team?
The rest is just posturing and mind-numbing jargon: escrow tax, BRI, repeater tax, the cliff, nontaxpayer midlevel exception.
Somehow, these issues and phrases found a dedicated audience which, through the beauty of modern technology, could respond to all of us in real time as we drifted into a late-night stupor at the Waldorf, or the Sheraton, or the Lowell Hotel.
Twitter provided instant gratification -- Look, people care! -- reassuring us in 140-character bursts that the endless stakeouts were worthwhile.
The fans helped keep us sane -- along with reruns of ''Seinfeld'' streaming on the touchpad screens of Ken Berger of CBSSports.com and Alan Hahn of Newsday.
The fans kept us fed, too. A network of generous bloggers, coordinated by the salary-cap savant Larry Coon -- out of pity or support -- regularly sent us stacks of pizza. Marc Cornstein, a New York-based player agent, sent two massive deli platters (thus inspiring a new sandwich title, the Cornstein on rye). The Brooklyn-bound Nets also sent pizza one afternoon, to the chagrin of the Waldorf security staff, which harrumphed at the stack of cardboard boxes in their pristine lobby. (That lobby was routinely chilled to what felt like 55 degrees, which at least helped keep us awake.)
The various hotel staffs generally tolerated us as we gradually took over every couch, every table and every wall outlet, our own little Occupy movement.
It was while waiting in the Waldorf lobby, on Oct. 26, that we had our Betty White sighting. She was being honored at the 21st annual Broadcasting & Cable Hall Of Fame awards. She left around 5:15 a.m., presumably after a solid night of sleep. I was still typing.
Clinton passed through after a Nov. 8 player meeting at the Sheraton. He stopped long enough to shake hands, hug the union president Derek Fisher and hand out copies of his book, before heading to a ''Daily Show'' taping.
Along the way, I learned that the Cole Porter piano, in the Waldorf lobby, is a major tourist attraction. (We resisted the urge to plank it.) I learned that the Lowell, a boutique hotel on East 63rd Street, makes amazing chocolate-chip cookies. The Lowell also provided my back rest, as I sat on the 63rd Street sidewalk on the night of Oct. 4, and wrote that the N.B.A. had just canceled the first two weeks of the season.
The hotels were chosen, often at the last minute, based on the availability of conference rooms. N.B.A. officials had a particular affinity for the Lowell, which had a tiny lobby, forcing us to wait outside.
Passers-by, many of them walking tiny dogs, often asked if we were waiting for someone famous. No, we told them, just David Stern.
During one of the early stakeouts, Popovich, the San Antonio Spurs coach, jogged by and seemed startled to find N.B.A. reporters on the sidewalk. He claimed to have no idea that negotiations, which involved the Spurs owner Peter Holt, were going on nearby.
On another night, I watched a man surreptitiously videotape a couple having dinner at the French bistro across the street. Apparently, someone was about to get divorced.
That same night, two TV cameramen fought poorly -- after angrily wrestling for position during Stern's sidewalk press conference. That was the last time the sides used the Lowell.
We thought the odyssey would end much sooner. For a minute, we thought it had. On Sept. 8, Roger Mason Jr., a member of the players' executive board, sent out a Twitter message: ''Looking like a season. How u.'' Mason said the message was inadvertent and was not intended as a prediction.
Mason's misstep spawned a lockout meme, later joined by ''marathon session,'' ''mutant pizza'' and ''enormous consequences'' in the lockout lexicon. An N.B.A. blog, Outside the Arc, immortalized them in a lyrical tribute, put to the tune of Billy Joel's ''We Didn't Start the Fire.''
The last night was the longest. I filed an article announcing the lockout's end around 6:30 a.m. The sun was rising as a cab took me over the Manhattan Bridge. The New York Times was already on my stoop. The most surreal chapter in my N.B.A. reporting career had reached its weary conclusion.
With a vote by N.B.A. owners on Thursday afternoon, a sense of normalcy will return.
It is, finally, looking like a season. How u?

HEADLINE: Eyeing 2012, White House Presses Europe on Debt

BYLINE: By HELENE COOPER and ANNIE LOWREY; Helene Cooper reported from Washington, and Annie Lowery from Paris.

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. visited Prime Minister Lucas Papademos of Greece in his Athens office on Monday. Timothy F. Geithner, the Treasury secretary, hopscotched across Europe on Tuesday and Wednesday, urging leaders to address the European debt crisis more urgently. And President Obama has been on the phone almost every other week -- including on Wednesday -- with either Chancellor Angela Merkel of Germany or President Nicolas Sarkozy of France.
Publicly, Obama administration officials talk only about the economic consequences of a potential debt conflagration in Europe. Privately, though, they are well aware that Europe's success in dealing with the troubles -- and the administration's success in persuading them to do so -- is arguably the single most important factor that will determine Mr. Obama's re-election chances. 
The American economy has shown signs of life recently, with talk of a double-dip recession fading and job growth picking up. The change has raised the prospect that the economy may not be quite the political weight around Mr. Obama's neck in 2012 that his advisers had feared -- unless Europe goes downhill. Mr. Obama's aides realize that there is no easy way to plan a re-election strategy for one potential body blow: an implosion of the European currency. Such an event, experts say, would undoubtedly send the American unemployment rate higher and possibly induce another recession. Other than lobbying from the sidelines, Mr. Obama and his administration have little control over the situation.
''It's certainly true that Europe is the gorilla in the room when people look at how the economy could affect the election,'' one senior Obama adviser said, speaking on grounds of anonymity because he was not authorized to speak publicly. Added Edwin M. Truman, former adviser to Mr. Geithner: ''If the euro comes apart in a messy way -- and it's hard to imagine it will come apart in a nonmessy way -- it would make the fall of 2008 look like a clambake.''
And so it is, Mr. Truman and others said, that Mrs. Merkel and Mr. Sarkozy could have far more to say about who will be the next president of the United States than anyone thought.
For Mr. Obama, the change of fortune is stark. This is a president whose election was greeted in Europe with rapture; as a candidate, he visited both Mrs. Merkel and Mr. Sarkozy in the summer of 2008, where he received welcomes more fitting to World War II heroes -- including a speech at the Tiergarten near the Brandenburg Gate in Berlin and an arrival ceremony at the Elysee Palace in Paris. France would be ''delighted'' with Mr. Obama's election, Mr. Sarkozy gushed at the time.
Now, incongruously, it is Mrs. Merkel and Mr. Sarkozy who could play a part in whether Mr. Obama wins re-election. The president himself has called Europe the ''wild card'' in the domestic economic recovery and his aides have privately expressed frustration at what they view as a passive response from European leaders to the debt crisis. Obama administration officials say that leaning on European leaders to get their house in order, as the president has been doing, is in best interest of the United States, and not something that Mr. Obama is doing for his own political benefit.
Mr. Geithner is in Europe this week in advance of the latest European summit meeting on Thursday that is meant to, yet again, try to deal with the debt issue. In a hurried, five-city, three-day tour, meeting with heads of state, Europe's central banker and high-ranking economic officials, Mr. Geithner has quietly dispensed advice on the sovereign-debt crisis while pressing for decisive action for the good of the global economy.
Some prominent Europeans have bridled at what they consider the unsought American intervention. On Wednesday, Valery Giscard d'Estaing, the former French president, told Reuters: ''Geithner's visit is inopportune. He should not be meddling in European affairs.'' Cognizant, no doubt, of such sensitivities, Mr. Geithner has tried to chart a careful course in Europe this week, meeting behind the scenes, careful never to push or prescribe publicly, and so far taking only two questions from the news media. So far, European leaders have largely declined to yield to pressure from Obama administration officials who are advocating the same aggressive way that the United States responded to its own banking crisis in the fall of 2008 and through early 2009.
Frustrated Obama officials have been urging their European counterparts to move as much money as possible to prop up the debt of countries like Greece, Italy, Portugal and Spain. ''Ultimately, Europe will need to find a path that allows for stronger growth, but right now, the most important thing Europe can do for the global recovery is to manage this crisis successfully,'' Michael Froman, the deputy national security adviser for international economic affairs, said in an interview.
On Thursday in Brussels, Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton said: ''We have great confidence in Europe. There is absolutely no doubt about that. But we do need a plan to rally behind in order to know the way forward.''
Administration officials say that besides the potential for drying up demand in Europe for American goods and the looming potential of a European bank failure's setting off another financial debacle, the European crisis could stymie growth not only in Europe, but also in emerging markets.
Anxiety over what could happen across the Atlantic, coupled with earlier undue optimism about the domestic economic recovery, has the White House nervous about trumpeting even modest good economic news for fear of a later downturn.
Democratic campaign strategists concede that a collapse of the euro would transform the political dynamic even as some see the president's standing improving, enhancing the prospects of other Democratic candidates.
''It is absolutely an important assumption that if the economy really tanks, really tanks, as the result of strong headwinds coming from Europe, it would be a more challenging environment,'' said Representative Steve Israel of New York, the chairman of the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee.
While political analysts say Mr. Obama, as the incumbent, would bear the brunt of the political fallout of another economic crisis, some Republicans are fretting as well. At a Washington dinner party two weeks ago, David Smick, a Republican financial consultant, approached Karl Rove, the Republican strategist, with a provocative question. ''What if I told you that given what's happening in Europe, that whoever is president in 2013 might not see his party elected for another 30 years,'' Mr. Smick told Mr. Rove, according to guests who were present. Mr. Rove, one guest said, ''just listened.''
In an interview, Mr. Smick said that the European crisis, in his view, could eventually make another huge government bailout like the controversial bank rescue program of late 2008 and 2009 necessary. But most political analysts say that could be political suicide for the country's leaders. On Wednesday afternoon, Mr. Obama was on the phone with Mrs. Merkel again. ''As usual,'' the White House said in a statement afterward, ''the president expressed his appreciation for the efforts the chancellor and other European leaders are making to resolve the crisis.''

 CORRECTION:
This article has been revised to reflect the following correction: An article on Thursday about the effects of Europe's debt crisis on elections next year in the United States misidentified the venue in Berlin where then-Senator Barack Obama spoke in 2008 while running for president. His speech was at the base of the Victory Column in the Tiergarten, a sprawling park in the center of the city -- not at the nearby Brandenburg Gate.

HEADLINE: Free Money for the Packers

BYLINE: By JEFFREY GOLDFARB and AGNES T. CRANE

 BODY:
The Green Bay Packers are on some kind of streak. The venerable football team has followed up last year's Super Bowl victory with 12 consecutive wins to start this season. It is now parlaying the local exuberance into an unconventional investment achievement.
Fans are being offered a rare chance to own a piece of the 92-year-old Packers. Shares are $250 apiece, with funds going to help improve the home stadium, Lambeau Field. It's only the fifth time stock has been made available for purchase. Yet, regardless of how many championship trophies the Packers may collect, it won't make a lick of difference to shareholders. 
Buyers get voting rights, an invitation to an annual meeting and a certificate suitable for displaying in the den. But the Packers pay no dividends and shares can't be sold for profit or otherwise. They can only be transferred to immediate family members.
Still, if the Packers sell all 250,000 shares to Cheeseheads, as the team's fans are known, it will raise nearly $63 million at no cost. Too bad the United States government -- and European ones, for that matter -- can't finance budgets this way, issuing zero-coupon perpetual securities, as Breakingviews suggested in an April Fool's prank in 2006.
Fans also have to pay a $25 handling charge on share purchases. They'll get no extra access to tickets, and the National Football League technically can fine owners for certain bad behavior like publicly criticizing the team or for betting on games.
But Packers stock shouldn't be completely booed out of town. Though buying it amounts to a donation, the structure at least gives proud fans a tangible stake in the local champs. And while Packers shares can't go up, they also can't really go down. Of the 1,253 stocks in the Nasdaq composite index since the last time the team sold shares some 13 years ago, about half have declined in value, ignoring dividends.
The famed Packers coach Vince Lombardi once said that if it didn't matter who won or lost, then why keep score? As far as investing goes, the team has found a nifty way around the problem.
For a More Open Fed
The Federal Reserve is working to improve its communication regarding monetary policy. But its important role as a crisis lender is also now in the spotlight. The Fed chief, Ben Bernanke, would get less flak if it managed this message better as well.
On monetary policy, the central bank has pledged to keep interest rates near zero for at least two years and is taking big policy steps aimed at getting the economy off the floor. The Fed's public relations strategy has developed accordingly, with Mr. Bernanke now hosting news conferences after some decisions on interest rates. Next year, the central bank is expected to reveal more about how it approaches its mandate to keep both inflation and unemployment down.
But the Fed also serves as the lender of last resort for the banking system -- and, most recently, as the wingman for the European Central Bank and other monetary authorities when the dollar is in short supply in their jurisdictions. It's a crucial role that keeps money flowing when the system would otherwise seize up.
Yet, it took a court order in support of an effort pioneered by Bloomberg to get the Fed to divulge details of the emergency lending it conducted during the 2008 crisis. Even then, Mr. Bernanke left it up to the press and the public to interpret the data it eventually provided.
A figure of $1.5 trillion actually measures the peak of Fed lending in December 2008. That's hardly small change, but Bloomberg calculated a much higher total -- $7.77 trillion -- based on the aggregate of all the lending limits and guarantees the Fed provided during the financial crisis, many of which were only partly used. Other news outlets ran with the larger number, sometimes misrepresenting it as the cash actually lent out by the Fed. That would be a full order of magnitude more than the controversial $700 billion Troubled Asset Relief Program, which had required Congressional approval.
The misunderstanding and the subsequent back-and-forth have left Mr. Bernanke on the defensive. An independent central bank that can act as a lender of last resort when liquidity dries up is a vital safety net. The Fed needn't be shy about making that case.

HEADLINE: White House Pushes Vote On Consumer Agency Chief

BYLINE: By EDWARD WYATT

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- The White House has undertaken an extraordinary push this week to promote the confirmation of a director for the new Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, despite signs that Senate Republicans will not budge from their vow to block any nomination to the post unless Democrats agree to overhaul the agency's structure.
''Does anyone here think the problem that led to our financial crisis was too much oversight of mortgage lenders or debt collectors?'' President Obama asked his audience during a speech on Tuesday in Kansas. To amplify that message, White House officials in recent days have conducted several briefings with reporters and arranged special access for print and television journalists from seven states where the administration thinks it might sway moderate Republican senators to break ranks. 
The goal is to get the necessary 60 votes on Thursday to end Senate debate on the nomination of Richard Cordray, a former attorney general of Ohio, to be the consumer agency's first director. Forty-five of the 47 Senate Republicans signed a letter in May vowing not to allow a vote unless Congress was given more oversight of the agency, including budgeting authority.
The consumer bureau, a legislative response to the predatory mortgage lending practices that many critics think were partly responsible for the financial crisis, was established as part of the Dodd-Frank financial regulatory act, which was signed into law in July 2010.
The law gives the consumer agency authority over nonbank financial companies that were barely regulated, if at all -- entities like payday lenders, credit reporting agencies, mortgage companies and debt collectors. Those institutions have been accused of preying on lower-income families, prodding them into mortgages with escalating interest rates, charging high rates of interest for short-term loans and using abusive debt collection methods.
The law vests that power in the agency's director, however, rather than the agency itself -- a departure from normal bureaucratic structure. After the law was enacted, the inspectors general of the Treasury Department and the Federal Reserve Board issued opinions saying the bureau could not assume its new powers without a confirmed director in place.
''It's not how we would have done it, to be sure,'' Neal Wolin, deputy Treasury secretary, said on Wednesday. ''But we knew from enactment that in order to get these additional powers there would need to be a director confirmed.''
Republicans, led by Senator Richard C. Shelby of Alabama, have said they think the agency is essentially unaccountable to anyone, including Congress, in part because it has the authority to set its own budget, drawing on money from the Federal Reserve and therefore not subject to Congressional appropriations.
Republicans have also pressed for the single director to be replaced with a board, much like those governing the Securities and Exchange Commission and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation. And the critics want to ease the ability of banking regulators to overrule any regulations drawn up by the consumer bureau that might interfere with the safety and soundness of the banking system.
''We support strong and effective consumer protection,'' Mr. Shelby and the other Republican senators wrote to Mr. Obama in May. ''The present structure of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, however, violates basic principles of accountability and our democratic values.''
White House officials and other supporters of the bureau maintain that there is plenty of accountability in the bureau's structure. The director must report to Congress on its activities twice yearly. There is a cap on its annual budget. And its rules can be overturned by a two-thirds vote of the Financial Stability Oversight Council, which includes the heads of the major financial regulators.
Several Democratic senators said Wednesday that the aims of their Republican colleagues were clearly out of step with the mood of the nation. Senator Robert Menendez, a New Jersey Democrat, accused Republicans of wanting to protect Wall Street rather than consumers.
The White House is specifically focusing on voters in Alaska, Indiana, Iowa, Maine, Nevada, Tennessee and Utah, hoping they will contact their senators and urge them to allow a vote on the nomination. On Thursday, Mr. Obama will be interviewed at the White House by local news anchors from Las Vegas, Indianapolis, Memphis and Portland, Me.
Senator Scott Brown, a Massachusetts Republican, did not sign the Republicans' May letter and has already said he will vote to end debate on Thursday. Senator Lisa Murkowski of Alaska, the other Republican who did not sign the letter, has not declared her position. A spokesman for her did not respond to an inquiry on Wednesday.
One of the moderate Republican senators from the target states, Susan M. Collins of Maine, is not biting, at least so far.
''I actually voted for the Dodd-Frank bill, but I am completely opposed to appointing a nominee to head this bureau until we correct the very serious structural flaws that are in the bill,'' Ms. Collins said. ''This has nothing to do with Mr. Cordray. He's clearly a qualified individual with a good reputation. It has everything to do with accountability for how money is spent in government.''
Carl W. Tobias, a law professor at the University of Richmond in Virginia, said the Republicans' strategy of denying an appointment because they dislike the way a law was structured carried a dangerous precedent.
''It's not typical and not very desirable in lots of ways,'' he said, ''because that would mean no legislation is good after the Congress that passed it.''
Without the 60 votes, Mr. Obama's options are limited. He can try for a recess appointment, but Congress has blocked that avenue before and could be expected to do so again. The White House could make some horse-trading promises in exchange for future support of some senators' favorite issues. Or it could agree to the structural changes that Republicans are seeking -- something Mr. Obama said Tuesday that he would never do.
''Consumers deserve to have someone whose job it is to look out for them,'' he said. ''I intend to make sure they do. And I want you to hear me, Kansas: I will veto any effort to delay or defund or dismantle the new rules that we put in place.''

HEADLINE: Time for a Vacation? Climate Change and the Human Clock

BYLINE: RACHEL NUWER


HIGHLIGHT: A study finds that over the last 30 years, peak attendance at national parks has moved forward by an average of four days -- seemingly in tandem with a rise in park temperatures. 

 BODY:
In the natural world, scientists have documented a vast range of shifts in biological behavior related to climate change, from birds laying their eggs earlier to bears emerging earlier from hibernation in time for the first blossom of spring. 
As it turns out, humans are not excluded from such behavioral changes. Over the last 30 years, a new study has found, peak park attendance has shifted by about four days, probably in response to climate change. 
The results may come as a surprise to some, said Abe Miller-Rushing, the science coordinator for Acadia National Park and the Schoodic Education and Research Center in Bar Harbor, Me., who was not involved in the study. "One of the main ways that people often think of climate change is affecting things that are far away," he said. 
Past studies have examined climate-related human behavior in terms of single events like droughts or floods. To the researchers' knowledge, this is the first study to examine behavioral response to temperature changes over a long period of time.

The study, published in the International Journal of Biometerorology, compared park temperatures and attendance records from 1979, when the parks first started keeping reliable attendance data, to those from 2008. Of nine parks experiencing significant increases in average spring temperatures, seven exhibited corresponding shifts in peak visitor attendance, said Lauren Buckley, a biologist at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill and lead author of the paper. 
"Although the public is still debating the occurrence of global warming, they're already changing their behaviors," she said in an interview.
Human behavioral shifts were comparable to those noted for other species. Of the nine parks with temperature increases since 1979, 78 percent recorded shifts in visitor rates and 71 percent of species at those parks have undergone behavioral timing changes in relation to rising temperatures.
Some shifts were more pronounced than others: at Grand Canyon National Park, July 4 was the peak attendance day in 1979, whereas June 24 was the peak in 2008. AtMesa Verde National Park, visitors peaked on July 10 in 1979 and on July 1 in 2008. 
Across the parks, the average shift was four days. 
Dr. Buckley also compared attendance at parks with notable temperature changes to attendance at parks without much change in temperature. The timing of attendance at the latter did not change much. (The study factored in other variables like travel costs.)
Dr. Miller-Rushing suggested that the warming trend could eventually lead parks to adjust their preparations for peak periods, including the hiring of seasonal employees. "As visitor season shifts, when those employees are hired or working would need to shift as well," he said.
Climate change could influence the timing of many types of vacations, from ski trips to autumn leaf viewing to bird watching, he noted. 
While the four-day shift in park visitation may not seem momentous, Dr. Buckley said, it does suggest that humans could be changing their behavior in other incremental ways that have not been researched. "There are probably more economically and socially significant events that might be shifting that we just don't have data for yet," she said. 
She has preliminary data to suggest that people are purchasing ice cream earlier in the year and that spring births are advancing. 
With all factors considered, Dr. Buckley concluded, "we are fairly confident that climate is having a role in shifting visitation."

HEADLINE: Consumer Bureau Is Taking Your Mortgage Complaints

BYLINE: ANN CARRNS


HIGHLIGHT: The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau has a new online form for consumer complaints about mortgages. 

 BODY:
The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau is now taking complaints about mortgageson its Web site.
The online form lets consumers choose a category from a drop-down menu, like problems in the application process or encountering difficulty making payments. It asks them to describe their problem in their own words, and to specify what they are seeking as a solution. Borrowers can also upload supporting electronic documents and submit them with the form. Once the complaint is submitted, the agency forwards it to the lender and gives borrowers a tracking number so they can monitor the progress of filing.
If you need help filling out the form, you can get help through an online chat function from 8 a.m. to 8 p.m. Eastern Time, Monday through Friday.
Home loans are likely to provide ample fodder for complaints. Arecent analysis suggested the country is not even halfway through resolving the foreclosure crisis.
The agency is moving ahead with this initiative even as its proposed director, Richard Cordray, a former attorney general of Ohio, is the subject of a contentious confirmation battle in Congress.
Mortgages are the latest category of complaints to be fielded by the agency, which opened for business in July. It first began accepting credit-card related complaintsand handled roughly 5,000 submissions in its first three months, according to an updatepublished last week. Companies reported resolving more than 3,100 of the complaints, with about 400 consumers, or 13 percent, disputing the adequacy of the response.
By the end of next year, the agency expects to handle complaints about all financial products and services.
Do you have a complaint about your mortgage? Let us know what you think of the bureau's online form.

HEADLINE: California Air Board Moves to Increase Presence of Zero-Emissions Vehicles

BYLINE: JIM WITKIN


HIGHLIGHT: The California Air Resources Board introduced a package of regulations that would mandate significantly higher numbers of the vehicles, as well as a more stringent smog standard. 

 BODY:
4:55 p.m. | Updated 
California has the worst air quality in the country, according to the state's air resources board, and 40 percent of the contributing pollution comes from passenger cars and light-duty trucks. In its effort to improve the state's air, the board, commonly known as CARB, proposed a package of new rules on Wednesday intended to cut vehicle emissions while aggressively increasing the number of advanced clean cars on the state's roads, as well as fueling stations to serve them.
The package, called the Advanced Clean Cars program, would apply to light-duty vehicles manufactured from 2015 to 2025. It combines four sets of related standards that were previously tracked separately by the agency: greenhouse gas limits, the Zero Emission Vehicle (ZEV) mandate, the Low Emission Vehicle (LEV-III) program and the newly created Clean Fuels Outlet regulation.
Combining these standards in a single program should simplify rule making and compliance, and help the state reach its greenhouse gas targets, officials said. In a 2005 executive order, Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger established a goal to bring greenhouse-gas emissions in 2050 to 80 percent below their levels of 1990.
Among the proposed rules are revised mandates requiring automakers to produce increasing numbers of zero-emission vehicles for the 2018-2025 model years. Currently, the board defines ZEVs as battery electric, hydrogen fuel cell and plug-in hybrid electric vehicles.
The new ZEV proposal would oblige automakers doing business in the state to devote 15.4 percent of their fleet to zero-emission vehicles by 2025. At this level of production, one in seven new vehicles sold in 2025 would qualify as zero emission, according to the board's estimates. From 2018 to 2025, this mandate would put 1.4 million new clean cars on the road. ZEVs would need to comprise 87 percent of the on-road fleet by 2050 to meet greenhouse gas targets set in the 2005 executive order.
Additionally, stringent new smog standards would require all passenger cars and light trucks sold in California to reach the state's super-ultra-low emission vehicle, or SULEV, standards by 2025. The measure is intended to reduce emissions of nonmethane organic gases and nitrogen oxides, which contain the principal smog-forming pollutants.
If approved by the state's Office of Administrative Law, the new package of regulations would be enacted into law in 2012, according to a board spokesman, Stanley Young. Mr. Young wrote in an e-mail that he would expect other states to follow California's recommendations on greenhouse-gas standards and ZEV mandates, as they had done in the past.
If enacted into state law, the board estimates that 2025-model-year cars would produce 34 percent fewer greenhouse gas emissions on a fleet-wide level compared to 2016 models, the last year for which standards were in place. The new standards would eliminate 52 million tons of these emissions by 2025, the equivalent of taking 10 million cars off the road, Mr. Young said.
But at least one environmental group has already suggested that the state's proposal did not go far enough.
After reviewing a summary of the regulations that were available in mid-November, the Union of Concerned Scientists issued a statement describing the package as "impressive progress," while qualifying that the ZEV mandates would need to be more aggressive to reach the 2050 clean-air goals. The group is pushing for a 30 percent increase in these mandates, which would effectively put 1.8 million zero-emission vehicles on the road by 2025, it said.
Mr. Young noted that a public comment period would begin on Dec. 12 and run through Jan. 26, allowing any interested party to comment on the new regulations. All comments will be posted on CARB's Web site for review.

HEADLINE: New N.B.A. Deal Is Expected to Be Approved Thursday

BYLINE: HOWARD BECK


HIGHLIGHT: Owners and players are working to ratify a new labor agreement for the N.B.A. 

 BODY:
The second-longest labor crisis in N.B.A. history is expected to reach its conclusion Thursday afternoon, with a vote to adopt a new collective bargaining agreement.
N.B.A. owners are meeting at 2 p.m., Eastern, at a Manhattan hotel to review the deal, which transfers $300 million a year from the players to the league and places new restrictions on contracts and payrolls. Although some owners wanted more concessions, ratification is expected.
Commissioner David Stern is expected to announce the deal in a news conference in the late afternoon or early evening.
The players' approval process is also underway, via electronic balloting. Voting began at 6 p.m. on Wednesday and will conclude at 4 p.m. Thursday.
Assuming both sides ratify the deal, training camps and free agency will open Friday. Signings and trades will be permitted starting at 2 p.m., creating a potentially chaotic first day for N.B.A. teams, as new players arrive by the hour.
The 2011-12 season, which was supposed to start Nov. 1, will begin on Christmas Day, with five nationally televised games. Teams will play a compressed 66-game schedule, with the regular season ending one week later than originally planned.
The owners and players reached a tentative deal on Nov. 26, ending a 149-day standoff. Only the 1999 lockout -- which lasted six months and resulted in a 50-game season -- was longer.
Owners were seeking economic relief and competitive balance in the new deal. The first goal proved easier to achieve than the latter.
Two N.B.A. stars, Chris Paul and Dwight Howard, are pushing for trades to bigger markets, echoing the drama that saw Carmelo Anthony force his way from Denver to New York last season. On Thursday, Shane Battier - one of the league's best defenders - announced via Twitter that he would be joining the Miami Heat.

HEADLINE: Field Notes From This Year's Application Season

BYLINE: REBECCA R. RUIZ


HIGHLIGHT: A handful of college counselors from across the country shared with The Choice their observations on this year's application season, noting that student interest in public institutions has heightened, as has interest in getting in applications well ahead of deadlines. 

 BODY:
To get an on-the-ground glimpse of this year's admissions cycle, The Choice reached out this week to a handful of college counselors across the country to hear what trends they had been observing.
While our survey was unscientific, it brought into focus some themes, including increased applicant interest in public colleges - both in and out of state - and an apparent rise in the number of students who have been filing applications early this year, sometimes at the prodding of the colleges themselves.
As Kelly Sortino, director of college counseling at Crystal Springs Uplands School, a private school near San Francisco, wrote in an e-mail:
We're definitely seeing an increase in ED [binding early decision] applications this year (almost double from previous years...it's almost 1/3 of the senior class and 1/4 of those students have an EDII option already selected.) Over all, we are seeing a surge of other early applications as well. 60 out of our 63 seniors submitted some sort of early, priority or rolling application in October and November.
Ms. Sortino also noted that more students at Crystal Springs applied to out-of-state public schools, perhaps due to "the questionable state of the University of California system," perhaps because of the generally favorable economics of attending a public institution over a private one.
Phillip Trout, college counselor at Minnetonka High School in Minnesota, noted that students' early application filings have been largely motivated by some universities' aggressive encouragement that they act ahead of general deadlines.
"Public universities are urging students to apply early (right away), like in September!" he wrote, pointing out that "the 'earlier and earlier' pitch is even being used by Harvard and Princeton."
He quoted Harvard's Web site:
'Regular Action candidates apply by Jan. 1 and receive notification by April 1. While the final deadline is January 1, it would be very helpful to us to receive your application by Dec. 15 so that we can create your admissions file as early as possible.'
Like Ms. Sortino at Crystal Springs Uplands, Richard Tobin, director of college counseling at Greenhills High School in Ann Arbor, Mich,, reported that student interest in public institutions had grown.
"Our number of applicants to the University of Michigan is the highest ever," he wrote, continuing:
We will likely have a few more applicants to Michigan still (deadline of Feb. 1), but about 70 of our 90 seniors have met Michigan's Early Action deadline (with the institution's promise to respond on Dec. 23). Our number of applicants to Michigan State is up as well, and we're seeing some more applications to other public institutions in the state.
In Philadelphia, Daniel Evans, director of college counseling at William Penn Charter School, also emphasized the high proportion of students who took early application action this fall. He wrote:
85-90% of the seniors applied Early (ED and / or EA), and most of the remaining 10-15% submitted application(s) in September, October or November under Rolling or Priority options. All of this created a first trimester that was a blur for my colleagues and me. On the other hand, the majority of students will have some decision(s) in hand before the new year.
Mr. Evans of Penn Charter reported that the heightened early application activity had increased the need for "expectation management" and counseling regarding how to navigate the complex web of restrictions surrounding early applications for those filing a mix of early decision, early action and rolling applications.

HEADLINE: State Taxes Rise Across the U.S.

BYLINE: CATHERINE RAMPELL


HIGHLIGHT: The period from July to September was the seventh straight quarter of year-over-year growth in state tax revenues, helping states struggling with budget shortfalls. 

 BODY:
State tax revenues rose last quarter compared with a year earlier, according to preliminary data from the Rockefeller Institute of Government at the State University at Albany. This was the seventh straight quarter of growth, and is happy news for states struggling with budget shortfalls in the wake of the Great Recession.
Total state revenues were up 7.3 percent from their level during the same period last year. The biggest gains were in personal income tax revenue, which rose 9.2 percent year over year.
The Rockefeller Institute collected tax data from 48 early-reporting states, and found that all but three reported total revenue increases. 
North Dakota had far and away the fastest growth in percentage terms, with tax revenue there rising 157 percent compared with a year earlier. Alaska had the second-fastest growth, at 124.4 percent. Both benefited significantly from higher oil and mineral prices, which drove up severance tax revenues.
At the other end of the spectrum was Delaware, where total tax revenues fell by 13.8 percent year over year.
Click the interactive map above to see how each state fared, and choose from the pull-down menu to see which categories of taxes fluctuated most. States that are blank either did not collect a given category of taxes (e.g., Florida doesn't have a personal income tax) or have not yet reported their numbers.

HEADLINE: A Somber New Year's Eve for Solar?

BYLINE: MATTHEW L. WALD


HIGHLIGHT: Companies brace for the expiration of a Congressional fix that preserved an investment tax credit for solar power installations. 

 BODY:
While renewable energy advocates have long argued that government subsidies for the sector are dwarfed by those for more traditional energy industries, they have had a more poignant complaint since the onset of the recession: one of the subsidies they do get, an investment tax credit, has been rendered nearly useless by the general business downturn.
Congress stepped in with a temporary fix, but it expires at the end of the year, which may make solar executives' New Year's Eve parties a bit melancholy. The industries are pressing for an extension, but with Congress deadlocked on higher-profile tax issues like the payroll tax cut, prospects are highly uncertain.
At issue is a complicated provision of the tax code called Section 1603, which is actually a modification of an earlier subsidy program.
Thomas P. Kimbis, a spokesman for the Solar Energy Industries Association, gave this example: a company installs a rooftop solar array that cost $100,000. Under the system that existed before the recession, the company is entitled to a $30,000 tax credit, meaning that it can subtract $30,000 from the amount it owes in federal tax in the year that the system is put in service.
But when the recession hit, profits dropped. The company finds it does not owe $30,000 in taxes and therefore has no way to use the credit.

One solution is to sell the tax credit to another company that does owe the $30,000. But typically that company will buy the credit only at a discount, so that the federal Treasury loses the full $30,000 but the company that put in the solar equipment gets, say, $25,000 or $27,000. Also, the number of companies in the market to buy such tax credits has dropped sharply.
So when the recession set in, Congress changed the rules; beginning in 2008, it allowed the Treasury to pay the $30,000 to the company that made the investment regardless.
"It's all about reducing upfront costs," said Rhone Resch, the executive director of the solar organization. (In the solar industry, nearly all the costs are upfront, since there are no fuel costs.)
The 1603 program applies mostly to commercial solar installations, including utility installations. It does not apply to rooftop systems owned by homeowners, which come under a separate program, but it does apply to home rooftop systems if they are owned by a third party, as is increasingly the case.
Mr. Resch spoke on Thursday at a meeting with reporters that included representatives of the hydrogen fuel cell industry, the biomass industry and the cogeneration industry. Tax credits to those industries vary, but the 1603 program converts credits for all those industries into cash payments.
The problem is that Congress was trying to tide the industries over during what it hoped would be a short recession, so it set up the program for two years. Then it renewed the program for a year. That third year is up on Dec. 31.
The renewal effort may be handicapped somewhat by the fate of Solyndra, which received a $535 million federal loan guarantee from the Department of Energy and then went bankrupt. But advocates of the 1603 program emphasize that it is structured differently from the loan guarantee program: it is for projects that produce energy, not manufactured goods, and the government pays nothing until the project is in service.
James Warner, the director of policy at the Fuel Cell and Hydrogen Energy Association, said there was precedent for extending a tax policy: the farm bill is technically an extension, every four years, of one passed in 1949.
Mr. Warner, Mr. Resch and others spoke in a conference room where a December calendar was on the wall. Big hand-drawn X's were over each expired day, and "23 days left" was written at the bottom. But realistically it's probably more like 10 days, because Congress is certain to go home before Christmas.
On Wednesday, 34 members of the Senate signed on to a letter calling on Senate leaders to work to extend the provision, and 88 members of the House signed a parallel version. More than 700 companies and 34 trade associations signed another letter. "This is a full-court press,'' Mr. Resch said.
Still, extending the tax credit would cost the Treasury somewhere in the neighborhood of $1.3 billion at a time when Congress is particularly worried about money. And there is some opposition to government support for renewable energy.
In addition, the renewal effort is off to a late start because almost everyone was waiting for the so-called supercommittee to lay out its grand bargain on taxes and spending before Thanksgiving, then the panel's deliberations fizzled.
Now the logical place for the provision is in a larger tax bill that may be delayed into early next year. Mr. Resch said it might be delayed even longer, into a lame-duck session after the elections of November 2012. That would doom a large number of projects, hurting companies that supply equipment, manufacture components or are branching out into the renewables field from areas like electrical contracting or roofing, he said.
The wind industry, meanwhile, is focusing on a different cutoff. The production tax credit, the benefit that the 1603 program converts to a tax grant, is in place for solar until 2016, but the one for wind expires at the end of next year. That means that to collect, wind farms have to be in service by the end of December 2012.
It is already too late to embark on a new project and finish it by then, wind industry experts say, so their credit has effectively expired. They are lobbying for extension of the underlying credit, not for the 1603 program.
An earlier version of this post quoted James Warner as saying that a farm bill was an extension of one originally passed in 1935. He later wrote in to correct himself, saying the farm bill was first passed in 1949.

HIGHLIGHT: Canada says tightrope walker Nik Wallenda can't cross Niagara Falls. 

 BODY:
It looks like the tightrope walker Nik Wallenda won't able to cheat death at Niagara Falls, at least not the way he originally proposed - on 1,800 feet of cable between the American and Canadian sides. On Wednesday, Canada said no. Its Niagara Parks Commission rejected Mr. Wallenda's request, in keeping with its 100-year history of rejecting daredevil acts at the falls.
Lawrence Downes, a member of the Times editorial board and our special circus-issues correspondent, was saddened by the news:
The commission was unmoved by Mr. Wallenda's insistence that the stunt would be an economic windfall, particularly for the sad little city of Niagara Falls, N.Y., which had joined the New York State Legislature and Gov. Andrew Cuomo in telling Mr. Wallenda - Yes, please, by all means, do it - so eager were they to bring free money to western New York.
But no. "Stunting is not the means to create long-term economic investment," said the Canadians, to whom responsible stewardship of the safety and beauty of the falls includes casinos, wax museums, an animated dinosaur exhibit and a Ferris wheel.
Oh, come on, said Mr. Wallenda - how can you say no to 60,000 tourists spending $20 million? He was even offering to pay expenses, including the cost of the helicopter to fish out his battered corpse if he fell.
He says he might go over the commission's head, appealing to the Ontario tourism minister and its premier. Barring that, he says he might string a cable over the American Falls, entirely in the United States.
If he does, Canadians may just have to look away. Things will surely be hopping at the New Year's Eve celebration sponsored by the Niagara Parks Commission. It will feature the Sheepdogs, Saskatoon's international rock phenomenon, and the punk group Simple Plan, which the commission hailed diplomatically on its Web site as "one of Canada's most prolific bands." Simple Plan is world-famous in Canada for albums like "Still Not Getting Any " and "I'd Do Anything."
Make your reservations now.

HEADLINE: Americans Got Much Poorer Last Quarter

BYLINE: CATHERINE RAMPELL


HIGHLIGHT: Americans got much poorer last quarter, as their collective household net worth suffered the biggest decline in three years. 

 BODY:
Americans got much poorer last quarter, as their collective household net worth suffered the biggest decline in three years.
The total net worth of American households and nonprofit groups fell by $2.4 trillion in the third quarter of this year, according to a new report from the Federal Reserve. That was a decline of 4.1 percent compared with the second quarter.
Wealth declined primarily because the financial markets did poorly. Americans saw big drops in the value of their assets like corporate equities (stocks), corporate and foreign bonds, mutual fund shares and pension fund reserves.
Household real estate assets also suffered, falling in value by $98.3 billion (0.6 percent) from the previous quarter, in nonseasonally-adjusted terms.
Partially offsetting the decline in assets was a smaller decline in household liabilities as families continued to cut back on debt, with the decline in mortgage debt more than offsetting the increase in consumer credit.
Don't break out the Champagne just yet, though. Total debt for the United States -- that is, also including corporate and government debt -- hit another all-time high because government borrowing is still outpacing the rate at which households shed debt.
Guess who will ultimately pay back that government debt: American households.

BYLINE: DAVID BROOKS


HIGHLIGHT: The life reports are in. Meet Byron R. Wien. 

 BODY:
My life has turned out so much better than I ever thought it would that I only wish it could go on forever. I am 78 years old and still working full time in a demanding job with considerable travel and I enjoy every minute of it. I have had a lot of bad breaks and good luck along the way. First, timing is everything, and I was born in Chicago during the Depression when fewer people had children, making it easier to get into a good college and get a good job. As for the first bad break, I was a teenage orphan. My father was a doctor, but he died when I was nine and my mother when I was fourteen. They both had weak hearts from childhood rheumatic fever. During the last two years of my mother's life her unmarried sister came to live with us as a caregiver, and after my mother's death the two of us moved to a smaller, less expensive apartment in the same neighborhood so I could continue at the same inner city high school. My father's insurance provided enough money for rent and food, but at fifteen I went to work every day after school as an office boy for a company in downtown Chicago to earn some spending money so I could live a reasonably normal life.
In the fall of my senior year I was summoned to the principal's office, which was never a good thing. The principal wasn't there, but the guidance counselor was. He asked me if I owned a suit and I told him I did. He then asked me if I had ever heard of Harvard and I told him I did. He told me that Harvard was looking for smart kids from public high schools to balance the many private school kids in the student population. Harvard had written to my school asking them to send one student to talk to an admissions officer who would be traveling to Chicago. He then said, "You're our pick, and when you go down there, don't make a fool of yourself."
I went to Harvard and it changed my life. I was interested in science and that was my area of concentration, but I never intended to pursue a career in the field. I wrote for and liked that. In the beginning I felt like an outsider at Harvard. I was a nerdy middle class Jewish kid from a public school and not likely to be asked to join a final club. The during the 1950s was a true meritocracy, where any day you could find some future major journalist like Jack Rosenthal, David Halberstam or Tony Lukas. It was a pressured but stimulating refuge and I learned a lot there. When I was a senior I realized I wasn't trained for anything and had to go to graduate school. I spent a few days at the Medical, Law and Business schools. Only the latter interested me. I fell asleep in a law school class, which I interpreted as a bad sign. I enrolled in the Business School and focused on marketing, thinking I would work in advertising where I could do some writing.
I got a job in an advertising agency, but didn't like it. I went into the Army for two years and when I got out I took a job with a management consulting firm. They had a project in Nigeria that nobody wanted to do, but the idea of going to a relatively unknown African country appealed to me and I have been interested in the Third World ever since. My next job moved me to New York, where a Business School classmate remembered me as a smart kid and invited me to join his small but successful investment management firm. I was to be a security analyst but I had no training for this. Initially I did poorly and was almost fired. Eventually I developed the necessary skills and became a partner of the firm. The lesson here is that you shouldn't try to decide what you want to do for the rest of your life when you are a teenager. Pursue your passion in college and the rest of your life will take care of itself.
In 1984 Morgan Stanley offered me a job as U.S. Strategist. The job involved writing a weekly essay and traveling around the world (at the time I had never been to Asia) to see clients. It was perfect for me, but I never thought about seeking it out. When they approached me they said that the research department, the firm management and the sales force had decided I would be perfect for the job; I later found out I was the seventh person they had wooed with that line. When giving career advice to young people, I tell them there is a perfect job out there for everyone, but most people never find it. Keep looking. I worked at Morgan Stanley for 21 years and now I have a similar role at Blackstone where I advise the firm and its clients on social, economic and political trends. I have been to China five times in the past two years, the Middle East twice, Latin America once, and Europe many times, as well as all over the United States.
My first marriage ended in divorce. I have been married for 33 years to Anita and we have many common interests. While I have had no children (a regret) I have eight godchildren and several nephews, many of whom I am close to. My first wife was a school teacher during the day and didn't want to have to deal with kids at night as well. Anita had not been married before and felt she was too old and too involved in her successful career for motherhood.
I have had five jobs, two of which I took because they were attractive financially. Both of those turned out to be mistakes. The jobs I took because I thought they would be enjoyable turned out to be extremely rewarding financially as well. This is ironic because I took a pay cut in both cases when I joined the firms. I have made more money than I ever thought possible and now spend part of my time trying to give it away effectively.
I still ski, play tennis, sail and make love, although my skills at all of these have deteriorated. We have a home in the Hamptons where on weekends we cook and read. I am at an age when my friends are dying around me and that inspires me to make every remaining minute count. I still wake up each day with enthusiasm and hope that continues until the end of my life.
In my job I'm expected to understand what is happening in the world and to identify secular change. It seems clear that the United States and Europe are mature, overleveraged economies with dysfunctional governments. Since growth will be slow, unemployment will be high and the standard of living for many people will decline. Opportunities for young people will be fewer than the ones I could take advantage of. There will be more social unrest. I was born in the Depression and lived through the glorious years for America after World War II. The future for these born now is not so bright.
When my parents died, I decided God was not looking out for me and pulled away from organized religion. I had a reasonable amount of religious training in my youth. I do not attend church or synagogue and give little thought to spiritual matters. This does not seem to detract from my enjoyment of life.
Not having children is one regret, as I said. Another is that I am estranged from my older brother to whom I loaned a large amount of money when my financial circumstances were marginal. He never paid it back and lied to me throughout the process. We talk only on our birthdays.

HEADLINE: Stress Test Reveals European Banks Need More Capital

BYLINE: LIZ ALDERMAN


HIGHLIGHT: European regulators told many of the region's biggest banks, including Deutsche Bank and Commerzbank, to raise more capital, as signs mount that the European sovereign debt crisis may worsen. 

 BODY:
8:59 p.m. | Updated 
European regulators on Thursday told many of the region's biggest banks, including Deutsche Bank and Commerzbank, to raise more capital as signs mounted that the European sovereign debt crisis might worsen.
With the region's leaders gathering in Brussels in their latest bid to shore up the euro, the European Banking Authority announced that over all, banks needed to raise 114.7 billion euros ($152.7 billion) in the event the debt crisis was not resolved soon. That was more than the estimate of 106 billion euros in October.
The banking authority's assessment showed that banks in Germany, Italy and Spain would have to raise more capital than previously thought, while banks in France had all they needed. In all, the stress tests showed that 31 of 71 banks needed stronger reserves.
Bank shares took a hit on Thursday. Commerzbank was down 9.5 percent, Deutsche Bank was off 4.3 percent and UniCredit was down 7.2 percent.
The banking authority came under fire earlier this year for conducting tests in which it did not consider the possibility that one of the 17 countries using the euro might default. Bowing to pressure, the regulators took into account potential losses on the vast amounts of bonds banks hold from troubled European governments in the latest tests.
American banks hold smaller amounts of European sovereign debt. But the Federal Reserve is also planning new tests to gauge the ability of banks in the United States to weather any further deterioration in Europe, which appears to be on the cusp of a recession.
The crisis has become a concern for President Obama, who has warned it could impact the country's economic recovery. The Treasury secretary, Timothy F. Geithner, visited several European capitals this week, urging leaders to address the debt crisis more urgently.
The banking authority's test results came after the European Central Bank introduced new support for Europe's banks, which have been having trouble getting other financial institutions to lend them money amid an erosion of confidence. More European banks have had to rush to borrow from the central bank recently to help finance their operations, a process the central bank said it would now make easier.
With their financing squeezed, some banks could face trouble raising new capital. Already, BNP Paribas, Societe Generale, Commerzbank and other giants have said they will sell assets to raise new money. A number of banks have claimed that the capital requirements will force them to cut lending to businesses and consumers - a step that will further depress Europe's teetering economy.
Mario Draghi, the president of the central bank, expressed concern Thursday that the tougher standards for banks could prompt them to stop making loans, creating a squeeze on credit.
While the additional capital "should improve the euro-area banking sector's resilience over the medium term," he said at a news conference, "it is essential that national supervisors ensure that the implementation of banks' recapitalization plans does not result in developments that are detrimental to the financing of economic activity in the euro area."
In response to fears that banks will curtail lending, regulators expanded the definition of reserves to include contingent capital, which is borrowed money that automatically converts to equity in a crisis. That concession should make it easier for banks to meet the requirements.
Banks are also restructuring their debt to bolster their reserves. Some financial firms are buying back or exchanging hybrid securities in a complex maneuver that allows them to improve their capital levels without raising additional money.
"There's no magic bullet to this problem," said Karl Goggin, a banking analyst at NCB Stockbrokers in Dublin. He said banks had three options to raise capital: tap private investors, sell assets or turn to their government.
"Most will turn to the first two options, but some will have to consider state aid," he said.
The test of 71 banks revealed new problems in Germany, where banks will have to raise new capital totaling 13.1 billion euros ($17.4 billion), more than twice the amount thought just a month ago. Deutsche Bank, the country's largest lender, will need to raise 3.2 billion euros ($4.26 billion), while Commerzbank must increase its reserves by 5.3 billion euros ($7 billion).
The German Finance Ministry said on Wednesday that it planned to propose legislation to revive the government fund it used in 2008 to rescue banks to help banks increase their reserves. In a break from previous practice, the government will be able to force banks to accept aid.
Banks in Spain must raise 26.2 billion euros ($35 billion). The nation's banking giants, including Grupo Santander, are considering asset sales to supplement their capital. The banking authority has said Italian banks must raise 15.4 billion euros ($20.5 billion).
For years, banks in Europe and the United States loaded up on the bonds of euro zone governments. Regulators encouraged banks to buy more by deeming the bonds risk-free, based on the assumption that no sovereign nation in the euro zone would ever default.
The banking authority's assessment on Thursday underscored how those assumptions had been shattered, especially as the sovereign crisis swirled to Italy and larger countries.

HEADLINE: NYSE Euronext and Deutsche Borse Consider Deal Options

BYLINE: MARK SCOTT


HIGHLIGHT: The $9 billion merger could be in jeopardy if European anti-trust authorities force more concessions from the exchanges, including the potential sale of the company's lucrative derivatives businesses. 

 BODY:
LONDON -- The $9 billion merger between Deutsche Borse and NYSE Euronext could be in jeopardy if European anti-trust authorities force more concessions from the exchanges, including the potential sale of the company's lucrative derivatives businesses.
Regulators have raised concerns that the pending merger would reduce competition in the fast-growing exchange derivatives sector. The financial firms already have announced the sale of some of their overlapping businesses, but said they may not continue with the deal if regulators demand further concessions.
"We want to pursue the transaction, but not at all costs," Deutsche Borse chief financial office Gregor Pottmeyer said in a statement late on Wednesday. "Antitrust conditions should not be allowed to endanger the industry and economic logic of this transformational merger."
The European Commission has until Jan. 23 to make a decision about the merger, but officials have been in close discussions with the firms in recent weeks, according to people familiar with the talks.
In response to the European Commission's initial demands, the companies in November agreed to concessions that they hoped would seal the merger. NYSE Euronext said it would sell its pan-European single equity derivatives units, except the options businesses in its home markets. Deutsche Borse also said it would divest similar operations.
The companies added they would give rivals access to Eurex Clearing, a clearinghouse for derivatives products, to offset regulatory concerns that the pending merger would lead to uncompetitive practices.
The companies, though, remain adamant that the European Commission should approve the merger. 
"European authorities have a stark choice to make," said a person briefed on the matter. "It can allow the transaction to proceed that will free up $4 billion of capital when things are coming apart at the seams in Europe, or it can let the deal fall through."
Regulators have centered their attention on the competition issues within the exchange-traded derivatives sector. Yet William Rhone, a senior analyst at financial consulting firm TABB Group in New York, said the real competitive issues lie in the so-called over-the-counter market, dominated by many of the world's largest investment banks, that still represents the majority of derivatives trades in Europe. 
Under new global regulatory proposals, these opaque deals are being forced to use clearing houses -- financial intermediaries that guarantee trades if one side defaults -- and to trade on exchanges.
"The NYSE Euronext and Deutsche Borse is an attractive proposition that will allow them to compete with the oligopoly of the OTC dealers," Mr. Rhone said. "It's that market, not the exchanges, where the debate about competition should be."

 BODY:
In which we bring you motoring news from around the Web:
 Sergio Marchionne, the chief executive of Chrysler and Fiat, said in an interview with Reuters that Fiat Group's primary product push in North America would come in 2013. "The big year for us, for a variety of reasons, is 2013," Mr. Marchionne said, noting that the company intended to reintroduce Alfa Romeo that year, and that the most substantial renewal of the conglomerate's product portfolio would happen in 2013. He also discussed the coming Dodge Dart compact sedan, which, according to Automotive News, would achieve 40 miles per gallon in highway driving and be offered eventually with a 9-speed automatic transmission developed by ZF. The Dart is scheduled to have its debut in January at the 2013 Detroit auto show. (Reuters Insider)
 Ford is grooming a Europe-derived replacement for its long-running Econoline van, to be called the Transit. The van is undergoing testing on a purpose-built course at the automaker's proving grounds in Michigan. Ford claims that the Econoline's replacement, which is based on the Transit model sold in Europe, would achieve a 25 percent improvement in overall fuel economy and be 300 pounds lighter than Econolines of similar dimensions.

HEADLINE: Catskills Deal for the New York City Watershed

BYLINE: MIREYA NAVARRO


HIGHLIGHT: A $5.6 million sale of a 1,200-acre parcel of pristine forest just east of the Belleayre Ski Center in the Catskills is said to restrict development and storm water runoff into the New York City watershed. 

 BODY:
An important state acquisition in the Catskill Park in New York is finally being completed four years after the purchase was brokered under Gov. Eliot Spitzer's administration.
The $5.6 million sale of the land, a 1,200-acre parcel of pristine forest just east of the Belleayre Ski Center, would restrict development and storm water runoff into the New York City watershed. The deal results from an agreement reached by the state, New York City, several environmental groups and the Crossroads Ventures real estate group in 2007. 
The agreement allows for future construction of a downsized private development project known as the Belleayre Resort at Catskill Park as well as an expansion of the state's Belleayre Mountain Ski Center.

The property will be added to a state forest preserve protected under the state constitution, officials with the New York State Department of Environmental Conservation said.
The department's commissioner, Joe Martens, the acquisition "preserves a major undeveloped geographic feature of the scenic Route 28 corridor in the heart of the Catskill Park." 
"The completion of this acquisition protects the Catskill Park while allowing economic growth in the area," he said.

HEADLINE: A Question for Newt Gingrich

BYLINE: SIMON JOHNSON


HIGHLIGHT: Newt Gingrich has not yet explained in any detail how he would rein in the biggest banks or what his ties to Wall Street are, an economist writes. 

 BODY:
Newt Gingrich has surged in recent polls and now has a chance to establish himself as the front-runner in the Republican presidential primaries. But as Mr. Gingrich ascends, he will need to answer a difficult question: What is his policy for Wall Street's too-big-to-fail banks?
This a pertinent issue for all American voters in 2012 - both for the primaries and for the general election. It speaks directly to who wins and who loses in American society and why). 
It is also a question that Mr. Gingrich is likely to be asked during the Republican debate on Monday, perhaps in the context of Europe's financial problems (the planned topics for the debate between Mr. Gingrich and Jon Huntsman are national security and foreign policy). 
Mr. Gingrich's career path creates a number of potential vulnerabilities around this issue.

No doubt Mr. Gingrich will seek to deflect the issue - as he did on Oct. 11, during a previous debate, when in response to a Wall Street-related question he said, "If you want to put people in jail, you ought to start with Barney Frank and Chris Dodd." 
This was a crowd-pleasing one-liner - Representative Frank and former Senator Dodd have their names attached to the financial reform legislation of 2011, and bashing that bill is standard Republican rhetoric.
But Mr. Gingrich will find it difficult to avoid the substance of this issue for much longer for a simple reason: Mr. Huntsman has figured out that breaking up megabanks is both sensible economics and good Republican primary politics. 
Mr. Gingrich claims to be the true conservative, but the awkward - for him - truth is that on all issues related to the financial sector, Mr. Huntsman has the conservative high ground. He understands that "too big to fail" is not a market, it's a government subsidy program, and that these subsidies are large, hidden, unfair and incredibly dangerous. 
As I explained last week, Mr. Huntsman is drawing on deep thinking around these issues by some of the most serious intellectuals on the right of the American political spectrum. He is also tapping into the deep and articulate resentment in the American nonfinancial sector; people who run the businesses that generate most of the jobs in the United States fully understand that the current structure of Wall Street does not serve us well.
So it will be hard for Mr. Gingrich to respond adequately on substance. As Mr. Huntsman told Bloomberg News, speaking of other presidential candidates more broadly: 
They want to be able to point out the deficiencies in front of some crowds, but they want to take money from the banking sector. They're not going to get contributions from the banking sector if they're specific about how they want to remedy the situation.
Mr. Gingrich was reported to be in New York this week, seeking to raise a lot of money quickly. It seems reasonable to presume that much of the available quick money is close to the heart of Wall Street.
Mr. Gingrich will also have to address the issue of whose money he took while speaker of the House in the mid- to late 1990s. This was a period in which big banks were pushing hard for the repeal of Glass-Steagall - the last remaining restrictions on what they could do and, effectively, on their scale. 
Mr. Gingrich may argue that it was the Clinton administration that argued forcefully for full financial-sector deregulation, and there is some evidence that is so. But there was also a bipartisan consensus around the issue and, as far as I can ascertain, Mr. Gingrich was a central part of that.
There was an intense debate on details during Mr. Gingrich's tenure, and a great many campaign contributions entered the fray. I have not yet seen a detailed analysis of what Mr. Gingrich received and what he oversaw - and from whom. Presumably such information will be forthcoming as his candidacy advances. 
Mr. Gingrich could, of course, now turn his back on megabanks - and brand them a dangerous form of European lemon socialism (socialized losses; private gains). He did say something vaguely along these lines in 2010.
But this is not the time for vagueness or generalities. Mr. Huntsman has a specific, detailed financial overhaul program that offers the most plausible way forward for forcing the big banks to become substantially smaller and also safer. I've discussed this approach with leading experts, both on the right and on the left, and my assessment is that these are the most ambitious and most sensible proposals we have seen from any politician.
Mr. Gingrich has no such plan - at least not on his Web site or elsewhere in the public domain.
So, Mr. Gingrich, do you agree that too-big-to-fail banks should be broken up, as Mr. Huntsman has proposed? What are your detailed, specific proposals for how to do this? Will you endorse Mr. Huntsman's plan?

HIGHLIGHT: Political news from today's Times, plus a look at what's happening in Washington. 

 BODY:
In Today's Times:
With no plans to let up on Mitt Romney, President Obama's campaign operatives are increasingly focused Mr. Romney's foremost rival, Newt Gingrich, as polls show him leading the Republican presidential field, Jeff Zeleny and Jim Rutenberg report.
A month out from the Iowa caucuses, Mr. Romney is trying to draw a distinct line between himself and Mr. Gingrich by contrasting their marriages, relationships with Washington and religious devotion, Michael Shear reports.
 Treasury Secretary Timothy F. Geithner is shuttling around Europe pressing its leaders for action on the continent's debt crisis, a move that underscores the risks the situation poses to the American economy and President Obama's re-election, Helene Cooper and Annie Lowrey write.
 The Republican candidates promised Jewish voters on Wednesday that they would take an approach favorable to Israel in Mideast peace talks, but Richard A. Oppel, Jr. writes that the candidates' rightward tilt on other issues important to Jewish voters may limit their appeal.
The bruising fiscal battles that defined the first session of the 112th Congress are giving way to lawmakers' efforts to amass political capital ahead of the 2012 election, Jennifer Steinhauer and Robert Pear write.
To the gatekeepers of the Obama administration, it is no matter that the mounds of State Department documents released by the anti-secrecy organization Wikileaks remain available online. Scott Shane explains that the administration still considers some of the information to be secret, a position that those who advocate government transparency say is absurd.
A federal judge in Illinois sentenced former Gov. Rod R. Blagojevich to a 14-year prison term for 18 felony corruption convictions, counts that include trying to sell or trade President Obama's former Senate seat, Monica Davey reports.
Two Democratic operatives who served President Bill Clinton have moved their rivalry from Washington to Hollywood, where both have characters modeled after them in dark political dramas about winning elections at all costs, Adam Nagourney writes.
Happening in Washington:
President Obama will meet with the Democratic leadership of the House before taping a round of regional television interviews. In the evening, he will speak at the White House's Hanukkah reception.
At 9:30 a.m., Attorney General Eric H. Holder Jr. will testify before a House Judiciary subcommittee with oversight of the Justice Department.
At the same time, the House Agriculture Committee will examine the bankruptcy of MF Global. The panel has subpoenaed the company's former chief executive, Jon S. Corzine, who used to be governor of New Jersey.
Economic data expected today include jobless claims at 8:30 a.m. and weekly mortgage rates at 10, simultaneous with the Labor Department's annual snapshot of work experience for 2010.

HEADLINE: Live Blog: House Panel Hearing on MF Global

BYLINE: ERIC OWLES


HIGHLIGHT: Jon S. Corzine, the former chief of MF Global, is appearing before the House Agriculture Committee on Thursday to answer questions about the collapse of his brokerage firm. The panel began at 9:30 A.M. 

 BODY:
 Jon S. Corzine, the former chief of MF Global, is appearing before the House Agriculture Committee on Thursday to answer questions about the collapse of his brokerage firm and the disappearance of up to $1.2 billion in customer money. The panel began at 9:30 A.M.
4:47 P.M. | Corzine Is Dismissed
This concludes our live blog coverage. The final group includes a food company industry representative, financiers and regulators. 

        
John Fletcher of the National Grain and Feed Association, a food company representative.
        
Terrence Duffy of the CME Group, the major exchange where MF Global did business.
        
William J. Brodsky of the Chicago Board Options Exchange, one of MF Global's regulators.
        
Dan Roth of the National Futures Association, a self-regulating group for the futures industry.
        
Stephen Luparello of the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority.
        
Gerry Corcoran of the Commodity Markets Council, a trade association.
Their prepared testimony is available on the House committee's web site.
4:43 P.M. | Where the Buck Stops
"The buck stops here," Mr. Corzine told Representative Renee L. Ellmers, Republican of North Carolina. "On that score," he added.
Ms. Ellmers questioned Mr. Corzine about his relationship with Mr. Gensler since their time together at Goldman Sachs. Mr. Corzine said they were not in contact on a frequent basis.
4:39 P.M. | Confusion Over Regulators
Representative Reid J. Ribble, Republican of Wisconsin, asked about the number of regulatory agencies. "Can we regulate greed, incompetence and fraud out of existence?"
Mr. Corzine allowed that the brokerage firm's collapse may have been due instead to poor judgment. "Mistakes will continue to happen in the course of human events."
4:34 P.M. | Questions on Corzine's Ties With Democratic Regulators
Representative Tim Huelskamp, Republican of Kansas, questioned Mr. Corzine about his meetings with the regulators.
Mr. Corzine said he did not have separate conversations with Mr. Gensler. 
"You're very close to the administration," Mr. Huelskamp said. As a generous campaign bundler did you meet with anyone in the administration?
Mr. Corzine said he never discussed MF Global with anyone in the Obama Administration.
4:29 P.M. | Addressing the Farmers
Asked how he would address farmers who have lost money in MF Global, Mr. Corzine said he could not offer specific advice. 
"This process of seeking to find these funds is one that absolutely needs every resource possible," Mr. Corzine said.
4:22 P.M. | Grading the Rating Agencies
Representative Scott R. Tipton, Republican of Colorado, asked Mr. Corzine about how the rating agencies grades of the brokerage. Mr. Corzine allowed that in hindsight they were not appropriately rated.
"Everyone felt an obligation to get the books reconciled," Mr. Corzine said.
Mr. Corzine on the European sovereign debt investments: "With the analysis and the perspectives on how those particular sovereigns were looked at we thought they were prudent investments."
4:16 P.M. | Corzine Declines to Speculate
Representative Austin Scott, Republican of Georgia, thanked Mr. Corzine for answering as many questions as he had.
Mr. Corzine said he didn't want to speculate on when the commingling of funds first occurred.
4:11 P.M. | An Increase in Risk
Representative Jean Schmidt, Republican of Ohio, cited a Bloomberg News report suggesting that Mr. Corzine had increased the company's risk. "At some point you had to know there wasn't enough money." Ms. Schmidt said. 
She asked if he was hiding the risk of MF Global's investments in Europe. Mr. Corzine said the information was public.
"Why were you so confident about these bets?" Ms. Schmidt asked.
They were less risky because financing was in place, Mr. Corzine said.
"Sitting here today," Mr. Corzine said, "it would have been better to have taken different judgments."
4:05 P.M. | Appetite for Risk
Representative Terri A. Sewell, Democrat of Alabama and a former securities lawyer, asked Mr. Corzine about the company's appetite for risk before and after his arrival. The former MF Global chief said it stayed "pretty much" at the same level.
4:00 P.M. | The Role of J.C. Flowers
Representative Jeff Fortenberry, Republican of Nebraska, repeated his question for regulators: who owned MF Global? I'd like to understand the whole interconnections here, he said. "Who hired you?"
Mr. Corzine said the board member from J.C. Flowers suggested his name when the previous chief of MF Global stepped down.
What we have here is inordinate risk-taking, Mr. Fortenberry concluded.
3:52 P.M. | Investing Overseas
Representative Joe Courtney, Democrat of Connecticut, asked about the impact of the new C.F.T.C. rules and repurchase agreements.
Mr. Corzine repeated the portion of the rule about allowing the investment of funds overseas from foreign currency-denominated deposits.
3:47 P.M. | 'We're Not the Prosecutors'
Representative K. Michael Conaway, Republican of Texas, opened with a question about Mr. Corzine's involvement in segregated funds. 
The former MF Global chief said a problem would have been brought to his attention. Mr. Corzine said he did not personally place orders.
Mr. Conaway asked when Mr. Corzine first took steps to protect the company from a liquidity risk. Mr. Corzine said the plan was to rely on undrawn credit lines held in reserve.
There was never any intent in my language or actions, Mr. Corzine said.
I understand why you're using the word intent, Mr. Conaway said. "We're not the prosecutors."
3:39 P.M. | Find That Money
Representative David Scott of Georgia opened with much harsher statements than other Democrats. Mr. Corzine immediately focused his answers on MF Global's board of directors.
Mr. Corzine said there was never any direct intent to co-mingle customer funds with proprietary funds. He also denied that he stood in the way of increased C.F.T.C. regulations.
"Mr. Corzine, we got to find that money," Mr. Scott said.
3:32 P.M. | The Best Intentions
Mr. Corzine told Representative Randy Neugebauer, Republican of Texas, that he never "intended" to authorize anyone to tap into segregated funds.
"So the answer is you don't know whether you did or not," Mr. Neugebauer said.
The Texas congressman questioned Mr. Corzine about his relationship with the Fed, a not-so-subtle reference to the former Democratic lawmaker's ties to the Obama administration. 
3:26 P.M. | Listen to Your Mother
Mr. Corzine said he upheld the motto of Representative Dennis Cardoza's mother to always behave properly when no one was watching.
Mr. Corzine said that he was with his chief financial officer when he first learned about the missing customer funds and that his first instinct was to recheck the numbers.
3:20 P.M. | And Now We Turn to New Jersey
Representative Steve King, Republican of Iowa, pushed harder on Mr. Corzine than the Democratic congressman from Iowa. Mr. King questioned why MF Global would invest in specific European countries.
Mr. Corzine said investments were not made with the belief that Greece would be bailed out.
Mr. King then questioned the former governor of New Jersey about budget shortfalls in the Garden State. Mr. Corzine said his former state treasurer has already responded to those numbers.
3:15 P.M. | Boswell Asks for a Message
Representative Leonard Boswell, Democrat of Iowa, asked Mr. Corzine what lawmakers should say to their constituents who have lost money in MF Global. 
Mr. Corzine said he hoped that the missing funds would be found. There is no question that futures markets and securities markets are essential for the United States economy.
3:12 P.M. | Replacing Missing Funds
Representative Timothy V. Johnson, Republican of Illinois, called for Mr. Corzine to commit his personal fortunes to replacing the missing customer funds. 
Mr. Johnson also asked why Mr. Gensler wasn't recused from oversight of MF Global earlier. He chastised Mr. Corzine for negligence, co-mingling or abnegation of his responsibility.
3:07 P.M. | Looking for More Precision
Representative Tim Holden, Democrat of Pennsylvania, questioned Mr. Corzine about the documents he claims he requires to be more precise in his answers and quickly yielded back his time.
3:05 P.M. | An Agreement on Confusion
Representative Bob Goodlatte, Republican of Virginia, began with questions about Mr. Corzine's role in overseeing customer funds. The congressman went over the timeline of when the former MF Global chief became aware of the missing funds.
Mr. Corzine blamed it on a miscalculation in "the last few hours and last few days."
Mr. Corzine and Mr. Goodlate agreed on one thing. They are confused about the reports in the public sector.
2:59 P.M. | Hitting the Buttons
Mr. Corzine said he was not aware of customer funds being transferred to the broker commodity. There was no intention on my part to violate the segregation rules, he said.
Mr. Corzine declined to name individuals who should have directly managed the transfer of funds. He said he didn't know who would have ultimately have hit the buttons.
2:50 P.M. | Recess Is Over
Mr. Peterson is questioning Mr. Corzine now about the missing customer funds.
2:11 P.M. | Corzine's Responses
Mr. Corzine has responded to all the questions posed by Mr. Lucas and Mr. Peterson, but his answer is often that he lacks the proper documents. The former MF Global chief has not pleaded the Fifth, but so far he has not answered questions as directly as lawmakers may have liked. We are still waiting for the panel to resume.
1:57 P.M. | Beware Roving Lawmakers
@kaylatausche Kayla Tausche
Don't worry - am okay! Congressman just walked in front of shot, caught my mic cord and brought me down to the ground! #OccupyCongress
Thu Dec 8 18:47:07 via Kayla Tausche
1:37 P.M. | So Many Titles, So Little Time
Mr. Peterson began his inquiry asking Mr. Corzine about his title. "Governor, senator, I don't know exactly what to call you," he said.
A lot of people have bad names, Mr. Corzine responded.
Mr. Lucas warned that the panel would break soon for a series of votes.
1:27 P.M. | Questions for Corzine Begin
"Is there a shortfall in the customer funds that MF Global was legally required to keep segregated?" Mr. Lucas asked.
"I know only what I read," Mr. Corzine said.
Mr. Lucas's next line of questioning was more direct. He asked why Michael Roseman, the chief risk officer of the company, was warning about the MF Global's exposure to European debt.
Mr. Lucas then focused on reports that Mr. Corzine threatened to leave the firm if the board did not trust his judgments. 
1:15 P.M. | Corzine Points Toward MF Global's Board
@m_delamerced Michael de la Merced
Corzine putting some responsibility for the RTM trades on #mfglobal board. All "independent, sophisticated" directors.
Thu Dec 8 18:14:24 via Michael de la Merced
"I simply do not know where the money is," Mr. Corzine said.
1:09 P.M. | Corzine Begins His Prepared Testimony
Mr. Lucas began by asking Mr. Corzine to stand for the administering of the oath and asking if he had the right to counsel. Mr. Corzine then began reading from his prepared testimony.
"Like all of you, I am devastated by the enormous impact on many people's lives resulting from the events surrounding the MF Global bankruptcy. Of course my distress and sadness pale in comparison to the losses and hardships that customers, farmers and ranchers and others, employees and investors have suffered. Their plight weighs on my mind every day."
"As the chief executive officer of MF Global at the time of its bankruptcy, I truly apologize to all those affected."
1:05 P.M. | The First Panel Is Dismissed
Mr. Corzine, a former Democratic senator from New Jersey, is up next.
His prepared testimony is available on the House committee's web site, but it offers little insight into the missing money. DealBook has noted the .
It appears he will try to place some of the blame for collapse of the brokerage firm on his predecessors.
1:00 P.M. | A Call for More Reporting on Segregated Funds
Representative Christopher Gibson, Republican of New York, asked about the daily segregated reports. Ms. Sommers said that with the C.F.T.C. already examining MF Global they were able to monitor events over the weekend before the brokerage declared bankruptcy. 
12:40 P.M. | More on the Missing Funds
Mr. Kobak on the difficulties in locating the missing customer funds:
All of the property is held in foreign locations and foreign administrators. Experience tells me it will be a longer process than it is domestically, Mr. Kobak said.
The trustee is taking all the steps he can take, "but that might mean going to litigation," Mr. Kobak explained. Insolvency rules in some parts of the rules don't always work the way they do in the United States.
12:34 P.M. | Gensler, Gensler, Gensler
Representative Tim Huelskamp, Republican of Kansas, joined a list of lawmakers who have peppered Ms. Sommers about Mr. Gensler's absence. Congressmen continue to tie Mr. Gensler to Mr. Corzine, via Goldman Sachs.
12:15 P.M. | Lessons Still Being Learned
Representative Henry Cuellar, Democrat of Texas, asked for lessons learned that would change regulation policies. Ms. Sommers said it may be too soon to answer that question, but that better protection is needed for customer funds. "We don't yet have all the facts," Ms. Sommers said.
12:13 P.M. | More Money Possible for MF Global's Customers
Mr. Kobak said he is asking the bankruptcy court tomorrow for permission to distribute more money to MF Global's customers.
11:55 A.M. | Can We Get the C.T.F.C. a Digital Subscription?
Questioned about DealBook's coverage of MF Global, Ms. Sommers said that "I'm not familiar with the article."
11:39 A.M. | Gensler Comes Under Attack Again
Representative David Scott, Democrat of Georgia, also criticized Mr. Gensler for recusing himself and asked about Mr. Corzine's ability to influence the C.T.F.C. MS. Sommers deflected the question with an explanation of the tougher constraints that were passed on Monday.
"First of all I find it very unacceptable that Commission Chairman Gensler is not here," Mr. Scott said. "That he has recused himself. That is has gone out of the country at the very time that we're faced with the largest - the eight largest bankruptcy in the history of the United States on a firm that comes under his oversight."
11:27 A.M. | We're Back in Session
... with more questions for the first panel.
11:15 A.M. | In Other Financial Regulatory News
President Obama is set to speak at 11:30 AM in the White House briefing room to address his attempts to push a vote this week on the confirmation of a director for the new Consumer Financial Protection Bureau.
10:45 A.M. | We're in Recess
In her final statement, Ms. Sommers told Representative Dennis Cardoza, Democrat of California, that financial companies were not engaged in transactions that were too complex for the C.F.T.C. to understand, but that "it's just tracing the amount of different accounts and the transactions from one place to the other."
Ms. Sommers said she was unsure when regulators would find the money.
"We can't over emphasis the complexity of MF Global's books and regulators," she said, adding that "at the end of the day, we'll know."
- 
10:26 A.M. | Criticism of Goldman Sachs
Representative Timothy V. Johnson, Republican of Illinois, attacked "the Goldman Sachs fraternity" and questioned why Gary Gensler, chair of the C.T.F.C., had recused himself from the inquiry. Mr. Gensler and Mr. Corzine are former employees of Goldman Sachs.
"Is that because he's part of this whole same Goldman Sachs fraternity that includes ministers of foreign governments in which the money's invested, Mr. Corzine himself, Mr. Gensler himself, and this whole nebulous group of individuals?" Mr. Johnson asked. "Is that why he's decided to recuse himself, because he's part of that group, or why did he do that?"
"I do not know," Ms. Sommers said.
10:19 A.M. | Criticism of Regulators
Lawmakers want to know whether MF Global's watchdogs were asleep. Ms. Sommers replies that the C.F.T.C. the "is not the front line regulator." That job belongs to for-profit exchanges like the CME Group.
- 
10:13 A.M. | DealBook Gets a Shout-Out!
 Mr. Peterson mentions our story about investigators suspecting that MF Global transferred some customer money to JPMorgan in Britain. Mr. Peterson wants to know whether JPMorgan was responsible for verifying the legitimacy of the funds.
Mr. Peterson:
On November 29, the New York Times, there was an article by Ben Protess and Azem Ahmed about how some investigators suspect that there was a transfer of some $200 million from MF Global to J.P. Morgan Chase in Britain. And it may have been the first major misuse of customer money it was reported. It's also said that the authorities are looking into whether J.P. Morgan initially questioned the source of this cash and sought proof of MF Global that it was complying with regulations.
- 
10:06 A.M. | The Questions Begin
"It has become clear that there were warning signs at MF Global in the weeks, if not months leading up to the bankruptcy, increased exposure in foreign sovereign debt, increased leverage, insufficient capital. Was the C.F.T.C. aware of these warning signs?" Mr. Lucas asked Ms. Sommers. The question reveals the complexity of the regulatory structure over MF Global. We will see a number of other regulators whose agencies oversaw the failed brokerage in the third panel today.
There's no real way to overemphasize the complexity this, Ms. Sommers said.
9:45 A.M. | Panel One: The Witnesses
Mr. Corzine is scheduled to appear in the second panel today. 
First up is Jill E. Sommers, a Republican commissioner with the C.T.F.C. who is leading the inquiry in the absence of the agency's head. Also testifying is James Kobak, a lawyer for the trustee overseeing the liquidation of MF Global's brokerage unit.

RT @n23mc: We should ask, "Should SIPC cover futures accounts like they do equity accounts?" What do you think? // What's everyone think?
Thu Dec 8 14:42:54 via Michael de la Merced
9:41 A.M. | The Hearing Has Begun
"I'd like to make it clear that our intention is not to sensationalize the events that have unfolded," said Representative Frank Lucas, Republican of Oklahoma and the chairman of the House Agriculture Committee. Mr. Lucas the primary goal should be to return the missing customer money.
The opening statement from the ranking Democrat reveals that lawmakers are already looking beyond today's hearing. "Given what happened here, we should probably be talking about strengthening Dodd-Frank, not weakening it," said Representative Collin Peterson, the ranking Democrat.
Mr. Peterson took a swipe, "It appears to me that nobody has learned a thing from what's gone on here; that Wall Street is operating as if 2008 never happened."

9:31 A.M. | Police Shielding Corzine
@kaylatausche Kayla Tausche
There was also a wall of 3 police officers shielding him from the press, though a few of us stuck our mics out anyway. #Corzine#MFGlobal
Thu Dec 8 14:30:32 via Kayla Tausche
9:29 A.M. | Tracking Other Investigations
Congress is not alone in seeking the missing customer funds. The Commodity Futures Trading Commission is leading the search, but the trustee overseeing the liquidation of MF Global's brokerage unit is also hunting for the $1.2 billion. Last week, Gary Gensler, the head of the C.T.F.C. removed himself from the inquiry following questions about his ties to Mr. Corzine, his former boss at Goldman Sachs. "Now, the worry is that the commission will stumble in its rare turn on center stage without its star leading the way," Ben Protess and Azam Ahmed reported.
The Federal Bureau of Investigation is separately examining a potential criminal case. Mr. Corzine has not been accused of any wrongdoing by law enforcement.
9:28 A.M. | Live Video Has Begun
It's not the most exciting video in the world, but you can watch people entering the room now on C-SPAN.
9:25 A.M. | Other Congressional Subpoenas
Today's hearing won't be the former senator's last trip to Capitol Hill. The Senate Agriculture Committee issued a subpoena for Mr. Corzine to testify at a Dec. 13 hearing. The oversight subcommittee of the House Financial Services Committee will will hold a hearing on Dec. 15.
9:24 A.M. | Corzine Is in the Building
@kaylatausche Kayla Tausche
Corzine just entered around a back hallway. Said nothing, holding coffee and folder of papers. #MFGlobal
Thu Dec 8 14:24:13 via Kayla Tausche
9:21 A.M. | Why the Agriculture Committee?
Some DealBook readers have asked why Mr. Corzine is appearing before the Agriculture Committee instead of the Financial Services Committee. As Ben Protess reported, "customers of the brokerage firm included farmers and agriculture companies, as well as hedge funds and other investors."
9:11 A.M. | 10 Questions for Corzine
Mr. Corzine has stated that he will try avoid using of his Fifth Amendment right against self-incrimination. If he responds to today's inquiries then lawmakers may want to look over the list of questions compiled by DealBook columnists Steven M. Davidoff and Peter J. Henning.
For example, "why did you feel the need to personally trade for MF Global instead of having a trader or trading group do it? Who did you speak to structure and monitor this trade, particularly since you were preoccupied with running this entire business?"
9:05 A.M. | A Preview of Today's Tone
On Dec. 1, the Senate Agriculture Committee questioned MF Global's regulators about the firm's collapse. That panel may provide a preview of what we can expect today.
9:00 A.M. | Corzine's Prepared Testimony Is Made Available
The House Agriculture Committee has posted all of the prepared testimony on their web site.
DealBook reports that Mr. Corzine "is expected to defend his decision to invest heavily in European sovereign debt, saying in his first public appearance since the firm filed for bankruptcy that he was "stunned" by the huge shortfall in client funds."
"Considering the circumstances, many people in my situation would almost certainly invoke their constitutional right to remain silent - a fundamental right that exists for the purpose of protecting the innocent," Mr. Corzine said in prepared testimony. "Nonetheless, as a former United States Senator who recognizes the importance of congressional oversight, and recognizing my position as former chief executive officer in these terrible circumstances, I believe it is appropriate that I attempt to respond to your inquiries."
"I remain deeply concerned about the impact that the unreconciled and frozen funds have had on MF Global's customers and others," he said in the written testimony.

HEADLINE: The Breakfast Meeting, Dec. 8

BYLINE: NOAM COHEN


HIGHLIGHT: Political operatives go Hollywood, Romney goes to Iowa (through Fox News), charities go soft-sell and Medvedev goes there on Twitter. 

 BODY:
Adam Nagourney writes about Jay Carson and Chris Lehane, two former Democratic operatives in Washington who serve as the models for political consultants in different Hollywood movies. The Carson-inspired character was at the heart of "The Ides of March," directed by George Clooney; Mr. Lehane is a writer and producer of "Knife Fight," slated for release early next year, which also focuses on a political consultant. Both worked for President Bill Clinton, Mr. Nagourney writes, and "not surprisingly, each movie has an older male candidate who has sexual relations with an intern." But more generally, he writes that the movies "go beyond the usual Hollywood glorification of political consultants, offering dark and at times unsettling accounts of what is done in the name of winning elections."

        
"If there were a Fox News primary, Mitt Romney would be losing it," Michael Shear , based on the most recent New York Times/CBS News poll of Republicans in Iowa. Newt Gingrich, the former House speaker, gets the support of nearly half of the Fox News watchers, while just 12 percent of the regular Fox watchers said they would vote for Mitt Romney, the former Massachusetts governor, in the Iowa caucuses next month. The Fox News bloc is sizable: nearly 40 percent of those Iowa Republicans surveyed said they get most of their news from the channel. (On that note, Mr. Romney has agreed to appear on "Fox News Sunday with Chris Wallace" on Dec. 18 interview, his first Sunday morning interview in roughly 20 months.)

        
Politico sets the stage for what it calls the "alpha dog" debate. While G.O.P. encounters this primary season seemingly blurred one into the other (when Donald Trump wasn't the scheduled host, that is), Politico writes that Saturday's ABC News/Des Moines Register debate at Drake University will stand out as "the first to reflect the new campaign order now that the GOP race has narrowed to a two-man contest between Gingrich and Romney."
The official Twitter account of Russia's president, Dmitri Medvedev, reposted an obscene message directed at political opponents of the Kremlin. Retweeting such a crude message "appeared to run contrary to Mr. Medvedev's image as an educated, Twitter-savvy leader," Reuters wrote. He has more than 700,000 followers on Twitter. The Kremlin confirmed that an "improper retweet" had appeared on the account and said an unidentified official was to blame. "The guilty will be punished," it said in a statement, Reuters reported.
Charities are trying the soft-sell this holiday season, Elizabeth Olson reports, when as much as half of donations can occur. The American Red Cross, citing a survey that found that despite a struggling economy, consumers say they will keep up charitable giving, has introduced a claymation figure called Fred. "Instead of the guilt-laden approach, we are trying a new visual identity that is approachable and friendly," said Peggy Dyer, chief marketing officer for the American Red Cross. Similarly, she writes, Oxfam America has introducing a "cheeky animated video featuring the actress Scarlett Johansson."
The Styles section looks at how customer service has changed at L.L. Bean. In addition to the 3,600 employees who answer customers' phone calls, "a 10-member team was recently created to interact with customers on social media platforms like Facebook and Twitter," writes Susan Q. Stranahan from Lewiston, Me. She quotes Terry Sutton, a senior vice president for e-commerce at the company, who notes the special skills that are needed now that complaints can be broadcast via social-networking: "We are quite used to dealing one-to-one with our customers, but this takes it to a whole new level."
Howard Beck described his recent assignment in a Reporter's Notebook for Sports: 156 hours in some of New York's finest hotels, where "I did not sleep, or shower, or earn rewards points." He was covering the N.B.A. lockout, which ended Nov. 26 with a new labor agreement that is expected to be ratified on Thursday. Twitter and text-messaging connected him to the fans who cared about every twist and turn, he writes.
During one late-night session at the Waldorf-Astoria, I heard from a Twitter follower in Australia. He was just getting out of work. My friend David Aldridge of TNT said he received Twitter responses from six continents that night. Everywhere but Antarctica, where I'm guessing the Wi-Fi is a little sketchy.

HEADLINE: Corzine Testifies on Capitol Hill

BYLINE: THE NEW YORK TIMES


HIGHLIGHT: The former senator testifies on the collapse of the financial firm he led. 

 BODY:
Jon S. Corzine, the former Democratic senator from New Jersey, is back on Capitol Hill, but this time as a witness, not a politician. Mr. Corzine, also the former head of Goldman Sachs and a former New Jersey governor, had been called to testify Thursday morning about his most recent role as the former head of MF Global Holdings, a brokerage firm whose collapse in October stemmed from the European debt crisis.
As our colleagues over at Dealbook write, Mr. Corzine "is expected to defend his decision to invest heavily in European sovereign debt, saying in his first public appearance since the firm filed for bankruptcy that he was 'stunned' by the huge shortfall in client funds." Read more about his appearance, and the prepared statementon DealBook, and check back for live blog updates when the hearing begins Thursday morning.

HEADLINE: Ballet Meets Colbert in Unusual Pas de Deux

BYLINE: JULIE BLOOM


HIGHLIGHT: David Hallberg, an American who has joined the Bolshoi Ballet, appeared on "The Colbert Report." 

 BODY:
"I was worried; what if I can't fire back?" David Hallberg said about his pre-show jitters before appearing Wednesday night on "The Colbert Report" on Comedy Central. The dancer, the first American to join the Bolshoi Ballet on a full-time basis, shouldn't have worried.
Despite Stephen Colbert's accusations that Mr. Hallberg was "Benedict Arnold in slightly tighter pants," the dancer gently reminded him that "the cold war's over." He went on to discuss his decision to leave the United States for Moscow to pursue his dreams in dance. "I love a challenge, I love risk," Mr. Hallberg said. Mr. Colbert responded: "There's nothing risky or challenging in the United States? Dance on fire. Do the 'Firebird' on fire."
Though Mr. Hallberg held his own in the interview portion, the same could not quite be said for Mr. Colbert during the performance part of the show. Mr. Hallberg danced an excerpt from American Ballet Theater's production of "The Nutcracker" with Hee Seo, a soloist with the company. Performing on flooring the show had installed for the dancers, Mr. Colbert, in his suit jacket and black tights and ballet slippers, soon joined in -- mimicking Mr. Hallberg's jumps and tours en l'air and briefly partnering Ms. Seo. At the end, snow fell from above and, in Bolshoi tradition, the audience threw 200 roses at the performers' feet.
(Before the interview and dancing, Mr. Hallberg warmed up with battement kicks backstage while Mr. Colbert interviewed the South Carolina Democratic Party chairman, Dick Harpootlian, about adding a referendum on corporate personhood to the Republican primary ballot.)
In the green room after the show Mr. Hallberg, 29, said he was happy to have been on. "I feel like Colbert's viewers are my contemporaries," he said. "This is a chance to show them the dedication dance requires and this is a valid art form."
He said he hadn't given Mr. Colbert too much advice except: "He was entering like a little weasel. When you enter from off camera, you need to present yourself."
He added he was happy to be stateside but was eager to return to Moscow. "I can't wait to get back," he said. "Moscow doesn't scare me anymore. I'm finding parts of the city I love. I'm so fulfilled."

HEADLINE: Huntsman Lashes Out At Romney and Gingrich

BYLINE: MICHAEL D. SHEAR


HIGHLIGHT: Jon Huntsman on Thursday accused his two leading rivals of being part of a Washington culture that is destroying trust with Americans. 

 BODY:
Jon M. Huntsman Jr. on Thursday accused his two leading rivals for the Republican presidential nomination of being part of a Washington culture that is destroying trust with the American people and blocking solutions to the nation's biggest problems.
In an interview with The Caucus, Mr. Huntsman, a former governor of Utah, said that electing Newt Gingrich or Mitt Romney to the presidency would add to the cynicism that people feel about politics and Washington.
"We don't need a lobbyist in chief. And we don't need a panderer in chief. We need a commander in chief," Mr. Huntsman said. He said the people "don't have lobbyists. They don't have attorneys. They don't have representatives on Capitol Hill."
Mr. Huntsman's comments came just hours before he delivers a speech that his aides are calling his "closing argument" in which he will urge a large-scale reform of the federal government as a way of restoring trust in Washington. Mr. Huntsman has struggled in national polls, but he has improved some in New Hampshire, where he is focusing all of his attention.
According to a copy of the speech obtained by The Caucus, Mr. Huntsman also lashes out at Mr. Romney and Mr. Gingrich as "no better" than President Obama when it comes to breaking faith with the American people. 
Mr. Romney, a former governor of Massachusetts, "will say anything to earn the voters' trust," Mr. Huntsman plans to say.
Mr. Gingrich, the former House speaker, "participated in the excesses of our broken and polarized political system," Mr. Huntsman will say in the speech. 
In the interview, Mr. Huntsman said that he would support whichever Republican becomes the nominee. But he made clear that he will not shrink from attacking his fellow Republicans in the final few weeks before voting begins.
"If you are in the hip pocket of Wall Street, you are not going to talk about 'too big to fail.' You're not going to be able to talk about 'no more bailouts,'" he said. "If you are in the hip pocket of K Street, you're not going to be inclined to take on Congress to call for term limits."
The harsh words are part of an evolving dynamic in the 2012 Republican contest in which candidates like Mr. Huntsman are eager to break out and appear more willing to criticize their rivals. Representative Ron Paul of Texas released an ad this week that accused Mr. Gingrich of "serial hypocrisy."
That contrasts with Mr. Romney and Mr. Gingrich, the two candidates who are leading in most polls, who are just beginning to take swipes at each other.
Mr. Huntsman's sharp tone in the speech is not reserved for Republicans. Mr. Huntsman accuses Mr. Obama of "jamming through" health care, "brazenly" ignoring deficit recommendations and employing "crony politics" during his three years in office. Mr. Huntsman was ambassador to China under Mr. Obama.
The speech also serves to lay out a government reform plan that Mr. Huntsman hopes will appeal to voters who are frustrated with the status quo in Washington.
The centerpiece of the seven-point plan is Mr. Huntsman's promise to send Congress a "Citizens Legislature Act" that would include a constitutional amendment imposing term limits on members of Congress.
Under his plan, representatives would be limited to six two-year terms and senators would be required to leave after two six-year terms. 
"We must save capitalism from crony capitalists, and return to our founders' vision of a limited government that protects free markets and provides a level playing field of opportunity," Mr. Huntsman says in the speech.
Other promises that Mr. Huntsman makes in the speech include: 
* To completely rewrite the tax code, eliminating "every last loophole, subsidy and carve-out."
* To cut spending in "every corner of government.
* To break up Wall Street banks so that taxpayer are never "held hostage" by a Sophie's Choice between "massive bailouts, or economic calamity."
* To adopt a comprehensive energy strategy, "systematically streamline" regulations and bring home troops from Afghanistan.
In the speech, Mr. Huntsman casts the proposals as the solutions to the broader issue of a breakdown of trust.
"Rather than a limited, efficient government that serves the public's interest, Washington has grown bloated and bureaucratic, captured and corrupted by swarms of lobbyists, influence peddlers and crony capitalists," Mr. Huntsman says.
He added that "the American people have been let down, time and again. They have lost confidence in how our nation is run. As a result, anxiety and worry have filled our nation's psyche."
And he concludes: "We are a country divided and suffering from self-doubt."
Whether that message can help resurrect Mr. Huntsman's presidential campaign is not clear. His campaign does not have much money to spread that message with commercials, though a super PAC financed in part by his father could help.
Mr. Huntsman will not be part of Saturday's debate in Iowa, having not met the threshold of 5 percent in a national poll set by the debate's organizers. Instead, he will hold a town-hall style meeting in New Hampshire that day and will participate in a one-on-one national security and foreign policy debate with Mr. Gingrich the following Monday.
Mr. Huntsman said that he was looking forward to that faceoff and predicted that Mr. Gingrich would "approach it as a professor; I will approach it as a practitioner." He said he had been disappointed by what he called "reality-show-like debates" of the past several months.
"It's been long on drama and short on substance at a time when the American people long for substance," he said.
For now, Mr. Huntsman is targeting only New Hampshire, where he has gained a small amount of ground recently. The campaign is hoping to kick-start his effort by making a better-than-expected showing on Jan. 10.
"People don't begin coalescing around a candidate until a week or 10 days out," Mr. Huntsman said. "We are moving up as opposed to down. Expect the unexpected. It's always the case in New Hampshire."

HEADLINE: Warner Music Says Losses Grew in the Quarter

BYLINE: BEN SISARIO


HIGHLIGHT: The company reported $707 million in revenue for the three months ending Sept. 30, down 6 percent from the same period last year. Its net loss for the quarter was up 124 percent from last year. 

 BODY:
The Warner Music Group reported increased losses for its fourth quarter and fiscal year on Thursday, with growth in digital music not enough to offset the company's interest costs and lagging overall music sales.
Warner, home to the Red Hot Chili Peppers, Green Day and Neil Young, had been publicly traded since 2005 but was taken private in July after it was bought by Access Industries for $3.3 billion. It continues to report financial returns because of its public debt obligations.
The company reported $707 million in revenue for the three months that ended Sept. 30, the last day in its fiscal year, down 6 percent from the same period last year; its net loss for the quarter was $103 million, an increase of 124 percent from last year.
For the full fiscal year, revenue was $2.87 billion, down 4 percent from the year before, and net loss grew 43 percent to $205 million.
Digital music sales continue to grow throughout the music industry, though they have never been enough to offset the decline in CD sales. At Warner, digital music accounted for 28.6 percent of revenue for the year, up from 25.4 percent last year. But revenue declined over all for both the company's recorded music and music publishing divisions.
"The digital revenue growth was more than offset by contracting demand for physical product," Warner said in its financial statement.
Total album sales in the United States have been up slightly for the year, but Warner blamed its "light release schedule" and costs related to the Access deal for its losses. The Access takeover cost Warner $46 million in professional expenses, and its interest expenses increased to $72 million from $47 million when it refinanced debts after the sale, the company said; its new debt obligations also have higher interest rates.
As of Sept. 30, Warner had $154 million in cash, down from $439 million last year, and $2.22 billion in long-term debt.
Warner, the third largest of the four major record companies, faces a changed competitive landscape with the recent sale of its smallest rival, EMI. If regulators in the United States and Europe approve the deal, EMI's record labels will be acquired by the Universal Music Group, already the largest company, and EMI's music publishing assets will go to Sony, leaving Warner in a distant third place.
Analysts and music executives have said that the EMI deal, reached last month, could take six months to a year to be approved. Universal has already committed to $680 million in divestitures, apparently in anticipation of antitrust challenges.
As expected, Warner also announced on Thursday that Edgar M. Bronfman Jr. would be stepping down as chairman on Jan. 31, but would remain on the board. Mr. Bronfman, the company's former chief executive, became chairman in August when Stephen F. Cooper, a corporate turnaround specialist, took over as chief executive. Mr. Bronfman's decision emerged after he sent a memo to Warner employees on Monday.
No new chairman was named.

HEADLINE: The President's Osawatomie Speech

BYLINE: ROSS DOUTHAT


HIGHLIGHT: A plausible diagnosis and a deeply flawed prescription. 

 BODY:
A little over a month ago, I wrote a column about the problems with contemporary liberalism's prescription for what ails the American middle class. My argument, in a nutshell, was that wage stagnation and social immobility are real issues, but that simply soaking the rich in order to invest more money in our existing public institutions (propping up Medicare and Social Security, preserving and expanding government employment, etc.) wouldn't necessarily do much to increase prosperity and mobility for the next generation of Americans, and might actually have perverse consequences instead.
If you were so inclined, you might consider the column my pre-buttal to the president's big speech in Osawatomie, Kansas last week, which combined a reasonably-accurate diagnosis of Middle America's economic problems with a prescription that consists of tax hikes for the rich, more government hiring for education and infrastructure projects (or at least infrastructure projects that don't offend rich environmentalists), and a mix of industrial policy and appeals to corporations' patriotism (which, as Mickey Kaus notes, just leads to more industrial policy down the road) to boost private sector employment. I'm sympathetic to some of the president's smaller-bore proposals: I'd like to see the payroll tax cut extended, for instance, because it takes us one step closer to abolishing the payroll tax entirely, and government support for basic scientific research (as opposed to specific companies like Solyndra) can sometimes deliver large returns on limited investments. But as David Frum notes, the West has already been trying a version of Obama's overall vision for the last decade or more, without achieving particularly encouraging results. Using rising tax revenues from the top 1 percent to increase public-sector hiring while putting off necessary structural adjustments till tomorrow (or the next day, or the day after that ...) was basically the economic policy of Britain's Blair-Brown government in the late 1990s and 2000s, and it ended in tears when the bust came and the tax revenues dried up. On this side of the Atlantic, too, this was roughly the blueprint that many blue states (and not a few red ones, for that matter) followed in the Bush era, compensating for middling job growth and middle class wage stagnation by expanding their payrolls faster than the private sector did. And even if this approach hadn't left states like California in the untenable position they occupy today, it would still be a profoundly depressing vision of the American economic future. As Frum writes of the president's speech:
The unblinking diagnosis of the ills of the U.S. economy in the first half of his Kansas speech builds to a conclusion that amounts to: Let's accept that our future prosperity will be very narrowly based, and instead use some of the proceeds of that narrow prosperity to create government jobs as consolation prizes for those who lose out in private markets.
I don't want to pretend that there is some perfect alternative to this approach to our economic challenges, and certainly the current Republican presidential field hasn't come close to articulating one. But I will say this: Even if - no, if - you have a deep belief in the government's ability to help underwrite the American Dream, you have an obligation to recognize the necessity of fundamentally restructuring the institutions of government (rather than just funding them at their projected levels in perpetuity), because as it stands they aren't getting the job done. The president's speech gestured at this reality, with lines about making government "more efficient and more effective, more consumer-friendly, more responsive to people's needs." But fundamentally, his pivot to the 2012 campaign has also been a pivot to a defense of business-as-usual, in which the rich pay, the government grows, and the millions of Americans who don't belong to public sector unions, work for favored industries, or draw on Social Security and Medicare are left waiting for the government's ever-more-expensive investments to trickle down to them.

HEADLINE: Former Treasury Official Rejoins Hellman & Friedman

BYLINE: PETER LATTMAN


HIGHLIGHT: Jeffrey Goldstein has rejoined the private equity firm as a partner after a two-year stint as a top lieutenant to the Treasury secretary, Timothy F. Geithner. 

 BODY:
A former senior Obama administration official is resuming his Wall Street career after a two-year stint in Washington. 
Jeffrey Goldstein, a top lieutenant to the Treasury secretary, Timothy F. Geithner, has rejoined the private equity firm Hellman & Friedman as a partner. 
As the Treasury Department's undersecretary for domestic finance since 2009, Mr. Goldstein played a leading role in shaping the administration's financial policies in the wake of the global economic crisis, including implementation of the Dodd-Frank Act overhauling Wall Street regulation. He worked on everything from restructuring the housing market to overseeing the Treasury's bailout investments in the banks and automakers. 
Mr. Goldstein left his post in July. The White House has nominated Mary Miller, an assistant secretary at the Treasury Department, as Mr. Goldstein's replacement. 
"Jeffrey's commitment to public service at such a critical time for the U.S. economy was extraordinary and we are proud he was chosen to serve in such an important role," Philip Hammarskjold, chief executive of Hellman & Friedman, said in a statement. 
At Hellman & Friedman, Mr. Goldstein, 56, will return to focusing on investments in the financial services sector. He previously worked at the firm from 2004 to 2009, where he helped oversee its investments in LPL Holdings, a now-publicly traded broker-dealer based in Boston, and Grosvenor Capital Management, a privately held Chicago-based investment shop. 
Mr. Goldstein will also serve in a new client-relations role at the firm, and will be based in New York. 
Hellman & Friedman, which has its headquarters in San Francisco, recently struck one of the largest buyouts of the year when it teamed up with the Carlyle Group to acquire Pharmaceutical Product Development for $3.9 billion. 
Prior to joining Hellman & Friedman the first time around, Mr. Goldstein served as chief financial officer of the World Bank, where he worked under its president, James D. Wolfensohn. Before that, he worked with Mr. Wolfensohn in the private sector at the investment firm BT Wolfenshohn. 
An earlier version of this post gave an incorrect middle initial for the Treasury secretary. It is Timothy F. Geithner, not P.

HEADLINE: Corzine Defends His Actions at MF Global

BYLINE: BEN PROTESS


HIGHLIGHT: At a House hearing on his firm's collapse, a humbled Jon S. Corzine insisted that he "never intended to break any rules" while running MF Global. 

 BODY:
9:05 p.m. | Updated 
WASHINGTON - Jon S. Corzine, who came to Washington in 2001 as a Democratic senator from New Jersey, made a humbling return on Thursday, defending his tenure as MF Global's top executive and sounding a note of contrition about the brokerage firm's startling collapse.
Mr. Corzine told the House Agriculture Committee that he was "stunned" when he learned late on Oct. 30 that about $1 billion of customer money could not be located, a discovery that thwarted a sale of the firm and led to its filing for bankruptcy. Regulators and the Federal Bureau of Investigation are now hunting for the money and examining potential wrongdoing at the firm.
 Thursday's testimony was his first public comments since the bankruptcy and came after the committee voted last week to subpoena him.
The former senator insisted that he always tried to "do the right thing."
"I never intended to break any rules," said Mr. Corzine, dressed in a dark suit but without his trademark sweater vest. "I know I had no intention to ever authorize the transfer of segregated moneys. I know what my intentions were." Mr. Corzine has not been accused of any wrongdoing.
He did not rule out possible wrongdoing at MF Global. In theory, an employee may have misused customer cash after misinterpreting the chief executive's words, he said.
Still, over three hours of testimony, Mr. Corzine danced carefully around questions touching on the scandal of the missing funds, using phrases like "never intended" and "not to my knowledge."
And he offered little insight into the whereabouts of the missing money. He surmised that one potential cause of the shortfall was the "extraordinary number of transactions during MF Global's last few days," calling it a "chaotic" period that was "extremely difficult" to "reconstruct."
Yet it was not known until Thursday whether Mr. Corzine would directly respond to the lawmakers' questions at all.
"Considering the circumstances, many people in my situation would almost certainly invoke their constitutional right to remain silent - a fundamental right that exists for the purpose of protecting the innocent," he said. "Nonetheless, as a former United States senator who recognizes the importance of Congressional oversight, and recognizing my position as former chief executive officer in these terrible circumstances, I believe it is appropriate that I attempt to respond to your inquiries."
Mr. Corzine, who ran Goldman Sachs before entering politics, eagerly defended his decision to invest heavily in European sovereign debt, saying that it was part of a crucial push to return the firm to profitability. The firm had a $6.3 billion bet on the debt of five European nations.
"At the time that MF Global entered into the transactions," he said, "I believed that its investments in short-term European debt securities were prudent."
The MF Global board, he said, approved the risk limits for the trades, which were set on a country-by-country basis. At times, he said, the firm exceeded those limits and "it took appropriate steps" to reduce the risk.
When MF Global filed for bankruptcy, Mr. Corzine said the firm was "within the risk limits set by the board of directors." He said that he resigned from the firm on Nov. 4 at the request of a senior member of the board.
Mr. Corzine, who was defeated for re-election as governor of New Jersey in 2009, also defended his dealings with regulators. Months before the firm failed, he began a personal lobbying blitz, urging regulators at the Commodity Futures Trading Commission to weaken a rule that would rein in the use of customer funds. He took his pitch directly to the agency's chairman, Gary Gensler, who worked for Mr. Corzine at Goldman Sachs in the 1990s.
Their relationship has come under a microscope on Capitol Hill. Mr. Gensler recused himself from the investigation of MF Global after Senator Charles E. Grassley, Republican of Iowa, raised questions about Mr. Gensler's past acquaintance with Mr. Corzine.
Now, some Republicans are criticizing Mr. Gensler for stepping back at such a crucial moment for the agency. Representative Timothy V. Johnson, Republican from Illinois, said on Thursday that it was "entirely unacceptable" for Mr. Gensler to not testify at the hearing. He also criticized what he has called a "Goldman Sachs fraternity."
Jill E. Sommers, a Republican member of the futures commission, has taken over the lead role on the case and testified on Thursday. Lawmakers asked her whether the agency should have sounded the alarm about MF Global before its final days.
Ms. Sommers replied that the agency was "not the frontline regulator." That job belongs to for-profit exchanges like the CME Group.
Lawmakers were not satisfied.
"It appears to me that no one has learned a thing; that Wall Street is still operating as if 2008 never happened," said Collin C. Peterson of Minnesota, the committee's ranking Democrat.
Mr. Corzine will remain a regular presence on Capitol Hill for weeks. Two other Congressional panels, the Senate Agriculture Committee and the oversight arm of the House Financial Services Committee, have also demanded that he testify next week.
The House panel on Thursday also heard testimony from the firm's regulators, including Ms. Sommers and the CME Group.
But throughout the stop-and-start proceedings, the attention was centered on Mr. Corzine. And with the world watching, he began his testimony with a mea culpa.
"I sincerely apologize, both personally and on behalf of the company, to our customers, our employees and our investors, who are bearing the brunt of the impact of the firm's bankruptcy," Mr. Corzine said.
"My sadness, of course, pales in comparison to the losses and hardships that customers, employees and investors have suffered as a result of MF Global's bankruptcy."
In its final days, MF Global tapped its customers' accounts to meet its own financial obligations, people briefed on the matter have said. The act violated a fundamental Wall Street regulation that firms never commingle customer money with company funds.
Mr. Corzine told the House committee that he learned of the missing money about 11 p.m. on Oct. 30. "I remain deeply concerned about the impact that the unreconciled and frozen funds have had on MF Global's customers and others," he said.
The former senator at times seemed comfortable sitting on the other side of the hearing room. When faced with questions about MF Global's complex trading, he took a professorial tone, explaining the intricacies of his business and even cracking an occasional smile.
And while lawmakers peppered Mr. Corzine with questions about his European sovereign debt bet and the missing money, they kept a cordial tone with their former colleague. One congressman even congratulated the former Goldman executive on achieving considerable wealth.

HEADLINE: Goodbye to 'Gays, Guns & God'

BYLINE: TIMOTHY EGAN


HIGHLIGHT: National polls suggest that Republican candidates have lost a few of their favorite wedge issues. 

 BODY:
How do you praise the sanctity of traditional heterosexual marriage when the best-known nuptials of the year, between a Kardashian and a basketball player, lasted all of 72 days? Or, for that matter, when a possible Republican nominee for president, Newt Gingrich, cares so much about marriage that he's tried it three times?
You don't. The above mockeries of marriage are just the latest reasons one of the most potent wedge issues of American politics - the banner of gays, guns and God - will have little impact next year. 
This trio is usually trotted out in big swaths of the West, in rural or swing districts and in Southern states at the cusp of the Bible Belt. The proverbial three G's was the explanation in Thomas Frank's entertaining book "What's the Matter With Kansas" for why poor, powerless whites would vote for a party that promises nothing but tax cuts for the rich.
It's misleading to think people will vote against their economic interests simply because a candidate doesn't mouth the same pieties as them as they do. But the cultural cudgel works to a point. I've certainly seen the three G's launched late in a campaign, to great effect. Jim Inhofe won a Senate seat in Oklahoma in 1994 using the three G's as an overt slogan. 
At the same time, I've watched smart politicians, like Montana's two-term Democratic governor, Brian Schweitzer, blunt the attack by showing off their guns and waving away the God and gay questions as none-of-your-business intrusions. 
But this year I think we've reached a tipping point on these heartless perennials. When George W. Bush won re-election in 2004, political sophisticates were stunned by a national exit poll in which 22 percent of voters picked "moral issues" from a list of things that mattered most - more than any other concern. This was heralded as the high-water triumph for evangelicals. 
Later analysis showed that the phrase "moral issues" was being used rather broadly by voters, from concern about character to worry over poverty. It was a catch-all. Still, the ranking of moral issues as the top reason to pick a president came as a surprise. 
Now look at this week's New York Times/CBS News Poll of likely Republican caucus-goers in Iowa, about as conservative a cohort of voters as anywhere in the country. Iowa, for Republicans, is where gays, guns and God will grow in political fields long after corn is no longer planted for ethanol subsidies. 
Topping the list of voter concerns was the economy and jobs - picked by 40 percent of respondents, followed by the budget deficit at 23 percent. Social issues came in a distant third, with 9 percent. And the candidate who polled highest as the one who "most represents the values you try to live by," Michele Bachmann, has nothing to show for that rating in the overall race, where she is in fifth place. 
But the decline of the three G's hasn't stopped a few of the dead-enders in the Republican field from raising the flag. Gov. Rick Perry of Texas, last seen trying to find a verb to follow "oops," is out this week with a very specific culture-war ad in Iowa, vowing to end "Obama's war on religion," whatever that is. 
"I'm not ashamed to admit that I'm a Christian," says Perry, in a folksy drawl. "But you don't need to be in a pew every Sunday to know that there's something wrong in this country when gays can serve openly in the military, but our kids can't openly celebrate Christmas or pray in school." The surprise here is that he actually completed several sentences, though it may have required a number of takes. 
Perry and Rick Santorum, another badly wounded culture warrior, blasted Secretary of State Hillary Clinton this week for saying that the United States would assist human rights groups fighting for tolerance in countries where people have been imprisoned, and even killed, for their sexual orientation. 
"This administration's war on traditional values must stop," said Perry, siding, apparently, with mullahs living in caves. 
This is Perry's last gasp; in desperation, he shows how this particular balloon has run out of hot air. Poll after poll has found that Americans now overwhelmingly favor letting gays serve openly in the military - a sentiment backed even by a sizable majority of Republicans.
The gay marriage issue is moving in the same direction. Earlier this year, Gallup reported that, for the first time in its tracking of the issue, a majority of Americans believe same-sex marriage should be legal. In 1996, only 27 percent felt that way. 
Which brings us to guns. President Obama has done nothing to curb gun use. If anything, he's expanded gun rights. There are probably a dozen Democrats in Congress from the West who know more about guns than Mitt Romney or Professor Newt Gingrich. That dog, as they say, will not hunt - not this year. 
The irony is that two of the G's could actually hurt Republicans in 2012. Conservative orthodoxy is badly out of step with emerging majority support for full citizenship rights of gays. And with religion, some Republicans have already made an issue of Romney's Mormonism, and Gingrich's switch to Roman Catholicism. In Gingrich's case, questions have been raised about how a multiple-married man could win the favor of high-ranking Catholic clerics who usually look askance at people who ditch their wives.
Do we dare expect these two fine men to be the ones, at long last, to bring an end to the gays, guns and God wedge issue, even if it's by accident?

HEADLINE: Lousy Filibusters: Richard Cordray Edition

BYLINE: ANDREW ROSENTHAL


HIGHLIGHT: Republicans have blocked confirmation of Richard Cordray, President Obama&#8217;s pick to lead the Consumer Financial Protection Agency. 

 BODY:
It seems like only yesterday that Republicans blocked President Obama's nominee for the D.C. Circuit appeals court, Caitlin Halligan, for no good reason. Actually, it was two days ago, and the Republicans have already moved onto yet more obstruction. Today, they blocked the confirmation of Richard Cordray: President Obama's pick to lead the new Consumer Financial Protection Bureau. 
In case readers haven't been following this particular drama, here's the background. The Dodd-Frank reform law, passed in response to the financial crisis, included language establishing a consumer protection agency that would shield Americans from deceptive lending through mortgages, credit cards and the like. (Those practices, you may recall, played a big factor in almost destroying the housing market, not to mention the economy.)

The Dodd-Frank law is not nearly strong enough. It stops well short of fixing the problems that caused the meltdown, including deeply inadequate regulatory oversight. But the CFPB concept seemed promising.
Republicans, of course, consider this agency a grave threat to the financial system. By which they mean it's a threat to their donors. An editorial we published in July explained that "banks-big campaign contributors-don't want robust consumer protection because complex and obscure products are lucrative." If there's a more charitable - but still reality-based - explanation for Republican opposition to the agency, I'd love to hear it.
Initially, the president wanted Elizabeth Warren, the Harvard law professor who'd pioneered the idea for the new agency, to actually lead it. But Republicans weren't going to let that happen. Blocking Ms. Warren was the next best thing to scrapping the whole agency, which cannot exercise its full regulatory powers without a director.
So the ever-obliging Mr. Obama passed over Ms. Warren, and in July tapped Mr. Cordray, the former attorney general of Ohio and current chief of enforcement at the agency. This was another pointless attempt by the administration to encourage Republican compromise. That attempt failed, of course. Senator Richard Shelby of Alabama responded charmingly to the news of Mr. Cordray's nomination. He said it was "dead on arrival."
Mr. Cordray has all the right credentials, but that doesn't matter. Today, 53 senators voted for Mr. Cordray, and 45 Republicans voted against ending debate on his nomination.

HEADLINE: E.P.A. Links Tainted Water in Wyoming to Hydraulic Fracturing for Natural Gas

BYLINE: By KIRK JOHNSON

 BODY:
DENVER -- Chemicals used to hydraulically fracture rocks in drilling for natural gas in a remote valley in central Wyoming are the likely cause of contaminated local water supplies, federal regulators said Thursday.
The draft report, after a three-year study by the Environmental Protection Agency, represents a new scientific and political skirmish line over whether fracking, as it is more commonly known, poses a threat in the dozens of places around the nation where it is now being used to extract previously unreachable energy resources locked within rock.
The study, which was prompted by complaints from local residents about the smell and taste of their water, stressed that local conditions were unusual at the site, called the Pavillion field, in that the gas wells were far shallower than in many other drilling areas around the country. The shallow depth means that natural gas itself can seep upward naturally through the rock, and perhaps into aquifers. 
But the suite of chemicals found in two test wells drilled at the site, the report said, could not be explained entirely by natural processes. The agency's analysis of samples taken from deep monitoring wells in the aquifer indicated the presence of synthetic chemicals, like glycols and alcohols consistent with gas production and hydraulic fracturing fluids, benzene concentrations well above standards in the Federal Safe Drinking Water Act standards, and high methane levels.
Also complicating the inquiry is the Pavillion field's long history. The oldest wells there were drilled 40 years ago or more, and chemicals that might have been used were not required to be listed or reported to anyone.
The energy industry has long stressed that fracking and water contamination have never been definitively linked.
''When considered together with other lines of evidence, the data indicates likely impact to ground water that can be explained by hydraulic fracturing,'' the draft study said. And perhaps just as crucially, the evidence also suggested that seepage of natural gas itself had increased around the drilling sites. Natural gas is often mixed with other elements, including methane, which can taint water supplies.
''Data suggest that enhanced migration of gas has occurred within ground water at depths used for domestic water supply,'' said the draft study, which will now be sent for scientific peer review and public comment.
A spokesman for Encana Oil & Gas (USA), which bought the Pavillion field in 2004 and drilled some of the approximately 169 wells there, said the E.P.A.'s science was inconclusive. Encana's parent company is based in Calgary.
''What we have here is not a conclusion, but a probability -- and based on the facts, not a good probability,'' said Doug Hock, the company's spokesman. He said that enhanced migration of gas as a result of drilling was unlikely in the Pavillion field, since drilling had reduced pressure in the underlying rock, thus reducing forces that can lead to gas seepage. And finding methane and benzene in two deep test wells drilled for the study, he said, is what you would expect in a gas-rich zone.
''Encana didn't put those there, nature did,'' he said.
The governor of Wyoming, Matt Mead, also said in a statement that the E.P.A.'s conclusions were ''scientifically questionable'' and not based on enough data. Mr. Mead, a Republican, called for more testing by the E.P.A., in conjunction with a state group of residents, state and federal agencies, and Indian tribes already at work looking into questions about Pavillion's water supply.
Wyoming, which is dependent on oil and gas drilling, along with coal mining, as anchors of its economy, will also be among the peer reviewers of the E.P.A.'s draft, the governor's statement said. The chairman of a local Pavillion residents' group -- about 200 people, mostly involved in farming and ranching, who live in proximity to the drilling sites -- expressed gratitude to the E.P.A., and perhaps a bit of veiled doubt about the zeal of local and state regulators.
''This investigation proves the importance of having a federal agency that can protect people and the environment,'' said John Fenton, the chairman of Pavillion Area Concerned Citizens. ''Those of us who suffer the impacts from the unchecked development in our community are extremely happy the contamination source is being identified.''
Gas drilling, using both hydraulic fracturing to release gas and horizontal drilling techniques that can snake underground far from the actual bore holes, is now moving into closer proximity to American population centers than in the past.
From the suburbs of Denver to Pennsylvania and Oklahoma, natural gas reserves, known about but previously unreachable for economic and technological reasons, are being tapped, and anxieties about the hydraulic injection process and its consequences are growing. Wyoming, in 2010, became one of the first states to require petroleum companies or their contractors to disclose the ingredients in their specially formulated fracking fluids. The E.P.A. has also begun a national study on the potential impacts of hydraulic fracturing on drinking water resources.

CORRECTION-DATE: December 14, 2011

 CORRECTION:
This article has been revised to reflect the following correction: An article on Friday about a draft finding by the Environmental Protection Agency that chemicals used in natural gas drilling were probably the cause of contamination of drinking water in a valley in Wyoming described the composition of natural gas incorrectly. Natural gas is made up primarily of methane when it emerges from the ground; methane is not merely ''often'' present.

HEADLINE: City Crackdown Looming As the Dog Population Rises

BYLINE: By SCOTT JAMES. 
Scott James is an Emmy-winning television journalist and novelist who lives in San Francisco. sjames@baycitizen.org

 BODY:
Call it a sign of the times: At food establishments around San Francisco, fliers are popping up with the words ''No Animals Allowed'' in bold red letters, and an image of a dog in a circle with a line through it. They are stamped with the official city and county seal.
Sheldon Lew, an inspector for the Department of Public Health, created the eye-catching sign about a year ago after hearing from restaurants and grocery stores about people who were taking in unruly, nonservice dogs -- a violation of state law. 
''They wanted something from the health department,'' Mr. Lew said
The fliers, which Mr. Lew said were not a required posting, have become increasingly popular with food establishments, an indication of rising tensions over the city's swelling dog population.
Indeed, the number of canines, at least 120,000, is now greater than the number of children, whose ranks dropped to 107,000 from 112,000 in the past decade, according to 2010 census figures.
Currently, new rules are being considered that could put dogs on a tighter leash -- affecting where they play, how they are cared for and where they live.
The Land Use and Economic Development Committee of the Board of Supervisors will consider legislation next week to regulate professional dog walkers, an industry that has flourished in the dog boom, but has also drawn complaints for damage to parks, where packs of dogs are routinely unleashed.
Proposals are expected to move forward in 2012 for the Golden Gate National Recreation Area -- national park land within the city that includes Crissy Field, Fort Funston and Ocean Beach -- that would greatly reduce off-leash play areas, because of dogs' impact on natural habitats and species.
A similar plan by the San Francisco Recreation and Parks Department to protect ''natural areas'' in city parks is also moving ahead, which could reduce existing off-leash dog play acreage by 14 percent or more.
And in the city's suddenly tight apartment market, rentals that allow dogs have become increasingly rare. As a result, advocates for pets are expected to lobby city leaders next year to change rental laws to remove illegal pet ownership as a ''just cause'' for eviction -- essentially allowing renters to defy leases and have dogs, even if they signed contracts agreeing not to. Landlords would most likely fight such a change.
''More and more people are wanting pets,'' said Bruce Wolfe, president of DogPAC, a pro-dog political action committee, who favors the rental law change.
An estimated one-third of San Francisco households now have dogs, which means two-thirds of households don't. By all accounts, the city is undergoing a period of adjustment as it tries to accommodate both groups.
''What happens with social change is that you experience a backlash,'' said Sally Stephens, chairwoman of San Francisco Dog Owners Group, a nonprofit organization that advocates for responsible dog ownership. ''There are people who don't understand the place that dogs have in our community.''
Ms. Stephens said that because so many San Francisco residents are new arrivals, and often single, dogs had become a powerful bonding force for people who might otherwise be lonely. ''The dog park is an amazing way to connect with people,'' she said.
Ms. Stephens acknowledged that some dogs were mishandled.
When I recounted a recent incident I saw of a dog eating food off shelves in Safeway as its owner idly watched, she agreed that such episodes had been a source of animosity toward dogs. However, she considered these problems rare.
But many of the impending conflicts, especially those involving parks, show that the increase in dog ownership has clashed with one of the city's most highly prized tenets: appreciation for the natural environment. Efforts to preserve indigenous habitats and species go back decades, predating the current dog craze.
But even as the city rolls out environmental plans that call for reducing some off-leash play areas in city parks, it also seems willing to accommodate its canine residents. Dog play areas will be added in new places like Rincon Hill, a once-desolate part of SoMa that has been newly developed as a residential area (as people arrived, so did their dogs).
It is an indication, despite the growing signs of a pushing back, that dogs ultimately still have plenty of clout here.
''The dog community is an economic factor in this city,'' Mr. Wolfe said. ''You don't see pet shops closing.''

PERSON: David Montgomery 

HEADLINE: David Montgomery, 84, Dies; Chronicled Lives of Workers

BYLINE: By BRUCE WEBER

 BODY:
David Montgomery, a labor historian whose experience as a machinist informed his influential writing about the culture of the factory floor, died last Friday in Philadelphia. He was 84.
The cause was a brain hemorrhage, his son Edward said.
Mr. Montgomery, who taught at the University of Pittsburgh and at Yale, wrote several books that explored the lives of workers, their rituals, their hierarchies, the power relationships among them and with their in-house managers, and the communities they formed.
In books that included ''Beyond Equality: Labor and the Radical Republicans, 1862-1872,'' ''Workers' Control in America: Studies in the History of Work, Technology, and Labor Struggles'' and his magnum opus, ''The Fall of the House of Labor: The Workplace, the State, and American Labor Activism, 1865-1925,'' Mr. Montgomery created vivid pictures of workers in the iron foundries, steel plants and munitions and electrical equipment factories of the 19th and early 20th centuries. 
For most of the 1950s, Mr. Montgomery worked as a machinist in Minnesota and New York, and in both places he was a union member and organizer who, in the cross hairs of anti-Communist McCarthyites, was fired from a number of jobs. (Mr. Montgomery was, in fact, a member of the Communist Party. He quit after the Soviet Union crushed the Hungarian rebellion of 1956.)
He entered academia at a time when labor studies was a field viewed largely in terms of economics. But along with other scholars, including the Englishman E. P. Thompson and the Americans David Brody and Herbert G. Gutman, Mr. Montgomery helped establish what became known as ''new labor history,'' a branch of inquiry that rerouted research away from its traditional focus on union organizing, strikes and relations between companies and unions. Instead, these historians -- and generations of students after them -- began seeing labor more in terms of social history.
''One of the signal achievements of Mr. Montgomery and his many energetic students,'' said Nelson Lichtenstein, writing about ''The Fall of the House of Labor'' in The New York Times Book Review in 1987, has been ''to put social drama and moral seriousness back into the struggles of labor, not just the great strikes at Homestead and Ludlow, but also into the seemingly mundane conflicts over a change in work rules or a five-cent wage advance.''
David Montgomery was born on Dec. 1, 1927, in Bryn Mawr, Pa.; his father was an insurance executive. He was educated in Pennsylvania as well, graduating from the Haverford School and, after serving in the Army in Los Alamos, N. M., as World War II was ending, Swarthmore College.
His first jobs were in factories in New York City and Minneapolis, and at the end of the McCarthy era he turned to academic life, earning an M.A. and a Ph.D., both in history, from the University of Minnesota. His dissertation became his first book, ''Beyond Equality,'' published in 1967, and he became a close colleague of Mr. Thompson's.
Known as a shy and humble man who came alive behind a lectern or on a soapbox, Mr. Montgomery won teaching awards at both Pittsburgh and Yale, where he gained local fame for, among other things, actively supporting the campus clerical workers in their 1984 strike.
''He was part stump speaker, part academic, part public intellectual,'' said Shelton Stromquist, a professor of labor history at the University of Iowa who was Mr. Montgomery's student at Pitt in the 1970s. ''David was never shy about demonstrating the relationship between his scholarship and activist commitment. The same is true of a lot of us.''
Mr. Montgomery, who lived in Kennett Square, Pa., is survived by his wife, the former Martel Wilcher, whom he married in 1952; a brother, Daniel; a sister, Virginia Baily; two sons, Edward and Claude; and five grandchildren.
''A phrase he loved,'' Mr. Stromquist said, ''was 'the frictions of daily life,' which he used to expand the notion of how class happens, to describe all kinds of ways in which workers have been strained and diminished. It was those frictions that produced a sense of being a member of a class being denied its full rights.
''He was very attentive to the ways in which workers are put upon, but he was more attentive to the ways in which they are proactive,'' Mr. Stromquist added. ''This wasn't a passive working class; this is a working class continually trying to find ways to assert its claims and power and sense of rights. What is so palpable in his work is the presence of working-class people as agents in history.''

HEADLINE: U.S. Climate Envoy Seems to Shift Stance on Timetable for New Talks

BYLINE: By JOHN M. BRODER

 BODY:
DURBAN, South Africa -- Facing sharp criticism from fellow envoys, environmental activists and one impassioned heckler, the chief American negotiator at a climate conference here on Thursday shifted his position -- or at least his language -- on a timetable for a new set of international talks.
Todd D. Stern, the Obama administration's special envoy for climate change, was put on the defensive by a narrative developing here that the United States opposed any further action to address global climate disruption until after 2020, when the 1997 Kyoto Protocol, a primary United Nations climate agreement, and voluntary programs negotiated more recently will have run their course. 
He firmly denied that the United States was dragging its feet and, somewhat ambiguously, endorsed a proposal from the European Union to quickly start negotiating a new international climate change treaty.
Mr. Stern's statement to delegates from more than 190 nations at the annual climate conference was disrupted by a 21-year-old Middlebury College junior, Abigail Borah, who told the assembly that she would speak for the United States because Mr. Stern had forfeited the right to do so.
''I am speaking on behalf of the United States of America because my negotiators cannot,'' said Ms. Borah, who is attending the conference as a representative of the International Youth Climate Movement. ''The obstructionist Congress has shackled justice and delayed ambition for far too long. I am scared for my future. 2020 is too late to wait. We need an urgent path to a fair, ambitious and legally binding treaty.''
Scores of delegates and observers gave her a sustained ovation. Then the South African authorities threw her out of the conference. ''That's O.K.,'' Ms. Borak, who is from Princeton, N.J., said later by telephone. ''I think I got my point across.''
Mr. Stern smiled as if the applause were for him and continued with his prepared remarks. Afterward, at a briefing for reporters, he dismissed charges that the United States was blocking any action on climate change until after 2020.
''It is completely off base to suggest that the U.S. is proposing that we delay action until 2020,'' Mr. Stern said. He detailed a number of domestic and international actions that the United States had taken and said that he and other administration officials were working on others, like finding ways to raise tens of billions of dollars to help poor nations adapt to a warming planet.
''Taking all of those things together, it's nonsense to suggest that what we are doing is proposing a kind of hiatus in dealing with climate change until after 2020,'' Mr. Stern said. ''So, I just wanted to make that clear because, after I heard it about the fourth or fifth time in the last few days, and again I've heard this from everywhere, from ministers to press reports to the very sincere and passionate young woman who was in the hall when I was giving my remarks. I just wanted to be on the record as saying that, that's just a mistake. It is not true.''
He then seemed to endorse a European Union proposal to adopt a ''road map'' for future discussions leading to a formal climate change treaty to be completed by 2015 and to take effect in 2020. He had previously given lukewarm support to the plan, saying only that the United States was open to a ''process'' for a future agreement.
His language was somewhat convoluted, but he said that the European Union had called for a road map ''that the U.S. supports.''
''We are strongly committed to promptly starting a process to move forward on that,'' Mr. Stern said, although he immediately qualified that statement by saying that any resulting agreement may or may not be legally binding.
The Europeans and a large majority of smaller nations are adamant that any future accord be legally binding, while China, India, the United States and several other major emitters of greenhouse gases have attached some difficult conditions to participation in any mandatory agreement.
Connie Hedegaard, the European Union's commissioner for climate action, said she was encouraged by Mr. Stern's change in tone.
''Support for the E.U.'s road map is growing here in Durban,'' Ms. Hedegaard said in a Twitter message after his comments.
The 17th annual meeting of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change is scheduled to conclude Friday night.
A number of issues are nearing resolution, although others -- including the status of the Kyoto Protocol as well as the form and timing of future negotiations -- remain up in the air.

HEADLINE: Illegal Border Crossings Dip Sharply

BYLINE: By JULIAN AGUILAR. 
jaguilar@texastribune.org

 BODY:
Campaign rhetoric to the contrary, statistics show that the number of illegal immigrants crossing the border is less of a problem now than it has been for four decades.
While presidential candidates talk about how to secure the United States-Mexico border, data show that their focus might instead be on dealing in a positive way with the millions of illegal immigrants already here. Apprehensions by the United States Border Patrol are at their lowest level since the Nixon era, according to unofficial statistics from the agency that The Washington Post reported this month.
A sour economy, increased enforcement by the Border Patrol and skyrocketing smuggling fees are keeping more would-be crossers at home. 
In 2010, the Border Patrol apprehended about 448,000 illegal immigrants on the Southwest border, roughly 93,000 fewer than in 2009. This year, apprehensions have dipped by more than 25 percent, to 327,500.
There are now 10.2 million illegal immigrant adults in the country and another 1 million illegal minors, according to data released this month by the Pew Hispanic Center. The center estimates that 35 percent of those adults have been in the country 15 years or longer, compared with 16 percent in 2000. Conversely, only 15 percent have been in the country five years or less, compared with 32 percent in 2000.
''It's more expensive to get in, it's more dangerous to get in and there are no jobs to be had,'' said Jeffrey S. Passel, the senior demographer at the Pew Hispanic Center. ''It's not surprising that the inflows are way down.''
James W. Ziglar, a senior fellow at the Migration Policy Institute and a commissioner of the United States Immigration and Naturalization Service under President George W. Bush, said there are so many people in the country illegally because the system has long been dysfunctional.
''We are not going to deport these people,'' Mr. Ziglar said. ''We need to deal with the problem and provide them with a way to a legal status.''
Mr. Ziglar's stance reflects the view of many of his fellow Republicans. In a poll this year, the Pew Research Center for People and the Press found that 58 percent of so-called Main Street Republicans supported a path to legalization while 39 percent opposed it. A poll by the Partnership for a New American Economy, a bipartisan group of mayors and business leaders, found that only 16 percent of likely attendees at the Iowa Republican caucuses were opposed to expanding legal immigration.
Along some parts of the Texas-Mexico border, violence is also down. Ciudad Juarez, for example, is on pace for 1,000 fewer homicides this year -- a rare bit of good news in a ravaged city. Howard Campbell, a professor of anthropology at the University of Texas at El Paso, said the violence in adjacent Ciudad Juarez has subsided because the gangs used by the Juarez drug cartel are weaker and the Sinaloa cartel -- which has waged a war in the city since 2008 -- is distracted with tougher battles to the west. Mr. Campbell also cited pressure on President Felipe Calderon to make the police and the military more accountable and to improve his country's image.
''In general,'' Mr. Campbell said, ''things hit bottom, and so there is an almost natural cycle of improvement. Whether this improvement will last is impossible to say.''

HEADLINE: Claims for Jobless Benefits Drop to a Nine-Month Low

BYLINE: By REUTERS

 BODY:
WASHINGTON (Reuters) -- The number of Americans filing new claims for unemployment benefits dropped to a nine-month low last week, suggesting the labor market's recovery was gaining momentum. 
The picture of an economy gathering strength was further enhanced by other data on Thursday showing that wholesale inventories in October rose by the most in five months, a sign businesses were rebuilding depleted inventories.
''The recovery is picking up some momentum. We still have a long ways to go, but this is very consistent with a recovery that has shown a little bit more resilience in the second half of the year,'' said Paul Ballew, chief economist at Nationwide Insurance in Columbus, Ohio.
Initial claims for state unemployment benefits fell 23,000 to 381,000, the Labor Department said, the lowest since late February. Economists had expected a smaller decline to 395,000.
The report, coming after data last week showed a rise in hiring and a decline in the unemployment rate to a 2 1/2-year low, implied further improvement in a sector that has been the Achilles' heel of the nation's recovery.
It was the latest sign of an acceleration in economic growth from the third quarter's tepid 2 percent annual pace.
Nonfinancial corporate businesses held a record $2.12 trillion in liquid assets like cash during the third quarter, up from $2.07 trillion in the previous quarter, Federal Reserve data showed.
In a separate report, the Commerce Department said wholesale inventories increased 1.6 percent in October after gaining 0.3 percent in September.
A liquidation of inventories cut into the growth of the gross domestic product in the third quarter, and a restocking is expected to help lift the economy in the final three months of the year.
The drop in claims for jobless benefits last week more than unwound the previous two weeks' increase, and returned them below the 400,000 level usually associated with improving labor market conditions.
A four-week moving average of claims, considered a better measure of labor market trends, fell 3,000 to 393,250, the lowest since early April.
A drop in the number of people still receiving benefits under regular state programs after an initial week of aid also offered a sign of an improving labor market. That figure fell to 3.58 million in the week ended Nov. 26, the lowest since mid-September 2008.

HEADLINE: The Real Way to Help Small Business

 BODY:
With only a week to go before Congress adjourns for the holidays, Congress has yet to renew federal unemployment benefits or the payroll tax cut that will expire at year-end. Unfortunately, Republican leaders seem far more interested in advancing their partisan aims than helping millions of struggling American families. 
The House leadership weighed in on Thursday with a particularly bad proposal. It would extend the current payroll tax cut but gradually reduce the duration of unemployment benefits. And it proposes to pay for both with changes to social spending programs and by freezing pay for federal workers. The bill is also larded up with deplorable amendments, including one that would weaken clean air rules and another that would rush ahead with a potentially dangerous oil sands pipeline from Canada.
In the Senate, the debate has focused on how to pay for a renewal of the payroll tax cut. Democrats want a surtax on incomes over $1 million a year. Republican leaders, wrapping themselves in a populist mantle, claim the surcharge would hurt small businesses and the economy since small businesses are ''job creators.''
Research shows that a mere 1 percent of small business owners make more than $1 million per year. Only about 5.4 million of the nation's 20 million small businesses pay any wages at all. The Republican claim about wealthy small business job creators, it turns out, is based on a convenient and overly broad definition of ''small'' that includes partnerships and S-corporations, like hedge funds, accounting firms, law practices and other often big businesses.
So when they claim to be protecting small business from high-end taxes, Republicans are really talking about protecting big companies whose owners fall into the one-half of 1 percent of taxpayers who are millionaires or better. A surtax would certainly not hurt them.
The latest Democratic bill to cut the payroll tax, blocked by Republicans on Thursday, called for a 1.9 percent surtax on income over $1 million. More important, for any savvy business owner, a surtax would have no bearing on hiring decisions. If new workers are profitable before tax, they will be profitable after tax, even if the employer has to pay slightly more of the profit in taxes.
Back in the real world of small businesses -- start-ups, corner stores, Main Street, small companies in large supply chains -- a surtax on high earners that pays for a payroll tax cut would be helpful because that tax cut would put more spending money in customers' pockets.
Senate Republicans have now blocked two Democratic versions of the payroll tax cut/millionaires' surtax. A new proposal by Claire McCaskill, a Democrat of Missouri, and Susan Collins, a Republican of Maine, would extend the payroll tax cut and impose a millionaires' surtax, but include an exemption for some small businesses.
The proposal is supposed to get Republicans on board. But implying that any small business exemption is needed only amplifies the false claim that small businesses are harmed by taxes on the rich. Unless very narrowly tailored, any small business exemption could all too easily become another loophole for the wealthy.
Congress should pass clean extensions of both unemployment benefits and the payroll tax cut. Based on the facts, as opposed to the rhetoric, a millionaires' surtax is a reasonable way to offset some of the cost.

HEADLINE: Marketers, and Media Companies, Set Their Sights on Latin Women

BYLINE: By TANZINA VEGA

 BODY:
WITH the Census Bureau counting nearly 25 million Latin women in the United States, marketers and media companies have started getting excited about the potential to reach them.
Among the most recent initiatives is a new publication, Cosmopolitan Latina, that will start publishing in May and will be aimed at American-born Latin women who are bicultural and bilingual.
''A lot of marketers understand that they need to invest with the Latino market,'' said Donna Kalajian Lagani, the senior vice president and publishing director at Cosmopolitan. But many Latinos, she said, ''are digesting their information in English.'' 
According to the census, of the Latin women in the United States, more than eight million are native-born and older than 18. ''She's very Latina, but she's also very American. You can't separate the two,'' Ms. Kalajian Lagani said of the new magazine's intended reader.
Hearst, which owns Cosmopolitan, plans to start with one issue in the spring and one in the fall, and at first, it will publish 545,000 copies that will be made available in states like Texas, California, Florida and New York, which have large Latino populations.
Latin women represent a ''core Cosmo brand,'' accounting for one in every four subscribers, said Ms. Kalajian Lagani. The core subscriber base for the print edition of Cosmopolitan is 1.45 million in the United States.
In addition to the new publication, Cosmopolitan will add content and advertising dedicated to Latin women in 750,000 copies of its regular issue. The Cosmopolitan Web site will have a separate tab for Latino-focused content and will offer Web-only articles written by Latina bloggers in addition to the content from Cosmopolitan Latina. Readers will also be able to receive beauty and fashion tips from Latina bloggers on their mobile phones.
The primary competitor to Cosmopolitan Latina is Latina magazine, published by Latina Media Ventures. Latina magazine recently celebrated its 15th anniversary issue by putting 15 Latin women, including the actresses Salma Hayek, Rosario Dawson and America Ferrera, on its cover.
One of the hallmarks of Latina magazine is its use of ''Spanglish,'' or the occasional use of Spanish words in otherwise English text. Michelle Herrera Mulligan, the editor of Cosmopolitan Latina, said the new publication would use Spanish words if it felt ''natural within a story.''
Ms. Herrera Mulligan said the magazine would focus on issues like entertaining, beauty and how Latinas related to their families. The overall voice of the publication, she said, will be one that asks readers, ''What makes you more confident, what makes you bolder?''
Spanish-language versions of Cosmopolitan have more than a million subscribers outside the United States, many of them in countries like Argentina, Mexico and Colombia.
According to data from the Publishers Information Bureau, a division of the Association of Magazine Media, the number of ad pages in Latina magazine increased 11.5 percent in the first three quarters of 2011 compared with the same period a year earlier. Despite a sluggish economy for print media, ad revenue for the same period increased to $20.9 million for the first three quarters of 2011, from $18.5 million for the same period in 2010.
Ad revenue for Cosmopolitan increased nearly 4.6 percent, to $292.5 million, for the first three quarters of 2011 compared with the same period a year before. The number of ad pages fell about 2 percent.
George Cleary, the president of Coty Beauty Americas, a perfume and cosmetics company, said the company was considering advertising in Cosmopolitan Latina. ''The Latina female is very beauty-involved,'' Mr. Cleary said. ''She has a much higher propensity to spend on our brands.''
One of the company's mascara brands, Rimmel, has been showing television ads on Univision and running Spanish-language print ads since September 2010.
Latino women have not gone unnoticed by other media outlets. At Siempre Mujer, a Spanish-language magazine published by Meredith, ad revenue for the first three quarters of 2011 increased to $11.8 million from $8 million during the same period in 2010. The number of ad pages in the magazine increased nearly 30 percent during the same period.
People en Espanol, the Spanish-language version of People magazine published by Time Inc., had a 35 percent increase in ad revenue to $44 million, and an increase of ad pages of close to 30 percent.
Television has also taken note. At the upfront presentations in May, television executives were selling new programming aimed at the Latino market. The annual presentations, which are meant to entice advertisers to buy time during programming, included the introduction of Utilisima, a lifestyle network for Latinas created by Fox Hispanic Media, part of the News Corporation.
Telemundo, owned by NBCUniversal, has made efforts to reach the growing Latino audience, including signing the popular Latina television personality, Cristina Saralegui, for her new show, ''Pa'lante con Cristina.''
Ms. Saralegui has said she would welcome both Spanish- and English-speaking celebrities on the show, which is available, as are other programs on the network, with English subtitles. Ms. Saralegui once edited the Spanish-language version of Cosmopolitan.

HEADLINE: Ford, Feeling Secure, To Resume Dividends

BYLINE: By NICK BUNKLEY

 BODY:
DETROIT -- The Ford Motor Company on Thursday said it would resume paying quarterly dividends to its shareholders for the first time since 2006, as it closes out its third consecutive profitable year.
The company's directors approved paying out 5 cents a share on March 1. Ford recently signaled that it was close to restoring its dividend, and analysts had been expecting an announcement soon, though some were forecasting a slightly higher amount.
The payouts will total about $200 million, Ford said. 
''We have made tremendous progress in reducing debt and generating consistent positive earnings and cash flow,'' William Clay Ford Jr., the company's executive chairman, said in a statement. ''The board believes it is important to share the benefits of our improved financial performance with our shareholders.''
Ford, the only one of the three Detroit automakers to avoid bankruptcy during the 2008-9 recession, will be the first to pay a dividend on common shares since July 2008. General Motors is working to shore up its pension funds before considering a dividend, even though it has more cash than Ford.
Ford has earned more than $17 billion in the last 10 quarters, and it had nearly $21 billion in cash and securities at the end of September. After closing numerous plants and cutting thousands of jobs as part of its restructuring, Ford has been focused on strengthening its balance sheet by paying down debt and improving its liquidity.
Bruce Clark, senior vice president for Moody's Investors Service, said that he expected Ford's cash flow in 2012 to easily support paying a dividend.
''We don't believe that it compromises the commitment to maintain a strong balance sheet,'' Mr. Clark said in a statement.
Ford's chief financial officer, Lewis W. K. Booth, said the company was healthy enough to pay a ''sustainable'' dividend even if the economy worsened in the future. The company has historically reduced its dividend during downturns to conserve cash.
''The shareholders who have invested in us need to get a return on that investment,'' Mr. Booth said during a conference call with reporters. ''As our business improves and our results improve, we'll continue to look to see if we can increase the dividend.''
Ford suspended its common-stock dividend of 5 cents a share in September 2006, the same month it hired Alan R. Mulally as chief executive and a year after its credit rating fell into junk status. Company officials had said they intended to resume a dividend after regaining an investment-grade rating, but in October, Mr. Booth said the dividend might be restored even before that happened.
Ford was upgraded by each of the three credit agencies in October after it signed a four-year labor agreement with the United Automobile Workers union, to one notch below investment grade. Several analysts said the deal, which increases Ford's labor costs by about 1 percent annually, paved the way for the company to bring back a dividend in the first quarter.
Brian Johnson, an analyst with Barclays Capital, had projected an 8 cent dividend in the first and second quarters, and Adam Jonas of Morgan Stanley estimated that Ford would pay up to $1.2 billion in dividends next year, or an average of about 7.5 cents a quarter.
Mr. Johnson, in a note to clients Thursday, said the dividend ''should put Ford more on the radar screen of dividend income funds.'' He said Ford probably will increase the dividend amount later in 2012.
Shares of Ford rose after the dividend was announced but were down 2.98 percent on the day to close at $10.75.
Members of the Ford family, which own almost 71 million shares of Class B stock in the company, will receive $3.5 million quarterly from a 5-cent dividend. Mr. Mulally stands to receive about $850,000 from his ownership of more than 17 million shares.

HEADLINE: Iran Shows Video It Says Is of U.S. Drone

BYLINE: By RICK GLADSTONE; Reporting was contributed by Artin Afkhami from Boston, Scott Shane, Eric Schmitt and Thom Shanker from Washington, and Sergio Pecanha from New York.

 BODY:
Iran paraded what its military described as a captured C.I.A. stealth drone on national television on Thursday and lodged an official diplomatic protest, portraying the visual images as an intelligence and propaganda windfall in its conflict with the West over its nuclear program.
American officials viewing the video declined to confirm or deny that the aircraft shown was the one that they have said was lost several days ago by controllers in neighboring Afghanistan. 
The two-and-a-half-minute video clip of the remote-controlled surveillance aircraft was presented by Iran as the first visual evidence that it had had possession of the drone since Sunday, when Iran asserted that its military downed the aircraft 140 miles inside Iranian territory. American officials have said the drone was lost because of a malfunction.
The aircraft shown on Iranian television appeared to be in good condition, which would seem to be inconsistent with an uncontrolled landing, although a close inspection of the images appeared to show a fracture on part of the wing that had been taped.
The aircraft was displayed on a platform clearly constructed for propaganda purposes, with photographs of ayatollahs who led Iran's revolution behind it and a desecrated version of the American flag. But the display did not show the undercarriage of the aircraft, which could have revealed possible damage.
At the Pentagon, senior officials would say only that the images from Iran were being analyzed by specialists both in the military and in other parts of the government, presumably intelligence agencies. A C.I.A. spokesman declined to comment.
American officials did not assert that the aircraft was a fake, and independent experts offered mixed assessments.
John Pike, director of GlobalSecurity.org, a consulting firm, said he would have expected far more damage if the aircraft had hit the ground in an uncontrolled crash. But Richard F. Healing, an aviation consultant, said many drones were ''basically gliders,'' with large wings relative to their weight. If it ran out of fuel, he said, a drone ''might come down gently'' and be damaged only lightly if it did not hit something.
Iran also said it had formally protested what it said was the drone's violation of Iranian airspace. Because Iran and the United States have no direct diplomatic relations, Iran summoned the ambassador from Switzerland, which manages American interests in Iran.
American officials have identified the missing drone as an RQ-170 Sentinel, an unarmed bat-winged aircraft used by the C.I.A. It can linger undetected for hours at 50,000 feet, far higher than many aircraft, with cameras and other sensor equipment to monitor activity on the ground. An RQ-170 was used to gather intelligence for the raid that killed Osama bin Laden in Pakistan in May.
The loss of an RQ-170 in Iran is a potentially significant intelligence blow for the United States, which has been stepping up efforts to monitor suspected nuclear sites in Iran.
The United Nations issued a report on Nov. 8 that said Iran might be actively working on a nuclear weapon and a missile delivery system. Iran insists its nuclear program is peaceful and has denounced the report as a fabricated pretext for new Western economic sanctions and possible military intervention.
Iran's leaders point to the drone as evidence of hostile American intentions.
The video was narrated by a voice that said Iran's Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps and army had collaborated in a ''sophisticated electronic attack'' to bring down the plane. The unidentified narrator gave the drone's dimensions as about 85 feet wide, 15 feet long and nearly 6 feet high. The narrator also said it had ''electronic surveillance systems and various radars.''
In an apparent attempt to explain the aircraft's undamaged appearance, a Revolutionary Guards commander, identified as Brig. Gen. Amir Ali Hajizadeh, said in the video that it ''was brought down by Iran's military systems with the minimum damage possible.''
American military experts have cast doubt on Iran's assertions partly because of the drone's ability to avoid radar detection. ''It would be almost impossible for Iran to shoot down an RQ-170 because it is stealthy, therefore, the Iranian air defenses can't see it,'' Loren Thompson, an analyst at the Lexington Institute in Arlington, Va., told the newspaper The Military Times. ''Partly for the same reason, it is exceedingly unlikely that they used a cyberattack to bring down the aircraft.''
Nonetheless, it remains unclear how American controllers lost contact with the missing drone and how it appeared to have ended up, seemingly intact, on the ground in Iran. American officials have not specified where it was lost. Iran's state-run press has said that it landed near the town of Kashmar, about 140 miles from the Afghan border.
Iran's semiofficial Mehr News agency reported on Thursday that Russian and Chinese officials had asked for permission to inspect the captured drone.
RQ-170 flights are among the most secret of the C.I.A.'s intelligence-gathering efforts in Iran, according to American experts and officials who have been briefed about them.

HEADLINE: Used Batteries From U.S. Expose Mexicans to Risk

BYLINE: By ELISABETH ROSENTHAL; Andrew W. Lehren contributed reporting from New York, and Karla Zabludovsky from Mexico City. David Agren contributed research from Guadalajara, Mexico.

 BODY:
NAUCALPAN DE JUAREZ, Mexico -- The spent batteries Americans turn in for recycling are increasingly being sent to Mexico, where their lead is often extracted by crude methods that are illegal in the United States, exposing plant workers and local residents to dangerous levels of a toxic metal.
The rising flow of batteries is a result of strict new Environmental Protection Agency standards on lead pollution, which make domestic recycling more difficult and expensive, but do not prohibit companies from exporting the work and the danger to countries where standards are low and enforcement is lax.
Mexican environmental officials acknowledge that they lack the money, manpower and technical capacity to police a fast-growing industry now operating in many parts of the country, often in dilapidated neighborhoods like the one here, 30 miles northwest of Mexico City. 
Batteries are imported through official channels or smuggled in to satisfy a growing demand for lead, once cheap and readily available but now in short global supply. Lead batteries are crucial to cellphone networks, solar power arrays and the exploding Chinese car market, and the demand for lead has increased as much as tenfold in a decade.
An analysis of trade statistics by The New York Times shows that about 20 percent of spent American vehicle and industrial batteries are now exported to Mexico, up from 6 percent in 2007. About 20 million such batteries will cross the border this year, according to United States trade statistics, and that does not take into account batteries smuggled in as mislabeled metal scrap or second-hand goods. In September, more than 60 18-wheelers full of old batteries crossed the border each day, trade records show.
Spent batteries house up to 40 pounds of lead, which can cause high blood pressure, kidney damage and abdominal pain in adults, and serious developmental delays and behavioral problems in young children because it interferes with neurological development. When batteries are broken for recycling, the lead is released as dust and, during melting, as lead-laced emissions.
Lead battery recyclers in the United States now operate in sealed, highly mechanized plants -- like labs working with dangerous germs. Their smokestacks are fitted with scrubbers, and their perimeters are surrounded by lead-monitoring devices.
But for much of the past decade, at the vast recycling compound of Industrial Mondelo here, batteries have been dismantled by men wielding hammers, and their lead melted in furnaces whose smokestacks vent to the air outside, where lead particles can settle everywhere from schoolyards to food carts. Officials of the plant, which has been given more than a dozen citations and fines for lead emissions and improper storage of dangerous materials, did not respond to repeated requests for comment.
The recycling factory has put a neighborhood of children at serious risk of lead exposure, said Marisa Jacott, director of Fronteras Comunes, an environmental group in Mexico City. Ms. Jacott wants to test young residents living near the plant but lacks the money to do so. The town's elementary school is on the same block as the recycling plant, which recently moved the bulk of its operations to a larger facility elsewhere. Lead pollution remains in the ground for decades.
A sample of soil collected by The Times in the schoolyard showed a lead level of 2,000 parts per million, five times the limit for children's play areas in the United States set by the Environmental Protection Agency. In most states, that would rate as a ''significant environmental lead hazard'' and require immediate remediation, like covering the area with concrete or disposing of the soil.
''If we export, we should only be sending batteries to countries with standards as strict as ours, and in Mexico that is not the case,'' said Perry Gottesfeld, executive director of Occupational Knowledge International, a San Francisco group devoted to reducing lead exposure.
One Border, 2 Standards
While Mexico does have some regulation for smelting and recycling lead, the laws are poorly enforced and even licensed plants are allowed to release about 20 times as much lead as their American equivalents, said Mr. Gottesfeld, who has studied the export trade.
Some American companies recycling in Mexico say that they already exceed that country's requirements and that they intend to bring their Mexican plants up to American standards. But there is no way to ensure that will happen. The E.P.A. says it ''does not inspect, monitor or verify the Mexican facilities.''
Which is why doctors and teachers in Mexico are demanding testing in a country that has little or none. At her community clinic on the outskirts of Guadalajara, Dr. Lourdes Perez Ramirez said that she routinely saw children with seriously delayed development and that she was convinced that lead poisoning from a nearby recycling plant might play a role, although she cannot prove it, because studies have not been done. ''I think there is danger from the lead,'' she said, ''but to find it you have to look. You have to look!''
Although lead batteries have long been classified as hazardous waste, the E.P.A. only last year began requiring that American companies report their exports -- but already, even that minimal system is not achieving the agency's goal of safer recycling. Exporters must estimate how many batteries they intend to transfer out of the country in the coming year and specify the recipient plant. That paperwork is sent to Semarnat, the Mexican counterpart to the E.P.A., which is responsible for accepting or rejecting the shipments. In 2010, Semarnat never refused.
Then each March, American companies are supposed to tally how many batteries were actually sent, but this year only 3 out of 10 exporters complied.
The E.P.A. declined to speak publicly on the export trade, instead explaining in a statement that its role was ''limited to processing'' the paperwork for the new battery tracking system.
Many people familiar with the industry said more needed to be done.
''We're shipping hazardous waste to a neighbor ill equipped to process it and we're doing it legally, turning our heads, and pretending it's not a problem,'' said Robert Finn, chief executive of RSR, a Dallas-based lead recycler that operates solely in the United States, and is concerned about the loss of raw materials to Mexico.
Sergio Herrera, deputy director for industrial inspection at the Mexican legal agency that oversees environmental compliance, known as Profepa, said regulating the battery trade was an ''important priority,'' but early efforts to control it have mostly exposed the daunting size of the task. A recent government survey found that 19 of 20 recycling plants did not have proper authorization for importing dangerous waste, including batteries. And a retrospective review of truck manifests turned up 142 illegal shipments containing millions of spent car batteries that had not been detected at the border.
Acumuladores de Jalisco, the recycling plant near Dr. Perez Ramirez's clinic, operates without the proper authorization to recycle imports and when it was last inspected in 2006, was found to lack storage for even ''one fifth of the hazardous waste it generates.'' Yet there is no record of any fine, or follow-up, which Mr. Herrera called ''a deficiency on our part in not verifying our procedures.'' The recycler did not respond to repeated interview requests.
Along the border, where American vigilance focuses on drugs and illegal immigrants, there is little effort to stanch the flow, with the Customs and Border Protection agency dealing ''mostly with imports,'' said Erlinda Byrd, an agency spokeswoman, though she noted there had been some spot checks for illegal waste exports. This year, the Mexican government trained more than 200 of its border agents on better detection of illegal shipments of batteries and other electronic waste.
But most illegal activity is discovered by accident: the criminal division of the E.P.A. says it has recently opened investigations into three cases of illegal battery exports, the first such cluster. All resulted from tips, often from American companies trying to operate within government rules, agency officials said.
In Mexico, a truck from Texas was impounded in October after a border agent noticed it was dripping acid. It contained 1,800 spent batteries. The truck's paperwork indicated that it was heading for a licensed recycler, but the driver told the police he was really taking it elsewhere. Another case involved 22.5 tons of batteries sent from Texas whose lead had already been resold to buyers in China.
The amount of lead shipped from Mexico to China has nearly tripled in three years to an estimated $150 million in 2011, according to government trade statistics. Mexico's production of lead from mining has increased only minimally since 2007.
'A Putrid Mist'
Chronic lead poisoning in children is hard to diagnose because the symptoms are fairly common, among them low I.Q. and attention issues. Without blood test results, a definitive diagnosis is impossible. Few labs in Mexico offer lead testing and the cost -- about $100 -- is beyond the reach of poor families.
After Mariel Landeros developed seizures last year in her first months of life, her family worried that the battery recycling plant across from her home in Naucalpan de Juarez was to blame.
Industrial Mondelo has been recycling batteries for nearly a decade, but production has grown manyfold in the last few years. ''As soon as they started, there was a putrid mist over the town,'' said Mariel's aunt, Irma Landeros Aguirre.
She had become increasingly concerned about the problems of her own daughter, Krystell, now 16, who suffered from nosebleeds and stomachaches, and lagged years behind her peers in school. Krystell had been referred for tests and was on a medley of drugs to control her behavior. But she had never had her blood tested for lead.
So when the baby exhibited serious neurological problems, the family visited the National Institute of Pediatrics in Mexico City. Mariel's first test came back at 18.4 micrograms of lead per deciliter of blood when she was 2 months old, well above what doctors consider safe for children. At 4 months, the level had gone up to 24.8. The doctor prescribed powerful medicine to bind the lead in her body so that it can be cleaned out by her kidneys.
According to the United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, ''Blood lead levels of 10 micrograms per deciliter of blood in young children can result in lowered intelligence, reading and learning disabilities, impaired hearing, reduced attention span, hyperactivity and antisocial behavior.'' An advisory task force in the United States has recommended remediation for children to 5 micrograms.
It is difficult to prove that lead battery recycling is the culprit in any one poisoning case, because there are other sources of lead exposure, like lead-based paint or ceramic pottery. But performing crude battery recycling close to where people live is a frightening combination, experts say.
Outside Acumuladores de Jalisco, the recycler at the edge of Guadalajara, open-air restaurants and a farmers' market sidle up to the factory's dirty brick wall. Fruits and vegetables are piled on crates and children play on the ground. A sample of that dirt tested at an accredited lab in the United States contained a lead level of 485 parts per million, a rate unsafe for play areas, let alone food handling.
Lead Is Gold
The American car battery industry likes to boast that it has the highest recycling rate for any commodity -- 97 percent of the lead is recycled -- and most states have laws mandating that stores take back old batteries. Whether deposited at the store where they were purchased or with a local mechanic, used batteries are redirected to recycling plants, where the real goal is not environmental stewardship but extracting the precious lead that is the gold of a protean trading system where traceability is impossible.
The provenance of any one battery is hard to ascertain because big stores like AutoZone and Wal-Mart put their own brand names on batteries that may be manufactured by various companies. Similarly, some large battery manufacturers like Johnson Controls and Exide Technologies take back their batteries and operate some recycling plants themselves. But they sometimes send batteries out to external recyclers, and buy lead from these outside recyclers for their battery-making operations.
At some point in their existence many used batteries are sold to middlemen who ship or sell them for lead extraction to the cheapest processor -- increasingly, in Mexico, despite the transport cost -- so the lead can be reused or resold. The price of lead scrap sold on trading Web sites has varied from 25 to 40 cents a pound in the past year, up from 5 cents a pound a decade ago. The lower the cost to extract the lead, the bigger the profit -- a reality, experts say, that encourages smuggling and has fueled a black market in batteries.
Federico Magalini, a researcher at the United Nations University who is trying to quantify the illegal lead trade, said batteries were ideal for smuggling because -- unlike bulky refrigerators or computer monitors -- they are compact and loaded with lead. ''If you want to make a lot of money you can just smash the plastics, throw the acid wherever you want, and sell the lead at a high price,'' he said.
But the increasing export of lead batteries has hobbled many American recyclers, especially smaller players, who now say they have only enough spent batteries to run one shift a day, resulting in layoffs. ''Our industry is built on the ability to keep that material here,'' said Bruce Cole, executive vice president, strategy and business development, of Exide, one of the largest domestic manufacturers and recyclers.
Already hurt by the recession, American recyclers are now also suffering from the cost of tougher regulation. The E.P.A. has reduced allowable lead levels in both smokestack emissions and ambient air by a staggering amount in the last three years because of a growing appreciation of the devastating effect that even low levels of lead have on health. American recyclers estimate the cost of compliance for a typical plant at $20 million.
Companies are being forced to make difficult decisions.
Exide, which has five recycling plants in the United States, does no recycling in Mexico, according to Mr. Cole, who said it was ''not in our interest'' to ''skirt regulations.''
Some battery brokers have begun trucking their goods to independent smelters south of the border instead of to American plants.
Johnson Controls, the Milwaukee-based battery giant, trucked hundreds of thousands of spent batteries to its own recycling plant in Mexico last year, according to E.P.A. export notices. The company runs one licensed recycling plant in Mexico and is completing construction of a second; it is also building a new recycling plant in South Carolina.
Alex Molinaroli, a senior executive at Johnson Controls, said its plants in Mexico far exceeded that country's regulatory standards and that they would be upgraded to meet the new American standards when they take full effect in 2013. ''We don't have a Mexican standard or a U.S. standard or a German standard,'' he said. ''We have our one standard globally, which today is being driven by the E.P.A.''
Although Johnson Controls has won praise from the E.P.A. for environmental innovation in the United States, its Mexican recycling plant does not face the same regulatory scrutiny.
Working in the Dark
Mexico does have some regulations governing lead exposure, and many plants hire doctors to monitor lead in the blood of workers. But the results are not made public or even disclosed to the workers themselves. If the levels come back high, employees are sent home for several days with an analgesic for the bone pain that typically accompanies adult lead poisoning, said Ms. Jacott, of Fronteras Comunes, who has spent two years interviewing workers. There are no requirements for monitoring lead levels beyond the factory.
Residents who live near the Acumuladores de Jalisco plant said they had been told by the government that the ground water was contaminated with lead, and they tick off maladies they attribute to lead exposure.
The men who disassemble the batteries end each shift covered in dust from their work and must shower and change before they leave, said the wife of one worker, who said that the factory doctor took good care of the men. ''Anyway,'' she said, ''there are not many other jobs around here.''
Environmental advocates and domestic recyclers say the onus should be on the United States to make sure its old batteries do not become Mexico's health problem. Some say a system is needed for inspecting foreign recyclers so they can be held to American standards. But one group, Slab Watchdog, has called on companies like Wal-Mart -- which sells a huge share of the nation's batteries and prides itself on environmentally friendly operations -- to guarantee that their batteries are recycled domestically.
The company's spent batteries, a spokeswoman said, now go to Johnson Controls -- the company that last year sent by far the most batteries to Mexico.

 CORRECTION:
This article has been revised to reflect the following correction: An article on Dec. 9 about the exposure of Mexican workers to toxic lead in spent batteries misstated the unit of measure for estimating this year's lead exports from Mexico to China. According to government trade statistics, such exports will amount to an estimated $150 million, not 150 million tons.

HEADLINE: To Fix Health, Help the Poor

BYLINE: By ELIZABETH H. BRADLEY and LAUREN TAYLOR. 
Elizabeth H. Bradley is professor of public health at Yale and faculty director of its Global Health Leadership Institute, where Lauren Taylor is a program manager.

 BODY:
New Haven
IT'S common knowledge that the United States spends more than any other country on health care but still ranks in the bottom half of industrialized countries in outcomes like life expectancy and infant mortality. Why are these other countries beating us if we spend so much more? The truth is that we may not be spending more -- it all depends on what you count.
In our comparative study of 30 industrialized countries, published earlier this year in the journal BMJ Quality and Safety, we broadened the scope of traditional health care industry analyses to include spending on social services, like rent subsidies, employment-training programs, unemployment benefits, old-age pensions, family support and other services that can extend and improve life. 
We studied 10 years' worth of data and found that if you counted the combined investment in health care and social services, the United States no longer spent the most money -- far from it. In 2005, for example, the United States devoted only 29 percent of gross domestic product to health and social services combined, while countries like Sweden, France, the Netherlands, Belgium and Denmark dedicated 33 percent to 38 percent of their G.D.P. to the combination. We came in 10th.
What's more, America is one of only three industrialized countries to spend the majority of its health and social services budget on health care itself. For every dollar we spend on health care, we spend an additional 90 cents on social services. In our peer countries, for every dollar spent on health care, an additional $2 is spent on social services. So not only are we spending less, we're allocating our resources disproportionately on health care.
Our study found that countries with high health care spending relative to social spending had lower life expectancy and higher infant mortality than countries that favored social spending. While the stagnating life expectancy in the United States remains at 78 years, in many European countries it has leapt to well over 80 years, and several countries boast infant mortality rates approximately half of ours. In a national survey conducted by the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation, four out of five physicians agreed that unmet social needs led directly to worse health.
Unfortunately, instead of learning from countries like Sweden and France, we prefer the frantic scramble to recover money from one part of the health care system only to reallocate it toward retreads of previously failed reforms. We pretend that the fresh schemes are innovative, but they are usually long on promises, short on details and often marked with an annoying acronym: H.M.O., F.S.A., A.C.O. and so forth.
It's time to think more broadly about where to find leverage for achieving a healthier society. One way would be to invest more heavily in social services. This may be difficult for many Americans to swallow as it suggests a potentially expanded role for government. Out of respect for individuals' rights, our current social programs are mostly opt-in, leaving holes for the undocumented, uneducated and unemployed to slip through cracks and become acutely ill. Emergency rooms, though, are not allowed to opt out of providing these people extraordinarily expensive medical treatment before discharging them back to wretched conditions and their inevitable return to the E.R.
The impact of sub-par social conditions on health has been well documented. Homelessness isn't typically thought of as a medical problem, but it often precludes good nutrition, personal hygiene and basic first aid, and it increases the risks of frostbite, leg ulcers, upper respiratory infections and trauma from muggings, beatings and rape. The Boston Health Care for the Homeless Program tracked the medical expenses of 119 chronically homeless people for several years. In one five-year period, the group accounted for 18,834 emergency room visits estimated to cost $12.7 million.
We can learn from the star pupils in our analysis. Other countries have created government ministries that marry health and social care. Earlier this year, the Department of Health in Britain released plans to create health and well-being boards comprising local government representatives, primary care physicians, hospital administrators, children and adult-services specialists and public health directors, who will coordinate care for their constituencies across the health and social care spectrum. We should think expansively about how to construct similar programs that enable much needed integration of these mutually dependent sectors. The Department of Veterans Affairs is leading the way, with programs called ''stand downs'' that simultaneously address the health and social needs of retired service members.
It is Americans' prerogative to continually vote down the encroachment of government programs on our free-market ideology, but recognizing the health effects of our disdain for comprehensive safety nets may well be the key to unraveling the ''spend more, get less'' paradox. Before we spend even more money, we should consider allocating it differently.

HEADLINE: Costco Reports 2.6% Increase In Net Income

BYLINE: By THE ASSOCIATED PRESS

 BODY:
The Costco Wholesale Corporation reported Thursday that its first-quarter profit rose 2.6 percent as revenue grew significantly and it kept prices low on gas, food and other products to gain market share. 
The wholesale club operator, based in Issaquah, Wash., has performed better than many retailers during the economic downturn as consumers turned to its clubs for deals on basic household necessities like food.
Costco has long recognized that it must continue to hold that low-price position to maintain its popularity even if it means pressuring its margins from time to time.
While the cost of gas, fresh food and other items rose for the company, it focused on keeping its prices low as it tried to attract shoppers during the holiday shopping season.
Costco reported net income of $320 million, or 73 cents a share, for the quarter that ended Nov. 20. That was up from $312 million, or 71 cents a share, in the same quarter last year.
After adjusting for charges related to a Mexican tax audit and a campaign in Washington state to change liquor laws, the company earned 80 cents a share. That met analyst expectations.
Revenue rose 12.5 percent to $21 billion on strong gasoline sales and benefits of foreign exchange. Analysts expected $21.29 billion, according to a survey by FactSet.
Costco said its customers bought more books, small electronics and jewelry in addition to necessities. Costco reported that revenue at stores open at least a year rose 10 percent. Excluding gas prices and strengthening foreign currencies, the figure rose 7 percent. That is considered an important measurement of a retailer's performance because it excludes results from stores that opened or closed during the year.
Costco opened four new stores in the quarter, and said it expects to end the week with 598 locations around the world.
Costco's shares fell $1.71, or nearly 2 percent, to $85.76.

HEADLINE: Tax Plan Passed, Legislature Faces Smaller Budget Gap

BYLINE: By THOMAS KAPLAN

 BODY:
ALBANY -- Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo and lawmakers declared the income tax overhaul that was approved early Thursday to be a victory for millions of New Yorkers, many of whom will enjoy a modest tax cut next year.
But it was also a major victory for legislators. In a month, they will return to the capital for a new legislative session, and their task of drawing up a new state budget, even in the face of a flagging economy, has suddenly become considerably easier.
The overhaul, which creates a new tax bracket for the highest-income residents while reducing the rate for millions of others, will generate enough revenue to nearly halve the budget gap that lawmakers expected to confront in January. And by allowing the state's so-called millionaires' tax to expire as scheduled at the end of this month, the deal avoided a heated debate that had seemed likely to dominate the budget process next year. 
The Senate voted 55 to 0 for the tax code changes about 9 p.m. Wednesday, and the Assembly voted 132 to 8 around 1 a.m. Thursday. The governor plans to sign the measure into law soon, and the new tax rates will take effect in January.
Mr. Cuomo, at a news conference late Wednesday, even before the Assembly voted, said that he and the lawmakers had now essentially finished ''50 percent of the budget'' for the coming fiscal year, which begins April 1. ''I think it's made it a lot simpler,'' he said.
By averting a confrontation over continuing the millionaires' tax -- actually a surcharge on incomes over $200,000 for individuals that the state had imposed since 2009 and that produces about $4 billion a year -- and reducing the state's projected budget gap, lawmakers will be able to focus more of their attention on other issues, including redrawing the state's political map to reflect the 2010 census, beginning the process of amending the state's Constitution to legalize resort-style casino gambling and limiting retirement benefits for future state and city workers.
The tax package includes the changes in rates and other measures to stimulate the economy, like a reduction of the payroll tax that helps support the Metropolitan Transportation Authority. It is projected to generate nearly $1.6 billion more revenue in the next fiscal year than had no action been taken this week and the surcharge simply expired. That money will leave the state with a projected budget gap next year of about $2 billion, down from a projected $3.5 billion before the tax package was approved.
The Assembly speaker, Sheldon Silver, a Manhattan Democrat, said in an interview on Thursday that he was leery of making further spending reductions after a year in which lawmakers agreed to deep cuts to the state budget.
''We can find some efficiencies, but I think the cuts have by and large been made last year, and anything beyond that would be deeply hurtful and not productive,'' Mr. Silver said.
The Senate minority leader, John L. Sampson, a Brooklyn Democrat, said Democrats would push for ''fairness and equity'' in next year's spending plan. ''You have to face reality,'' Mr. Sampson said, ''and reality is this: You cannot cut your way into prosperity.''
But Senator John A. DeFrancisco, a Syracuse Republican and the chairman of the Senate Finance Committee, said the Republican-controlled Senate would seek further spending cuts.
''We still have to show fiscal discipline and make some real cuts,'' Mr. DeFrancisco said. He suggested reducing optional services provided under the state's Medicaid program, and he added that creating a new pension tier, with smaller benefits, for new public workers, was ''clearly something that should be on the table.''
For the time being, Mr. Cuomo and the lawmakers are basking in the glow of their swift approval of a consensus tax package by a divided Legislature. On Thursday morning, they celebrated its passage in speeches at a meeting of the state's regional economic development councils, and on Friday, the governor plans to highlight key elements of the package with appearances in Binghamton and Brooklyn.
Mr. Cuomo's authorship of a tax package that creates a new bracket for high-income earners is an about-face for the governor, who had campaigned on a promise to oppose any new taxes or a surcharge on high earners, and who had repeated that pledge many times in his first 11 months in office.
At the late-night press briefing on Wednesday, the governor, a Democrat, explained his reversal as a step necessary to preserve his commitment to increase spending next year on school aid and Medicaid -- the two largest chunks of the state budget -- by 4 percent. He said that while he wanted to reduce taxes over the long term, a ''different economic reality than anyone anticipated'' had forced his hand.
''If you want to say, 'I don't want to vote for more revenues -- no how, no way,' then you're saying you're voting for zero and zero for education and Medicaid,'' he said. ''That's the choice, when we talk about the reality that we face, the new reality. That was the reality for me.''

HEADLINE: Two Big German Banks Among Those Told to Raise Capital

BYLINE: By LIZ ALDERMAN; Reporting was contributed by Jack Ewing, Julia Werdigier and Mark Scott.

 BODY:
8:59 p.m. Updated
European regulators on Thursday told many of the region's biggest banks, including Deutsche Bank and Commerzbank, to raise more capital as signs mounted that the European sovereign debt crisis might worsen.
With the region's leaders gathering in Brussels in their latest bid to shore up the euro, the European Banking Authority announced that over all, banks needed to raise 114.7 billion euros ($152.7 billion) in the event the debt crisis was not resolved soon. That was more than the estimate of 106 billion euros in October.
The banking authority's assessment showed that banks in Germany, Italy and Spain would have to raise more capital than previously thought, while banks in France had all they needed. In all, the stress tests showed that 31 of 71 banks needed stronger reserves. 
Bank shares took a hit on Thursday. Commerzbank was down 9.5 percent, Deutsche Bank was off 4.3 percent and UniCredit was down 7.2 percent.
The banking authority came under fire earlier this year for conducting tests in which it did not consider the possibility that one of the 17 countries using the euro might default. Bowing to pressure, the regulators took into account potential losses on the vast amounts of bonds banks hold from troubled European governments in the latest tests.
American banks hold smaller amounts of European sovereign debt. But the Federal Reserve is also planning new tests to gauge the ability of banks in the United States to weather any further deterioration in Europe, which appears to be on the cusp of a recession.
The crisis has become a concern for President Obama, who has warned it could impact the country's economic recovery. The Treasury secretary, Timothy F. Geithner, visited several European capitals this week, urging leaders to address the debt crisis more urgently.
The banking authority's test results came after the European Central Bank introduced new support for Europe's banks, which have been having trouble getting other financial institutions to lend them money amid an erosion of confidence. More European banks have had to rush to borrow from the central bank recently to help finance their operations, a process the central bank said it would now make easier.
With their financing squeezed, some banks could face trouble raising new capital. Already, BNP Paribas, Societe Generale, Commerzbank and other giants have said they will sell assets to raise new money. A number of banks have claimed that the capital requirements will force them to cut lending to businesses and consumers - a step that will further depress Europe's teetering economy.
Mario Draghi, the president of the central bank, expressed concern Thursday that the tougher standards for banks could prompt them to stop making loans, creating a squeeze on credit.
While the additional capital ''should improve the euro-area banking sector's resilience over the medium term,'' he said at a news conference, ''it is essential that national supervisors ensure that the implementation of banks' recapitalization plans does not result in developments that are detrimental to the financing of economic activity in the euro area.''
In response to fears that banks will curtail lending, regulators expanded the definition of reserves to include contingent capital, which is borrowed money that automatically converts to equity in a crisis. That concession should make it easier for banks to meet the requirements.
Banks are also restructuring their debt to bolster their reserves. Some financial firms are buying back or exchanging hybrid securities in a complex maneuver that allows them to improve their capital levels without raising additional money.
''There's no magic bullet to this problem,'' said Karl Goggin, a banking analyst at NCB Stockbrokers in Dublin. He said banks had three options to raise capital: tap private investors, sell assets or turn to their government.
''Most will turn to the first two options, but some will have to consider state aid,'' he said.
The test of 71 banks revealed new problems in Germany, where banks will have to raise new capital totaling 13.1 billion euros ($17.4 billion), more than twice the amount thought just a month ago. Deutsche Bank, the country's largest lender, will need to raise 3.2 billion euros ($4.26 billion), while Commerzbank must increase its reserves by 5.3 billion euros ($7 billion).
The German Finance Ministry said on Wednesday that it planned to propose legislation to revive the government fund it used in 2008 to rescue banks to help banks increase their reserves. In a break from previous practice, the government will be able to force banks to accept aid.
Banks in Spain must raise 26.2 billion euros ($35 billion). The nation's banking giants, including Grupo Santander, are considering asset sales to supplement their capital. The banking authority has said Italian banks must raise 15.4 billion euros ($20.5 billion).
For years, banks in Europe and the United States loaded up on the bonds of euro zone governments. Regulators encouraged banks to buy more by deeming the bonds risk-free, based on the assumption that no sovereign nation in the euro zone would ever default.
The banking authority's assessment on Thursday underscored how those assumptions had been shattered, especially as the sovereign crisis swirled to Italy and larger countries.
Reporting was contributed by Jack Ewing, Julia Werdigier and Mark Scott.
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

HEADLINE: Holiday Theater, in Three Flavors

BYLINE: By ERIK PIEPENBURG

 BODY:
Instead of making Ebenezer Scrooge watch those instructive scenes from his past, present and future, perhaps the ghosts would have completed their Grinch-eradication mission faster if they'd taken him to a show. They might have come up with a list like this one, which divides some of this year's notable holiday productions into three loosely defined, Dickens-inspired categories: Past (for nostalgia lovers), Present (for current-events followers) and Future (for tech geeks or more adventurous-minded theatergoers). Tiny Tim may have wished God's blessings on everyone, but be aware that not all these shows are good for families with children.
PAST
THE Irish Repertory Theater reinvents Dylan Thomas's classic story in a concert version of ''A Child's Christmas in Wales.'' The show mixes traditional and contemporary Christmas music with Thomas's story of what happens to a boy on Christmas Day in Wales. Adapted and directed by the Irish Rep's artistic director, Charlotte Moore, the production includes Howard McGillin (seated above), Broadway's longest-running Phantom in ''The Phantom of the Opera.'' 
Theater 2020 is presenting ''A Radio Christmas Carol, '' a radio-play version of Dickens's story that features Foley artists onstage creating sounds out of everyday materials. The show is being performed in Brooklyn Heights at the 19th-century St. Charles Borromeo Church.
The material may be current, but the storytelling is old-fashioned in ''The Flying Latke,'' a children's Hanukkah show at the Flea Theater. The play tells the story of a boy named Danny Silverstein and a mysterious flying potato pancake that causes a U.F.O. panic, starting on the first night of Hanukkah. The work is adapted by Arthur Yorinks from his children's book.
The ghost of Dickens gets a star turn in a solo version of ''A Christmas Carol'' at the Canal Park Playhouse. Written by Greg Oliver Bodine and directed by David F. Chapman, ''A Christmas Carol, as told by Charles Dickens (himself)'' uses physical comedy to tell the story of Scrooge from the perspective of his creator. Brunch at the theater's Waffle Iron Cafe is available on Saturdays.
Two one-night-only shows merge the past and the present. On Dec. 17 an old art form gets an updating in the ''Gotham Burlesque Holiday Spectacular,'' featuring the performers Dirty Martini, Jo Weldon and Tigger! and hosted by the downtown entertainer known as World Famous *BOB*. On Dec. 12 Ann Harada, who originated the role of Christmas Eve in the musical ''Avenue Q,'' revisits the character in ''Christmas Eve With Christmas Eve,'' a benefit concert for Broadway Cares/Equity Fights AIDS.
PRESENT
MOTHER GOOSE meets Occupy Wall Street in ''Little Lord's Babes in Toyland,'' a purposefully shoddy musical revamping of Victor Herbert's 1903 operetta, ''Babes in Toyland.'' The Brechtian-sounding ''recession spectacular,'' as it's billed, was adapted and directed by Michael Levinton, who is said to have spent seven seasons in a Baltimore community theater production of ''Babes.''
The show, at the Brick Theater in Williamsburg, Brooklyn, is ''not recommended for actual children,'' warns the Little Lord theater company's Web site.
''A Molly Jolly Christmas'' is the first Christmas show starring Molly Dykeman (the alter ego of Andrea Alton), a self-described ''barely lucid poet/security guard'' who riffs on current events while in a pill-induced haze. Each performance will feature appearances by a rotating roster of guests, including the Village Voice gossip columnist Michael Musto, the burlesque artist Vicky Sin and the performance artist Shelly Mars.
Several gender-flexible fixtures on the performance circuit are returning to New York this year with topical shows.
The religiously anti-holiday performer Jackie Beat mounts a new show, ''The Nutcracker,'' which includes an original holiday number called ''It's Beginning to Look a Lot Like Syphilis.'' The downtown darling Justin Vivian Bond returns to the Abrons Arts Center with ''Mx. Bond's Austerity Measures: A Snow Job for the Masses,'' a politically minded, androgyny-embracing musical take on holiday cheer for the anti-Wall Street set.
If Scrooge had a Jewish sister with a scowl and a habit of kvetching about what's happening to the world, she might look like Jackie Hoffman in ''A Chanukah Charol.'' In her new solo show, inspired by Patrick Stewart's ''Christmas Carol,'' Ms. Hoffman meets the ghosts of Hanukkah Past, Present and Future, and gets a visit from the beloved Yiddish comedic actress Molly Picon.
FUTURE
THIS season brings several progressive-minded interpretations of ''A Christmas Carol.'' Scrooge meets steampunk in Pipe Dream Theater's dark musical ''3 Ghosts.'' In ''Reid Farrington's A Christmas Carol,'' Mr. Farrington, a former video designer for the Wooster Group, incorporates images from 35 movie versions of Dickens's novel in an evening of film, performance and installation art. The Bronx Academy of Arts and Dance brings back its show ''Los Nutcrackers'' (the subtitle isn't publishable here), a blending of ''The Nutcracker'' and ''A Christmas Carol'' in which a bickering gay couple meet a thug-angel who takes them back to the night they met while dancing to Lisa Lisa & Cult Jam.
Two shows skew to the dark side. Company XIV returns with its annual Christmas-season adaptation of ''Snow White,'' choreographed and directed by Austin McCormick. This multimedia-rich show, which runs at the Bond Street Theater in Brooklyn, takes its inspiration from the Brothers Grimm fairy tale, mixing opera, circus, dance, projection and live performance. While not recommended for very young children, the piece will appeal to tweens and above.
Also back for another season is ''Nutcracker: Rated R,'' a sex-, drug- and secrets-filled show about a grown-up ballerina named Clara who is transported back to New York in the early 1980s. Bits of Tchaikovsky's original score mix with modern music in a performance that also blends contemporary ballet, break dancing and burlesque. This year the show moves to the intimate nightclub Le Poisson Rouge.

HEADLINE: In Tough Times, a Boom in Cremations as a Way to Save Money

BYLINE: By KEVIN SACK

 BODY:
As Toni Kelly battled lymphoma, first with a bone marrow transplant and then with brutal rounds of chemotherapy, she worried obsessively that her four-year struggle would destroy her family's finances.
Her husband, Doug, refused to consider her pleas to stop pursuing costly therapies. But she knew that after she died, which she did on Sept. 29, there was one way she could keep from adding to the $200,000 in medical debt she would leave behind. Like a growing proportion of Americans, she said she wanted her body to be cremated.
''We did everything we could to cut down other costs, and one of the things Toni said was, 'Let's find out how much it costs to be cremated,' '' Mr. Kelly said. ''If there was a way we could save even $500 or $1,000, it didn't make a difference. Her major thing was not ruining the family.''
All but taboo in the United States 50 years ago, cremation is now chosen over burial in 41 percent of American deaths, up from 15 percent in 1985, according to the Cremation Association of North America. Economics is clearly one of the factors driving that change. 
The percentage of bodies that are cremated has risen steadily for years, for reasons ranging from spiritual to environmental. But a recent study shows that the increase has accelerated during the downturn, and many funeral home directors say they believe the economy is leading people to look for less expensive options.
The disposition of Ms. Kelly's remains cost about $1,600, and that total included a death notice, a death certificate and an urn bought online. It was a fraction of the $10,000 to $16,000 that is typically spent on a traditional funeral and burial.
Family and friends remembered Ms. Kelly, a 54-year-old artist, at a simple memorial service at the golf course in Virginia Beach where Mr. Kelly works as an assistant pro and where she liked to walk their dogs. It was the first cremation on her side of the family, Mr. Kelly said.
''Neither one of us felt that the body itself was really all that important,'' said Mr. Kelly, who raised two sons with his wife during their 28-year marriage. ''We had no interest in being put in the ground, no need for a memorial for the whole world to see. Her concern was the financial devastation she was bringing to the family.''
Many others share that concern, according to a national telephone survey of 858 adults conducted last year by the Funeral and Memorial Information Council. It found that one-third of those who chose cremation in 2010 said cost was a primary factor, up from 19 percent in 1990.
With the cremation rate rising one-third faster than at the middle of the last decade, the cremation association projects it will pass 50 percent by 2017 (still lagging behind Canada and much of Europe and Asia). Although state cremation rates vary widely, from 13 percent in Mississippi to 73 percent in Nevada, every state has experienced an increase since 2005.
Until recently, said Michael W. Nicodemus, president of the cremation association, concerns about cost rarely entered into his discussions about cremation with families at the Hollomon-Brown funeral homes in Virginia's Tidewater region, where he is a vice president. The rationale for cremation in the past was more typically that the family plot had become anachronistic in today's transient society and that cremation afforded relatives and friends more time to gather from afar for a memorial service.
Today, he said, nearly half of his consultations eventually turn to worries about money, and the cremation rate at the company's nine funeral homes has risen to 55 percent, up from 35 percent six years ago.
''People have lost money in the markets,'' Mr. Nicodemus said. ''Their retirements aren't what they used to be. A lot are living off Social Security.'' Some families, he said, have reversed burial plans because life insurance has lapsed or savings have been drained by uninsured medical expenses.
''We had six families to see yesterday, and all six were cremations,'' Mr. Nicodemus said. ''That tells me something.''
African-Americans, steeped in the traditions of open-casket funerals and rousing eulogies, remain the most resistant to cremation, according to surveys. But in the Virginia Tidewater, as elsewhere, even that cultural wall is crumbling.
Kenny Alexander, owner of Metropolitan Funeral Service in Norfolk, Va., said there was enough demand in the area's black community to make him consider buying a crematory, a $125,000 investment. He said 2 or 3 of every 10 families that come to him now asked for cremations. A decade ago, Mr. Alexander said, he did not even know how to price one.
''Unemployment, coupled with the downturn in the economy, the realities of people losing their savings and not being insured, has certainly caused African-American families to look at cremation in a different light,'' Mr. Alexander said.
In some instances, he added, families do not want friends to know because it may carry the stigma of financial hardship. ''We just say the burial is going to be private,'' he said.
Most mainstream religions have relaxed objections to cremation, which were tied to biblically based views of the body as a vessel for the soul and of a heaven populated by human forms.
''America is becoming Hinduized in this way,'' said Stephen Prothero, a professor of religion at Boston University and the author of ''Purified by Fire: A History of Cremation in America.'' ''We're increasingly seeing the human as essentially spiritual and gradually giving up on the Judeo-Christian idea of the person in the afterlife.''
Still, Lorice L. Ottenbacher of Virginia Beach explained that her husband's choice to be cremated, while largely motivated by his beliefs, also had an economic component.
''We talked about how expensive funerals were,'' said Ms. Ottenbacher, whose husband, Charles, died on Oct. 29 after a six-year struggle with Alzheimer's disease. ''He said, 'Well, just take me out to sea and let me swim with the dolphins and I'll be happy.' So that's what he's going to get.''
Whatever the precise cause for the shift, the funeral industry is having to adapt, making up for lost revenue with higher volume and more services, like catered receptions and ash pendants.
Sales of crematories -- there are about 2,200 across the nation, according to the cremation association -- are growing steadily as funeral home directors decide to perform cremations themselves rather than paying others to do so, said Paul F. Rahill, president of the cremation division at Matthews International, a major manufacturer. The ovens burn at 1,800 degrees for 90 to 120 minutes, and a grinder crushes the remaining bone into powder.
To broaden cremation's appeal to the environmentally minded, and to comfort people fearful of fire, the company is marketing a new ''biocremation'' process that dissolves the body with chemicals.
Families seem intrigued. ''In their minds,'' Mr. Rahill said, ''it's a gentler process.''

Beady Eye (Friday) After the contentious breakup of Oasis, the singer Liam Gallagher retained custody of his bandmates (save his brother Noel, the chief songwriter-guitarist) to form this new rock ensemble. Its debut, ''Different Gear, Still Speeding'' (Dangerbird), delivers the processed, raffish Brit-pop of Oasis with one floor-stomping exception: ''Bring the Light,'' an exhilarating retro-rock single with Jerry Lee Lewis-style piano. At 8 p.m., Terminal 5, 610 West 56th Street, Clinton, (800) 745-3000, terminal5nyc.com; $43 advance, or $48 at the door. (Stacey Anderson)
Jane Birkin (Sunday) The Serge Gainsbourg muse and increasingly politicized singer completes the American leg of her international tour, which honors the 20th anniversary of Gainsbourg's death. Her delicate French pop is delivered in unpredictable shifts between husky ardor and finely spun warble -- a sensual soundtrack that has inspired singers including Vanessa Paradis and Carla Bruni. With Joey Arias. At 7:30 p.m., Town Hall, 123 West 43rd Street, Manhattan, (800) 982-2787, the-townhall-nyc.org; $78.50 and $149. (Anderson) 
- Anna Calvi (Tuesday) Art-rock needed another quixotic blonde. Enter Ms. Calvi, a tenacious singer-songwriter from London whose Siouxie-worthy moans cap virtuosic strings and creaking, complex orchestrations. Her beguiling cover of Edith Piaf's ''Jezebel'' is a straight shot of gothic adrenaline. With Eleanor Friedberger. At 9 p.m., Music Hall of Williamsburg, 66 North Sixth Street, Brooklyn, (800) 745-3000, musichallofwilliamsburg.com; $8. (Anderson)
Celebration (Saturday) Their cabaret-laced psychedelia may veer toward the funereal, but this trio from Baltimore is wholly enjoyable live. The singer Katrina Ford is a guttural wailer in the vein of Merrill Garbus from Tune-Yards; the band's latest disc, ''Hello Paradise'' (Friends), added Eastern chromatics into the dark carousing. With Arboretum and Superhuman Happiness. At 9 p.m., Union Pool, 484 Union Avenue, at Meeker Avenue, Williamsburg, Brooklyn, (718) 609-0484, union-pool.com; $10. (Anderson)
- Gary Clark Jr. (Tuesday) This bluesy singer-guitarist may be vaunted as the next Hendrix nowadays, but he's also well suited to be the next Slowhand: at Alicia Keys's recent Keep a Child Alive charity gala, Mr. Clark decimated Eric Clapton's solo on the Beatles staple ''While My Guitar Gently Weeps,'' churning his distorted strings into a euphoric moment of psychedelia. His major-label debut is forthcoming. At 10:15 p.m., Mercury Lounge, 217 East Houston Street, at Ludlow Street, Lower East Side, (800) 745-3000, mercuryloungenyc.com; sold out. (Anderson)
The Devil Wears Prada (Tuesday) Despite the bewildering, self-imposed indignity of sharing their name with an Anne Hathaway rom-com, these screamo rockers from Ohio balance aggressively thrash guitars with blood-curdling histrionics. This slipshod Christian group may be the first religious rockers to take Bart Simpson's sage advice: ''All the best bands are affiliated with Satan.'' At 7 p.m., Best Buy Theater, 1515 Broadway, at 44th Street, (800) 745-3000, bestbuytheater.com; $22. (Anderson)
Jose James (Thursday) The starry-eyed M.C. from Brooklyn has a grave edge to his gentle R&B cadences, which tugs his brassy hip-hop/jazz fusion back from the brink of schmaltz. The classy digressions of his recent breakthrough album, ''For All We Know'' (Verve), paint him as a burgeoning Gil Scott-Heron. At 7 p.m., Brooklyn Museum, 200 Eastern Parkway, at Prospect Park, Brooklyn, (718) 638-5000, brooklynmuseum.org, museumtix.com; $12, or free for members. (Anderson)
Wyclef Jean (Sunday and Monday) His disc ''If I Were President: My Haitian Experience'' (Columbia) was viscerally felt yet fully theoretical; Mr. Jean did make a bid for the presidency of his native country, but it was rejected. Sadly, his reunion with the Fugees also seems like a flight of fancy by now. At 8 p.m., City Winery, 155 Varick Street, near Spring Street, South Village, (212) 608-0555, citywinery.com; $50. (Anderson)
- Sharon Jones & the Dap-Kings (Tuesday and Wednesday) The finest soul-funk revivalists in town deliver a spectacle to rival James Brown on ''The T.A.M.I. Show'' each time they take the stage. It surely must be exhausting, being this marvelous, yet their new disc, ''Soul Time'' (Daptone), compiles outtakes and B-sides that show no dip in their exuberance. At 9 p.m., Bowery Ballroom, 6 Delancey Street, near the Bowery, Lower East Side, (800) 745-3000, boweryballroom.com; sold out. (Anderson)
Spike Jones's 100th Birthday Celebration (Thursday) Parody pop's patron saint would surely have a few rude sound effects for today's political climate. As it is, this zany bandleader left behind a broad legacy to share with the next, irreverent generation; the raspberries punctuating the 1942 Hitler-baiting ode ''Der Fuehrer's Face'' are a master class of substantial absurdity. Expect the hosts Rob Schwimmer and Mark Stewart to be liberal with them. At 7 p.m. and 9:30 p.m., Joe's Pub, at the Public Theater, 425 Lafayette Street, at Astor Place, East Village, (212) 967-7555, joespub.com; $20. (Anderson)
John Lennon Tribute (Saturday) This celebration of the most radical Beatle is as renewable as his pacifist message; it has been held every year since the first anniversary of Mr. Lennon's untimely death. This 31st iteration includes a faithful revisiting of his first solo album, ''Plastic Ono Band'' (Apple), by the rock singer-guitarist Richard Barone, the gospel-soul dynamo Bettye LaVette and more. At 7 p.m., Le Poisson Rouge, 158 Bleecker Street, near Thompson Street, Greenwich Village, (212) 505-3474, lepoissonrouge.com; $25 to $85. (Anderson)
- Darlene Love's Christmas Show (Sunday and Monday) Her lovelorn ''Christmas (Baby, Please Come Home)'' is a holiday rock show-stopper for the ages; her annual yuletide festivities at B. B. King's boite are a New York institution. Truly, this former protegee of Phil Spector has been an indelible voice in pop from the 1960s onward -- the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame certainly agreed when she was made one of the 2011 inductees. At 8 p.m., B. B. King Blues Club & Grill, 237 West 42nd Street, Manhattan, (212) 997-4144, bbkingblues.com; $45 in advance, or $50 at the door. (Anderson)
The National (Monday to Thursday, through Dec. 17) The hyper-literate Brookynites continue to reap the windfall from ''High Violet'' (4AD), their nuanced chamber-rock effort from 2010, with this start of six consecutive nights at the Beacon. Fair enough; their baritone keening and propulsive drumming share a certain majesty with the space. At 8 p.m., Beacon Theater, 2124 Broadway, at 74th Street, (800) 745-3000, beacontheatrenyc.com; $39.50. (Anderson)
'A Not So Silent Night,' With Rufus and Martha Wainwright (Thursday) Almost every branch of the genetically blessed McGarrigle-Wainwright musical clan convenes under the Town Hall rafters: the patriarch (Loudon Wainwright III), his children (Rufus, Martha and Lucy) and their aunt and uncle (Anna McGarrigle and Sloan Wainwright). Sadly, the matriarch, the sublime folk artist Kate McGarrigle, passed away last year; she'll be honored by many friends, including Lou Reed and Laurie Anderson. At 8 p.m., Town Hall, 123 West 43rd Street, Manhattan, (800) 982-2787, the-townhall-nyc.org; $75. (Anderson)
Oh Land (Sunday) The Danish singer-songwriter Nanna Oland Fabricius employs her jazzy waver wisely: it makes even her harshest dismissals, like the wryly near-expletive ''Sun of a Gun,'' hitch with vulnerability. Her second electro-pop album, ''Oh Land'' (Epic), shares the smart club-ready charisma of Robyn and Lykke Li with added R&B flourishes. With Savoir Adore. At 8 p.m., Music Hall of Williamsburg, 66 North Sixth Street, Brooklyn, (800) 745-3000, musichallofwilliamsburg.com; $20. (Anderson)
Rocket From the Tombs (Monday) This band's roiling fury was too great to last -- in fact, these prog-rockers from Cleveland were together for just 12 terse months in 1974-75. Yet their scarcely tamped aggression -- in the singer Peter Laughner's garbled mutterings, in the serrated bursts from the guitarist Chris Cuda -- hinted at the punk explosion to follow shortly. Mr. Laughner died in 1977; the surviving members' reunion show is a long-awaited triumph for proto-punks the world over. At 9 p.m., Bell House, 149 Seventh Street, Gowanus, Brooklyn, (718) 643-6510, thebellhouseny.com; $15. (Anderson)
- Suuns (Saturday) The prog-rockers from Montreal take Hemingway-esque economy with their tunes, stacking small fragments of dissonant melody into dense, enormous waves. Their debut album, ''Zeroes QC'' (Secretly Canadian), merely suggests the sensational power of their live jams. With the Antlers. At 7 p.m., Webster Hall, 125 East 11th Street, East Village, (800) 745-3000, websterhall.com/events; $20. (Anderson)
The Weakerthans (Friday and Saturday) The tail end of these reflective Canadian rockers' Bowery residency promises king-sized nostalgia. Friday offers a full revisit of their languidly poppish ''Reconstruction Site,'' and Saturday tackles their atmospheric ''Reunion Tour'' (both Epitaph). At 9 p.m., Bowery Ballroom, 6 Delancey Street, near the Bowery, Lower East Side, (800) 745-3000, boweryballroom.com; sold out. (Anderson)
- Why? (Thursday) A cabal of oft-prickly indie rockers, Why? displays subtly ingrained hip-hop undertones, as befits a band entrenched in the Anticon label collective of Oakland, Calif. This preview of their forthcoming album should yield major fireworks. At 7 p.m. and 10 p.m., Gould Hall, French Institute Alliance Francaise, 55 East 59th Street, Manhattan, (800) 982-2787, ticketmaster.com; $20. (Anderson)
Yelle (Friday) This dance-pop sprite from St. Brieuc, France, performs alone and also lends her name to a delightful trio, whose ''Safari Disco Club'' (V2) is this year's brightest combustion of New Wave nostalgia and Europop bounce. Francophiles may recognize her cover of the 1980s French hit ''A Cause des Garcons'' from Emma Stone's recent, zany ''Saturday Night Live'' dance skit. With Housse de Racket. At 9 p.m., Music Hall of Williamsburg, 66 North Sixth Street, Brooklyn, (800) 745-3000, musichallofwilliamsburg.com; sold out. (Anderson)
Yuna (Sunday) Nirvana's ''Come as You Are'' is in good hands with this jazzy pop chanteuse from Malaysia; her cover of the grunge hit writhes with tempestuous keys and her gorgeous falsetto lilt, one reminiscent of Bjork for its fragile resolution. Yuma's debut, ''Decorate'' (Fader), of 2010, adds sing-song, Ronettes retroism to her folksy harmonies. With Emily Greene. At 8 p.m., S.O.B.'s, 204 Varick Street, at Houston Street, South Village, (212) 243-4940, sobs.com; $10. (Anderson)
Z100 Jingle Ball, With Lady Gaga and David Guetta (Friday) All the popular kids from the Pop Class of 2011 storm the Garden stage for truncated spectacles. Expect only four costume changes from Lady Gaga, as well as appearances by the French house artist David Guetta, the hipster dance spastics LMFAO, the deceptively bouncy rockers Foster the People, the powerhouse pop star Kelly Clarkson and more. At 7:30 p.m., Madison Square Garden, (866) 858-0008, thegarden.com; $51 to $451. (Anderson)

their baritone keening (with the lead singer Matt Berninger, above) and propulsive drumming share a certain majesty with the space. At 8 p.m., Beacon Theater, 2124 Broadway, at 74th Street, (800) 745-3000, beacontheatrenyc.com

HEADLINE: Long Island Gets Big Grant In Cuomo's Competition

BYLINE: By PETER APPLEBOME

 BODY:
Long Island and three struggling upstate regions were the big winners Thursday in a competition for $785 million in one of Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo's signature development initiatives.
In a session that resembled a pep rally, the state awarded more than $100 million each to four regions: Long Island; central New York, with its hub in Syracuse; western New York, oriented around Buffalo; and the sprawling North Country, which includes the Adirondacks. The state's six other regions each received $49 million to $69 million, including New York City, which received $66 million for 50 projects, many of them focused on lower-income parts of the city.
The largest New York City award was $29.5 million for modernizing the Hunts Point Produce Market in the South Bronx. But in an award that raised some eyebrows, the Ridgewood Bushwick Senior Citizens Council, founded by Assemblyman Vito J. Lopez of Brooklyn, was awarded $845,806 for three projects despite allegations of financial improprieties against the council. 
The awards announcement, hosted by Maria Bartiromo of CNBC and full of upbeat pronouncements about the state's economic prospects, was a far cry from the usual gray press releases common for economic grants. The 10 regions had been asked to submit plans for growth, injecting competition into a process that had long been dominated by political calculations and cookie-cutter strategies.
Mr. Cuomo contrasted the competition with what he characterized as a lackadaisical attitude toward job creation in the past. He said that legislators had already agreed to provide money for a second round of awards next year.
''New York didn't get it; we just didn't get it,'' he said during the presentation in Albany. He compared the attitude of New York to what he saw around the country as housing secretary during the Clinton administration. ''There was almost an old hangover New York arrogance. We just assumed business was going to come here.''
He added, ''We learned the hard way that businesses are not cemented into the foundation.''
The 10 regions in the competition each had councils that put together economic plans and proposed investments based on their strengths in business, location and natural resources.
A five-person panel selected by Mr. Cuomo evaluated the plans developed by the regional councils and picked four winners. Each received $40 million in addition to individual grants that were evaluated by the regional councils and nine state agencies.
Central New York was awarded the largest combination of grants and tax credits, $103.7 million, for projects with focuses including clean energy, agribusiness and biotechnology. One such project, to complete the Central New York Biotechnology Research Center in Syracuse, will receive $2 million.
The North Country won $103.2 million, to be spent on high-tech and traditional manufacturing and the revival of small towns. The largest piece, $9.9 million, is to be spent on rehabilitating a 46-mile rail freight line.
Long Island, which was awarded $101.6 million, focused its proposal on reviving manufacturing and suburban smart growth. Projects include housing and transportation programs in economically troubled communities like Wyandanch, Brentwood and Hempstead; an electric grid project between Stony Brook University and Brookhaven National Laboratory; and a new cancer drug testing facility at the Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory.
Western New York, awarded $100.3 million, focused on eight industry areas, including health and life sciences, advanced manufacturing and energy, with $5.1 million going to support the Roswell Park Cancer Institute's research into the medical uses of genetic sequencing.
A spokesman for Mr. Cuomo, Josh Vlasto, did not respond directly to issues that have been raised about the Ridgewood Bushwick Senior Citizens Council in Brooklyn, which has been under federal investigation in the past for its financial practices. No charges have ever been filed.
But Mr. Vlasto did say in an e-mail, ''The individual projects won approval on the merits after a review by an independent group of businesses, community and labor leaders from all five boroughs.'' He added that the state's Department of Housing and Community Renewal would stay in contact with New York City's Department of Investigation ''about the status of any ongoing investigations.''
No one from the organization was available for comment.
A city investigation into the organization, completed in November, found a number of irregularities, including $218,659 in bonus and back pay in 2008 for its executive director, Christiana Fisher, that board members did not recall authorizing. That amount pushed the total pay for Ms. Fisher, who is also Assemblyman Lopez's campaign treasurer, in that fiscal year to $782,000.
Representatives of Long Island's council said they were pleased, both for bringing together often fractious suburban communities and for the inclusion of transit and revitalization projects for low-income communities.
''It makes all the difference in the world,'' said Stuart Rabinowitz, president of Hofstra University and co-chairman of Long Island's council.
''Long Island has so many different overlapping governments and so many self-appointed civic organizations, it's hard to find one nonpartisan or bipartisan group that speaks for the economic welfare of the entire region,'' he said. ''And this council tried to do that.''
