HEADLINE: A Gates Summit Aims to Fill Family Planning Gap

BYLINE: ANDREW C. REVKIN


HIGHLIGHT: A look at ways to ensure women have the right and capacity to have the family size they desire. 

 BODY:
The Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation and the British government today (World Population Day) have been hosting a London Summit on Family Planning, aimed at expanding access to contraception and related health services for women, particularly in poor urban communities, who want more control over the size of their families. (More on the meeting goals is here. You can track or review the discussion via the Twitter tag #FPsummit.)
I heard about the conference today in an e-mail from Robert J. Walker, the president of the Washington-based Population Institute, which is excerpted below as a "Your Dot" offering.
Not surprisingly, the conference was attacked in advance by groups opposing contraception and abortion. In its newsletter, the Catholic Family and Human Rights Institute charged that the Gates goal is to build a multi-billion-dollar war chest for programs that would take away, through "population control," a woman's right to have babies. In its piece, the group noted, "Even Amnesty International fears the campaign will 'return to coercive family planning programs.'"
The group, practicing extremely selective quotation, failed to note that Amnesty International also said:
Contraceptive information and services - 'family planning' - form an essential part of the health services that women need throughout their lives.
The group dismisses the idea that there is substantial "unmet need" for family planning among women in many poor countries with the same definitiveness used by folks proclaiming risky human-driven climate change is a "hoax." In fact, as with climate, there are real issues related to spin and the realities of the scientific and economic research, but there is also strong evidence for a real problem deserving a response.
Melinda Gates, in a CNN interview a few days ago, described how she reconciles her own Catholic faith with her activism on family planning: "Part of what I do with the (Gates) Foundation comes from that incredible social justice I had growing up and belief that all lives, all lives are of equal value." There's more from her in an "Impatient Optimists" blog post. Here's a Gates Foundation video laying out her argument (followed by more on "unmet need" research and Walker's population thoughts): 
If you want to learn more, I suggest paying less attention to activist newsletters and instead read an invaluable discussion of the research and rhetoric on access to family planning accompanying "Is there an 'unmet need' for birth control," a 2011 blog post by Berk Ozler, a World Bank development economist. 
The comment string includes substantial input from Lant Pritchett, a Harvard development economist who's been embraced by anti-contraception groups for challenging the extent and significance of the family planning gap.
Here's Robert Walker's note: 
The working assumption always seems to be that population growth is a "given," and that world population will be 9 billion by 2050 and there's nothing that can or will be done about it. Projected population growth, however, is just a projection. It's not a prediction. (Demographers are loath to make predictions). To the extent that demographers talk about the assumptions underlying the UN medium variant, which now shows world population reaching 9 billion, by 2042, there's a growing consensus that the assumptions may prove too optimistic (i.e. population may grow more rapidly than projected). Reasons for this vary, but it includes declining donor nation assistance for family planning over the past 17 years, a variety of cultural factors (e.g. prevalence of child marriage, male opposition, and misconceptions about the dangers of contraception). For more about the population projections, see this Woodrow Wilson Center discussion.
In particular, listen to the comments made by Carl Haub, the senior demographer at the Population Reference Bureau:
"It has been - I guess conventional is a good word - to assume that birth rates are going to come down the way they did in the rich countries," Haub noted. 
But there has been a "stall" for many developing countries, which he suggests is caused by fast initial uptake from urban women followed by much slower uptake by rural women. These dynamics, however, are relatively new and therefore are not always well incorporated into current projections.
On the other hand, population projections are extremely sensitive to changes in fertility. If the total fertility rate, the average number of children that a woman has in her lifetime, falls by even half a child, the impact on the long run projections is enormous.
Many of the challenges that we face (hunger, severe poverty, energy, food, carbon emissions) are seemingly intractable. Population growth, which is a , is not intractable. Far from it. There are proven highly cost-effective means of lowering fertility rates: providing access to contraceptives, keeping girls in school, ending child marriage practices, and changing social norms (including attitudes toward women and desired family size) through entertainment media.
And that's why the Family Planning Summit in London is BIG. If its goal of providing family planning services to 120 million more women in the developing world is met, the payoff would be enormous at multiple levels: lower maternal and child mortality, better health, higher educational attainment, poverty reduction, greater food and water security. It would even contribute to climate change mitigation and adaptation.
With the world on the verge of another food crisis (corn, wheat, and soybean prices are soaring again), extreme weather patterns becoming more pronounced, carbon emissions on the rise, loss of biodiversity accelerating, we desperately need some "win-win" strategies in our quest to make the world more sustainable. Family planning is exactly that.
I hope you will devote some attention to the London Summit. Here's my Huffington Post blog on the subject.

HEADLINE: Many Regulators Put Their Attention on How JPMorgan Marketed Its Funds

BYLINE: SUSANNE CRAIG and JESSICA SILVER-GREENBERG


HIGHLIGHT: Authorities are responding to current and former JPMorgan financial advisers who said they had felt pressure to sell the bank's products even when cheaper or better performing options were available. 

 BODY:
Regulators are examining JPMorgan Chase's sales tactics, after claims that the nation's largest bank pushed its own mutual funds over competitors' investments.
Authorities are responding to current and former JPMorgan financial advisers who said they had felt pressure to sell the bank's products even when cheaper or better performing options were available.
Several brokers told The New York Times that they had been encouraged to favor JPMorgan funds, and they described a broader culture that emphasized sales over client needs. Also, in the marketing materials of one major offering, JPMorgan published hypothetical performance results, even though actual returns existed, according to internal bank documents reviewed by The Times. In each case, the actual gains were lower than the theoretical results.
Now, regulators, including the Securities and Exchange Commission, the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority, the Manhattan district attorney and officials in New Jersey and Delaware, have opened inquiries into JPMorgan's sales practices, according to several people briefed on the activities but not authorized to speak on the record. The S.E.C. and New Jersey's Office of the Attorney General have scheduled several interviews related to the case, these people said.
The people cautioned that these inquiries, directed at the bank's Chase Wealth Management division, are at an early stage. No one at JPMorgan has been accused of any wrongdoing.
While the bank declined to comment on regulatory matters, a spokeswoman, Melissa Shuffield, said that JPMorgan "doesn't pressure brokers to sell its funds over any other product."
"We stand behind the integrity of our investment process and fund selection and always place our clients' interests first in every decision," Ms. Shuffield said.
In the wake of the financial crisis, JPMorgan made an aggressive effort in this area, building up its mutual fund offerings and expanding its brokerage sales force. The strategy, which runs counter to the approach favored by much of the industry, proved successful. Even as small investors left the stock market in droves, JPMorgan collected billions of dollars, becoming one of the largest mutual fund managers in the country.
 JPMorgan managed to attract assets, even though the performance of its funds has been just above average. Fifty-nine percent of its funds beat their peer group average for the three-year period ending on June 30 of this year, according to Morningstar, a fund researcher.
 JPMorgan's efforts have been lucrative. The bank collects a fee on every dollar that it manages.
 Such financial incentives, industry experts say, can create potential conflicts. The worry is that banks will favor their own product for profit reasons rather than focusing on clients' interests. It is one of the major reasons many of JPMorgan's rivals have backed away from selling their own mutual funds.
 JPMorgan defends its strategy, saying that customers want its funds and that it has "in-house expertise."
 One of the bank's core offerings is the Chase Strategic Portfolio, which contains roughly six investment models. These investments, which contain funds created by JPMorgan and competitors, are intended to provide ordinary investors with diversified exposure to stocks and bonds. The bank heavily promotes the Chase Strategic Portfolio in its branches around the country.
The product comes with a double layer of fees. Besides the underlying cost for its mutual funds, JPMorgan also collects an overall management fee.
Investors pay as much as 1.6 percent of assets annually. The bank says the average fee is closer to 1.2 percent, adding that competitors charge as much as 2.75 percent for similar products.
Prospective clients do not have a true sense of the product's returns. Marketing documents for the Chase Strategic Portfolio highlight theoretical returns, even though many of the models have actual three-year returns, which were lower.
The bank said individuals who invest in the product are provided with actual performance. JPMorgan further noted that models in the Chase Strategic Portfolio, after fees, had gained 11 percent to 19 percent a year on average since 2009, which the bank says is competitive.
JPMorgan says it follows industry standards in its marketing. The firm says its common practice is to wait until all the components of the portfolio have a three-year return before citing performance in marketing efforts. The bank is currently preparing to add the real returns to sales materials.

HIGHLIGHT: Highlights from the DealBook newsletter. 

 BODY:
Rate Scandal Stirs Scramble for Damages | As unemployment climbed and tax revenue fell, the city of Baltimore laid off employees and cut services in the midst of the financial crisis. Its leaders now say the city's troubles were aggravated by bankers' manipulation of a key interest rate linked to hundreds of millions of dollars the city had borrowed.
Baltimore has been leading a battle in a federal court in Manhattan against the banks that determine the interest rate, the London interbank offered rate, or Libor, which serves as a benchmark for global borrowing and stands at the center of the latest banking scandal. Now cities, states and municipal agencies nationwide, including Massachusetts, Nassau County on Long Island, and California's public pension system, are looking at whether they suffered similar losses and are weighing legal action.
Dozens of lawsuits filed by municipalities, pension funds and hedge funds have been consolidated into a few related cases against more than a dozen banks that are involved in setting Libor each day, including Bank of America, JPMorgan Chase, Deutsche Bank and Barclays. Last month, Barclays admitted to regulators that it tried to manipulate Libor before and during the financial crisis in 2008, and paid $450 million to settle the charges. It said other banks were doing the same, but none of them have been accused of wrongdoing. DealBook »
More Officials to Testify as Diamond Defends His Actions | In a letter to a parliamentary committee, Barclays' former chief, Robert E.

When Corporate Corruption Seems Banal | Eduardo Porter writes in his column in The New York Times: "Perhaps the most surprising aspect of the Libor scandal is how familiar it seems. Sure, for some of the world's leading banks to try to manipulate one of the most important interest rates in contemporary finance is clearly egregious. But is that worse than packaging billions of dollars' worth of dubious mortgages into a bond and having it stamped with a Triple-A rating to sell to some dupe down the road while betting against it?" new york times

HEADLINE: Iowa: Racially Homogeneous, but Politically Diverse

BYLINE: MICAH COHEN


HIGHLIGHT: Iowa is a swing state in every sense of the word. Registered Republicans barely outnumber registered Democrats, and many Iowans are unaffiliated with either party. 

 BODY:
President Obama campaigned in Cedar Rapids, Iowa, on Tuesday, his 10th trip to the state as president. It was the ninth time this year that Mr. Obama, Michelle Obama or Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. has visited Iowa. Mitt Romney, of course, spent weeks in Iowa in the run-up to the state's Jan. 3 caucuses and has returned a number of times since.
Why is a state with only six electoral votes getting such attention? It's a swing state in every sense of the word. First, Iowa has an approximately equal number of registered Republicans and registered Democrats. Second, it is one of the most elastic states, with a large swath of unaffiliated voters who are persuadable, and could plausibly vote for either Mr. Obama or Mr. Romney.
Iowa's competitiveness is partly a function of demographics, but the state's current political dynamic is also a consequence of Iowa's prominent role in the presidential nominating process, according to Mr. Yepsen. "The caucuses have helped contribute to the creation of a healthy two-party system," he said. "Every four years, one party or the other or both, was really doing some intense grass-roots political work."1
Historically, Iowa was solidly Republican, and the state is relatively homogeneous racially, nearly 90 percent white. But as the state's economy and demography changed, so did its politics.
"The farm crisis of the 1980s really broke the back of the Republican Party," Mr. Yepsen said.
The number of Iowans working primarily in farming -- the power source of the state's G.O.P. -- dropped to 56,000 in 1997 from 86,000 in 1982, according to The Almanac of American Politics. Iowa compensated for its slumping agricultural industry by adding white-collar and high-tech jobs and nurturing a growing financial services industry. Today, the state's economy no longer relies so heavily on farming, and economic diversity, in turn, led to more political diversity. Iowa now has a more unusual profile.
It is the 12th most rural state by population, yet it is just about average in terms of median family income. It is also educated -- about 91 percent of residents age 25 or older had at least a high school degree in 2009, placing the state seventh among all 50 states according to the Census Bureau's American Community Survey.2
Iowa is also less politically segregated than many other states.3 With a few exceptions, Republicans are competitive in Iowa's Democratic-leaning regions, and vice versa.
Eastern Iowa tends to vote Democratic, but not by huge margins. There are blue-collar Democrats -- many who work for the automobile industry or in other manufacturing jobs -- in Dubuque and Davenport, Mr. Yepsen said. And there are liberal voters in Iowa City, where the University of Iowa is situated. The Democratic voters in southeastern Iowa, however, tend to be of the more conservative, yellow dog variety. Mr. Obama lost some of these southeastern counties to John McCain in 2008.
Western Iowa, where agriculture is still the backbone of the economy, is the most conservative part of the state, culturally and ideologically akin to its western neighbor, Nebraska. Religious conservatives are dominant in the northwest.4
Central Iowa is the most competitive region of a competitive state. Outside of Des Moines, most of central Iowa is rural and tends to vote Republican. Polk County, where Des Moines is, traditionally votes Democratic. But as white-collar jobs have supplanted blue-collar jobs, Polk County has become more competitive. 
The Republican governor, Terry Branstad, even edged out a victory in Polk in 2010.
Iowa has a relatively small but fast-growing Hispanic population, spread out fairly evenly throughout the state. Despite making up only 5 percent of the state's population, Iowa's Hispanics are being heavily courted by the Obama campaign, Mr. Yepsen said. There are Latino communities in Des Moines; smaller cities like Davenport, Muscatine and Storm Lake; and meatpacking towns like Columbus Junction. 
The Bellwether: Cedar County
In the past three presidential elections, the vote in Cedar County has exactly matched the statewide vote. There has not been even a one percentage point difference. Here's the catch: only 9,665 people voted in Cedar County in 2008. Because of the small size of Cedar -- the county seat, Tipton, has slightly more than 3,200 residents -- the county's penchant for mirroring the statewide vote may be just a fluke, and it is possible Cedar's preferences in 2012 will diverge widely from the state's over all.
The Bottom Line
According to the current FiveThirtyEight forecast, Mr. Obama is a 65 percent favorite to win Iowa. 
Because Iowa's partisan armies are about the same size a large chunk of residents are genuinely swing voters, the electoral outcome is subject to more factors - and more uncertain ones - than most states. In states like North Carolina and Pennsylvania, which have a roughly equal partisan balance but few true swing voters, turnout will be a chief determinant in November. In Iowa, however, the campaigns need to turn out their base and court the state's large bloc of independent voters. 
In Mr. Obama's favor is the state's low unemployment rate, which is well below the national rate and may be helping him with those unaffiliated voters. But Mr. Romney has advantages, too.
In 2008, registered Democrats outnumbered registered Republicans in Iowa, and Mr. Obama carried the state by 10 percentage points. But the 2012 Republican presidential caucuses -- by engaging and registering conservative voters -- seems to have helped to even things out again, Mr. Yepsen said. Republicans now outnumber Democrats.
The Republican caucuses, and the absence of a competitive Democratic campaign, may also help Mr. Romney in another respect: "The media pounding that Obama took from Republicans in the state will still take a toll on him in November," Mr. Yepsen said, "That leaves a taste in the mouth."
1: Notably, New Hampshire, the nation's other darling of the primary campaign, is also both elastic and fairly equally balanced in voter registration among Democrats and Republicans.
2: Iowa ranks far lower in the attainment of bachelor's degrees and advanced degrees.
3: Rick Santorum's famous trek across all 99 of Iowa's counties would not have made sense otherwise. In Iowa, there are Republicans and Democrats throughout the state.
4: This area is clearly visible in dark red in the map of 2008 county-level results above.

HEADLINE: July 11: Has Anything Changed in the Presidential Race?

BYLINE: NATE SILVER


HIGHLIGHT: Five state polls on Wednesday showed President Obama ahead of Mitt Romney by a margin of at least six points, but ultimately our presidential forecast was unchanged. 

 BODY:
On the surface, Wednesday seemed to be a pretty good polling day for President Obama. The latest five state polls, including those in Pennsylvania and Wisconsin, showed him ahead of Mitt Romney by a margin of at least six points.
But our presidential forecast was unmoved - literally. It gives Mr. Obama a 66.1 percent chance of being re-elected, exactly the same number as on Tuesday. Why no change?
The reason is pretty simple: the polls were broadly in line with the model's previous expectations, which had Mr. Obama as a seven-point favorite in Wisconsin, for instance, and five points ahead in Pennsylvania.
There were also polls out in Maine and New Mexico, states that sometimes get talked up as battlegrounds, but really aren't. The model already had Mr. Obama ahead by 14 points and by 12 points in those states.
Mr. Obama should be pleased with Wednesday's polls in one sense. The polls no more than match the model's expectations. But the model has Mr. Obama a little bit ahead in the national race, putting him up by around two points in the popular vote over Mr. Romney and projecting him to 294 electoral votes to Mr. Romney's 244.
In other words, Wednesday's polling was consistent with the hypothesis that Mr. Obama has a small lead in the race. That contrasts with that seemed to show more of a straight-up tie.
Frankly, very little has changed so far in our assessment of the presidential race. In the month that we've been publishing model updates, the projected Nov. 6 result has pretty much always featured about a two-point lead for Mr. Obama. Sometimes that lead has moved a little closer to three points, and sometimes a little closer to one point, but it's remained in a very tight range.
We do sometimes like to narrate even these small changes. I hope that we're able to do this while keeping everything in its proper context. There's nothing wrong with enjoying a baseball game, even though you know it's part of a 162-game season.
But the big picture of relative stability in the race should be kept in mind as well, especially if you're used to seeing coverage in other news outlets that touts everything as a "game-changer."
There are certainly little bits of good news or bad news for the candidates on any given day, but often they wind up being canceled out. Mr. Romney might have a good set of national polls one day, for instance, but a mediocre set of state polls the next. Mr. Obama gets a "win" on health care, then a rather poor jobs report. There's some good economic news out of Europe, then some bad news about manufacturing activity here in the United States. Mr. Obama gets some good-looking polls in Virginia, but some bad ones in Michigan - and so on and so forth.
If you read the evidence selectively, it will be remarkably easy to find a favorable flow of news for your candidate at any given time. But usually you'll be putting too much weight into the importance of some factors while ignoring others that contradict your story. There just hasn't been much change in the race since Mr. Romney wrapped up the Republican nomination.
There is, of course, no guarantee that things will remain as stable straight through to Election Day. But there have been some cycles - most notably 2004, which this race resembles in some ways - in which we were seeing pretty much the same numbers for weeks or even months on end.
I'd like to wait at least a few more days before concluding that the latest news, like the jobs report and the health care ruling, will have little effect on the race. The news over the past few weeks has been at least a little bit more substantive than at some points earlier in the year.
But this may be one of those cycles, like in 2004, when the public is pretty locked in to their choices. If so, the threshold for what news counts as "important" in the context of the presidential race, like things that we might expect to move the numbers by at least a full percentage point in one direction or another, is going to be very high.

HIGHLIGHT: Political news from today's Times and around the Web, plus a look at what's happening in Washington. 

 BODY:
Today's Times

        
Cross-fire on the campaign trail on Tuesday over President Obama's new tax proposals helped bring taxes to the forefront of the election, allowing the president to temporarily shift the debate away from the anemic economy, Mark Landler and Ashley Parker report.

        
While President Obama passed on the chance to address the N.A.A.C.P. at its annual convention in Houston, Mitt Romney will be there to make his pitch to the nation's premier civil rights group, Trip Gabriel reports. Despite the president's overwhelming support among black voters, Mr. Romney is hoping to make inroads with his pro-jobs message at a time of 14.4 percent unemployment among African-Americans.

        
The debate over who is an outsourcer continues between Mr. Obama and Mr. Romney, Michael D. Shear and Richard A. Oppel Jr. report. There is no question about the potential power of that narrative, but in both cases there are deep uncertainties about the fundamental truth to the arguments.

        
Representative Vern Buchanan, Republican of Florida, was cleared of wrongdoing involving his failure to completely disclose some of his financial holdings, with the House ethics committee concluding that any omissions were not "knowing or willful," Eric Lichtblau reports. But the committee is continuing a separate investigation into allegations that Mr. Buchanan tried to influence the testimony of a witness.
Around the Web

        
President Obama is trying to capitalize on a dropping unemployment rate among post-Sept. 11 veterans, Politico reports.

        
The Obama campaign team blanketed Capitol Hill on Tuesday, meeting with Congressional Democrats on how best to attack Mr. Romney, The Hill reports.

        
After losing the Green Party nomination to the presumptive winner, Jill Stein, Roseanne Barr was "on the shortlist" to be the party's vice-presidential nominee, The Washington Post reports.

HEADLINE: To Boos and Polite Applause, Romney Speaks to the N.A.A.C.P.

BYLINE: ASHLEY PARKER and MICHAEL D. SHEAR


HIGHLIGHT: "If you want a president who will make things better in the African-American community, you are looking at him," Mitt Romney said to the N.A.A.C.P's annual convention in Houston. 

 BODY:
HOUSTON - Less than four years after President Obama swept into the White House with the overwhelming support of black voters, Mitt Romney appeared on Wednesday before the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People with a bold claim: "If you want a president who will make things better in the African-American community, you are looking at him," Mr. Romney said.
His assertion was met with cackles and boos - as well as some tepid applause - and was emblematic of his entire speech, in which he tried to appeal to African-Americans, while still offering some tough medicine and policy prescriptions unpopular with them.
In his roughly 25-minute speech at the N.A.A.C.P.'s annual convention here in Houston, Mr. Romney promised to fight teachers' unions and repeal the president's health care plan, both positions that are unpopular among blacks.
When he said would "eliminate every nonessential expensive program I can find, that includes Obamacare," the crowd began to boo - the first of several instances of vocal disagreement. Mr. Romney grinned nervously and deviated slightly from his prepared remarks, as he tried to explain his position.
He also said he would "defend traditional marriage." Though many African-Americans have not warmed to same-sex marriage, the N.A.A.C.P. passed a resolution in May supporting marriage equality.
"I believe that if you understood who I truly am in my heart, and if it were possible to fully communicate what I believe is in the real, enduring best interest of African-American families, you would vote for me for president," Mr. Romney said.
Mr. Romney's speech was blunt and delivered with little of the typical rhetorical flourishes and soaring language that is often aimed at celebrating the history of the civil rights movement.
Instead, the presumptive Republican nominee came straight to the point, awkwardly acknowledging the lack of support among African-Americans for a candidate from his party.
But even as he accepted that reality, Mr. Romney appeared determined to deliver a tough critique of Mr. Obama's economic policies in the face of a restless crowd that at several points booed him.
To the audience, he suggested that their support for the president was misplaced, a mistaken assumption that his policies would make their lives better. In fact, Mr. Romney said, African-Americans would do better if he was president.
"If I did not believe that my policies and my leadership would help families of color -- and families of any color -- more than the policies and leadership of President Obama, I would not be running for president," he said.
His message -- offered with little veneer -- was basically this: you should not support Mr. Obama just because he is an African-American.
Though Mr. Obama, the country's first African-American president, won 95 percent of the black vote in 2008, Mr. Romney is not ceding any ground in what his campaign anticipates will be a close election in November. The black vote, which is still solidly in Mr. Obama's column, could prove crucial in swing states like North Carolina and Virginia.
"This is an honor to address you, and one I had not expected, and one I value very highly," Mr. Romney said, before later promising that, as president, he would return to the convention next year, if invited.
In May, Mr. Romney hired a consultant, Tara Wall, to help with outreach to black voters, and he also visited an inner-city charter school in West Philadelphia, where he was heckled. But his appearance on Wednesday was his most pointed wooing of black voters this campaign, even as he offered a speech that was less conciliatory in tone that many in the crowd had expected.
Mr. Romney also offered an economic pitch to the group, similar to the one he has been making to Hispanic voters - another critical voting bloc, especially in swing states like Colorado, Florida, Nevada and Virginia.
"The unemployment rate, the duration of unemployment, average income, median family wealth are all worse in the black community," he said. "In June, while the overall unemployment rate remained stuck at 8.2 percent, the unemployment rate for African-Americans actually went up, from 13.6 percent to 14.4 percent." 
Last month, speaking to an annual conference of Hispanic officials, Mr. Romney addressed the topic of immigration - both legal and illegal - but ultimately gave a tweaked version of his economy-driven stump speech.
Many in the audience gave Mr. Romney credit for showing up and speaking to the group, but said they were frustrated with certain aspects of his speech.
"I give him thumbs up for being courageous," said William Braxton, 59, a retired attendee from Charles County, Md., with a chuckle. "He was courageous without a doubt."
But Mr. Baxton said he took issue with Mr. Romney's claim that he would be the best president to serve black citizens.
"Oh my God, I was shocked," Mr. Braxton said. "Never ever have I heard him say anything about how he would help the poor or underprivileged, let alone the black community. Maybe his view is that he could tell us what we want to hear and we're supposed to swallow it."
Donna Payne, 48, of Washington, D.C., who was at the convention as a representative of the Human Rights Campaign, said that she thought Mr. Romney "did the best he could," before dissolving in laughter.
"To say he would repeal Obama's health care plan is absolutely a joke," Ms. Payne said. "I can't believe he had the nerve to even bring up repealing the plan in the middle of speaking to an audience that fought hard for the health care plan and for coverage. It's a total misread of who you're talking to."
In recent national polls, Mr. Obama still overwhelmingly leads Mr. Romney among black voters, many of whom are suspicious of Mr. Romney's record on civil rights and diversity, especially when he was the governor of Massachusetts. Upon taking office, for his instance, he eliminated the state's Office of Affirmative Action. 
Mr. Romney is also a member of the Mormon Church, which until 1978 barred blacks from entering the priesthood. But Mr. Romney's father, George Romney, a former governor of Michigan, was known for his aggressive stance on civil rights. The elder Mr. Romney refused to support Barry Goldwater in 1964 because he was worried about his extreme rhetoric and his campaign's appeals to the Southern white segregationist vote, and he later used his perch as the secretary of Housing and Urban Development to try to integrate the suburbs.
Mr. Romney mentioned his father near the end of his speech, mentioning several instances of his civil rights work and concluding: "He was a man of the fairest instincts, and a man of faith who knew that every person was a child of God."
Though Mr. Obama was invited to address the group as well, he canceled, citing a scheduling conflict, and Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. will speak at the convention on Thursday.

HEADLINE: Ad Watch: Obama Pushes Tax-Cut Extension in New Ad

BYLINE: RICHARD A. OPPEL JR.


HIGHLIGHT: President Obama's campaign opens up a new front in its campaign to push a middle-class tax cut. 

 BODY:
6:51 p.m. | Updated President Obama's campaign unveiled a new attack ad arguing that Mitt Romney's tax plan is a sop to the wealthy. The ad will run in key swing states: Colorado, Florida, Iowa, North Carolina, New Hampshire, Nevada, Ohio, Pennsylvania, and Virginia. 
Click on a subsection below to jump to a fact check. 
YouTube
0:04 Romney: Tax Cut for Millionaires
According to Roberton Williams, senior fellow at the Urban-Brookings Tax Policy Center, the average federal tax rate on incomes over $1 million would fall from 31.4 percent to 23.3 percent under the Romney plan, a roughly one-quarter decline. (Mr. Williams emphasized that the Romney campaign has also promised to broaden the tax base but has failed to enumerate how it would do this, making it impossible to fully analyze their plan.) As for the Obama plan, he said that middle-class taxes would not change while wealthier taxpayers would pay more.
0:12 Romney: Tax Hike for 18 Million Working Families
Assuming the extension of the Bush tax cuts and Alternative Minimum Tax relief, those taxpayers who would see their I.R.S. bills rise under the Romney plan (almost 11 percent of all filers) would suffer an average increase of $885, according to the nonpartisan Urban-Brookings Tax Policy Center. The overwhelming number of people in this category make less than $50,000, and they would see tax increases under the Romney plan because of the expiration of three provisions passed in 2009, including the expansion of the Earned Income Tax Credit. The ad does not mention that about 118 million filers would get a tax cut. That includes nearly everyone making $100,000 or more, as well as about 77 percent of those making $30,000 to $40,000, for example, and 94 percent of those making $50,000 to $75,000. 
0:17 Obama: Make Wealthy Pay More
Mr. Obama's newly proposed plan calls for a one-year extension of the Bush-era tax cuts for people making less than $250,000. According to the administration, a one-year extension for people making under $250,000 would cost the government $150 billion in revenue. In a point of comparison, economists estimate that letting the cuts expire for people above that threshold would generate $850 billion over 10 years.
Scorecard
Mr. Romney is basing much of his campaign on the idea he is an accomplished and skilled businessman who could deal effectively with the nation's economic problems. The ad tries to undermine this claim by trying to paint Mr. Romney as an ally of the wealthy and corporations, including those that have sent American jobs overseas.

HEADLINE: Romney in the Lions' Den

BYLINE: CHARLES M. BLOW


HIGHLIGHT: What was Mitt really trying to achieve at the N.A.A.C.P. convention in Houston? 

 BODY:
"I do not have a hidden agenda."
That's what Mitt Romney told the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People on Wednesday at its 103rd convention.
I'm not so sure about that.
I doubt that Romney thought he'd change many minds among African-Americans when he spoke to the group and I'm not convinced that was even his strategy.
The speech sounded like it was designed not for the audience in the room, but for those in Republican living rooms.
It sounded as though he wanted to show force and fearlessness: "Look folks, I walked into hostile territory unafraid and unbowed." This was his version of a Daniel in the lions' den speech.
Talk tough. Get heckled and booed for telling the truth to those who don't want to hear it. Take the president down a couple of pegs in front of the most loyal segment of his supporters.
But I just don't think it worked. Romney benefits from not talking and makes problems for himself when he does speak. His disfluency does him a disservice.
Romney began his speech by doing what too many politicians do when addressing minority groups: point out the problems as if the group isn't intimately aware of them.
"The unemployment rate, the duration of unemployment, average income, median family wealth are all worse in the black community," Romney said. He talked about the "many disadvantaged young people" who "live in neighborhoods filled with violence and fears, and empty of opportunity." He talked about the disproportionate number of black children "in our worst-performing schools."
But the policy prescriptions, to the extent that he offered any, didn't diverge an inch from the platitudes that have become the mainstay of his campaign: cut taxes, cut government, promote business, promote charter schools, fight teacher unions and gay marriage. And of course, "eliminate every non-essential expensive program I can find. That includes Obamacare." Cue the boos.
Of course, he also made the obligatory veiled reference to welfare, saying that he believes that the free enterprise system "can bring change where so many well-meaning government programs have failed."
But these were all Republican bromides. There was little in the way of specifics and no special appeals. This is exactly what his base wants from him. Romney said, "my campaign is about helping the people who need help." That is just vague enough so that everyone can believe that he's talking about them, not "the other." And that is exactly how Romney would like it to sound.
The N.A.A.C.P. was not amused. It issued a statement that read in part:
This morning Governor Romney laid out his policy agenda for this nation.Unfortunately, much of his agenda is at odds with what the N.A.A.C.P. stands for - whether the issue is equal access to affordable health care, reforming our education system or the path forward on marriage equality. We appreciate that he was courageous and took the opportunity to speak with us directly.
The Obama campaign responded to Romney's speech with a five-page memo entitled "Mitt Romney: The Wrong Choice for African American Communities."
Romney said that his "policies and vision will help millions of middle class Americans of all races."
That assertion simply isn't true - at least when it comes to tax policy.
As the Washington Post reported last month:
The tax reform plan that House Republicans have advanced would sharply cut taxes for the wealthiest Americans and could leave middle-class households facing much larger tax bills, according to a new analysis set to be released Wednesday.
Romney has embraced that tax plan.
The Post quoted Sen. Robert P. Casey, Jr., a Pennsylvania Democrat who chairs the Joint Economic Committee as saying, "According to this report, while millionaires will receive a huge tax break, earners making under $200,000 will see their taxes rise significantly."
And when it comes to African Americans in particular, The Center for American Progress Action Fund published a chart Tuesday that pointed out that "2,200,000 African American working families, encompassing almost half of all African American children, would receive a tax increase from the loss of tax credits from the child tax credit and the earned income tax credit" under a Romney presidency while "603,000 millionaires (100 percent), will receive a tax cut in 2015, with the average tax cut for millionaires being $250,000. "
Just helping the people who need help, you know?
On education, Romney, who has already said that he would dramatically scale back the Department of Education to become basically an instrument to fight the teacher's unions, said that under his administration:
For the first time in history, if I'm president federal education funds will be linked to a student, so that parents can send their child to any public or charter school they choose.
Dismantling the public school system is not the same as fixing it. Scapegoating teachers while turning a blind eye to environmental factors affecting poor performance and test results isn't the answer either. And another unsettling fact about charter schools is that they are less racially diverse than public schools, according to a recent study by the Civil Rights Project at U.C.L.A. Re-segregation isn't progress.
Lastly, this was not the crowd for the "repeal Obamacare" message. Blacks strongly support the law. Romney must have known that.
The N.A.A.C.P. was most likely just a prop in Romney's performance. His agenda, hidden in plain sight, was to hold the line under pressure, and speak half-truths to gain power.
12:55 a.m. | Updated
According to Buzzfeed, this is what Romney told a group of donors in Hamilton, Mont. on Wednesday night:
I had the privilege of speaking today at the N.A.A.C.P. convention in Houston and I gave them the same speech I am giving you. I don't give different speeches to different audiences all right.
Romney added:
When I mentioned I am going to get rid of Obamacare they weren't happy, I didn't get the same response. That's O.K, I want people to know what I stand for and if I don't stand for what they want, go vote for someone else, that's just fine.
Revealingly, there was more:
But I hope people understand this, your friends who like Obamacare, you remind them of this, if they want more stuff from government tell them to go vote for the other guy - more free stuff. But don't forget nothing is really free. It has to paid for by people in the private sector creating goods and services, and if people want jobs more than they want free stuff from government, then they are going to have to get government to be smaller. And if they don't want to repeal Obamacare they are going to have to give me some other stuff they are thinking about cutting, but my list takes Obamacare off first and I have a lot of other things I am thinking of cutting.

HEADLINE: Caring About Politics

BYLINE: DAVID BROOKS and GAIL COLLINS


HIGHLIGHT: Brooks and Collins on why people are bored by Obama vs. Romney - and why we shouldn't be. 

 BODY:
David Brooks: Gail, for the past few weeks, I've been collecting string for a column on why young people should care a lot more about politics. And when I say collecting string I mean piling up books and articles on the subject without ever working up the willpower to actually read them.
Gail Collins: Oh yes, collecting string. It is second only to the myth of "the backup column." The column that you will keep in storage just in case whatever you're doing doesn't work out. Which in the real world is devoured as fast as a warm chocolate-chip cookie.
David: Not a lot of people are following politics closely this year. Four years ago, pollsters asked Americans if they found the presidential race interesting. A clear plurality said yes. This year, a clear plurality says no. Somehow they find a race between two androids less than scintillating.
Gail: Well, duh. You have the dramatic change-guy who didn't seem to change anything - although I personally would argue that health care alone was huge. And on the other side, the incredibly boring businessman who has offshore accounts in the Cayman Islands to avoid the taxes most of the rest of the country has to pay.
David: We may be entering an era in which politics is less central. A lot has happened recently - jobs numbers, a health care law upheld, new immigration policies, zillions of dollars in ad spending. And the polls have hardly moved. Obama had a tiny lead four months ago and he has a tiny lead now. Nobody's mind is being changed because nobody who is persuadable is paying attention. It's apathy city.
Gail: David, don't feel bad. I'm happy to tell you it's the Republicans' fault. The normal rule of democracy is that if things are lousy, you throw out the incumbents. But right now the opposition is controlled by people who are totally insane and good at nothing but shutting things down. I would argue that the president, with a Congress composed mainly of Democrats and traditional Republicans, could take care of a lot of our problems. But if people simply want a change, all they've got is the Forces of Loony Doom.
David: Gail, did you accidentally leave the TV on and absorb a night's worth of MSNBC subliminally in your sleep? Your partisan ya-yas are flowing. By the way, if you did, have you seen the world's most embarrassing promo spots, the ones directed by Spike Lee in which the hosts are put in front of some big infrastructure project or the White House and forced to give a pious speech as if they are high school kids running to be Robert Moses? Why can't MSNBC hosts unionize and put an end to this humiliation?
Anyway, the topic at hand is apathy. Granted, I studiously ignore stories about fund-raising numbers. I have never seen compelling evidence that fund-raising levels powerfully influenced a presidential race. Whether Romney outraises Obama or vice versa is totally unimportant.
Gail: Although, the billionaires, good grief. 
David: But I still follow the other political news closely and I still think politics is the most complicated and consequential of human activities, and very much worth obsessing about. I often mention to goo-goo types that Haiti has thousands of N.G.O.'s, which are presumably doing good work (well, at least half of them). But if the politicians don't get governance right, there's only so much anyone else can do. The place will still be a wreck. Politics matters.
Gail: No argument here. It's the Tea Party forces on the Republican side who don't actually believe in politics. They have a my-way-or-the-highway mentality that won't go away until they get the message that most Americans don't want to shut down large parts of the government, privatize entitlements, privatize education, etc.
David: I think you're a bit over the top here. If there is anybody who wants to eliminate entitlements, I haven't met that person. Wanting to reform the schools with charters is not exactly handing them over to Enron. Even Paul Ryan wants government to consume about 19 percent of G.D.P., which is nearly twice as big as it was under F.D.R.
The big argument is over the shape of government and its size, within limits. And I continue to believe that electoral politics presents the sternest character test, especially these days. The job of being a senator or even president just stinks.
Gail: On that last point, I totally agree. Very few people appreciate how hard it is.
David: Imagine all the fund-raising. Imagine all the travel. Imagine all the criticism. These people do it because they are emotional freaks (O.K., I grant that) but also because they want to do good for the country. To run for office, you have to play close attention to what other people want. You have to balance the demands of marketing with the cry of conscience. You get mercilessly punished for each bad decision or unfortunate word, not to mention everything good that you do. We think ill of our politicians not because they are so rotten, but because the tasks are so hard. How can this drama not be interesting?
Gail: I have always loved politics. I have always loved politicians. They are generally truly humble people, even though they're egomaniacs. They understand how much they're under the thumb of average folks back home.
David: I was going through the decades of the 20th century to try to see which of them were primarily political decades. That is to say, was the most important thing that happened that decade political or not? My results follow:
1900s - Industrialization. Not Political.
1910s - World War I. Political.
1920s - Consumer culture and beginning of mass prosperity. Not Political.
1930s - The New Deal. Political.
1940s - World War II. Political.
1950s - Suburbanization. Not Political.
1960s - New Frontier, Civil Rights, Vietnam. Political.
1970s - Feminism. Not Political.
1980s - Reagan Revolution. Capitalist Revival. Semi-Political.
1990s - Silicon Valley. Not Political.
2000s - 9/11, Afghanistan and Iraq. Political.
Gail: Hmmm. Just coming from my own special thing, I would argue that feminism was political. But go on.
David: Yeah, I know, the personal is political and all that. But one has to draw lines.
In at least half the decades, politics was the most important thing that happened, though to be fair in the happier decades politics took a back seat. I think this vindicates my feeling that anybody who is not paying close attention is not paying attention to the one of the main arenas of life in their time. You can try to ignore politics, but it won't ignore you.
Gail: Of course I agree with you. But I can see how this particular campaign is turning a lot of people off. And now that I think of it, I might have been too quick in giving up on the issue of the "super PACs" and their endless money.
Folks in the true-blue or really-red states feel as if their votes don't matter, and they're sort of right - it's as if they've already been counted. And people in the swing states are under such a barrage of attack ads from both sides, they're numb with disdain for everybody involved. I have family visiting from Ohio right now, and they're like refugees from a TV-ad tsunami. And it's only July! There's got to be a better way.

HEADLINE: Many Regulators Put Their Attention On How JPMorgan Promoted Funds

BYLINE: By SUSANNE CRAIG and JESSICA SILVER-GREENBERG

 BODY:
Regulators are examining JPMorgan Chase's sales tactics, after claims that the nation's largest bank pushed its own mutual funds over competitors' investments.
Authorities are responding to current and former JPMorgan financial advisers who said they had felt pressure to sell the bank's products even when cheaper or better performing options were available.
Several brokers told The New York Times that they had been encouraged to favor JPMorgan funds, and they described a broader culture that emphasized sales over client needs. Also, in the marketing materials of one major offering, JPMorgan published hypothetical performance results, even though actual returns existed, according to internal bank documents reviewed by The Times. In each case, the actual gains were lower than the theoretical results. 
Now, regulators, including the Securities and Exchange Commission, the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority, the Manhattan district attorney and officials in New Jersey and Delaware, have opened inquiries into JPMorgan's sales practices, according to several people briefed on the activities but not authorized to speak on the record. The S.E.C. and New Jersey's Office of the Attorney General have scheduled several interviews related to the case, these people said.
The people cautioned that these inquiries, directed at the bank's Chase Wealth Management division, are at an early stage. No one at JPMorgan has been accused of any wrongdoing.
While the bank declined to comment on regulatory matters, a spokeswoman, Melissa Shuffield, said that JPMorgan ''doesn't pressure brokers to sell its funds over any other product.''
''We stand behind the integrity of our investment process and fund selection and always place our clients' interests first in every decision,'' Ms. Shuffield said.
In the wake of the financial crisis, JPMorgan made an aggressive effort in this area, building up its mutual fund offerings and expanding its brokerage sales force. The strategy, which runs counter to the approach favored by much of the industry, proved successful. Even as small investors left the stock market in droves, JPMorgan collected billions of dollars, becoming one of the largest mutual fund managers in the country.
JPMorgan managed to attract assets, even though the performance of its funds has been just above average. Fifty-nine percent of its funds beat their peer group average for the three-year period ending on June 30 of this year, according to Morningstar, a fund researcher.
JPMorgan's efforts have been lucrative. The bank collects a fee on every dollar that it manages.
Such financial incentives, industry experts say, can create potential conflicts. The worry is that banks will favor their own product for profit reasons rather than focusing on clients' interests. It is one of the major reasons many of JPMorgan's rivals have backed away from selling their own mutual funds.
JPMorgan defends its strategy, saying that customers want its funds and that it has ''in-house expertise.''
One of the bank's core offerings is the Chase Strategic Portfolio, which contains roughly six investment models. These investments, which contain funds created by JPMorgan and competitors, are intended to provide ordinary investors with diversified exposure to stocks and bonds. The bank heavily promotes the Chase Strategic Portfolio in its branches around the country.
The product comes with a double layer of fees. Besides the underlying cost for its mutual funds, JPMorgan also collects an overall management fee.
Investors pay as much as 1.6 percent of assets annually. The bank says the average fee is closer to 1.2 percent, adding that competitors charge as much as 2.75 percent for similar products.
Prospective clients do not have a true sense of the product's returns. Marketing documents for the Chase Strategic Portfolio highlight theoretical returns, even though many of the models have actual three-year returns, which were lower.
The bank said individuals who invest in the product are provided with actual performance. JPMorgan further noted that models in the Chase Strategic Portfolio, after fees, had gained 11 percent to 19 percent a year on average since 2009, which the bank says is competitive.
JPMorgan says it follows industry standards in its marketing. The firm says its common practice is to wait until all the components of the portfolio have a three-year return before citing performance in marketing efforts. The bank is currently preparing to add the real returns to sales materials.
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

Alfresco Designs
To the Editor:
Re ''Rooms With a View: The Indoor Look Moves Outdoors,'' by Julie Lasky (July 5):
Back in college, we would regularly haul our motley collection of rickety tables, secondhand sofas and understuffed armchairs out to the dorm's front lawn. Studying, eating, even sleeping were conducted alfresco to remedy the lack of air-conditioning. Who knew we were so far ahead of the design curve? We weren't being prescient; we were simply trying to beat the heat.

Not Your Average Doghouse
To the Editor:
Re ''The New Second Home,'' by Jennifer A. Kingson (June 28):
When I was a kid, my dog had a doghouse that looked like a house in the style of the architect Joseph Eichler. We lived in one, so it was no great shakes to match the roof slope and color scheme (gray with dark gray trim). The total cost was one sheet of plywood and some surplus two-by-fours, plus paint we already had. The roof was removable, the walls had vents and there was an entryway where Chula, the dog, could sit and watch the world go by. Father-and-son building time was one day.
Chula liked her house but, frankly, liked my room even better as a place to sleep. Many dogs later, Terri the Terrorist Terrier is curled at my feet in my office, which is an enclosed porch added on to my Florida single-wide mobile home. She has a doggy door so she can slip in and out to guard our property against burglars, cats and terrorists. Woof. ROBIN MILLER
Bradenton, Fla.
To the Editor:
It is appalling that in an era when so many American families are losing their homes to foreclosure, you choose to run a feature story on doghouses that can cost many thousands of dollars. What were you thinking? JUDITH TULLER
New York City
To the Editor:
Explain to me again why these people can't pay more taxes?
DIANA MATTHEWS
Evanston, Ill.
To the Editor:
These extravagant doghouses might seem like a modern obsession, but the Park-McCullough House, an Italianate home in North Bennington, Vt., built in the mid-1860s, is flanked by a smaller carefully detailed model built as a doghouse for the family's pet Newfoundlands. It was later converted into a playhouse for the children.
I know the house quite well, as I lived in a neighboring house for many years and served on the board of the Park-McCullough House Association. According to its publication, ''The original section of the House's highly popular playhouse was built in 1865-1866 to house the family dog ... Because the details of the playhouse are so faithful to those of the main House, it is assumed that Dudley [the architect] had a hand in its design.'' MARTIN KALISH
Pownal, Vt.
To the Editor:
Once again an example of outrageous, thoughtless ostentation. These doghouses are really for the humans. Those who spend on these things would have a greater legacy and more reason for pride if they were to give the money to save and protect abandoned and abused animals, or to start a fund to pay for medical help when the animal's owner or foster owner can't afford it, or buy food for animals in shelters, or give to a free spay-and-neuter clinic.
Wealthy people will learn a lot from giving to less fortunate people and animals. And guess what? They will have a lasting feeling of the blessings of doing good for others, far outweighing the empty feeling of simply having a fortune. DR. KIRIN NIELSEN
Evanston, Ill.
Outdoor Cooking
To the Editor:
Re ''Rediscovering Fire,'' by Tim McKeough (Shopping With, June 28):
Your article on good grills that don't have to be costly missed an obvious example. For this past Father's Day, I bought my husband a cast-iron hibachi. I am a baby boomer, and a hibachi was what every dad had in my suburban neighborhood of Coventry, R.I. They were portable and did not need a huge amount of charcoal, and the cast-iron grillwork was unbeatable. We grill only occasionally. But as empty nesters, we think the small size is ideal.

Mealtime Squeeze
To the Editor:
Re ''Putting the Squeeze on a Family Ritual,'' by Matt Richtel (June 21):
I read this article about food pouches for children with growing incredulity. Nowhere is the societal cost of this new on-demand product mentioned. Is this really the way we want to go at a time of energy shortages, economic hardship and the increasing degradation of the environment? I see, in the not-too-distant future, sandy beaches littered with sticky, empty food pouches.
Mr. Richtel is right: the anxiety parents feel about feeding their children is not new. Benjamin Spock wrote about it in 1946. Those of us who raised our children in olden times (the late 20th century) also experienced balky children who needed a little drama to ingest a meal, or busy schedules interrupted by their hunger. Our tools were actual food on a fork (traveling into a dark hungry monster's cave, perhaps) or a container of Cheerios.
These are not new needs. They are familiar old needs, and corporations want us to deal with them in a new, wasteful way that makes them a lot of money. Is ''free-range parenting'' really ''a new way of relating to our children''? No, it's foisting off a child's need with a plastic pouch of pureed food.
Does this ''empower'' our children? While we all would sometimes like to be ''as flexible as modern life demands,'' life on the go as it's described by marketers isn't really life itself, but a series of moments we are handing off as we are getting to some event in the future. When are we going to wise up to this? Life is now. Sit down with your children and hand them a banana.
TANYA SHRIVER CASTIGLIONE
Danbury, Conn.
To the Editor:
Mr. Richtel's article presents the implications of squeezing out family mealtime traditions in favor of a more convenient approach to feeding our overscheduled young with food pouches. Please also consider the environmental consequences of throwaway packaging and added energy use.

HEADLINE: Reacting to Fed Minutes, Indexes Dip but Recover

BYLINE: By THE ASSOCIATED PRESS

 BODY:
The stock market bounced back from an afternoon slump Wednesday after the Federal Reserve released disappointing minutes from its June meeting.
At the meeting, the most recent, Fed policy makers cited several threats to the United States economy, including a slowdown in China and a looming budget squeeze in Washington. 
The Fed also did not signal that new steps to stimulate the economy were on the way, and that tripped up the stock market, said Steven Ricchiuto, chief economist at Mizuho Securities USA. He said many traders had hoped to see evidence that the Fed was prepared to begin a new bond-buying effort to prod the economy.
''They didn't get what they wanted to see,'' Mr. Ricchiuto said.
Stock investors took the news badly at first, but by the end of the day they were taking it in stride. The Dow Jones industrial average dropped as many as 118 points shortly after the 2 p.m. release of the Fed's minutes, but recovered most of its losses by the closing bell.
The Dow closed down 48.59 points, at 12,604.53. The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index slipped 0.02 of a point to close at 1,341.45. The Nasdaq composite index lost 14.35 points to close at 2,887.98.
This was the fifth consecutive loss for the Dow. With Europe still completing details of a bailout for Spanish banks and the American economy still sluggish, investors appear to have little incentive to buy stock.
''The bottom line is that there aren't a lot of investors willing to put money into this market,'' said Jeffrey Kleintop, chief market strategist at LPL Financial. ''There's not much to get excited about.''
Corporate earnings for April through June, which started to come in this week, are not expected to help the stock market. Financial analysts forecast that companies in the S.& P. 500 will report a 2 percent decline in earnings for the period compared with a year ago, according to the research firm S.& P. Capital IQ. That would be the first decline in profits since the summer quarter of 2009.
Chevron and other energy stocks rose, following oil prices higher. The price of crude oil jumped $1.90, to $85.81 a barrel, after the government said crude supplies had fallen for a second week in a row, a sign that demand for energy may be increasing.
Energy stocks led the 10 industry groups in the S.& P. 500 index, rising 1.4 percent. Chevron gained 97 cents to $104.85 and Exxon Mobil gained $1.27 to $84.38.
In the bond market, the price of the Treasury's 10-year note fell 4/32, to 102 5/32, while its yield rose to 1.52 percent, from 1.50 percent late Tuesday.

HEADLINE: U.S. Trade Deficit Declined in May

BYLINE: By THE ASSOCIATED PRESS

 BODY:
WASHINGTON (AP) -- The United States trade deficit narrowed in May from April, helped by cheaper oil that reduced imports and an increase in exports to Europe and China. 
But economists cautioned that the global economy had weakened since then. And they noted that the decline in the deficit did not change their growth forecasts for the second quarter.
The Commerce Department said on Wednesday that the trade deficit fell 3.8 percent to $48.7 billion in May, down from $50.6 billion in April.
Exports rose 0.2 percent to $183.1 billion. The increase reflected stronger sales of telecommunications equipment and heavy machinery. Exports to the 27-nation European Union rose 2.6 percent in May from April. Imports dropped 0.7 percent to $231.8 billion. The amount the United States spent on imported oil fell to the lowest level in 15 months.
A narrower trade gap means the United States is spending less on foreign products, while taking in more from sales of American goods.
''It is always nice to see the trade deficit narrow, but I am not sure this will continue,'' said Joel L. Naroff, chief economist for Naroff Economic Advisors. ''The sharp decline in oil prices has faded, and the economies in Europe and Asia have weakened further.''
A separate Commerce Department report showed that American wholesale companies added modestly to their stockpiles in May. But sales at the wholesale level dropped by the largest amount in three years. That could prompt companies to restock more slowly in the coming months, which could weigh on growth this year.
Wholesale stockpiles rose 0.3 percent in May after a 0.5 percent increase in April, which was reduced from an initial report of a 1.1 percent gain. But sales at the wholesale level fell 0.8 percent in May, the biggest decline since March 2009.
American manufacturing has weakened this year, hurt by Europe's financial crisis and slower growth in China. Sluggish job growth and meager pay increases have made American consumers more cautious about spending. Consumer spending drives roughly 70 percent of economic activity.
Paul Ashworth, chief United States economist at Capital Economics, said he did not expect growth to increase from the first quarter's tepid 1.9 percent annual pace. He forecast annual growth of 1.5 percent to 2 percent in the second quarter.
Growth in American exports will slow further ''given the sharp slowdown in economic growth in Europe and Asia,'' Mr. Ashworth said. He predicted that trade would be a drag on growth in the second half of this year ''and probably through 2013 as well.''

HEADLINE: To Find Fields to Farm in New York City, Just Look Up

BYLINE: By LISA W. FODERARO

 BODY:
Back in the 1960s, Lisa Douglas, the Manhattan socialite played by Eva Gabor in the television sitcom ''Green Acres,'' had to give up her ''penthouse view'' to indulge her husband's desire for ''farm livin'.''
Today, she could have had both. New York City (the stores!) is suddenly a farming kind of town (the chores!). Almost a decade after the last family farm within the city's boundaries closed, basil and bok choy are growing in Brooklyn, and tomatoes, leeks and cucumbers in Queens. Commercial agriculture is bound for the South Bronx, where the city recently solicited proposals for what would be the largest rooftop farm in the United States, and possibly the world. 
Fed by the interest in locally grown produce, the new farm operations in New York are selling greens and other vegetables by the boxful to organically inclined residents, and by the bushel to supermarket chains like Whole Foods. The main difference between this century and previous ones is location: whether soil-based or hydroponic, in which vegetables are grown in water rather than soil, the new farms are spreading on rooftops, perhaps the last slice of untapped real estate in the city.
''In terms of rooftop commercial agriculture, New York is definitely a leader at this moment,'' said Joe Nasr, co-author of ''Carrot City: Creating Places for Urban Agriculture'' and a researcher at the Centre for Studies in Food Security at Ryerson University in Toronto. ''I expect it will continue to expand, and much more rapidly, in the near future.''
For city officials, the rise of commercial agriculture has ancillary benefits, as well. Rooftop farms have the potential to capture millions of gallons of storm water and divert it from the sewer system, which can overflow when it rains. And harvesting produce in the boroughs means fewer trucks on local roadways and lower greenhouse gas emissions, a goal of Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg's administration.
Community gardeners and educators have tended plots and grown food for years. But they have only recently been joined by for-profit companies intent on getting back to the urban land.
Gotham Greens began harvesting from its hydroponic greenhouse on a rooftop in the Greenpoint section of Brooklyn last year; it plans to open three more next year in Brooklyn, Queens and the Bronx. The existing operation, with 20 employees, grows bok choy, basil and oak leaf lettuce, and sells to retailers like Whole Foods and FreshDirect.
Brooklyn Grange, another farming operation, incorporated with the intention of finding a site in Brooklyn. But two years ago, a one-acre rooftop became available instead in Long Island City, Queens. The partners, led by Ben Flanner, the president and head farmer, spread out 1.2 million pounds of soil and started planting. This spring, Brooklyn Grange finally made good on its name, starting a second farm on a 65,000-square-foot roof at the Brooklyn Navy Yard, where more than 100 rows feature pattypan squash, scallions and beefsteak tomatoes.
Mr. Flanner pointed out two benefits to an agricultural aerie -- plentiful sun and an absence of pests. ''There are a number of parallels with regular agriculture,'' he said. ''What we don't have are deer or foxes or rodents.''
One challenge: wind, which can whip between buildings and topple delicate seedlings. ''We have to be clever to come up with solutions to reduce the amount of wind on the plants,'' he said. ''We do a lot of staking and trellising.''
Plans are in the works for even larger operations. In March, BrightFarms, which develops greenhouses near supermarkets to shorten the food-supply chain, announced it would create a sprawling hydroponic greenhouse on a roof in Sunset Park, Brooklyn, that is expected to yield a million pounds of produce a year. The chief executive, Paul Lightfoot, said the greenhouse would occupy up to 100,000 square feet, making it the nation's largest such operation when it opens next year. (Recently, the company reached an agreement with the A&P supermarket chain to sell the Brooklyn produce.)
And last month, the city's Economic Development Corporation issued a request for proposals for a 200,000-square-foot rooftop farm on a city-owned building on Food Center Drive in Hunts Point, the food-distribution hub in the Bronx. ''We're testing the marketplace,'' said Seth W. Pinsky, the corporation's president. ''It was a logical place for a rooftop farm. If we're successful at Food Center Drive, our hope would be to replicate this elsewhere.''
While there may be a veritable prairie of empty rooftops in the city, not all are suitable for growing crops, Mr. Nasr, of Ryerson University, said. Roofs must be strong enough to accommodate the weight of either soil or a greenhouse, and if they are not, strengthening them can be costly. Access is also a challenge, with some buildings lacking stairs or an elevator to the roof. Not all roofs enjoy full sun, with shadows cast by adjacent buildings. And neighbors wary of increased traffic and noise can be prickly.
''But in New York City,'' Mr. Nasr said, ''even if you eliminate roofs for all those reasons, you are still left with a large number that could be considered.''
The City Planning Department recently revamped the zoning regulations to encourage green development, including rooftop farms, and the City Council approved the changes. The new rules, called Zone Green, exempt greenhouses on nonresidential buildings from certain height and floor-area limits. Such structures cannot, however, exceed 25 feet in height and must be set back six feet from the edge of the roof.
Amanda M. Burden, the planning commissioner, credited the changes with ''creating more places for urban agriculture to take root in a dense, built-up environment.''
Whether the relaxation of the zoning rules will unleash a flood of new proposals remains to be seen. None, so far, are planned for Park Avenue.

HEADLINE: In Kansas, Stronger Mix Of Ethanol

BYLINE: By MATTHEW L. WALD. 
David Pogue, whose State of the Art column normally appears on this page, is on vacation.

 BODY:
LAWRENCE, Kan. -- Intended as an additive to gasoline, ethanol in modern times was meant to stretch America's fuel supplies, much as a cook uses chicken stock to increase the volume of a soup. By federal mandate, ethanol makes up about 10 percent of most fuel that motorists buy at the pump.
Unfortunately for ethanol makers, Americans are driving fewer miles and upgrading to more efficient cars -- or to continue the analogy, eating less soup.
So ethanol makers want to change the longstanding recipe, trying to persuade gas stations and motorists to buy fuel that is 15 percent ethanol, or E15. And here, between a transmission shop and a Western clothing retailer, the first service station in the nation to offer the new blend for regular cars has just begun sales. 
''I'm a firm believer that we have to do something. You can't just sit there,'' said Scott Zaremba, owner of the Phillips 66 station, which has 14 gas pumps and four for diesel that mix in soy biodiesel with the petroleum variety. ''Being in the Midwest, offering renewables from ethanol and biodiesel fuel are just a natural fit for us.''
Mr. Zaremba and other ethanol advocates acknowledge that it will be difficult to persuade motorists to fill up with E15. Although the Environmental Protection Agency has approved the fuel for cars with a model year of 2001 and later, most major automakers are warning customers to stay away, saying they are unconvinced that it is safe for engines. And the modifications necessary for a gas station to offer E15 may cost tens of thousands of dollars -- a steep deterrent to station owners who have no idea whether the fuel will appeal to customers.
Ethanol's success -- and its challenges -- are in large part a result of conflicting federal mandates. In 2007, Congress decided to wean the country off gasoline by specifying how much ''renewable'' fuel, mostly ethanol, to require in the national fuel supply. Oil companies must blend ever-increasing amounts of ethanol into motor fuel or face possible penalties.
At the same time, the government is also requiring automakers to improve the fuel economy of new cars, reducing consumption of all fuels. By the 2025 model year, cars will have to go twice as far on a gallon as they do now.
Ethanol production has fallen sharply in recent weeks because of rising corn prices, and in the last few weeks, four plants with total annual production capacity of more than 350 million gallons have announced that they will close. Fuel ethanol deliveries were once expected to show steady increases, but the pace of growth has wavered with overall motor fuel sales.
''We should have seen it coming,'' said Doug Sommer, the plant manager at East Kansas Agri-Energy, an ethanol producer in Garnett, a few miles south of here, that supplies Mr. Zaremba's station.
Mr. Sommer's plant, like many, is running below capacity. And as the price of corn, the main ingredient in ethanol, is pushed higher by drought, some ethanol makers are wondering if they will have to shut down. Mr. Sommer's plant was processing 45,000 bushels of corn a day but is now down to 36,000.
The fuel makers say they are in their own bind.
''It's the quintessential immovable object and the irresistible force,'' said Charles T. Drevna, the president of the American Fuel and Petrochemical Manufacturers, a trade association. Fuel makers are supposed to use more ethanol in their blends, but carmakers say that if E15 damages engines, the repairs will not be covered by warranties. ''What do you want us to do?'' he said. ''We can't comply.''
Not so, say the ethanol manufacturers, which petitioned the E.P.A. to approve E15 for most cars. ''The economics are so compelling right now, ethanol being about 90 cents cheaper than gasoline,'' said Bob Dinneen, president and chief executive of the Renewable Fuels Association, a trade group.
He promised ''meaningful savings at the pump'' and predicted that when retailers like Mr. Zaremba's station get going, competitive pressures will pull others along.
Some car experts say that the savings are illusory, because a gallon of ethanol has only about two-thirds as much energy as a gallon of gasoline, so it will take a car fewer miles on a gallon.
The ethanol industry had previously tried to expand ethanol demand by promoting E85, a fuel that is 85 percent ethanol. Although about 10 million newer-model cars on the road are capable of using E85, it has yet to catch on with gas stations or consumers.
Mr. Zaremba, who owns a chain of eight service stations with convenience stores clustered west of Kansas City, hopes E15 will be different. He says he is not selling oil, but ''transportation energy,'' and ethanol is the fuel of the future.
Mr. Zaremba has bypassed many of the technical issues surrounding E15 because he has pumps that the customer can use to select E10, E15, E30 or E85. He has been selling E15 for a while, but only this week began labeling it for use by ordinary cars, and not just ''flex-fuel'' cars that can use any mix up to 85 percent ethanol.
On Tuesday, the first day he was selling E15 more broadly, the price was $3.279, two cents a gallon less than standard fuel, or E10. He noted, however, that the E15 is 90 octane, compared with 87 octane for regular, which could be a big selling point in the future; to meet the new fuel economy standards, he and others predict, the auto companies will move to higher-compression engines, which will require higher octane.
Mr. Zaremba said the fuel was a way to further set apart his stations in a highly competitive market. (They are already distinguished by an ''oasis'' theme, which includes plastic palm trees and Jimmy Buffett songs playing in the convenience store.)
But on Day 1 of the E15 era, buyers were scarce.
Phillip Ferry, of Lawrence, noticed the E15 pump at Mr. Zaremba's station after he had already, by habit, begun filling up his 2008 Toyota Yaris with regular fuel.
Next time, ''I may try that,'' he said approvingly. Mr. Ferry, a cost estimator at a Carstar body shop in Stilwell, Kan., said that ethanol was good for farmers, and that by buying E15, ''we're helping people who need the help.''
Debbie Konrade, of Berryton, Kan., who fills up her 2009 Range Rover two or three times a week on her commute to Kansas City, Mo., also pushed the button for E10. Asked about E15, she said, ''my husband said, 'Don't put it in the car.' '' Still, she said, the idea was interesting and she would ask the mechanic at the dealer next week, when she took the car in for an oil change.
Ms. Konrade probably will not get much encouragement. Automakers have been vocal in their opposition to E15. Some new Toyotas come with a gas tank cap embossed with ''E15-E85'' in inch-high letters with a red circle and slash through them. For years, Ford vehicles have come with a cap that warns against E20, because a few years ago Minnesota was considering authorizing that fuel. General Motors, Chrysler and nearly all the others also caution that using E15 may damage the car and will void the warranty.
''Our vehicles were designed to operate on E10,'' said Cynthia Williams, environmental policy manager for Ford. ''That's what the consumer should be using.''
Still, pressure from the government and the ethanol industry to bolster consumption continues. The renewable fuel standard calls for the use of 15 billion gallons of conventional biofuels a year, most of which is ethanol, beginning in 2015, in addition to billions more gallons of fuel from cellulosic sources like corn cobs or wood chips. Government officials hope that some can be used in aviation or for home heating and that some biofuel is a drop-in substitute for gasoline.
Steve Gardner, the general manager of East Kansas Agri-Energy, said he was rooting for Mr. Zaremba and others who might follow the E15 road. While the fuel is a five percentage point increase in ethanol in the engine, it would mean a 50 percent bump for ethanol suppliers.
''He can advertise to consumers that this was grown down the road by Farmer Jones, and it's supporting 38 jobs here in this county, and we're not sending money to Venezuela and Iraq and God knows where,'' Mr. Gardner said. ''It's win-win-win.''

HEADLINE: Branson Offers a Service To Launch Small Satellites

BYLINE: By NICOLA CLARK

 BODY:
FARNBOROUGH, England -- Virgin Galactic, the space venture founded by Richard Branson, the British billionaire, said Wednesday that it planned to develop a rocket that would carry small satellites into orbit at a fraction of the current cost. 
The news came on the third day of the Farnborough International Airshow, where Airbus and Boeing, the world's two largest commercial jet makers, announced nearly $7 billion in aircraft orders.
''I believe this new vehicle will create a long overdue shake-up of the whole satellite industry, disrupting current norms and limitations,'' Mr. Branson said at a ceremony that also served to present formally a full-size model of SpaceShipTwo, a bullet-shaped craft that Virgin Galactic expects will carry its first tourists into space as early as next year for $200,000 each.
The chief executive of Virgin Galactic, George T. Whitesides, said four customers had already put down deposits to book satellite launchings on the new vehicle, called LauncherOne, which Virgin Galactic said could begin by 2016.
LauncherOne is a two-stage rocket capable of carrying payloads of up to 500 pounds into orbit for less than $10 million a launch. Like SpaceShipTwo, LauncherOne will be carried to an altitude of about 50,000 feet by the company's twin-fuselaged WhiteKnightTwo. LauncherOne will then fire its engines and lift the satellite into its final orbit.
The Virgin Galactic venture is part of an accelerating shift of the business of spaceflight -- once the near-exclusive domain of government space agencies -- to private enterprise. In May, Space Exploration Technologies of California became the first private company to send a cargo rocket to the International Space Station.
Mr. Branson's announcement came amid a break in the clouds and rain that have plagued much of the Farnborough show this year, a metaphor for the general gloom across the aerospace industry. The environment of economic uncertainty, particularly in Europe and North America, has kept most airlines from signing significant aircraft orders.
The world's two top plane makers added a handful of deals to their order books on Wednesday. Airbus said it had received a new order from CIT Aerospace, an American leasing company, for five more of its twin-aisle A330 aircraft, a deal worth $1.1 billion at list prices. The purchase follows a previously undisclosed order for five of the planes.
China Aircraft Leasing, of Hong Kong, agreed to buy 36 single-aisle A320 jets from the European company in an order worth $3.3 billion at list prices.
Boeing won a commitment from another leasing company, Avolon of Ireland, to buy as many as 30 single-aisle 737s valued at about $2.3 billion at list prices. Of those planes, at least 15 will be equipped with the next generation of more fuel-efficient engines.

HEADLINE: He Takes Stuff Seriously

BYLINE: By PENELOPE GREEN

 BODY:
WEST ROXBURY, Mass.
FOR the last two decades, Joshua Glenn has been thinking deeply about things -- nonfunctional stuff like tchotchkes and objects harvested from junk drawers -- in zines and magazines, on Web sites he has produced or contributed to, in story anthologies he has edited and, most recently, in a curious literary and economic experiment called the Significant Objects project.
Mr. Glenn, a writer, editor and semiotic brand analyst, worked with Rob Walker, a contributor to The New York Times Magazine (which was not involved in their project), collecting all manner of insignificant objects, including snow globes, buttons and mysterious figurines, from flea markets and thrift stores. They paid no more than a $1.50 or so apiece and then asked writers like Luc Sante and Curtis Sittenfeld to create short stories around the objects.
Could their narratives add value to nearly worthless thingamajigs, he and Mr. Walker wondered. The answer, it turns out, was an emphatic ''yes,'' as the newly significant objects sold for as much as 2,700 percent of their value on eBay, in a round of sales conducted from 2009 to 2010. (The proceeds went to the writers and various nonprofits.) 
As it progressed, the project gained steam in interesting ways. One week, Paola Antonelli, the senior curator of architecture and design at the Museum of Modern Art, donated the contents of her junk drawer, and noted that the Significant Object stories might illuminate string theory (it's complicated).
Another week, objects foraged from Dead Horse Bay in Brooklyn were ''storified'' and then auctioned off one a day. Copycat Significant Object projects began popping up, including one by a Canadian high school's creative-writing class late last year. And buyers of the objects would add their own stories to those of the objects they had bought, in artwork, videos and blogs.
One such buyer is Molly Peck, a 37-year-old artist who lives in a minuscule two-room apartment in the East Village with her boyfriend, a large yellow Lab and not much else. She bid on about 30 objects, and won 4 of them, she said recently, because, as she put it, ''I'm a chronic empathizer and I wanted every object to get to at least $20.''
What she won -- a ''Necking Team'' button with a story by Susannah Breslin for $36.88; a geisha bobblehead figurine with a story by Edward Champion for $56; a hair pick with a story by Robin Sloan for $13.50; and a gaucho tray with a story by James Reichmuth for $10.50 -- she tucked into a drawer because her boyfriend is a strict minimalist and frowns on decorative objects. ''We don't even have a vase,'' she said.
Eventually, Ms. Peck gave her winnings away. ''But I have the memory of the experience,'' she said. ''That's the whole thing. Instead of buying things, you are buying this intangible set of events.''
You would imagine the home of a guy like Mr. Glenn, 44, to be the antithesis of Ms. Peck's apartment: layered with years' worth of stuff, or at least the leftovers from his recent flea market raids. But the 1930s bungalow he shares with his wife, Susan Roe, a human resources consultant, and their two sons, ages 14 and 12, is largely thing-free.
The ''Significant Objects'' book, into which Mr. Glenn and Mr. Walker collected 100 of their favorite stories, is out this week, and Mr. Glenn invited a reporter to his home on the occasion of its publication to investigate his own significant objects, such as they are, and to answer the question ''What the heck is a semiotic brand analyst, anyway?''
The bungalow is spare and tidy, with simple furniture (an Ikea sofa, a wooden bench, a painting or two) and clean surfaces. The refrigerator is bare of soccer schedules, children's photos and magnets. Mr. Glenn and Ms. Roe will not be appearing on ''Hoarding: Buried Alive.''
''I've been reading way too many women's magazines for a client,'' Mr. Glenn said. ''And I think this is what they're saying: 'Stress causes cancer. Clutter causes stress.' So, basically, clutter causes cancer.''
One could make a case.
Still, Mr. Glenn does have treasures, some stored in a wooden box decoupaged with Elvis photos that Ms. Roe made years ago; others live in his office in downtown Roxbury. He had brought them together to make a few points. If you wonder why it's so hard to clean the junk drawer, take heart in Mr. Glenn's taxonomies.
''The way human beings attribute significance to objects hasn't changed since we began having objects,'' he said, fishing around in his box. ''Even if we don't identify ourselves as collectors, we are collectors of things. And things are collectors of meaning in various ways.''
True collectors, he added, don't attach significance to individual objects; it's the whole that matters. And hoarders attach significance to every object.
Most of us fall somewhere in the middle, Mr. Glenn said, unconsciously (or not) sorting our things -- our meaningful things, that is, our nonfunctioning objects -- into five categories.
Totems are from the natural world, like rocks. He brandished one with a white stripe. ''These are supposed to be lucky, right?''
Idols are objects of contemplation, like those little Buddha figurines. He has one of the laughing variety. ''I used to rub its stomach for good luck,'' he said. ''I don't have a Buddhist practice. I don't want to be alone with my howling mind. But I am attracted to Buddhist logic.''
Evidence is what he calls artifacts from a public event or a crime scene. Mr. Glenn's example is his miniature bust of John F. Kennedy. ''I think everything related to him is evidence,'' he said.
Talismans are lucky objects.
And finally, fossils are things that bear ''mute witness,'' he said, ''to a vanished way of life, which could be something from the 1920s or your own childhood.'' He has a lot of things that fall into that category, including a plastic G.I. Joe medallion, a few toy soldiers and an orange Tonka dune buggy. He also collects vintage board games, comic books and paperbacks with the letter X in the title.
''I played with these way too long,'' he said, meaning the toy soldiers. ''You can probably tell I'm really interested in my childhood. I loved being a kid.''
His childhood, he said, was ''fantastic, nearly feral and free-range.'' (One of seven children, he grew up in two Victorian houses in a progressive neighborhood; his mother, a psychotherapist, and his father, an Episcopalian minister, divorced well, he said, and lived within two blocks of each other.)
He and Ms. Roe moved 12 times in as many years before they bought this house for about $371,000 in 2000. He had dropped out of graduate school in sociology and earned his master's in teaching instead. Then he tried and failed to find work as a middle school teacher, and fell into a job as an editor at the Utne Reader, in Minneapolis, where he had moved with Ms. Roe when she was offered a job there.
Later, Mr. Glenn joined an early version of Tripod, the blog-hosting Web site originally intended as a lifestyle guide for his generation. But it was the blog hosting that took off, and when Lycos bought Tripod in 1998, Mr. Glenn was awarded stock options worth about $80,000, he said.
This cushion allowed him to focus on Hermenaut, an indie philosophy zine-turned-bound-journal that he had cooked up in the '90s, which had a steady circulation of 5,000. (Articles included ''Smells Like Teen Reification,'' a takedown of Sassy magazine written by Mr. Glenn, and features that celebrated ''outsider intellectuals'' like Bruce Lee and Oscar Wilde.)
But when he was offered investment money from a friend who had AOL stock, just before the Time Warner merger, Mr. Glenn began doubling the frequency of his magazine in anticipation of a windfall. ''You know how that turned out,'' he said ruefully, adding that he went into serious credit card debt.
That's when a friend hired him to help with a new marketing business, doing semiotic brand analysis. As Mr. Glenn explained it, he and his peers put on their Roland Barthes hats to analyze texts and images from the pop culture universe (everything from packaging and advertising to women's magazines and contemporary films) and prepare reports for marketing companies on how a product or idea means. Not what, but how.
It's a job uniquely suited to someone like Mr. Glenn, who has an appetite for intellectual shenanigans and is unbound by an academic career. Also, it pays well (enough so that he can work half the month for his marketing clients and devote the rest to his publishing ventures). He spent much of last week staring at photos of shirtless male celebrities, looking for meaning for a marketing company working for a maker of male grooming products. ''I'm finding the signal in the noise,'' he said bravely. ''I've seen hundreds, no, millions of naked chests. I'm a little traumatized. Hugh Jackman is a complete throwback compared to most celebrities. He has a lot of hair, though it seems to be shaped a bit. And Channing Tatum, of course, is completely hairless.''
But he has cracked some codes, Mr. Glenn said, and he predicts a return of chest hair in the future. ''Just a little. And in five ways. But I can't tell you what they are. It's a fine line. You're splitting hairs, as it were.''
Meanwhile, the Significant Objects project continues. Bloggers at Design Observer and Wired were excited by the opening of the Museum of Innocence late last spring, and proclaimed its existence as proof that SO had become an honest-to-God meme.
The Museum of Innocence, to explain, started life as a novel, a tale of obsessive love written by Orhan Pamuk, the Nobel -winning Turkish author, and published in 2008. The novel's protagonist collects evidence, as Mr. Glenn would say, of his short-lived, ill-fated affair -- an earring, a purse, thousands of cigarette butts -- along with fossils, to continue using Mr. Glenn's taxonomies, from the 1970s, when the affair occurred, and creates a museum with them.
Using most of his $1.5 million prize money, Mr. Pamuk bought a town house in Istanbul and, in April, opened its doors to reveal an actual museum, complete with 4,213 cigarette butts in a vitrine, household objects, even the bed where the protagonist slept in the last years of his life.
For this author-turned-curator, the objects tell a story about his characters, and a larger story about Istanbul's painful and incomplete metamorphosis into a modern Western city. By all accounts, the museum is well attended, proving, as Mr. Glenn and Mr. Walker's social experiment continues to do, that stories add value in unaccountable ways.
There is one object Mr. Glenn saved from his childhood that is not a toy. It's a battered plaster mask. As a teenager he plucked it from a high shelf when he was looking to swipe a switchblade his father said he had confiscated from a parishioner.
Instead, Mr. Glenn found what he decided was Baudelaire's death mask. He knew that the poet Fanny Howe had owned the house, and he had it in his mind that the mask had belonged to her. For years, he said, it was the most significant object in his life and he hung it above every desk in every house he lived in, an ''idol'' to meditate on and draw inspiration from.
A few years ago, when he was putting together a book called ''Taking Things Seriously'' (75 tales of, you know, significant objects and how they got that way), he decided he would write about the mask. So he called his father. ''And my father said, '1. It didn't belong to Fanny Howe. 2. I have no idea where it came from. And 3. It's not Baudelaire.' ''
Cue sound of dream deflating. Sometimes the best stories are fiction.

HEADLINE: 16 Million Reams of Paper, Please

BYLINE: By KEVIN ROOSE

 BODY:
A single company purchased more than 50,000 Hewlett-Packard computers last year, buying in bulk to shave millions of dollars off its costs.
But it was not General Electric, Procter & Gamble or another large, multinational conglomerate with the muscle to dictate prices to suppliers. Rather, the big buyer was the Blackstone Group, a private equity firm.
Private equity firms like Blackstone are emerging as a powerful new force in the marketplace. The big investors, which collectively oversee thousands of companies, are using their size and scope to pressure suppliers, set their own prices and exert their influence in a range of industries, including health care, construction and consumer goods.
Last year, Blackstone was part of a group of companies that collectively bought 16 million reams of copy paper, 35 million FedEx shipments and 900,000 days' worth of rental cars from National and Avis. 
''We have incredible leverage,'' said James A. Quella, Blackstone's North American head of portfolio operations. ''The more volume we have, the lower our prices go.''
For years, private equity firms like Blackstone have been viewed as financial alchemists who buy undervalued companies, rejigger their balance sheets and sell them for quick gain. In good times, the strategy worked. Buyout specialists could turn a tidy profit in a matter of months, without getting deeply involved in the businesses they owned.
Hence the ''barbarians at the gate'' stereotype, which has arisen again in recent months as the presidential election has brought the private equity debate into sharp focus. Critics of the industry have faulted Mitt Romney, the presumed Republican candidate, for his years of running Bain Capital, a large buyout firm.
The industry players have been cast as job destroyers more concerned with making money for investors than improving the companies they own. One particularly critical ad for the Obama campaign featured a company, GST Steel, that went out of business years after it was taken over by Bain Capital.
But with the financial crisis, the decline of stocks markets and the sputtering recovery, private equity has been adapting its ways. While profit remains central and layoffs can still be part of the private equity equation, buyout firms are now stuck holding on to companies longer than expected.
As a result, the firms cannot operate at arm's length anymore and instead have had to roll up their sleeves and become full-fledged operators.
The private equity titans have huge economic influence and sway, largely because of the size of their portfolios. Blackstone owns all or part of 74 companies that employ 700,000 people and generate $117 billion in annual revenue.
Taken collectively, Blackstone's businesses would rank as the 13th largest company by revenue, ahead of JPMorgan Chase, I.B.M. and Procter & Gamble.
Kohlberg Kravis Roberts, another megafirm, would be No. 5 on that list with its 74 portfolio companies and $210 billion in aggregate revenue.
The Carlyle Group has investments in 200 portfolio companies, including Dunkin' Brands and Hertz, that collectively employ around 675,000 people - more than General Motors and General Electric combined.
''Historically, private equity firms were about financial engineering,'' said Jason Busch, managing director at Spend Matters, a research firm that focuses on the procurement processes of big corporations. ''That's the fairy tale story from 25 or 30 years ago. Within the last decade, there's been more operational work to do.''
Blackstone and others are taking the cues from the likes of General Electric. Decades ago, G.E. started buying in bulk for its various businesses units, including aerospace, energy, consumer and finance.
Despite the disparate industries spread across dozens of countries, G.E. decided to make buying decisions at the corporate level, as a way to save money and bolster profits. Today, most large multinational companies adhere to a similar strategy for their supply chain, buying computers, office supplies and all types of products at a discount.
Now, private equity firms are too. Both Blackstone and K.K.R. belong to a group purchasing program called CoreTrust, which has roughly 200 member companies including TPG Capital, Bain Capital, and other private equity firms.
The program, which began in 2006, helps companies save 10 to 50 percent on common items, and even lets them stay enrolled after they are sold or taken public by their private equity owners.
''It's just common sense,'' said Todd Cooper, head of procurement for K.K.R., which uses CoreTrust for some bulk purchases. ''Every company, whether I'm a manufacturer or a retailer, uses FedEx. Everybody needs laptops.''
Those savings can add up. Blackstone says it has saved $600 million since 2006 through CoreTrust, direct supplier relationships and an equity health care group, which applies the same group purchasing principles to employee health insurance plans. K.K.R. pegs its total savings at north of $700 million.
''It's a phenomenal benefit,'' said Chris Karkenny, the chief financial officer of Apria, a health care company that was acquired by Blackstone in 2008 and has since used CoreTrust to buy telecommunications equipment, office supplies and other goods. ''We do just over $2 billion in revenue, but we're getting rates that companies with $100 billion in revenue would get.''
In 2005, Mr. Quella of Blackstone recruited Gregory Beutler, a former G.E. executive, to help Blackstone drive down prices in its biggest spending categories. The two set a goal of saving $100 million a year through bulk-buying. They immediately began reaching out to the company's suppliers, telling them that they were to treat Blackstone's myriad businesses like one giant conglomerate, and set their prices accordingly.
''We went to U.P.S. and FedEx,'' Mr. Quella said. ''We said, 'Guys, we just did an analysis: our smallest company is paying $9.95 for overnight. Our largest company is paying $6.95 for overnight. You guys charge whatever you get away with. We want one price, and we want that price to be the price you give your biggest customer.' ''
The hardball tactic worked. ''We negotiate them to the wall,'' Mr. Beutler said of Blackstone's suppliers.
Another cost-cutting tactic is the reverse e-auction. In the eBay-style process, suppliers are given a set period of time, typically an hour, to bid against one another for a large contract.
Earlier this year, when Emdeon, a medical data provider owned by Blackstone, wanted to renegotiate a contract for a type of large, 112-pound paper rolls it uses to print medical claim statements and customer bills, Mr. Beutler organized a one-hour e-auction involving four paper makers.
Mr. Quella and Mr. Beutler watched eagerly from their desks as the bids began at $47.43 a roll, then fell as companies began lowering their prices. When the auction ended, a late bid of $45.87 a roll had won out. The savings were small by group purchasing standards, only about 3 percent of a contract that averages around $3.5 million annually. But at the scale of private equity, every dollar counts.
''Ten percent of a big number is a big number,'' Mr. Quella explained.
While e-auctions and other aggressive negotiating tactics save money for private equity firms, they often put suppliers in a bind: should they lose out on a large contract, or win it and make the narrowest of profit margins?
''It almost is a necessary evil,'' said Anthony C. Chukumba, an analyst for BB&T Capital Markets. ''You want the business. But if you bid so low and then win a contract, then you have something that is only marginally profitable.''
Some large private equity firms choose not to participate in programs like CoreTrust, typically because they believe the group purchasing process strains relationships with suppliers, and requires them to micromanage companies in exchange for relatively small savings.
Private equity-owned companies, too, have raised objections to group purchasing programs, which often require them to change suppliers from the ones they have used for decades.
''It's difficult to break companies out of their mindsets,'' said Justin Hillenbrand, a partner at Monomoy Capital Partners, a midmarket private equity firm that uses a group purchasing program for its portfolio companies. ''Maybe they've been using U.P.S. forever, and because of that U.P.S. gives them favors; maybe it delivers things at odd hours. Guess what? If my purchasing program can get FedEx for 25 percent cheaper, they're going to switch.''
At one meeting, Mr. Quella of Blackstone said, the chief executive of a portfolio company expressed his frustration that the firm's group purchasing plan would force him to switch the brand of toilet paper his company used in its bathrooms.
Still, group purchasing advocates defend their work as a necessary part of private equity's fat-trimming process. Blackstone and K.K.R., rival firms in almost every sense, are now teaming up to introduce CoreTrust to Europe.
As group purchasing programs grow, they will have to tread lightly, finding a balance in getting the prices they want and not angering the companies they own, or their suppliers.
''It's one thing to fool with the balance sheet of a company - it's another to change its operations,'' said Mr. Busch of Spend Matters. ''It's absolutely about rolling up your sleeves, but it's about having soft hands as well.''
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

HEADLINE: Third City In California Votes to Seek Bankruptcy

BYLINE: By IAN LOVETT

 BODY:
LOS ANGELES -- San Bernardino will become the third California city to file for bankruptcy this year, after officials conceded the city might not even be able to cover payroll through the summer. 
Faced with a budget shortfall of $45 million and city coffers that have already been drained, the San Bernardino City Council voted on Tuesday to file for bankruptcy. Andrea Travis-Miller, the interim city manager, told Council members before the vote that the city had very few options left.
''I am concerned about our ability to make payroll, not only in the next 30 days but also in the next 60 to 90 days,'' Ms. Travis-Miller said. ''A major restructuring of this organization is needed.''
Ms. Travis-Miller said it would take 30 days before city staff would be prepared to file the paperwork in bankruptcy court.
Under a California law passed this year, cities must hire a third-party mediator to negotiate with employee unions and creditors before filing for Chapter 9 bankruptcy protections. However, cities can avoid this mediation process if they instead declare a fiscal emergency, which Mayor Patrick Morris said that San Bernardino planned to do.
Karol K. Denniston, a partner at the law firm Schiff Hardin who helped draft the mediation legislation, said a long and difficult bankruptcy case might follow, because the city had skipped the mediation process.
With 15 percent unemployment in the city, and a foreclosure rate in San Bernardino County that remains among the highest in the state, San Bernardino has been pummeled by the recession.
As a result, the city's revenues have plummeted in recent years, while pension costs have continued to rise. Previous budget cuts were not enough to keep the city out of the red.
James Penman, the city attorney, called the loss of redevelopment funds, which the state cut off in an effort to close its own budget deficit, ''the straw that broke the camel's back.''
Unlike Stockton and Mammoth Lakes, however, whose financial problems were long known before those cities filed for bankruptcy, even the mayor said he did not know just how dire San Bernardino's financial situation was until a few weeks ago.
Over the past 16 years, according to Mr. Penman, city budget officials had presented falsified documents to the mayor and the City Council that showed the city's finances in the black, when in fact they were in the red for 13 of those years. Only two weeks ago, Mr. Morris said, did he learn that the city was ''in for a world of hurt.''
Still, Mr. Morris said the city's financial crisis had been many years in the making, with a lack of reserve funds exposed by the financial crisis.
''This is a long time coming,'' Mr. Morris said. ''This is not something that happened like a lightning flash.''

HEADLINE: Fed Board Is Divided On Stimulus

BYLINE: By BINYAMIN APPELBAUM

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- Federal Reserve officials agreed at a meeting in June that unemployment would remain elevated for another five to six years, but most did not regard that as reason enough to expand the Fed's efforts to stimulate growth, according to an official account published on Wednesday.
The American economy is stuck in a new kind of normal, somewhere between crisis and prosperity, and economic policy makers are struggling to define their role. The Fed, which has responded forcefully each time the economy tips back toward recession, remains divided over whether it should try with similar urgency to return the economy to prosperity. 
The account of the June meeting suggested that Fed officials now viewed the risk of standing still, so clear in a crisis, as smaller and harder to measure, while the uncertain consequences of action are weighing heavily on their willingness to expand the central bank's aid campaign.
''A few'' of the 12 officials who vote on Fed policy thought further measures, like bond purchases, ''likely would be necessary to promote satisfactory growth,'' the account said. But several others were willing to consider such steps only if economic conditions deteriorated. This was more than the Fed said after its last meeting in April, but less than many investors were hoping to hear.
The Fed expected slow growth this year, but the account -- released after a standard three-week lag -- said officials were still disappointed that ''a variety of indicators showed smaller gains than had been anticipated'' in recent months.
Among the drags on the economy cited in the document were ''slow growth or even contraction in some major foreign economies, ongoing and prospective fiscal tightening in the United States, modest growth in household income, and -- despite some recent signs of improvement -- continued weakness in the housing sector.'' The Fed announced after the meeting on June 19-20 that it would continue until year's end with an effort to reduce borrowing costs for businesses and consumers by rearranging its portfolio. The expected impact is modest, however. The account said it would put ''some downward pressure on longer-term interest rates and help make broader financial conditions more accommodative.''
The document, a summary rather than a transcript, offered little clarity about the Fed's next steps, a point underscored by the diversity of conclusions that analysts who follow the central bank quickly drew from the text. Some saw clear evidence that action was imminent; others drew the opposite lesson.
Paul Ashworth, chief United States economist at Capital Economics, was among the analysts who chose a position in the middle, writing to clients that ''officials are edging closer to launching a third round of large-scale asset purchases, but it won't become a reality unless the recovery loses even more momentum.''
The Fed began the year on the sidelines, its officials united in the view that they had done enough. The central bank has already said that it plans to hold short-term interest rates near zero until late 2014, at least. It has amassed a vast portfolio of Treasury securities and mortgage bonds to further reduce long-term rates.
But growth has once again fallen short of the Fed's expectations, and the lack of public clarity is a consequence of the internal debate among the 19 officials who participate in the discussions of the Federal Open Market Committee.
The case for additional action is easy to explain. The economy is not growing fast enough to reduce unemployment, a point underscored last week by a government report that employers added only 80,000 jobs in June. Moreover, inflation has fallen below the 2 percent pace the Fed regards as healthy.
''We are falling short on both our employment and price stability mandates and I expect that we will make only very limited progress toward these goals over the next year,'' John C. Williams, president of the San Francisco Fed, said Monday.
Mr. Williams, who favored asset purchases last year before backing off earlier this year, said that it was again time to consider additional action, and that any new round of purchases should include mortgage securities.
But proponents of additional action have not yet won the support of the Fed's chairman, Ben S. Bernanke, who controls the decision-making process. Mr. Bernanke has not offered a clear account of his hesitations, beyond the premise that additional action should not be taken lightly.
He may clarify his views when he testifies before the Senate and House next week.
The account released Wednesday did offer some explanations, however, for the Fed officials' reluctance to take additional action.
Some officials see evidence that unemployment cannot quickly return to normal levels because many people looking for jobs lack the skills sought by companies looking for workers. And they are concerned that policies aimed at reducing unemployment would instead accelerate the pace of inflation.
There is also skepticism about the power of additional asset purchases to improve economic conditions. While previous rounds of purchases have clearly lowered interest rates, tight credit standards have prevented many borrowers from taking advantage.
And the account said some officials sought information about how far the Fed could expand its purchases without soaking up so much of the supply of Treasuries or mortgage bonds that shortages might cause ''a meaningful deterioration in securities market functioning.''
A result of these concerns, according to the account, is that the Fed is searching for other ways to foster growth. ''Several participants,'' it said, ''commented that it would be desirable to explore the possibility of developing new tools to promote more accommodative financial conditions and thereby support a stronger economic recovery.''

HEADLINE: China's Economy, Still Strong

BYLINE: By STEVEN RATTNER. 
Steven Rattner, a contributing opinion writer, is a longtime Wall Street executive and a former counselor to the Treasury secretary.

 BODY:
THE ''plum rain'' that envelops Shanghai every summer -- a confusing mix of drizzle, fog and smog -- is a handy metaphor for the murkiness that currently enshrouds China's economy.
A drumbeat of negative views about China's economic prospects dominates the country's image. The financial weekly Barron's recently proclaimed in a cover story that ''it looks like the Great China Growth Story may be falling apart.'' On Friday, China is expected to announce new, subpar growth figures.
But consider a less prominent fact: a Bloomberg survey of economic forecasters yielded an average projected growth rate for China of 8.2 percent for 2012. If that's the oft-predicted ''hard landing'' from the heights of China's historic double-digit rates, let's all wish for a similar fate for the United States. No other major country -- not even Brazil or India -- will grow at a rate near China's this year. 
As a China believer who recently made a return trip to the country after eight months, I was eager to assess whether the optimism evident there during my past visits had ebbed. I met with businesspeople and investors, mostly Chinese. To be sure, almost every meeting included an acknowledgment of relative soft spots in the economy and worries about things like declining exports, weakening Western economies, a housing bubble, too much investment and a failure to spur domestic consumption.
But on balance, the people I met were firmly optimistic that the fundamental ''urge to surge'' remained. If anything, the intervening decline in the Chinese stock market had made them more enthusiastic about investing.
''China wants you to misunderstand this economy,'' one very successful investor said, suggesting that it serves China's interests to be underestimated by the United States.
Concerns about China's economy are often exacerbated by anxieties about its political stability amid a leadership transition, rampant corruption and official economic data of questionable veracity. But put those emotions and knee-jerk skepticism aside, and the economic picture looks rosy, at least to me.
Take, for example, China's extraordinary investment rate of 48 percent of gross domestic product. High investment is a hallmark of an emerging economy; China's capital stock per capita is still only about a tenth of the United States', which suggests room for further investment.
All that spending gives China a feeling of lunging further and further into the 21st century. Visiting Pudong, Shanghai's shiny new financial district, I recalled that when it was built, in the late 1990s, the vast project was ridiculed by critics as unlikely to ever be fully utilized. Today, Pudong is a major money center.
No doubt a portion of China's investment has been misdirected. But misdirected overinvestment won't bring down an economy; it simply represents lost consumption for Chinese families. In any event, I'd prefer some misdirected investment to the United States' alternative: a modest 16 percent investment rate.
As for concerns about the housing market, here's what passes for a burst bubble in China: a 2.2 percent decline in housing prices over nine months (and then a small increase in June). Compare that with the 33 percent drop in the United States between July 2006 and January 2012.
And what of the economic downturn in the West? Though it has indisputably hurt Chinese exports (which are still growing, albeit at a rapidly decelerating rate), China is now far less dependent on its exports; their share of G.D.P. has dropped from almost 40 percent in 2007 to 29 percent.
China may be totalitarian, but its leaders still behave as if they had 1.3 billion customers whom they need to keep happy by delivering steady and rapid progress up the economic ladder. Interest rates were cut in June and were just lowered again. Constraints on bank lending have been relaxed. The luxury tax was reduced. And notably, the managed appreciation of China's currency over the past two years or so has been slightly reversed as China continues to pursue its neomercantilist strategy of manipulating everything from technology transfers to trade barriers.
While China has instituted only modest measures to stimulate consumer spending, the investors I met with are buying up businesses ranging from car dealerships to dairies, betting that the Chinese will step up their expenditures.
The ''pessimists-lite'' -- those who argue that China's growth rate may not re-accelerate -- may be right. No economy can expand indefinitely at China's historic double-digit rate. But for me, China's economy still pulsates with the confidence of its growing entrepreneurial spirit, an important factor that doesn't fit neatly into statistical models.

HEADLINE: Myanmar: U.S. Eases Sanctions

BYLINE: By ANNIE LOWREY

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- The White House on Wednesday formally eased sanctions on Myanmar, signaling support for its recent governmental reforms and officially opening the door to American investment in the deeply impoverished Asian nation. 
Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton announced plans in the spring for a ''targeted easing'' of sanctions to allow American dollars to enter the country, for decades one of the most authoritarian in the world. But companies could not move ahead until the sanctions were formally suspended.
The United States still will not allow investment in entities owned by Myanmar's armed forces or its Ministry of Defense. It also bolstered its ability to place sanctions on ''those who undermine the reform process, engage in human rights abuses, contribute to ethnic conflict or participate in military trade with North Korea.'' And it will require American companies pouring money into Myanmar to make disclosures about their activities.
''Individuals who continue to engage in abusive, corrupt or destabilizing behavior going forward will not reap the rewards of reform,'' President Obama said in a statement, while praising the country's progress.
The announcement came on the day that Derek J. Mitchell, the first United States ambassador to Myanmar since 1990, arrived at his posting.
Relations between the United States and Myanmar have thawed remarkably since the election of President U Thein Sein last year. The government has released some political prisoners and opened peace talks with opposition groups, among other changes.
While the administration has praised the changes in Myanmar, Mr. Obama said the United States ''remains deeply concerned about the lack of transparency in Burma's investment environment and the military's role in the economy,'' using an alternative name for the country.
The United States will continue to block businesses or individuals from making transactions with any ''specially designated nationals'' or businesses that they control -- allowing Washington, for example, to stop money from flowing to groups disrupting the reform process. Mr. Obama also created a new power for the government to impose ''blocking sanctions'' on any individual threatening peace in Myanmar.
Businesses with more than $500,000 in investment in the country will need to file an annual report with the State Department, with details on workers' rights, land acquisitions and any payments of more than $10,000 to government entities, including Myanmar's state-owned enterprises.
Some pro-democracy leaders had wanted stricter sanctions. Daw Aung San Suu Kyi, the well-known opposition figure, had urged foreign governments not to allow investment in the state-owned Myanma Oil and Gas Enterprise. She has raised questions about its transparency, while others have voiced concerns about whether it might funnel money to antidemocratic military figures. American companies and people will be allowed to invest in the firm. But any investors will need to notify the State Department.
Canada, Australia and the European Union have also eased sanctions on Myanmar recently. Many American businesses have pushed for the quick relaxation of sanctions, so that United States companies would not be left out of a possible investment boom.
Myanmar is the second-poorest country in Asia on a per capita basis, richer only than war-torn Afghanistan.
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

HEADLINE: Mentioning Potential Tax Increases, Staying Mum on Some Tax Cuts

BYLINE: By RICHARD A. OPPEL Jr.

 BODY:
President Obama's campaign has unveiled an attack ad arguing that Mitt Romney's tax plan is a sop to the wealthy. The ad will run in swing states: Colorado, Florida, Iowa, Nevada, New Hampshire, North Carolina, Ohio, Pennsylvania and Virginia. 
THE SCRIPT ''The choice on taxes. Mitt Romney's plan: A 25 percent tax cut for millionaires. Tax breaks for oil companies and corporations that shift jobs overseas. But a tax hike for 18 million working families. President Obama's plan: Ask the wealthy to pay a little more so the middle class pays less. Eliminate oil subsidies and tax breaks for companies that outsource. Two plans. Your choice.''
ON SCREEN The ad shows Mr. Romney giving a speech and then cuts to a montage that includes an aerial shot of a large beachfront home, an Exxon logo and an overseas workplace. Mr. Obama is then shown shaking hands with people at a rally, laughing with workers at a plant, speaking with elderly people and then walking confidently.
ACCURACY One of the ad's main claims -- that Mr. Romney's plan would raise taxes for 18 million working families -- is accurate, according to data from the nonpartisan Urban-Brookings Tax Policy Center. Assuming the extension of the Bush-era tax cuts and alternative minimum tax relief, those taxpayers who would see their federal tax bills rise under the Romney plan (almost 11 percent of all filers) would have an average increase of $885, the center found. The overwhelming number of people in this category make less than $50,000, and they would see tax increases under the Romney plan because of the expiration of three provisions passed in 2009, including the expansion of the earned-income tax credit.
The ad does not mention that about 118 million filers would get a tax cut under the Romney plan. That includes nearly everyone making $100,000 or more, as well as about 77 percent of those making $30,000 to $40,000, for example, and 94 percent of those making $50,000 to $75,000.
The ad's other main claim -- that ''millionaires'' would get a 25 percent cut in their average tax rate -- is also accurate, the data suggests. According to Roberton Williams, senior fellow at the Urban-Brookings center, the average federal tax rate on incomes over $1 million would fall to 23.3 percent from 31.4 percent under the Romney plan, a roughly one-quarter decline. (Mr. Williams emphasized that the Romney campaign has also promised to broaden the tax base but has not said how it would do this, making it impossible to fully analyze their plan.) As for the Obama plan, he said that middle-class taxes would not change while wealthier taxpayers would pay more.
SCORECARD Mr. Romney is basing much of his campaign on the idea that he is an accomplished and skilled businessman who could deal effectively with the nation's economic problems. The ad seeks to undermine this claim by trying to paint Mr. Romney as an ally of the wealthy and corporations, including those that have sent American jobs overseas. RICHARD A. OPPEL Jr.

HEADLINE: Romney Says He Offers Better Chance for Blacks

BYLINE: By ASHLEY PARKER and MICHAEL D. SHEAR; Ashley Parker reported from Houston, and Michael D. Shear from Washington.

 BODY:
HOUSTON -- Although President Obama swept into the White House with the overwhelming support of black voters, Mitt Romney appeared before the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People on Wednesday with a bold claim: ''If you want a president who will make things better in the African-American community, you are looking at him.''
His assertion was met with cackles and boos -- as well as tepid applause -- and was emblematic of his entire speech, in which he tried to appeal to blacks while offering tough policy prescriptions that are unpopular with them. 
In a roughly 25-minute speech at the N.A.A.C.P.'s annual convention here, Mr. Romney promised to fight teachers' unions and repeal the president's health care plan.
When he said he would ''eliminate every nonessential, expensive program I can find; that includes Obamacare,'' the crowd booed -- the first of several instances of vocal disagreement. Mr. Romney grinned nervously and deviated slightly from his prepared remarks as he tried to explain his position.
Mr. Romney's speech was blunt and was delivered with little of the rhetorical flourish or soaring language that is typical when celebrating the history of the civil rights movement. Instead Mr. Romney, the presumptive Republican nominee, came straight to the point, awkwardly acknowledging the traditional lack of support among blacks for a candidate from his party.
But even as he accepted that reality, he appeared determined to deliver a tough critique of Mr. Obama's economic policies in the face of an unreceptive crowd. He suggested that their support for Mr. Obama was misplaced, and that his policies as president would make their lives better.
''If I did not believe that my policies and my leadership would help families of color -- and families of any color -- more than the policies and leadership of President Obama, I would not be running for president,'' he said.
Later, in an interview with Neil Cavuto on Fox News, Mr. Romney said that the booing was not a surprise.
''We expected that, of course,'' Mr. Romney said. ''But, you know, I am going to give the same message to the N.A.A.C.P. that I give across the country, which is that Obamacare is killing jobs.''
He added, ''I expect to get African-American votes.''
Although Mr. Obama, the country's first African-American president, won 95 percent of the black vote in 2008 according to exit polls, Mr. Romney is not ceding any ground in what is expected to be a close election in November. The black vote, which is still overwhelmingly in Mr. Obama's column, could prove crucial in swing states like North Carolina and Virginia.
In May, Mr. Romney hired a consultant, Tara Wall, to help with outreach efforts to black voters, and he also visited a charter school in West Philadelphia, where he was heckled. But his appearance at the N.A.A.C.P. was his most direct wooing of black voters this campaign.
Mr. Romney pointed to economic sufferings of the group, as he has when speaking to Hispanic voters, another critical voting bloc that he may have trouble winning over.
''The unemployment rate, the duration of unemployment, average income, median family wealth are all worse in the black community,'' he said.
Many in the audience gave Mr. Romney credit for speaking to the group, but said they were frustrated with certain aspects of his speech.
''I give him thumbs up for being courageous,'' said William Braxton, 59, a retiree from Charles County, Md. But Mr. Braxton said he took issue with Mr. Romney's assertion that he would be a better president for blacks.
''I was shocked,'' Mr. Braxton said. ''Never, ever have I heard him say anything about how he would help the poor or underprivileged, let alone the black community. Maybe his view is that he could tell us what we want to hear, and we're supposed to swallow it.''
Donna Payne, 48, of Washington, who was at the convention as a representative of the Human Rights Campaign, a gay rights group, said Mr. Romney ''did the best he could,'' before dissolving in laughter.
''To say he would repeal Obama's health care plan is absolutely a joke,'' Ms. Payne said. ''I can't believe he had the nerve to even bring up repealing the plan in the middle of speaking to an audience that fought hard for the health care plan and for coverage. It's a total misread of who you're talking to.''
In recent national polls, Mr. Obama overwhelmingly leads Mr. Romney among black voters, many of whom are suspicious of Mr. Romney's record on civil rights and diversity, especially when he was the governor of Massachusetts. Upon taking office, for instance, he eliminated the state's Office of Affirmative Action.
Mr. Romney is also a member of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, which until 1978 barred blacks from entering the priesthood.
But Mr. Romney's father, George W. Romney, a former governor of Michigan, was known for his strong support of civil rights. Mr. Romney mentioned his father near the end of his speech, saying, ''He was a man of the fairest instincts, and a man of faith who knew that every person was a child of God.''
Mr. Obama was invited to address the group as well; he cited a scheduling conflict. Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. will speak at the convention on Thursday.

HEADLINE: Annan Seeks More U.N. Pressure as One of Syria's Ambassadors Defects

BYLINE: By RICK GLADSTONE; Andrew Roth contributed reporting from Moscow, and Dalal Mawad and Neil MacFarquhar from Beirut, Lebanon.

 BODY:
Kofi Annan, the special envoy whose peace plan for ending the increasingly violent conflict in Syria is paralyzed and at risk of complete collapse, asked the United Nations Security Council on Wednesday to threaten the Syrian government and the rebels with consequences for failure to comply.
Mr. Annan made his request as new evidence emerged of fracturing in the government of President Bashar al-Assad of Syria, which has faced a slow but growing rash of defections and desertions. The latest was Syria's ambassador to Iraq, Nawaf Fares, who issued a statement reported by Al Jazeera and Reuters that he had resigned and had renounced his membership in Mr. Assad's Syrian Baath Party. 
''I urge all honest members of this party to follow my path because the regime has turned it to an instrument to kill people and their aspiration to freedom,'' Mr. Fares said in the statement from an unidentified location. There was no immediate comment from the Syrian government on the defection, the first by a Syrian ambassador since the uprising broke out in March 2011.
The Security Council has already passed two resolutions that request compliance with Mr. Annan's plan but do not carry coercive pressure. ''You should insist on implementation of your decisions, and send a message to all that there will be consequences for noncompliance,'' Mr. Annan, who represents the United Nations and Arab League, told the Council.
Mr. Annan did not specify that the Council should threaten measures under Chapter 7 of its charter, which authorizes economic sanctions, and if necessary, military action, as was done in the Libyan conflict last year. But his request quickly laid bare the makings of a potential confrontation among the five permanent members of the Council, whose effort to speak in a unified way on the Syria conflict has often masked serious divisions.
Representatives of the United States, Britain and France said they would address Mr. Annan's request with a resolution that included Chapter 7 sanctions. But Russia and China, which have twice blocked such coercive measures, were expected to resist. Russia, the Syrian government's most important foreign supporter, circulated its own draft resolution that does not include the Chapter 7 provision.
Alexander Pankin, the ranking Russian diplomat at the Security Council, said that Mr. Annan had ''asked that the Council speak in a united and single voice. And there will be consequences. But consequences does not mean under a certain chapter or certain article.''
Mr. Annan, who spoke to the Council by video link from his Geneva office after having visited Syria, Iran and Iraq, also said that Mr. Assad was open to the idea of an interlocutor between him and the political opposition, which presumably would allow a dialogue without the two sides' having to directly talk to each other.
It was not clear whether Syria's array of anti-Assad groups, who have said they would not negotiate with Mr. Assad, would agree to such an idea.
Mr. Annan addressed the Council less than two weeks before the authorization of the 300-member observer mission in Syria, assigned to monitor a cease-fire and other provisions of the plan, will expire. The observers, who are unarmed and have no enforcement authority, suspended work a month ago because both the Syrian government and its armed antagonists were ignoring Mr. Annan's plan, and the rising violence had made the mission's work too dangerous.
Both Mr. Annan and the United Nations secretary general, Ban Ki-moon, want the Council to renew the mission's mandate. Mr. Ban has said a withdrawal of the mission would send the wrong signal and encourage more violence. While the Council is expected to reauthorize the monitors, the size of their group and duration of deployment remain to be negotiated.
The defection of Syria's ambassador to Iraq was the second high-ranking exit from Mr. Assad's government in less than week, following the departure last Thursday of Manaf Tlass, a general in the elite Republican Guard who is the son of a former defense minister.
Mr. Fares, who received the Baghdad posting in 2008, was described at the time of his appointment as a well-connected statesman whose family was rooted partly in the Sunni tribal society of Iraq's Anbar Province, which extends to Syria's eastern desert.
News of his defection was slow to emerge. Al Jazeera first reported it in an unattributed dispatch. Ayad Allawi, a prominent Sunni politician in Iraq and a former interim prime minister, reported later in a Twitter post: ''Reliable sources have informed me of the defection of Nawaf Fares, the Syrian Ambassador to Iraq.''
Burhan Ghalioun, a member of executive bureau and former leader of the Syrian National Council, the main anti-Assad opposition group, said he had also been made aware of the defection, while visiting Moscow with a delegation of opposition figures.
''We welcome the defection of the Syrian ambassador to Iraq,'' Mr. Ghalioun said. ''We have called upon high-ranking officials whether in the military or in the diplomatic service to defect from this regime and join the revolution of dignity.'' Both General Tlass and Ambassador Fares were members of a privileged Sunni elite in a Syrian government dominated by Mr. Assad's minority Alawite sect. A growing number of other high-ranking Sunnis, mostly from the military, have been leaving Syria in recent weeks, reflecting what Syrian political analysts have called the increasingly sectarian nature of the conflict.
While opposition groups are mostly Sunni and have called the defections the beginning of the end for Mr. Assad, outside political analysts are more cautious. Alawites, who represent only about 12 percent of the population, remain intensely loyal to Mr. Assad, and none of his close Alawite confidants have abandoned him.
''There are indications to me that the Sunni insulation is cracking,'' said Andrew J. Tabler, a Syria expert who is a senior fellow at the Washington Institute for Near East Policy. ''But these people are not from the core. It's an important distinction.''

HEADLINE: Romney Faces Calls to Deliver Counterpunch

BYLINE: By JEFF ZELENY and ASHLEY PARKER; Jeff Zeleny reported from Washington, and Ashley Parker from Houston.

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- Mitt Romney and his team of advisers built a reputation during the Republican primaries as tough street fighters skilled in the tactics of political warfare. They quietly took pride in tearing apart Newt Gingrich, Rick Santorum and the rest of their rivals.
The aggressive posture ultimately became one of Mr. Romney's selling points, particularly among conservative voters who were searching for the candidate tenacious enough to take out President Obama in the general election. 
But now, even with polls suggesting he is battling Mr. Obama to a draw at this stage of the race, Mr. Romney finds himself confronting concern that he is not nimble and aggressive enough to withstand the Democratic assault against him.
The president and his re-election campaign have managed to turn the focus of the race in recent days to taxes, outsourcing jobs and Mr. Romney's bank accounts -- almost everything except the weak job-creation figures released last week.
That has stirred worries among some Republicans that Mr. Romney is allowing himself to be defined by the Obama forces and that he lacks the kind of powerful counterpunch the base of the Republican Party is craving.
Now deep into his second run for the White House, Mr. Romney has shown consistent discipline, sticking doggedly to his strategy of making the election about Mr. Obama's stewardship of the economy and for the most part avoiding being baited into traps set for him by rivals.
''If you're responding, you're losing,'' Mr. Romney told Fox News on Wednesday, his voice betraying no air of concern.
But the latest Democratic offensive has become so intense that the Romney campaign will start a new wave of television commercials on Thursday, aides said. In a rapid-fire era of presidential politics, when candidates have the ability to respond at a moment's notice, the restraint of the Romney campaign over the last two weeks has opened a round of second-guessing about his insistent focus on the economy.
Conservatives have lit up talk radio programs across the country, worrying whether Mr. Romney's business record has been ''Swift Boated,'' referring to attacks waged against Senator John Kerry's military record in 2004.
The Romney campaign headquarters in Boston has been inundated with advice and criticism from donors and supporters who worry that Mr. Romney has lost an opportunity to introduce himself on his own terms.
''Team Obama is doing just what we did in 2004, which is to define the opposition furiously and early,'' said Mark McKinnon, a strategist who worked on George W. Bush's re-election campaign. ''Most voters don't have a deep sense of Romney other than he's not Obama. And in this cycle, that may be enough, but it's a very risky approach.''
Four months until Election Day, much of the Republican Party's base is boiling hot. The latest example came on Wednesday, when the House held a symbolic vote to repeal the national health care law upheld last month by the Supreme Court. But Mr. Romney was in Houston speaking to the N.A.A.C.P. convention, a sign that he is trying to adhere to his own strategy of working to broaden his appeal to independent and undecided voters.
As his business record and tenure as Massachusetts governor was being relentlessly assailed in television commercials across a range of top battleground states, Mr. Romney released a Spanish-language ad on Wednesday that featured his son Craig. He delivered a testimonial about his father, whom he called ''a man of great convictions.''
Advisers to Mr. Romney acknowledge that the questions about his record and wealth have contributed to a climb in his unfavorable rating among voters. But the campaign does not believe that the overall position of the race has changed, with voters still seeking an alternative to Mr. Obama.
While Mr. Obama has outspent Mr. Romney in battleground states, outside Republican groups have nearly evened the disparity. But the advertising from the major Republican ''super PACs,'' Crossroads and Restore Our Future, are aimed at highlighting the president's economic record, rather than defending Mr. Romney. Officials close to both groups said Wednesday that they had no plans to change their approach to help defend Mr. Romney against the Democratic-led attacks.
While Mr. Romney largely avoided an early round of recriminations that often comes after winning a party's contentious nominating fight, his advisers are feeling it now among some Republicans who worry that he is not taking full advantage of the chance to defeat Mr. Obama.
Some think he botched his chance to capitalize on the Supreme Court's decision to uphold the individual mandate portion of Mr. Obama's health care law when his campaign contradicted itself, calling the mandate first ''a penalty'' and only later ''a tax.'' Others hoped he would have already responded more forcefully to recent attacks by the Obama campaign on his time at Bain Capital.
Former Gov. Mike Huckabee of Arkansas said the Romney campaign ''should continue to hammer away'' on a message of economic growth and job creation and ignore the commentary from conservative critics. He said Republicans would continue to rally behind Mr. Romney because of their strong desire to win back the White House.
''I'm not overly worried,'' Mr. Huckabee said Wednesday in an interview. ''Overall, the Romney campaign is being very disciplined, saving their fire until the convention.''
Mr. Romney, who is nearing the final stages of his search for a vice president and preparing to take a foreign trip at the end of the month, is devoting only a portion of his time to attending campaign events, further limiting his ability to control the narrative of the campaign.
He spent much of last week on vacation with his family in Wolfeboro, N.H., where he has a lake house. He is scheduled to return to there this weekend and is not planning any public events, while the president sets off on a two-day campaign trip across Virginia.

HEADLINE: Small Is So Beautiful

BYLINE: By GAIL COLLINS

 BODY:
Our subject for today is the care and feeding of small businesses.
''I love you guys,'' Mitt Romney told a teleconference hosted by the National Federation of Independent Business. ''I love the fact that you're working hard to follow your dreams and to build businesses. I -- I love you guys. I love the fact that you're -- that you're working hard to -- to follow your dreams and to -- and to build businesses.''
To summarize: We love you, guys. 
And they're everywhere! The Small Business Administration defines a small business as one with fewer than 500 workers, and that's 99.7 percent of everything out there. ''There are 5.7 million firms with employees in this country, and about 5.7 million have fewer than 500 employees -- rounding slightly,'' said Robert McIntyre, the director of Citizens for Tax Justice.
It's sort of metaphysical, when you get right down to it. I am you as you are me and we are one and we are all small businesses. Ich bin ein small business. No wonder politicians want to get on their good side.
All of this takes us to President Obama's call for Congress to extend the Bush tax cuts for families with incomes below $250,000 a year. Most people, the president said, believe it is wrong to ''raise taxes on middle-class families.'' It was certainly a triumphant moment for the administration's economic policies. In 2008, who among us could have hoped that four years in the future, middle-class Americans would be making $250,000 a year?
But Romney called the idea ''a massive tax increase on job creators and on small business.'' He also denounced it as ''another kick in the gut to the middle class in America,'' thus signaling his determination to broaden the American middle even further, as well as to call everything the president does a ''kick in the gut'' for the rest of this campaign season.
How do we feel about this argument, people? We are not talking about business taxes, in the normal sense of the word. If we were, it would quickly become so incredibly confusing that you would be begging me to go back to the matter of the dog Romney once tied to the roof of his car.
The typical American business owner does not pay corporate taxes. He or she subtracts expenses from revenues and declares the bottom line as income. There are many, many advantages to this approach. You can avoid corporate tax rates, and it's a lot easier to deduct things. If you're a baker of gourmet cupcakes, you can subtract the entire cost of your new $50,000 ovens from your income, right up front, as well as lunch with your best friend who is also an occasional cupcake purchaser.
''There are rules, of course, but both the rules and the implementation of the rules are fuzzy,'' said William Gale, the co-director of the Tax Policy Center.
And everybody can get into the game! Including partners in hedge funds and law firms and investment banks. ''Here's the beauty -- each of the hedge fund principals themselves is a small business,'' said Gene Sperling, director of the National Economic Council. Sperling is a small business himself because he gets occasional royalty payments for co-writing a few episodes of ''The West Wing.''
This flight to small is so popular that the Congressional Research Service concluded that if taxes on high incomes went up, it would actually create more small businesses because more rich people would want to ''seek self-employment because the opportunities for tax evasion and avoidance are greater.''
Small business growth. It's what makes America great.
When the Republicans claimed that capping the Bush tax cuts at $250,000 would hurt small businesses, the Obama administration quickly retorted that only about 3 percent of the small business owners have incomes above $250,000.
Yeah, said the Republicans, but that little slice still represents more than 900,000 people, and half of all the nation's business income.
Yeah, said the Democrats, but that's because of the hedge fund managers and law partners and movie stars with rental property.
Yeah, said the Republicans, but the high-end sort-of-small businesses will still cut back on jobs or investment if their taxes go up. Taxes rise, bad things happen. It's an article of faith. The Hartford Financial Group said it did a survey that showed just that, although as Robb Mandelbaum pointed out in The Times, only 2 percent of the small businesses surveyed actually cited taxes as their prime concern.
We do know these things: Republicans do not like income taxes, even for very wealthy people. Possibly particularly for very wealthy people. Barack Obama, who also has royalty income, is a small business. Possibly the only small business the Republicans do not love.

HEADLINE: For a Soaring Political Career, Uncertain Turns

BYLINE: By MONICA DAVEY; Steven Yaccino contributed reporting.

 BODY:
CHICAGO -- A few years ago, the political career of Representative Jesse L. Jackson Jr. was soaring.
His appeal had long since crossed race and class lines -- a Barack Obama before anyone heard of Barack Obama -- and he seemed destined for a political future that could reach higher and wider than that of his father, the civil rights leader and former presidential candidate whose name he shared.
But Mr. Jackson's prospects have tumbled precipitously since the end of 2008. Most recently, Mr. Jackson, 47, has been absent from Congress since June 10, and in the last few weeks his office has released three brief statements, which seemed to set off as many questions as they answered. The latest, on Wednesday night, said that he was receiving ''intensive medical treatment at a residential treatment facility for a mood disorder'' and is expected to recover.
Last week, his office had said he had grappled with ''certain physical and emotional ailments privately for a long period of time'' -- a more dire, if mysterious, assessment than its initial explanation, a week before, that he was dealing with exhaustion. 
The disclosures, absent details, have set off waves of speculation here and in Washington about the precise nature of Mr. Jackson's ailment, his location and, four months before his presumed re-election to Congress, his political future. It has left his father, the Rev. Jesse Jackson, who this week is hosting his annual Rainbow PUSH Coalition national conference about how to combat poverty and unemployment, fending off relentless questions about his eldest son.
Less than four years ago, Representative Jackson was eyeing the Senate seat that Mr. Obama would soon give up to go to the White House. A poll and local editorials backed him, and Mr. Jackson told everyone who would listen why he should get the seat, distributing talking points and templates for letters of support and, on occasion, carrying a three-ring binder that made his case.
The Senate was only one option. By then, he was regularly mentioned as a future mayor of Chicago -- one of the few figures thought of as legitimate competition to Richard M. Daley, a fellow Democrat who ran the city for decades, his father before him. There was no rush, though, the thinking went: Mr. Jackson was young and had plenty of time.
Now, Mr. Jackson's disappearance is only the latest in a series of blows to his image over the last four years, with many here, even allies, having begun alluding to his ascent in the past tense.
The events -- including a continuing House ethics investigation into claims that a longtime supporter and friend offered sizable campaign contributions to Rod R. Blagojevich, then the governor, if he would appoint Mr. Jackson to the Senate seat being vacated by Mr. Obama -- have called into question the Jackson family narrative that some Chicagoans had come to believe: that the workhorse son with the privileged education and crossover appeal might surpass the prominence of the father, who twice ran for president but was best known for mobilizing opinion outside establishment circles.
''He's frozen,'' Don Rose, a longtime Chicago political consultant, said of the younger Mr. Jackson, who is still widely referred to here as Junior. ''He had a high potential. But the ability to go beyond Congress -- to be mayor, to be senator -- is pretty well dead, unless something changes and the clouds are removed.''
His Father's Son
Father and son have always been close, in life and in politics, yet their personas are, in many ways, starkly different.
With education at St. Albans, the elite Washington school, a master's degree in theology and a law degree, not to mention a nod as People magazine's ''Sexiest Politician'' in 1997, the younger Mr. Jackson's appeal crossed races.
If his father was a passionate speaker, often moving around the world from one civil-rights-related cause to another, the younger, scholarly Mr. Jackson was a more traditional student of political strategy and statistics, who focused intently on his district and built political strength, in part by backing candidates for the Illinois Legislature and the City Council in Chicago.
''Around here, Reverend Jackson is seen as a national figure, and someone who can mobilize opinion on the South Side, but -- to use a Chicago word -- he's not seen as someone with a lot of clout,'' said Dick Simpson, a political scientist and former alderman. ''Congressman Jackson has been building a case, trying to build a coalition.''
Mr. Jackson's office declined to comment for this article, and his father declined requests to be interviewed as well.
Until this spring, Representative Jackson made a point of rarely missing votes in Congress, nearly to the point of obsession, said an associate who recalled him literally sprinting to cast a vote before it drew to a close.
In Congress, he was credited with securing nearly a billion dollars for projects in his district; pressing for constitutional amendments ensuring rights like voting, health care and housing; and this spring urging an increase in the minimum wage.
''One of the things I teased him about was that they always say his father is a tree shaker, not a jelly maker,'' said Delmarie Cobb, a Chicago consultant and communications director in Mr. Jackson's first Congressional race, referring to a phrase the senior Mr. Jackson had been quoted as using about himself.
''The idea now was, you need to roll up your sleeves and be a jelly maker,'' Ms. Cobb said of the congressman, recalling suggestions that he could be ''Jesse Plus -- everything Jesse has, plus you'll be a hard worker.''
Still, in his earliest political years, the son benefited significantly from his connection to his famous father.
After working as a national field organizer for Rainbow PUSH, Mr. Jackson was only 30 and had never held political office in 1995 when he sought a Congressional seat among a competitive field with older, more seasoned opponents, including Emil Jones Jr., a product of Chicago's political machine and the Democrats' leader in the State Senate. Campaign buttons in that first race, offering a not-so-subtle reminder of the father-son link, read: ''A new generation.''
In that first race, the elder Mr. Jackson could be seen out on the city's South Side, in his son's would-be Congressional district, shaking hands, signing autographs and proudly urging voters to remember his son at the ballot box. In 1988, the younger Mr. Jackson introduced his father, at the end of a second presidential bid, at the Democratic National Convention as ''a man who fights against the odds, who lives the odds, our dad, Jesse Jackson.''
Yet, the younger Mr. Jackson's former advisers said he always realized that the link carried benefits and complications, saying at times, ''I'm my father's son, and there are some things I get credit for and shouldn't, and there are some things I get blamed for and shouldn't.''
The Second Congressional District of Illinois includes parts of the predominantly black South Side, but also southern suburbs and a sizable population that was white or Hispanic and had grown weary of politicians after Mel Reynolds, Mr. Jackson's predecessor who resigned after being convicted of having sex with a teenage girl. So Mr. Jackson reached for a wide audience. Aides recall him giving some campaign speeches in English and then in Spanish, drawing note from Latino voters.
''You saw the same thing in him that you would see in Barack Obama,'' said Hermene D. Hartman, the publisher of N'Digo magazine who assisted on the 1995 campaign. ''It was the same newness, freshness, difference, change. That's very politically sexy. He was the new wave.''
That wave, said Representative Danny K. Davis, a fellow Democrat here, seemed limitless. ''He was smart, charismatic, articulate, pedigreed,'' Mr. Davis said. ''And so, there was nothing that could stand in the way, quite frankly, of this being a natural for higher office.''
Trouble Surfaces
By the end of 2008, though, Representative Jackson suddenly found himself in the middle of a political storm. After Mr. Obama won the presidential election, the appointment of a successor to the Senate was left to Governor Blagojevich, who is now in federal prison after being convicted of trying to trade the appointment for something of value.
The accusations against Mr. Blagojevich included claims that he discussed sizable campaign donations from Raghuveer Nayak, a longtime supporter and friend of Mr. Jackson and his family, in exchange for appointing Mr. Jackson. Mr. Jackson came to be known as Senate Candidate No. 5 in the criminal complaint against Mr. Blagojevich -- a complaint that Mr. Jackson and his father discussed in a phone call on the day of the arrest, documents show, even conferencing in Mr. Nayak at one point.
Mr. Jackson, who had openly sought the Senate job, has repeatedly denied any knowledge of deal-making or payoff plans and has not been charged in the case. If Mr. Nayak was offering millions of dollars to appoint Mr. Jackson, Mr. Jackson knew nothing about it, he has said. Still, the House ethics inquiry continues.
Then came revelations of a relationship with a woman in Washington, and Mr. Jackson's wife, Sandi, an alderman on the Chicago City Council, acknowledged a rough period in their marriage.
Since Mr. Jackson disappeared from public view last month, Ms. Jackson has said little, telling a scrum of reporters not long ago, ''I think it's important to say that I love my husband very much, that's the first thing.'' She added, ''The second thing is as a wife, my primary concern is that of my children -- just want to make sure that they're taken care of and provided for.''
Endless Speculation
That has left much to speculation -- endless parsing of the brief, official words released by Mr. Jackson's office and an inconclusive rehashing of his medical history, including a weight-loss surgery in 2004 after a 100-pound weight gain left Mr. Jackson at 310 pounds, according to The Hill, and a wrenched back in 2005 that required pain medication, according to Chicago magazine.
In the latest statement from Mr. Jackson's office, on Wednesday, his aides took care to note that Mr. Jackson was not being treated for alcohol or substance abuse -- some among the many rumors floating about. The statement did not disclose where Mr. Jackson is being treated or the name of his doctor, citing a need to protect his privacy.
''He is responding positively to treatment and is expected to make a full recovery,'' the statement said. It offered no details of Mr. Jackson's mood disorder, a category of mental illnesses that includes major depressive and bipolar disorders, according to the National Institutes of Health.
Before the 2007 election for mayor of Chicago, Mr. Jackson gave serious consideration to running, several former advisers said. While Mayor Richard M. Daley was viewed as so unbeatable that many referred to him as ''Mayor for Life,'' Mr. Jackson was seen as one of the few people who might be able to defeat him.
Strategy meetings were called. So were large donors. But then Mr. Jackson decided not to pursue it that year, and by 2011, when Mr. Daley retired, few people even brought up Mr. Jackson's name.
For now, he seems in control of his Congressional seat, as long as he wants it. After running one of his most energetic, intense campaigns in years, Mr. Jackson in March easily held off a serious Democratic primary challenge from Debbie Halvorson, who had served in Congress, and has been widely expected to win the general election in the strongly Democratic district. His supporters say that his political future remains bright and that the clouds of recent years will ultimately amount, in Ms. Hartman's words, to ''a hiccup.'' Still, questions are looming.
''We need to keep him and his family in our thoughts and prayers,'' Brian Woodworth, Mr. Jackson's little-known Republican opponent, said last week. ''But there's a policy issue here as well, and that's that there needs to be more information for the voters. There's too much there that says, what's going on?''
At the Rainbow PUSH conference at a downtown hotel on Wednesday afternoon, a pack of reporters pursued the elder Mr. Jackson, seeking insights about his son's medical state. Mr. Jackson, 70, never known to avoid the television cameras, ignored them, disappearing behind a curtain. Exiting through a back kitchen area, past racks of dirty dishes, he answered no questions. ''No, no,'' he said before climbing into a service elevator.

HEADLINE: Fear of Year-End Fiscal Stalemate May Be Having Effect Now

BYLINE: By REBECCA BERG

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- With the economy having slowed in recent weeks, business leaders and policy makers are growing concerned that the tax increases and government spending cuts set to take effect at year's end have already begun to cause companies to hold back on hiring and investments.
Economists say the magnitude of the effect remains unclear and the fiscal uncertainty is probably not the economy's main problem, but is instead one of several factors -- along with Europe's troubles, the spike in oil prices this spring and a continuing hangover from the housing bubble -- restraining growth.
''We think it's an issue now, and it will be increasingly an issue in the second half of the year for people's decisions,'' Douglas W. Elmendorf, director of the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office, said recently. He warned that the uncertainty could stifle gross domestic product growth by as much as 0.5 percent this year. 
A market index that economists consider to be a proxy for uncertainty -- the Chicago Board Options Exchange Volatility Index, or the VIX -- has risen more than 26 percent since the beginning of April, when the so-called fiscal cliff began to draw headlines.
A separate index meant specifically to track uncertainty over government policy, created by Nick Bloom, an economist at Stanford University, and Steven J. Davis, an economist at the University of Chicago, has risen approximately 56 percent during the same period.
The fiscal cliff refers to a combination of tax increases and spending cuts scheduled to start at the first of next year. Leaders of both parties say they do not want the changes to take effect as planned, with President Obama saying Monday that he favored a temporary extension of tax cuts on income below $250,000 and Republicans favoring the extension of all tax cuts.
But the two parties have so far been unable to agree on a plan to avoid the scheduled tax increases and spending cuts.
The expiration of the tax cuts -- both President George W. Bush's and additional tax cuts from Mr. Obama's stimulus bill -- would cause the tax bill for a typical middle-class household to rise by about $1,750. A series of automatic spending cuts, to both military and domestic programs, would also take effect on Jan. 1, a result of the failure of a special Congressional committee to reach a deficit deal last year.
If Congress does not act, the changes would cause roughly a 4 percent reduction in economic output, according to the Congressional Budget Office -- and, some experts predict, would result in another recession.
But extending the laws indefinitely without a plan for future savings could increase debt unsustainably, creating longer-term problems. The dueling risks, combined with an approaching election, leave many forecasters unsure of what will happen.
Businesses are keenly aware of a of the potential for outright legislative failure to deal with the situation, executives and analysts say. Businesses tend to be more sensitive to uncertainty over government policy than consumers, because consumers tend not to be anticipatory in their economic behavior; rather, they react to fiscal and monetary shifts only once they have occurred. If corporations sense the potential for a downturn, however, they become more likely to hold off on hiring new employees or investing in new projects.
''Part of the uncertainty is simply not knowing who's going to be the president and who's going to be in charge of Congress,'' said Dean Maki, the chief United States economist at Barclays Capital. ''And that's only amplified by the fact that major policy changes need to be made after the election.''
In a survey published in June by the Business Roundtable, chief executives reported growing more pessimistic about the trajectory of the economy. W. James McNerney, chief executive of Boeing and chairman of the Business Roundtable, said that the concerns included ''uncertainty over year-end U.S. government tax and spending plans and a path to resolution of the euro zone crises.''
As a military contractor that could be directly affected by spending cuts, Boeing has begun pressuring lawmakers to outline a plan of action.
Deborah Lee James, the executive vice president for government affairs and communications at SAIC, another large military contractor, said, ''Uncertainty of this nature is the enemy of both those of us in industry and policy makers.''
Outside the military contracting industry, the fiscal cliff has not received the same amount of attention, but it is starting to receive more.
A senior Obama administration official, who requested anonymity when recounting private discussions, said that it was unclear whether uncertainty was affecting corporate decisions, but that chief executives talked about the subject. ''Every C.E.O. I talk to'' mentions it, the official said. ''It's a large part of the buzz.''
Last summer's debt ceiling debate provides a case study of how businesses can react to uncertain legislative outcomes.
Betsey Stevenson and Justin Wolfers, economists at the Wharton School at the University of Pennsylvania, found corporations cut back on hiring as Congress delayed raising the debt ceiling.
''We never reached the debt ceiling, we raised it before we reached it, but that didn't mean nothing bad happened,'' Professor Stevenson said. ''I think you could say the same thing about the fiscal cliff.''
The index created by Professor Bloom and Professor Davis -- to measure uncertainty over regulation -- is based on media coverage, taxes set to expire and disagreement among economists about the market's trajectory. Historically, uncertainty over fiscal policy has had some of the biggest effects on the index. The debt ceiling dispute produced a bigger spike than the 2001 terrorist attacks or the 2008 collapse of Lehman Brothers.
Professor Bloom, an associate professor at Stanford, said he expected it to have a growing effect in coming months.
''We're in horrible limbo,'' Professor Bloom said. ''It's like the economy is on death row.''
Robert E. Rubin, the former Treasury secretary and Wall Street executive, finds a positive angle to the fiscal cliff, which he says has created potentially productive pressure on Congress to reduce the deficit. Nevertheless, Mr. Rubin says he favors debt reduction that would not take effect until after the economy had begun a solid recovery.
''I think the current fiscal outlook is having a serious effect on confidence,'' Mr. Rubin said. He added that he did not believe the fiscal cliff itself was damaging confidence yet, but that it could begin to do so in the fall.
Whatever the end result, R. Glenn Hubbard -- dean of the business school at Columbia University, a former adviser to Mr. Bush and a current adviser to Mitt Romney -- said that ''businesspeople are rightly upset.''
As a source of uncertainty for businesses in particular, Professor Hubbard ranks the fiscal cliff first, even above the debt crisis in Europe. He added, ''This kind of uncertainty is very bad because it needn't be.''

 CORRECTION:
An article on Thursday about uncertainties surrounding a package of tax increases and spending cuts scheduled to take effect in 2013 if Congress does not act misstated, in some copies, part of the budgetary effect of such inaction. The government would gain -- not forfeit -- $399 billion in tax revenue.

HIGHLIGHT: Metropolitan Diary: Prices change in the subways when the train enters Manhattan from Jackson Heights. 

 BODY:
Dear Diary:
 While I was on my way from Jackson Heights to Lower Manhattan a few weeks ago on the R subway line, one of those ubiquitous small-item vendors came through the car, loudly calling out: "Yo-yos, Rubik's cubes! One dollar only!" 
As he had some buyers - including me - he happily dispensed his wares from a large shopping bag he was carrying.
As we pulled into the 59th Street/Lexington Avenue station, he announced, "Next stop, Lexington Avenue," which was then followed by his now modified call: "Yo-yos, Rubik's cubes! Five dollars!"
Everyone around me giggled at his demonstrated mastery of the economic rules of the marketplace.

HEADLINE: Very Serious Predictions

BYLINE: PAUL KRUGMAN


HIGHLIGHT: Where's my fiscal crisis? 

 BODY:
Erskine Bowles and Alan Simpson are the quintessential Very Serious People; they are mentioned in worshipful tones no matter how bizarre their remarks. And they were key players in the great hijacking of US policy debate over the course of 2010 and 2011, in which unemployment dropped off the agenda and the deficit moved front and center.
So, about 16 months have passed since both men predicted a US fiscal crisis within two years. Here's how it's going: the US just sold a bunch of long term debt for the lowest interest rate ever. A picture (I had to overlay two slightly different series because the constant-maturity data don't go all the way back):
The truth is that predictions of am imminent fiscal crisis made no sense, and would have been considered irresponsible demagoguery if the people making the predictions weren't so Serious.

HEADLINE: Amid Chatter on Climate and Energy Views, a Look at Deeds

BYLINE: ANDREW C. REVKIN


HIGHLIGHT: A fresh look at Americans' energy and climate habits. 

 BODY:
There is endless cogitation, here and elsewhere, over views on human-driven global warming and America's energy menu. Much of this, I'm afraid, is about as useful as watching "water sloshing in a shallow pan." Lots of motion, no depth.
Here's a quick look beyond climate and energy beliefs and words to climate and energy , provided in the latest report on American's actions related to energy conservation and greenhouse gases from the Yale Project on Climate Change Communication and Center for Climate Change Communication at George Mason University.
The full report (and survey methodology) is here: Americans' Actions to Conserve Energy, Reduce Waste, and Limit Global Warming in March 2012. Here are highlights from the summary distributed today by Anthony Leiserowitz of the Yale group:
In the past year, more than half of Americans (56 percent) say they have attempted to reduce their family's energy consumption.
However, fewer than half (43 percent) of Americans report they often or always set the thermostat to 68 degrees or cooler in the winter, a 5-point decline since November 2011.
21 percent of Americans say they sometimes, often or always use public transportation or carpool, and 30 percent say they walk or bike instead of driving, an 11- and 5-point decline, respectively, since November 2011.
One in three (33 percent) Americans say that in the past year they rewarded companies that are taking steps to reduce global warming by buying their products.
Over the next 12 months, 52 percent of Americans intend to reward or punish companies for their global warming-related behaviors by either buying or boycotting their products.
15 percent of Americans say they have volunteered or donated money to an organization working to reduce global warming. One in ten Americans (11 percent) has written a letter, email, or phoned a government official about global warming. Of these, 77 percent urged officials to take action, while 19 percent urged them not to take action to reduce global warming.
In the past year, more Americans report that they increased vs. decreased their attention to global warming stories in the news (28 percent more vs. 19 percent less).
By contrast, fewer Americans say that in the past year they talked about global warming with people they know (18 percent more vs. 27 percent less), searched for global warming information on the internet (11percent more vs. 35 percent less), or shared global warming information on social networks sites (such as Facebook, Twitter, blogs, or other social network programs) (6 percent more vs. 41 percent less).
A new report from the American Council for an Energy-Efficient Economy ranks the United States ninth in energy efficiency among the dozen major economies assessed and finds "limited or little progress toward greater efficiency at the national level."
With that in mind, I agree with comment contributors on recent pieces discussing the fracking fight who say any push to sustain or expand fossil fuel choices should be part of a broader commitment to use energy more carefully and efficiently. This came up in 2010 with President Obama's push for more oil development, but bundled with broader commitments to develop new fuel options and transportation technologies.
In transportation, at least, there are signs of progress, as shown in data analyzed by the University of Michigan's initiative on Sustainable Worldwide Transportation. The research group maintains an "Eco-Driving Index" that tracks American vehicle driving and buying habits and vehicle emissions trends. Have a look at the latest findings, which show how a mix of tightening mileage standards and behavior changes led, as of April, to a 19 percent reduction in emissions per driver of newly purchased vehicles compared to October 2007.
On that front, too, it's worth listening to former Secretary of State George Shultz. In an interview taped by staff at Stanford University, he makes the non-partisan case for climate-smart energy action while showing off his solar-charged Nissan Leaf. Here's my Twitter summary of one nugget:
GOP elder statesman George Shultz on his solar-charged Leaf: "I'm driving on sunshine. Take that, Ahmadinejad!" shar.es/t50de (video)
- Andy Revkin (@Revkin) July 12, 2012
And here's the video:
One thing to note, of course, is that it remains far easier to "walk the talk" if you have the resources to afford such technologies. I'd still like to scrap the oil tank in our basement and move to a geothermal system for heat and cooling (right now it's ceiling and box fans for us for cooling). But I see no affordable path at the moment.

HEADLINE: Two Medical Students Navigate the Health Care Maze

BYLINE: PAULINE W. CHEN, M.D.


HIGHLIGHT: What do all of the changes in health care mean for a new generation of doctors? "The Health Care Handbook," written by two medical students at Washington University, is an astonishingly clear "user's manual" that explains our health care system and the policies that will shape it in the years to come. 

 BODY:
A burly Midwesterner in his mid-20s, he had entered medical school determined to become a primary care physician. But over the last two years, despite encouragement from mentors and good experiences helping patients at the local free clinic, the resolve of the young doctor-to-be had wavered. On the eve of his third year of medical school, he had become more apprehensive than ever.
One recent afternoon, seeing his eyes turn glassy and his smile freeze, I realized that my own attempt to encourage him was failing to restore his determination. 
"I appreciate what you're trying to tell me," he said. "But there's a big difference between your experiences and mine." He paused to search for words to explain, then smiled when the television down the hall began blasting the latest news on health care reform. 
"You knew what you were getting into when you started, but us," he said, gesturing toward the television, "we have no idea of what health care or our futures will look like."
For several years now, doctors and patients have been struggling to reimagine the future of health care. Policy makers, health care experts and pundits have been eager to help, churning out well-meaning op-eds and essays and cobbling together exhaustive blogs and books. Trying to help the rest of us understand, for example, they have described how Medicare will rely increasingly on "accountable care organizations" and "bundled payments" and eventually eliminate "the doughnut hole." 
Unfortunately, there's been one problem with these earnest and well-intentioned attempts to help: It's hard to understand what they are saying. In fact, few of us fully understand how the health care system works in the first place, let alone what these august experts are trying to say.
Now Elisabeth Askin and Nathan Moore, medical students from the Washington University School of Medicine in Saint Louis, have set out to help all of us understand. Motivated by their own anxiety about the future, they have written "The Health Care Handbook" (self-published with their medical school), an astonishingly clear "user's manual" that explains our health care system and the policies that will change it. 
It's the kind of book to share not only with your doctors and colleagues, but with your friends and Aunt Dorothy, too.
In their unpretentious voice, Ms. Askin and Mr. Moore make clear from the beginning that their explanations are neither in-depth nor definitive. But given their evenhanded and highly organized prose, it's hard not to put their book in the same revered category as a medical textbook or dictionary. In a mere 175 pages, and with an impressive roster of references and well-placed graphics, "The Health Care Handbook" illuminates the maddeningly opaque terms, acronyms, organizations, personages and policies that abound in health care. The authors do so not by expounding on the minutiae, but by jettisoning the jargon and gobbledygook and presenting only the core ideas. 
For example, they explain the Affordable Care Act using a series of questions. In the process Ms. Askin and Mr. Moore distill the law's more than 2,000 pages --- "a little longer than a Harry Potter book," they deadpan - down to one of the best explanations I've seen. It can be read in under 20 minutes. 
And thanks to their particularly winsome literary voice, what usually is mind-numbingly dull turns into a good and even occasionally funny read. "Everything is always more complicated than you think," the two authors write in the introduction, putting it in bold, italicized and underlined type to embellishing their warning. ("If we could have underlined that phrase obsessively in each copy of this book, we would have," they continue.)
That medical students, and not a group of rarefied experts, would write such a book comes as no surprise to some. "No one knows what is going to happen tomorrow," said Rebekah Apple of the American College of Physician Executives, a professional organization that has begun reaching out to young doctors to help them develop management and leadership skills in the face of uncertainty. "But these young doctors are even more acutely aware of the shifting sands."
Unlike physicians who finished their education and training even a decade earlier, current medical students must learn to practice in a system that is constantly changing, and their medical schools, already overburdened with an ever-growing list of required courses and competencies, have few or no resources to help them. Many students have taken matters into their own hands, putting together health policy and economics discussion groups and lecture series for themselves.
The idea of "The Health Care Handbook" was hatched a little over a year ago in such a student-initiated discussion group. "We wanted to write the book we were looking for," Mr. Moore said. With guidance from Dr. William A. Peck, director of the Center for Health Policy at Washington University and former dean of the medical school, and the help of close to 50 expert and lay readers, Mr. Moore and Ms. Askin wrote the book in under a year while managing their medical school obligations. 
With the future of health care wide open, "The Health Care Handbook" is being published primarily in e-book form to allow for quick revisions (the newest edition came out within a week of the Supreme Court decision). A paperback edition is scheduled to come out at the end of the summer, and there are plans to offer video modules and other supplemental materials. 
While Ms. Askin and Mr. Moore still have a year or more of medical school to complete, they hope to keep the inspiration for the book and its future iterations in the hands of those who need it most. After they graduate, a group of students from their medical school will be chosen every year to update and revise the book as needed "to ensure that fresh student perspective."
"We wanted to write a book that would be like giving people little floaties to help them learn to swim through the vast and confusing ocean that is health care," Ms. Askin said. 
She added: "It's exciting to us that our book could actually be helping people."

HEADLINE: Taking on a Debt to New York

BYLINE: ROSALIE KNECHT


HIGHLIGHT: Credit? Who needs it? Did you know you can turn an abandoned Volkswagen into an outhouse? 

 BODY:
A few years ago, when I had just moved to New York, my father mentioned in a letter that my mother, who is a nurse, had spent the week arranging hospice care for a dying patient. "I spent this week hanging a door," he said. "Kind of seems insignificant in comparison. On the other hand, the door will almost certainly last longer."
At that point I was struggling to manage the financial records of a recruiting company in Chelsea - a nightmarish task for which I had no aptitude or training whatsoever - and picking up other odd jobs as they arose. I spent a while temping at a real estate development firm that was short-handed because the regular receptionist had gone on a monthlong Scientology cruise. Of course, none of this was as profound as comforting the dying, or as tangible as hanging a door. 
Around that time I also applied to be a personal assistant to a somewhat old-fashioned writer. During the interview, he asked me what my father did, and when I answered that he and my brother were both in construction, he said, "I see. But you weren't interested in construction!" as if I had bravely thrown aside the family business in favor of life in the big city. I didn't know how to explain that girls aren't usually under a lot of pressure to go into the building trades.
What I had gotten from the family affinity for carpentry, though, was a blithe belief that it was possible to sidestep capitalism by making your own stuff. In the '70s, after my parents were thrown out of the converted dairy shed they'd been living in for starting a chimney fire, my dad built a two-room wood-frame house in Perry County, Pa., at the edge of my grandparents' farm. The house was neat and attractive but lacked indoor plumbing, electricity, running water and insulation. But my parents liked being left alone better than pretty much anything else in the world and they had an entire movement of hippie back-to-the-landers giving context to their priorities. 
Eventually, yearning for easy street, they paid $4,000 cash for what could be called a house only in the loosest sense of the word: four stone walls with trees growing in the stairwell and chimney. They moved into it as soon as they'd fixed the roof and floors, and spent the next 10 years finishing it. My brother and I grew up in that house during those years, and my parents still live there. By going about things in this profoundly weird way, they managed to own a house outright without ever taking out a bank loan. Neither of them had any credit history whatsoever until they were well into their 40s.
With this background, I arrived at adulthood and New York City with a smug and completely deluded attitude toward credit and debt. Namely: who needs it? It might seem as if you do, if you want a house or a car, but there's always some way around it. Get out of the rat race! Show some ingenuity! Did you know you can turn an abandoned Volkswagen into an outhouse? 
Armed with my optimism, I moved into a four-story brownstone in Bed-Stuy, Brooklyn, that a pair of enthusiastic, self-taught carpenters had converted from seven bedrooms to 10, drastically reducing the rent per tenant. They had done this by putting up walls wherever they would fit, and by striking a deal with the landlord: we wouldn't complain about the black mold or the lack of gutters or the mysterious soft spots appearing in the drywall like fontanels, and he would pick up our rent check on the front stoop without coming inside. We eventually added an 11th bedroom, a little shed in the backyard that was six inches too small to need a permit from the city. One of the carpenters lived in it and paid $150 per month in rent, which we used to buy mammoth bags of dry goods from a grocery wholesaler in Queens. All of this seemed perfectly reasonable to my parents. Only occasionally did I lie in bed at night and think: What are the warning signs before a house actually falls down? Is there, like, a sound?
I had three great years there, and when it got to be too much, I moved into a regular apartment - a structurally sound two-bedroom in Prospect-Lefferts Gardens - and was smacked in the face with the reality of market-rate real estate. I was an administrator at a ballet school by then, and to afford the apartment I was increasing my hours and trying frantically and unsuccessfully to break into bartending, the holy grail of New York stopgap jobs. The longer hours at a desk forced the realization that what I did to make a living was falling exactly nowhere on the "hanging a door" vs. "comforting the dying" matrix. It was neither tangible nor profound. I was going to have to make a change.
I could have left the city. Running away into the woods had always seemed like a reasonable option. I'd once known a guy who did that, explaining with the dogged logic of the perpetually stoned that rent was a major drain on his finances and he was going to go live in a tent in a eucalyptus grove in the Berkeley hills. You've heard about these people before, but they tend to live in another culture and another climate. New Yorkers don't do that. It's too cold, and where would you do laundry?
 So leaving the city was out. Staying put meant digging in, dropping the patchwork of part-time jobs and getting what my dad once referred to, with hippie élan, as a "straight job": benefits, a 9-to-5 schedule, and not going to work with plaster on your pants. I start a new job as a grant writer next week. Eventually, I'd like to go to graduate school for social work, since my mortal terror of student debt has decreased as my selection of business-casual attire has increased. My choices are made, for the time being, and they do not involve going off the grid.
Whenever I go home to Pennsylvania, though, I'm reminded of the alternatives. This year, just when I'd gotten comfortable dismissing the creditless, mortageless Elysium I grew up in as a relic of another generation and a very different economy, a counterpoint popped up.
Recently, a Catholic monk approached my grandparents about buying a house from them. The house is next door to the one my grandparents live in, and it has been more or less abandoned for 20 years. The roof was breached a long time ago, and as a kid I was warned not to go in there because the floors might cave in. One day this spring, the monk rode by on his bicycle, saw the derelict property, and started making inquiries.
My grandparents arranged for the house to be transferred to him free of charge, since the property is worthless at best, a liability at worst, and they were happy to have it off their hands. The monk plans to make it into a hermitage. The only resource he has currently committed is his own physical energy. He used to live in a monastery in Camden, where he did free carpentry and other odd jobs for people when the building inspectors weren't around, and as a gesture of gratitude, he's been doing some chores for my grandparents. The first thing they asked him to do: hang a door.

HEADLINE: Rebel Whimper

BYLINE: KENNETH W. NOE


HIGHLIGHT: Money, not ideology, drove many men to join the Confederate Army in 1862. 

 BODY:
James H. Lee enlisted in the new 43rd Alabama Infantry in the spring of 1862. A man either poor enough or transient enough to have eluded the census taker two years earlier, Lee openly admitted that it was money, in the form of regular pay and a $50 bounty (akin to a signing bonus), that finally convinced him to rally to the colors. Writing from camp near Mobile, Ala., a few weeks later, he already regretted his decision. "We have not drawed one red cent," he wrote his wife, "and from what I hear among the boys they havent more than one third of them ever drawed half of there bounty yet." 
A week later, still unpaid, Lee wrote his father asking him to contact a friendly local judge and sue the government for his release. "I have been told by severel men," he explained, "that if they do not pay a soldier his bounty as soon as he is mustered in to service he is at liberty to come home if he sees cause to do so." The Confederacy had stiffed him on his bounty, and he wanted out.
Both the promise of a hefty bounty and the failure to deliver it to Lee were typical stories in the Confederacy by 1862. The South was desperate for men as the campaigns of 1862 loomed. A year earlier, in the new republic's first heady days, fears that not enough men to win the war would volunteer seemed unthinkable. Observers, like the British correspondent William Howard Russell, reported waves of excitement and enthusiastic volunteering across the south that accompanied secession and the creation of the new government. Weeks before Fort Sumter, the Provisional Confederate Congress authorized Jefferson Davis to raise 100,000 volunteers for a period of 12 months, a quota the military met so easily that it sent many eager recruits home. 
Three months later, after the victory at Bull Run and Abraham Lincoln's decision to raise a massive Union force, the Confederate Congress authorized an additional 400,000 soldiers. Never a proponent of short enlistments, Davis wanted the new recruits to serve for the duration of the war. Compromising, legislators settled on three years, but even that term proved too much for many Southern men, and the results were disappointing. Worse, by the end of 1861, Davis and the Army faced the end of the 12-month enlistments, and it was obvious to a host of battlefield commanders that many of those war-weary soldiers would leave camp and head home for good, given the chance, in March 1862.
The Confederate Congress reacted to the threat of the bulk of its army marching home by passing legislation in December 1861 to keep the men in the field. The new act was long on carrot and short on stick: it authorized a $50 bounty, a 60-day furlough and transportation home for soldiers willing to re-enlist. Once back in camp they could reorganize their units and, to the bitter consternation of West Pointers throughout the Army, elect their own officers. Men who had not served previously but who were now willing to sign up for three years or the duration of the war would also receive the bounty. Before the month was out, Congress authorized the creation of entirely new companies helmed by elected officers and brigaded with older state units.
To Richmond's chagrin, the December legislation still did not produce enough men; the manpower crisis continued through the winter. By April 1862, George B. McClellan's 100,000-man Army of the Potomac was massing outside of Washington. Davis, the presidential adviser Robert E. Lee and the Confederate military as a whole were worried enough about having adequate numbers of men to fight that spring that the ostensibly states' rights, anti-centralization government in Richmond instituted the first draft in American history. Unless exempted, men between the ages of 18 and 35 would owe the republic three years of military service. 
Still hoping to raise troops without coercion, Congress continued the provisions of the December legislation. Men could still enlist voluntarily, and so choose their companies and officers as well as collect their bounties, or otherwise wait for the government to do the choosing for them. They also retained the right to hire substitutes. In a tradition going back to the American Revolution, and reaffirmed by the Richmond government as recently as October 1861, volunteers could leave the Army at the rate of one per company per month if they could persuade someone to take their place. The April conscription law allowed drafted men to provide substitutes as well, as long as they were recruits not otherwise draft-eligible.
In the end, enlistment and conscription legislation decisively shaped the Confederate Army. Raw numbers tell much of the story. Of all the men who fought in gray, 15 percent, roughly 120,000 men, were conscripts, unwilling soldiers who sometimes had to be jailed before being delivered to their commands. Draft evasion, meanwhile, undermined morale among common whites. Another 9 percent, some 70,000 soldiers, entered the Army as substitutes through conscription's side door. Substitution created a boom market for likely men, some of whom received hundreds of dollars, property and even land in exchange for taking a desperate soldier's or draftee's place. Comrades routinely scorned conscripts and substitutes for their lack of commitment, poor performance and alleged tendency to desert. 
Finally, 180,000 Johnny Rebs, 22.5 percent of all who fought for the Confederacy, enlisted for the first time as volunteers in the wake of Congress's December 1861 and April 1862 legislation - including James H. Lee. In a recent study I sampled 320 of these "later enlisters." Generally a bit older and notably less ideological than their predecessors, these soldiers largely rallied to the colors for reasons that had much to do with their growing fears that invading Yankee "vandals" would deprive them of land, property, slaves and ultimately their families' economic survival. About 1 in 10 men also cited the bounty and a broader need for making a living in hard and inflationary times. For many of them, like Lee, soldiering was a job, and one of the few available.
For Lee, though, it was a job he usually wanted to quit. He tried and tried again to leave the Army that initially would not pay him his bounty. When he discovered that the camp rumor about men having contracts that guaranteed their release was mere wishful thinking, he turned to searching for a substitute. His father identified a likely man, but it was too late; yet another new law in September 1862 raised the upper draft age to 45 and made the potential substitute eligible for conscription and thus ineligible for substitution. 
Serving as a nurse as well as a detailed carpenter, Lee embraced Christianity while in uniform but remained bitter. He managed to avoid combat until he was transferred to the 1st Confederate Engineer Troops as a sapper. Captured during the Battle of the Crater in July 1864, Lee died in captivity weeks later, a reluctant Rebel to the last.

HEADLINE: Out of Africa

BYLINE: DAYO OLOPADE


HIGHLIGHT: Kenya has decided to issue fewer work permits to foreign workers in an attempt to boost employment for young Kenyans. This won't work. 

 BODY:
NAIROBI - I live in the most cosmopolitan city in East Africa. Here, going about one's daily business, it's easy to cross paths with Ugandans, Tanzanians, Rwandans, Sudanese, Somalis, Ethiopian and Eritreans. Add to that a dollop of Nigerians, Ghanaians, Cameroonians and Congolese, not to mention Europeans, Americans and Indians, and you have a dynamic mix of skills and histories in one unusual place.
But as of this week, the international flavor of Nairobi - as well as the economic progress of Kenya at large - is suddenly in peril.
Kenya just slapped age and salary restrictions on the issuing of work permits to foreign nationals. Permission to work will be given only to those foreigners over the age of 35 making more than $24,000 annually. There will also be a cap at the high end of the income scale: foreign medical, accounting, engineering, legal and real-estate professionals are banned from coming to Kenya outright.
The announcement, made recently by the immigration minister, Otieno Kajwang, is a halfhearted attempt to shore up employment figures that are admittedly dismal for Kenyan youth, even those with university degrees. Sixty-five percent of young Kenyans, or some 10 million people, are without work. Fewer foreign workers means more local jobs, the protectionist logic goes.
The new policy could particularly affect the flow of low-wage Asian immigrants to Kenya and neighboring countries. At present, Chinese and Indian nationals hold a combined 14,000 Kenyan work permits, and can be seen driving steamrollers and managing restaurants far into the hinterlands. Though the new measures are thin gruel compared with the wholesale expulsion of Asians from East Africa in 1972, the sentiment behind them is similar. 
"We do not want to create little India, little Pakistan and little China in Kenya," wrote one commentator in Business Daily, the top local business paper.
This is a step in the wrong direction. Kenya has issued about 26,000 work permits to foreigners since 2007 - hardly enough jobs to employ the millions of young Kenyans who lack work. The policy may keep out young Somalis, who are seen as undesirable in the wake of repeated bombings by the extremist Somali-based group Al Shabaab. But it will not penalize the growing body of well-heeled, older workers circling over the region's new oil finds. And it'll hobble many of the private-sector ventures that effectively create jobs and services for Kenyans, either directly or through secondary means.
The biggest employers of expatriates in Kenya are Nestlé, Safaricom, East African Breweries and Bharti Airtel - companies with a mix of foreign and homegrown corporate components that supplement local labor with specialized foreign talent. Add to the pile regional players like Unilever, PZ Cussons and Bidco, and smaller, development-focused firms like Juhudi Kilimo, the microfinance arm of the K-Rep Bank. Each offers value-added services essential to replacing imports, developing a service and manufacturing base, improving agricultural output and weaning Kenya off the tourism teat.
What's more, I'd wager that even expatriate-heavy firms are doing more to employ Kenyans than the members of Kenya's Parliament: Legislators may have helped improve education here, but they have spent more creative energy trying to avoid national taxes. 
So why the blanket persecution? The cynic in me sees this as a ploy from Nyayo House, Kenya's infamous immigration agency. It is widely known as a cartel that routinely extorts foreign firms in exchange for granting them access to Kenya's workforce. Properly enforced, the old law was sufficient to protect low-wage jobs. Imposing yet more requirements will create more avenues for rent-seeking - as well as an incentive for even more parties to go around the law.
A chief irony of this is that Kenya usually is the voice of anti-protectionism in the East African Community, a regional organization of five states that seeks to integrate its members' currency and labor laws to promote regional growth. Kenyan negotiators have been assuring less powerful members of the organization that having no fences is what makes good neighbors.
They're forgetting that works two ways.

HEADLINE: Taxi Fares in New York to Rise by 17%

BYLINE: MATT FLEGENHEIMER and MICHAEL M. GRYNBAUM


HIGHLIGHT: The Taxi and Limousine Commission voted to raise fares by an average of 17 percent, the first major increase in eight years. The fares could go into effect as soon as September. 

 BODY:
The cost to take a yellow cab in New York City is about to go up.
The Taxi and Limousine Commission voted on Thursday to raise taxi fares by an average of 17 percent, the first major increase in eight years. The new fares are expected to go into effect in September. 
The cost of a fare between Manhattan and Kennedy International Airport will rise by $7, to $52, exclusive of tolls and tip. The surcharge on rides to Newark Liberty International Airport will also go up, to $17.50 from $15. 
Six members of the commission voted in favor; two voted against, and one abstained. The commission also approved a small adjustment in the amount that taxi owners can charge cabbies to rent their vehicles for a shift. 
But the bulk of the higher fares is expected to go directly toward higher wages for cabbies, whose pay has lagged behind inflation. 
"Taxi drivers have been working hard for six years with no raise," David S. Yassky, the chairman of the taxi commission, said on Thursday. "There comes a time you need to make sure people can earn a decent living."
Mr. Yassky acknowledged that ridership could fall with the increase, but he said that, historically, fare increases had led to only slight declines in demand.
Owners of large taxi fleets, however, complained that they would not receive a larger proportion of the higher fares, saying they should be able to charge drivers proportionately higher rates for renting a vehicle.
Michael Woloz, a spokesman for the Metropolitan Taxicab Board of Trade, which frequently sues the city's taxi commission, said the yellow cab industry would "seriously look at all of our options, including legal options."
"What happened today was not a package," Mr. Woloz said. "It was a lopsided giveback to the drivers." 
The last across-the-board fare increase occurred in 2004, when metered fares rose by about 26 percent. 
Nora C. Marino, one of the commissioners who voted against the fare increase, said she supported a raise for drivers but was concerned that the package was not "balanced."
"You could see it in the room," Ms. Marino said. "When one half of the room is cheering and the other half of the room has long faces, that's not a balance."
Cabbies' groups, who have complained for years that drivers could barely earn a living in their jobs, were thrilled by the outcome of Thursday's vote. As the results were announced, Bhairavi Desai, the executive director of the New York Taxi Workers Alliance, was handed a bouquet of flowers from a driver. Her eyes began to well.
"Today is a day of celebration," she said after the vote.

HEADLINE: A Murky Value Case for a Higher Ethanol Blend

BYLINE: NORMAN MAYERSOHN


HIGHLIGHT: The fuel-economy penalty for burning E15, which began to be dispensed this week from a filling station in Kansas, may not be offset with a proportionately cheaper pump price. 

 BODY:
As our colleague Matthew L. Wald noted on Wednesday, a filling station west of Kansas City, Kan., recently began pumping E15, the fuel blend consisting of 15 percent ethanol and 85 percent gasoline. The formulation was approved for use by the Environmental Protection Agency late in 2010.
Though the government cannot compel filling stations to stock the fuel, the Energy Department frames the use of E15 as falling within its broader objective of reducing petroleum imports. (The ethanol is produced primarily from corn grown in the United States.) However, the cost and efficiency benefits for the fuel's end user are not so apparent. As Mr. Wald wrote:
Some car experts say that the savings are illusory, because a gallon of ethanol has only about two-thirds as much energy as a gallon of gasoline, so it will take a car fewer miles on a gallon.
At the filling station in Lawrence, Kan., visited by Mr. Wald, the price on Tuesday for E15, as seen in the photo above, was $3.279, 2 cents a gallon less than the standard E10 formulation. The lower per-gallon price means that drivers will pay less to fill their tanks, but it does necessarily mean they are getting a bargain.
The Web site of the Energy Department says motorists could expect their cars to travel "3 to 4 percent fewer miles per gallon on E10 than on straight gasoline." Logically, E15, with its higher concentration of ethanol, will further erode a vehicle's estimated fuel economy. Using 5 percent as a rough estimate of the fuel economy loss (compared with straight gas, which is difficult to find), the E15 fuel ought to be in the range of 15 cents a gallon cheaper in order to power that vehicle the same number of miles for each dollar spent.
The more relevant comparison, of course, is to the E10 on sale at the same station. Simply, the netted savings of 2 cents a gallon still falls short -- E15 should probably be in the range of 4 to 6 cents a gallon cheaper to yield the same miles-per-dollar result as E10. The E15 might be more attractive to drivers of cars that require premium fuel, as Mr. Wald points out, because the ethanol blend has an octane rating of 90. And it was the better choice for topping off his Chevy Aveo rental car before heading back to the airport, because he was more interested in volume per dollar than miles.
The financial penalty may seem small, but the psychic damage could be significant -- at least to drivers whose ability to boast about the 50 m.p.g. fuel economy of the family Prius is a critical determinant of self-esteem. That car would suddenly fall below the magic 50 mark and into the increasingly populated range of cars that claim mileage in the 40s.

HEADLINE: Children of Immigrants Study More

BYLINE: CATHERINE RAMPELL


HIGHLIGHT: In a typical week, children of immigrants spend about 27.7 hours in educational activities, while children of native-born Americans spend about 24.6 hours, according to the Labor Department. 

 BODY:
Whether because of Tiger Moms or otherwise, the children of immigrants really do study more than the children of native-born Americans.
That chart is based on data from the Labor Department's American Time Use Surveys from 2003 to 2010. It shows that teenagers whose parents were immigrants spent an average of 26 minutes more per day on education-related activities than their counterparts with native-born parents. 
That means that over the course of a week, children of immigrants spend about 27.7 hours in educational activities, whereas children of native-born Americans spend about 24.6 hours.
This gap in time spent on educational activities reflects both more time spent in school (181 minutes for immigrants' children versus 167 minutes for children of the native-born) and more time spent studying (50 minutes versus 38 minutes).
By contrast, children of native-born parents spend more time in paid work activities. Given theeconomic mobility benefits of education, this contrast does seem to fit the stereotype of immigrants' working long hours to help their children rise to a higher socioeconomic class in adulthood.
That doesn't mean life is all work and no play for the children of immigrants. Immigrants' children spend a few more minutes watching television and shopping than the progeny of native-born Americans do. The children of native-born Americans do spend more time playing sports, though.
By the way, since I'm guessing this question will come up: Bigger educational time commitments are true for children of both Asian immigrants and Latin American immigrants.
Children of Asian immigrants spend about 51 minutes more per day on educational activities than do children of native-born whites. That's true even when you control for family characteristics like income, parents' education and number of siblings.
Children of Latin American immigrants spend on average 18 more minutes per day in educational activities than the children of their white, non-Hispanic native-born counterparts, although that gap is not statistically significant. Once the Labor Department's researchers controlled for differences in family composition, the gap widened to a statistically significant 35 minutes per day.

HEADLINE: Latest Data Doesn't Move the Political Needle

BYLINE: DAVID LEONHARDT


HIGHLIGHT: Moody's analysis of this week's economics reports leaves its job-growth forecast unchanged between now and the election. 

 BODY:
Even with the fall in jobless claims, the economic data was close enough to expectations this week that the The Times election year's jobs tracker remains unchanged. Moody's Analytics continues to forecast a gradual improvement in job growth in coming months, suggesting a close presidential election.
In Friday's Times, Annie Lowrey has more details on why economists expect the economy to improve this year, with some specific attention to oil prices. 
Previous posts have more detail on the weekly jobs tracker. In brief:
Historically, nothing - not social issues, campaign advertisements or gaffes - has influenced voters more heavily than the direction of the economy in an election year. In only three races since World War II has the outcome been different from what the economy's direction would have suggested: 1952 (when the popular Dwight D. Eisenhower was running), 1968 (when the Vietnam War hobbled the Democrats) and 1976 (when Watergate hobbled the Republicans).

HEADLINE: HSBC Reveals Problems With Internal Controls

BYLINE: LANDON THOMAS JR. and MARK SCOTT


HIGHLIGHT: HSBC, the largest financial institution in Europe, has become the latest British bank to reveal major internal-control problems, saying that senior officials would apologize to U.S. lawmakers next week for not cracking down soon enough on money-laundering activities in America. 

 BODY:
8:58 p.m. | Updated 
LONDON - HSBC, the largest financial institution in Europe, has become the latest British bank to reveal major internal-control problems, saying that senior officials would apologize to United States lawmakers next week for not cracking down soon enough on money-laundering activities in America.
The money laundering, which a United States Senate subcommittee indicates was linked to terrorism and drug deals, could result in HSBC paying fines of up to $1 billion, according to analysts.
"Our anti-money-laundering controls should have been stronger and more effective, and we failed to spot and deal with unacceptable behavior," Stuart T. Gulliver, the chief executive of HSBC, wrote in a memo that became widely circulated after it was released to employees late Wednesday.
HSBC said Thursday that it would have no further comment before a hearing Tuesday in Washington.
The admission by HSBC, long seen as one of the more conservatively run and trustworthy of the financial giants based in London, came at an awkward time for the bank. It is under new management since the period when the money laundering occurred, from 2004 to 2010, and it has shifted corporate focus to fast-growing markets in Asia, which accounted for the bulk of its $16.8 billion in profit last year.
HSBC can distance itself from the money-laundering episode by chalking it up to the previous management. But the bank, along with more than a dozen financial institutions, also faces scrutiny by regulators on both sides of the Atlantic for any role the companies might have played in an the interest-rate manipulation scandal that has embroiled Barclays, a main HSBC competitor.
One big HSBC investor, who was not authorized to speak publicly, said that while it was a serious lapse not to have caught customer money laundering sooner, it did not necessarily indicate a deeper ethical problem within the bank.
That investor plans to closely follow developments to see what role - if any - the bank played in trying to manipulate key interest rates, including the London interbank offered rate, or Libor. If any issues arise, it could lead to more political pressure and damaging lawsuits, especially in London.
"We do not think there is a culture of money laundering at HSBC," the investor said. "Management overlooked it but will fix it. But Libor is different."
Adding another political wrinkle: HSBC's former chairman, Stephen Green, who was in office from 2006 to 2010 when many of the money-laundering detection problems occurred, is currently the trade minister in Prime Minister David Cameron's government. Mr. Green's office did not reply to a request for comment on Thursday.
Shares of HSBC fell more than 2 percent Thursday in London.
British politicians and regulators are in the middle of an inquiry into the banking practices of Barclays in the Libor scandal, for which the company has already agreed to pay fines in Britain and the United States of $450 million.
A broader investigation into the conduct and practices of all banks operating in Britain is likely to follow, and regulators in the United States are conducting their own wider sweep.
In the case of the money laundering, the United States authorities have been examining HSBC for several years. On Tuesday, officials from the bank are set to testify in Washington before the Senate Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations.
A subcommittee spokesman declined on Thursday to discuss the investigation, but the panel's Web site describes the agenda as "a hearing on the money laundering and terrorist financing vulnerabilities created when a global bank uses its U.S. affiliate to provide U.S. dollars, U.S. dollar services, and access to the U.S. financial system to high risk affiliates, high risk correspondent banks, and high risk clients, using HSBC as a case study."
Mr. Gulliver, HSBC's chief executive, is not expected to testify.
In his memo to employees, Mr. Gulliver said that since 2010, the bank has doubled its annual spending on regulatory compliance to $400 million, and now has about 3,500 people worldwide working on compliance - more than 1,000 of them in the United States. Over all, HSBC has about 295,000 employees.
Ian Gordon, a bank analyst at Investec in London, said Thursday that for HSBC, the money laundering "is an historic issue and I don't think there will be any material repercussions in terms of civil liability."
But Mr. Gordon is among those who note that HSBC's bigger issue in the near future is the Libor investigation.
At HSBC, unlike Barclays, profits come mainly from a mix of consumer and corporate businesses in Asia. Investment banking, which makes up as much as 70 percent of Barclays's profit, accounts for less than a third of HSBC's bottom line.
Mr. Gulliver is a recent appointee to the top spot at the bank, taking over in early 2011, and he has been vocal in shifting focus toward Asia - where he spends a large amount of his time - and away from slower growth developed markets.
Although he has an investment banking background, Mr. Gulliver is a low-key British national who has spent much of his career out of the public eye in Asia. Consequently, he is a less controversial public figure than Robert E. Diamond Jr., the recently ousted Barclays chief, whom the former British business minister, Peter Mandelson, once referred to as the "unacceptable face" of London banking.
In a recent report, analysts at Morgan Stanley estimated that the possible litigation exposure for the industry at large from the Libor fallout could be as much as $6 billion. That figure, while involving significant guesswork, was calculated on the basis of the potential profits a bank could have made by benefiting from a lower interest rate.
According to Morgan Stanley's calculations, HSBC's potential penalty if found culpable in the Libor investigation would be $348 million, which translates into a 1 percent earnings per share hit for 2013. The bank that would suffer the most was Royal Bank of Scotland, the Morgan Stanley analysts said, with possible legal exposure of $1 billion.
An earlier version of this article referred incorrectly to the Congressional panel that will hold a hearing on money laundering next week. It is the Senate Permanent Subcommittee (not Committee) on Investigations.

HEADLINE: Rights Groups Assail U.S. Decision on Myanmar

BYLINE: MARK MCDONALD


HIGHLIGHT: Human rights groups are tearing into the Obama administration for its decision --- overriding the wishes of Aung San Suu Kyi --- to allow virtually any new American investment in Myanmar. 

 BODY:
HONG KONG - Human rights groups are tearing into the Obama administration for its decision to allow virtually any new American investment in Myanmar. 
The prized oil-and-gas sector in Myanmar is now wholly open to American firms, even though the opposition leader Daw Aung San Suu Kyi had asked foreign companies and governments to hold off doing business with the state-owned Myanmar Oil and Gas Enterprise. 
M.O.G.E. has long had deep ties to the military, and for years it essentially bankrolled a succession of authoritarian juntas. The U.S. Congressional Research Service has estimated that one energy project alone, the Yadana natural gas pipeline, has provided at least $500 million in annual revenue for the government.

- Freedom House (@FreedomHouseDC) July 11, 2012
In a speech in Geneva last month, Ms. Aung San Suu Kyi said M.O.G.E. was still operating without transparency or accountability. Any new investments should wait, she said, until the agency meets labor standards issued by the International Monetary Fund. 
"By allowing deals with Burma's state-owned oil company, the U.S. looks like it caved to industry pressure and undercut Aung San Suu Kyi and others in Burma who are promoting government accountability," said Arvind Ganesan, business and human rights director at Human Rights Watch. 
The group said petroleum lobbyists had "pressed the Obama administration for a wholesale removal of the investment ban without any limits on partnering with M.O.G.E., citing potentially lucrative investment opportunities when Burma opens up additional oil and gas blocks for exploration later this year."

It was four years ago this month that a sweeping set of punitive sanctions against Myanmar was enacted by Congress, codified in the Tom Lantos JADE Act. The only American company exempted from the sanctions was Chevron, which holds a 28 percent stake in the Yadana pipeline project. The French firm Total operates the project. 
"This legislation will turn off a huge cash spigot for the thuggish Burmese regime," Mr. Lantos said as his sanctions bill was making its way through Congress. 
But the Democratic congressman from California didn't see his objection to the Chevron exemption upheld: He died of cancer in February 2008, and the law was enacted that July. The final wording merely says that "Congress urges Yadana investors to consider voluntary divestment over time" in Burma. That divestment did not happen.
Chevron's profile of its outreach efforts in Myanmar is here, on the company Web site. 
The U.S. Campaign for Burma said Wednesday that "investment in many of the most attractive sectors of the Burmese economy is likely to worsen the human rights situation while directly benefiting individuals and entities responsible for rights abuses, who contribute to corruption, or are otherwise acting to obstruct political reform." 
The campaign added: "The Obama administration's decision-making process has lurched forward without careful thought, strategy or transparency."
Mr. Obama's executive order was issued Wednesday. 
The administration, led by the personalized diplomacy of Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton, seemed to have struck a deal with Ms. Aung San Suu Kyi earlier this year on the "targeted easing" of an array of U.S. sanctions against the former Burma. Under a new government led by President Thein Sein, Myanmar has been undertaking a dramatic series of reforms, reforms that have consequently brought down longstanding trade and investment barriers erected by Japan and a number of Western countries. 
Sen. Jim Webb, Democrat of Virginia, and Sen. James M. Imhofe, Republican of Oklahoma, wrote to Mrs. Clinton in May to say that her plan for targeted sanctions would be "a strategic mistake." They wanted an open field for American businesses, not a sector-by-sector approach.
"The U.S. should not be picking winners and losers in our engagement abroad," the senators said. 
Encouraging further liberalizations by a government still riddled with former generals and their cronies is a dicey process and an inexact science. The initial reforms came so quickly and abruptly that many Western governments (and many Burmese activists) were simply caught off guard. Previous regimes, after all, had kept Ms. Aung San Suu Kyi locked up for much of the past two decades. 
And human rights abuses still proliferate.
"Foreign investment is essential to rectify these harsh conditions," said Rhonda Mays and Robert Herman of Freedom House. "But suddenly funneling money into the country's opaque, scandalously corrupt business environment is no way to help Burma progress economically or politically. This is all the more true when the main investment goal is the exploitation of natural resources.
"It is no coincidence that around the world, growth strategies based on extractive industries tend to reinforce the concentration of wealth and power and do little to advance general economic well-being - unless the country in question has a strong system of checks and balances and the rule of law. Despite the recent steps toward reform, Burma still has neither."
The new U.S. still blocks direct dealings with the military or with people and companies already banned. The Treasury Department's entire list of sanctions is here; the Directorate of Defense Industries and the Innwa Bank were added to it on Wednesday.

HIGHLIGHT: Political news from today's Times, plus a look at what's happening in Washington. 

 BODY:
In Today's Times:
Republicans are pushing Mitt Romney to toughen up against President Obama as conservatives worry that their candidate is being defined and outmaneuvered by the president in the fight for the White House, Jeff Zeleny and Ashley Parker write. In response, Mr. Romney's campaign plans to release ads today rebutting Democrats' attacks and reframing his record as a businessman and governor.
Mr. Romney faced a tough crowd on Wednesday when he spoke at the annual convention of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People, Ashley Parker and Michael D. Shear report. In his most direct appeal thus far to black voters, he told the group that he would be a better president for African-Americans than Mr. Obama, but delivered policy prescriptions like repealing the Democrats' health care overhaul that run counter to what the group has advocated. Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. is scheduled to address the group today.
The House voted again on Wednesday to repeal the health care overhaul, suggesting that despite a recent Supreme Court ruling, the fight over reshaping how the nation delivers health care will continue well beyond the November elections, Robert Pear reports.
Representative Jesse L. Jackson Jr.'s mysterious monthlong absence from Congress is the latest blow to a political career once thought of as "soaring," Monica Davey writes in her profile of the young Democrat who had been considered a serious contender for mayor of Chicago and President Obama's former Senate seat.
Economists are worried that Congress's failure to act on tax increases and spending cuts set to take effect at the end of the year are discouraging businesses from hiring and investing, further depressing the economic recovery, Rebecca Berg writes. The government's inaction as the country races toward what economists call the fiscal cliff has contributed to volatility in economic markets already burdened by instability in Europe, spiking oil prices, and a hung-over housing market.
Members of the Federal Reserve were divided at a June meeting over whether and how the central bank should assert itself into efforts to stimulate the economy, suggesting that further stimulus is unlikely. Binyaman Appelbaum writes that despite projections that unemployment would remain high for several more years, Fed officials "now viewed the risk of standing still, so clear in a crisis, as smaller and harder to measure, while the uncertain consequences of action are weighing heavily on their willingness to expand the central bank's aid campaign."
Happening in Washington:
Economic data expected this morning include weekly jobless claims andimport and export price indexes for June at 8:30 a.m, followed by weekly mortgage rates at 10, and the federal budget for May at 2 p.m.

HEADLINE: Fund-Raiser at Cheney Home Signals Resolve to Elect Romney

BYLINE: ASHLEY PARKER


HIGHLIGHT: When Mitt Romney shows up in Jackson Hole, Wyo., on Thursday for a reception at a country club and a more intimate dinner at the home of former Vice President Dick Cheney, the fund-raiser will represent something more than his usual tap dance for dollars. 

 BODY:
JACKSON HOLE, Wyo. - Some view the fund-raiser as a symbolic laying on of the hands, a passing of the torch from the last Republican administration to the hope of the next one. Others view the high-dollar event in more practical terms, as a sign of how urgently Republicans believe President Obama needs to be defeated. 
But one thing is clear: When Mitt Romney shows up in Jackson Hole, Wyo., on Thursday for a reception at the Teton Pines country club, followed by a more intimate dinner at the home of former Vice President Dick Cheney, the fund-raiser will represent something more than his usual tap dance for dollars.
"This is a reflection of the respect they have for Governor Romney, obviously, and a reflection of the support they have for him, and also their concern for making sure we don't re-elect President Obama," said Elizabeth Cheney, Mr. Cheney's daughter, who will also be in town for the event. "This goes to not just kind of sitting back and saying I'm going to endorse Governor Romney, but saying we're going to do whatever we can to help with this cause."
Though friends and donors of both Bush administrations are expected to attend, the guest list does not include many members of former President George W. Bush's inner circle. (Read: No Karl Rove, the architect of Mr. Bush's campaign and White House; no Condoleezza Rice, the former secretary of state).
More than 200 guests are to attend the dinner, and are expected to include Harold Hamm, the billionaire oil executive; Lowry Mays, the founder of Clear Channel Communications; and L.E. Simmons, president of a private equity firm with a focus on oil. 
Though both Mr. Cheney and Mr. Bush remain popular with the Republican base, both are polarizing figures among the broader electorate. Many Americans still blame the economic downturn on Mr. Bush's administration, and Mr. Bush is considered such a liability on the campaign trial that Mr. Romney rarely, if ever, mentions him. 
"It should come as no surprise that Vice President Cheney is hosting a fund-raiser for Mitt Romney," said Melanie Roussell, a spokeswoman for the Democratic National Committee, in an e-mail statement. "Not only has Romney suggested we return to the unilateral approach to foreign policy that got us bogged down in Iraq, but he also plans to carbon copy the failed economic policies of the past - the same policies that benefited a few, while leaving the middle class out to dry." 
In private, however, relations between Mr. Romney and the Bushes - both father and son - are warmer. Many of Mr. Romney's foreign policy advisers hail from both Bush administrations, and Ms. Rice headlined a fund-raiser for Mr. Romney in June. One of Mr. Romney's senior advisers, Ron Kaufman, was something of top counselor to Bush 41.
Former President George H.W. Bush and his wife, Barbara, both endorsed Mr. Romney earlier in the campaign, and former President George W. Bush did so as well, in an awkward run-in with ABC News.
"I'm for Mitt Romney," the younger Mr. Bush said, in May, before slipping into an elevator. 
Ms. Cheney said her father first got to know Mr. Romney well during the 2002 Olympics, when Mr. Romney moved to Salt Lake City to help revive the flailing games. 
"My dad just has a tremendous amount of respect for him," she said. "Having served four of the last five Republican presidents, he has a unique insight into what it takes to sit in the Oval Office, and he feels Governor Romney has what it takes, and is the right man to lead the nation."
Though Mr. Romney rarely mentions Mr. Cheney on the campaign trail, he did bring him up at a town hall in September, recalling having watched the former vice president field a variety of questions during an interview on C-Span he had seen.
"And I listened to him speak and said whether you agree or disagree with him, this is a man of wisdom and judgment, and he could have been president of the United States," Mr. Romney said. "That's the kind of person I'd like to have - a person of wisdom and judgment."
The two men will probably have some time on Thursday for a private meeting.
Thursday evening's event is the first time Mr. Cheney and his wife, Lynne, are opening their Wyoming home for a fund-raiser. The dinner is being co-hosted by Dick and Maggie Scarlett, who served as Wyoming finance chairs of the 2008 presidential campaign of Senator John McCain of Arizona.
Though the Romney campaign would not disclose how much money it hopes to raise, several people close to the event said they expected it to be the largest campaign fund-raiser in the history of the state.
And, of course, the dinner will reflect the mood of Wyoming, as well. Wildflowers will adorn all of the tables.

HEADLINE: Ad Watch: Romney Ad Hits Obama on Truth Issue

BYLINE: TRIP GABRIEL


HIGHLIGHT: Mitt Romney's campaign released a blistering television advertisement on Thursday accusing President Obama of dishonesty in recent attacks on Mr. Romney. 

 BODY:
5:47 p.m. | Updated Mitt Romney's campaign released a blistering television advertisement on Thursday accusing President Obama of dishonesty in recent attacks on Mr. Romney. It also features a somewhat off-topic cameo by Hillary Clinton scolding Mr. Obama during the 2008 Democratic primary. The ad is the latest in the depths of nastiness that the presidential contest has already reached this year.
The ad, titled "No Evidence," is the latest in an increasingly personal dispute between the campaigns over Mr. Romney's record at Bain Capital, the private equity firm he founded. While campaigning, the president has attacked Mr. Romney as an "outsourcing pioneer'' because of investments he made at Bain, and an Obama for America ad last month asked if Americans wanted an "outsourcer-in-chief. 
Click on a subsection below to jump to a fact check. 
YouTube
0:06 Obama Outsourcing Attacks
The ad quotes, correctly, a fact-checking column in The Washington Post that was highly skeptical of an Obama for America ad last month that asked if Americans wanted an "outsourcer-in-chief." But the column appeared before a news article in The Post on June 21 that took a deeper look at Bain and identified companies the firm invested in that helped other companies move call centers and manufacturing overseas.
0:11 FactCheck.Org Findings
The ad cites a second fact-checking column, by FactCheck.org, which found "no evidence" Mr. Romney sent American jobs overseas while he was running Bain. That conclusion was based in part on the fact that Mr. Romney departed from Bain in 1999 to run the Salt Lake City Olympics, before two companies Bain invested in moved work from the United States to Mexico, in 2000 and 2001. On Thursday that timeline was thrown into question by a report in The Boston Globe that securities filings named Mr. Romney as the owner, president and chief executive of Bain during the period. It is unclear whether he made hands-on decisions during that time. 
0:18 Obama and Clinton in 2008
This is the Romney campaign's second use of clips of an angry Hillary Clinton from the 2008 Democratic primary. Mrs. Clinton was criticizing then-candidate Obama for circulating fliers in Ohio that she said falsely characterized her position on trade agreements. 
Scorecard
The two campaigns are entrenched in hand-to-hand combat over details and the significance of Mr. Romney's years at Bain, which is the source of his personal wealth and his top credential as a leader capable of improving the economy. The Obama campaign has barraged Mr. Romney on his Bain record, to the point of distorting some facts. But it is unlikely to call off the assault, which some polls show has persuaded a slice of voters to doubt Mr. Romney in swing states.

HEADLINE: Explaining Why Wall Street and the Wealthy Hate Obama

BYLINE: CHRYSTIA FREELAND


HIGHLIGHT: The rich in America - many of whom backed Barack Obama in 2008 - have turned against the president this year, despite the fact that banks received the biggest government bailout of all. 

 BODY:
NEW YORK - This week, I write about why the rich in America - many of whom backed Barack Obama in 2008 - have turned against the president this year. On the face of it, that's surprising - after all, the recovery for the 1 percent has been much more robust than it has been for everyone else, partly thanks to government intervention.
My conclusion - spoiler alert! - is that there's one really big reason for the hostility between the wealthy and the White House: Mr. Obama is breaking with the narrative about American capitalism that has prevailed in this country at least since Ronald Reagan. That is the idea that when the rich get richer, everyone else benefits, too. Instead, the president is suggesting that American capitalism isn't delivering on its promise to the middle class - and that the rich should help fix that by paying taxes at a higher rate.
For me, one window into how alien this way of thinking is for many Americans came in a recent note by Brent G. Schutte, a market strategist at Harris Private Bank. Mr. Schutte compares inequality within the U.S. income distribution to inequality among players in Major League Baseball. (The gaps between top and bottom are comparable, which highlights an interesting but rarely remarked-upon fact about the winner-take-all economy: The disparity within the 1 percent, which all M.L.B. players occupy, is as great as the polarization between the 1 percent and everyone else.)
Mr. Schutte's commentary is charming and original. The conclusion, though, is a straightforward lament for the days when most of us assumed the rise of multimillionaires enriched us all. 
"I hope to hear less of the debate about whether or not Albert Pujols was worth the money," Mr. Schutte writes, referring to the Los Angeles Angels player, "and instead more discussion on how we can create more Pujols in the future." 
It is a heart-warming sentiment, in keeping with the heart-warming theme of unification during Mr. Obama's first campaign. But it doesn't match the reality of U.S. capitalism today, at least as the president sees it.

HEADLINE: Why Obama May Be Stronger Than His Approval Ratings

BYLINE: NATE SILVER


HIGHLIGHT: About 4 percent of the electorate has a favorable view of Mr. Obama, but does not approve of his job performance. The way those voters behave in November could be decisive. 

 BODY:
There is a small but reasonably persistent gap between President Obama's net approval ratings and his head-to-head polls against Mitt Romney. Whereas Mr. Obama's approval ratings have been almost exactly breaking even for most of the past few months - in fact, they're very slightly underwater now according to the Real Clear Politics average - he has more often than not enjoyed a slight lead in head-to-head polls against Mr. Romney.
Liberals and conservatives tend to interpret this evidence in different ways. For liberals, it may be taken as a sign that Mr. Romney is an especially weak candidate - enough so that many voters who are on the fence about Mr. Obama's job performance, and even a few who disapprove of it, will be willing to vote for Mr. Obama if Mr. Romney is the alternative. The claim has often been made in recent weeks, for instance (in my view, based on relatively speculative evidence), that Mr. Obama's attacks on Mr. Romney's tenure at Bain Capital may have damaged Mr. Romney.
Conservatives instead sometimes argue that this is a sign that Mr. Obama has some softness in his numbers. As voters become more engaged with the campaign, Mr. Romney may have a bit of wind at his back if he is able to keep the focus on Mr. Obama's job performance; the head-to-head polls could fall more in line with Mr. Obama's approval ratings. 
Neither of these views is irrational. In support of the liberal position, my research suggests that there can be some predictable-seeming differences between a president's net approval rating and the result he actually realizes on Election Day, based in part on "candidate quality" factors related to his opponent. For instance, opponents who have especially "extreme" ideologies (who are perceived as being very liberal or very conservative) may allow a president to over-perform his approval ratings, while challengers who are viewed as moderates may get the benefit of the doubt from voters. Elections are perhaps a referendum on the incumbent, but they are not purely so.
On the other hand, in support of the conservative position, my research suggests that approval ratings may have some predictive power even once you are also accounting for head-to-head polls, especially early in the campaign.
Both of these views, however, leave aside an intriguing piece of evidence. That evidence is Mr. Obama's favorability ratings. They are net-positive right now, as they have been throughout most of his presidency. 
Right now, the Real Clear Politics average shows 50.6 percent of Americans with a favorable view of Mr. Obama, versus 45.1 percent with an unfavorable one. That contrasts with his approval ratings, which now show 46.8 percent as approving his job performance and 48.7 percent as disapproving it.
In other words, there is a small slice of the electorate, about 4 percent, that has a favorable view of Mr. Obama, but does not approve of his job performance. Given how close the election is, the way they behave in November could be decisive. If the election is a referendum on Mr. Obama based on his approval ratings, it's going to be very close. He may be a slight underdog, especially since some of the approval ratings polls are of adults or registered voters, which are generally a point or two more favorable to the Democratic candidate than those of likely voters. However, if it's a referendum based on Mr. Obama's favorability ratings, his net-positive score (plus 5.5) makes him look like the favorite.
Is there evidence on whether approval ratings or favorability ratings are a better indicator of a president's re-election chances? Actually, there's not very much of it. Favorability ratings have received much less academic study than approval ratings. There are a couple of reasons for this. First, the two sets of ratings are normally extremely close to each other. Unless you need extreme precision for something, your choice just won't matter that much. And second, the historical record of approval ratings is a little richer. Pollsters take them somewhat more often than favorability ratings, using somewhat more consistent question wording, and these ratings are archived more completely than the favorability ratings are. So approval ratings tend to be used as a default in studies of the presidency.
What I'll offer here is only some cursory evidence: a comparison of approval ratings and favorability ratings for the past five incumbent presidents who were running for re-election, as taken from the CBS News poll database (most CBS News polls were conducted in conjunction with The New York Times). Five data points isn't very many, but using both approval ratings and favorability ratings from the same polling organization at least allows for the comparisons to be a bit more apples-to-apples.
In the table below, I've listed the average net approval ratings and net favorability ratings for each of these presidents, in CBS News polls conducted from Sept. 1 of the election year through Election Day. These are listed alongside the results of the election.
Three of these presidents - Ronald Reagan, George H. W. Bush and George W. Bush - had nearly identical approval ratings and favorability ratings. But they diverged by a material amount in two other cases.
In 1996, Bill Clinton's approval ratings (roughly plus 25) were quite a bit stronger than his favorability ratings (roughly plus 14). He won a perfectly solid victory over Bob Dole, but the 8.5-point margin was somewhat more consistent with his pretty good favorability ratings than his very good approval ratings. 
Consider that Mr. Clinton in 1996 had roughly identical approval ratings to Ronald Reagan in 1984 - but Mr. Reagan's margin over Walter Mondale was much larger than Mr. Clinton's over Mr. Dole, perhaps because Mr. Reagan's favorability ratings matched his lofty approval ratings while Mr. Clinton's did not.
In 1980, Jimmy Carter had bad approval ratings (negative 14 net), but somewhat more forgivable favorability ratings (negative 6). His 10-point loss to Mr. Reagan roughly split the difference between them.
There are a few other wrinkles to consider that complicate the analysis. For instance, presidents with very strong or very weak approval ratings tend to have election results that are a little closer to the mean. A president with a plus-40 approval rating isn't likely to win the election by as many as 40 points. When his ratings are that strong, many of the voters approving him will be of the opposite party, and some of those opposite-party voters will wind up for their party's own nominee out of partisan loyalty.
Ordinarily, the more robust way to analyze this data would be with regression analysis. In this case - with two highly correlated measures tested upon just five data points - regression analysis is not a very powerful tool. Still, I ran those numbers for fun and got an interesting result:
Note that the regression coefficient on the approval ratings and favorability ratings is almost exactly the same. What that means is that the best policy in these past elections would simply have been to weight them equally.
If you take an average of Mr. Obama's approval ratings and his favorability ratings right now, based on the Real Clear Politics numbers, you will get a positive rating (approve or favorable) from 48.7 percent of voters, and a negative one (disapprove or unfavorable) from 46.9 percent.
The net rating - plus 1.8 percent - almost exactly matches his current standing against Mr. Romney. The Real Clear Politics average of head-to-head polls has Mr. Obama with a 2-point lead on Mr. Romney, while our "now-cast" (which is based only on the polls and does not look at economic factors) has Mr. Obama projected to a 2.1-point lead.
Let me emphasize, again, that although this analysis produces a neat-looking result, it's based on some relatively thin evidence - really just two presidential elections (1980 and 1996) where the two sets of ratings diverged to any appreciable degree. Check back in 2040 or so, and we might be able to answer more definitively which set of ratings has more predictive power, or whether the method of averaging them together is the most sensible choice.
Still, it seems as though the small set of voters who take a favorable view of Mr. Obama but do not approve of his job performance are very much worth fighting over for the campaigns. The split between the two sets of ratings may reflect a sensible enough reaction from voters, who have ample reason to be dissatisfied with the direction of the country, but may be more sympathetic to Mr. Obama as some of the problems began before his tenure.
If you're part of Mr. Obama's campaign, there could be risk in taking a negative tack that might reduce that sympathy factor. At the same time, these results suggest that Mr. Obama doesn't necessarily need to damage Mr. Romney to win. If voters are judging Mr. Obama based on a mix of his personal qualities their perception of his job performance, his numbers might be just strong enough to win as it is, without their factoring much about Mr. Romney into their decision.
Mr. Romney's campaign in Boston faces an equally interesting set of choices.
Do you explicitly try to appeal to the set of voters who like Mr. Obama personally but take a neutral or negative view of his job performance? There have been times when Mr. Romney's campaign seemed to adopt this strategy. At times on the campaign trail, Mr. Romney has told voters that he thinks of Mr. Obama as a good man, but that he's just not up to the job of being president.
Or do you try to bring down Mr. Obama's favorability ratings by a couple of points? This is more in line with the advertisement that Mr. Romney's campaign released on Thursday, which accuses Mr. Obama of dishonesty in how he portrayed Mr. Romney's tenure at Bain Capital.
That strategy seems a bit higher risk - especially as Mr. Romney's favorability ratings are rather tepid, meaning that he does not necessarily want to give voters an excuse to think of the election as a popularity contest.
However, Mr. Obama may be slightly stronger than his approval ratings imply, if not as strong as his favorability ratings suggest. In that case, a higher-risk strategy might be called for, particularly if the small lead Mr. Obama has in head-to-head polls seems to persist for another several weeks.

HEADLINE: De-hazing the Lazy Days of Summer

BYLINE: FELICITY BARRINGER


HIGHLIGHT: The E.P.A.'s decision to demand more aggressive action to clean up haze in national parks has prompted a backlash from some states and from industry. 

 BODY:
It's high season in the nation's national parks as millions of visitors come to see nature. If last year's visitor figures hold up -- and early indications suggest they will -- nine million visitors will see the Great Smoky Mountains, the most visited national park. Three other parks -- Grand Canyon (more than four million visitors in 2011) Yellowstone (about three million) and Acadia (more than two million) -- combined will attract roughly the same number. 
Yet many visitors are likely to find their view of the natural landscapes softened, if not significantly obscured, by haze or smog from civilization.
An amendment to the Clean Air Act passed 35 years ago was designed to ensure that when visitors get to their destinations, they will be able to see the parks' vistas.
 For the better part of those years, there has been a tug of war between the owners of manufacturing concerns -- particularly coal-fired power-plants -- and the Environmental Protection Agency over how far the agency can go in requiring plants to cut down on three pollutants linked to haze: fine particles, which blur the air on their own, and sulfur dioxide and oxides of nitrogen, which break down into other smog-producing chemicals with the sun's help. 
The 1977 law, and a rulethat followed it in 1999, are intended to protect visibility in 156 national parks and wilderness areas. The most recent survey of air quality in the parks showed that visibility was stable or improving in the vast majority of them. But it noted that if a place with bad visibility remains stable, that is not particularly good news.
Now, working to avoid legal sanctions for excessive delays, the E.P.A. says it has approved 11 state cleanup plans and provisionally approved another 11 with small modifications that do not impose new requirements. It has also proposed to approve eight more state plans. 
 In Colorado, the local power company, Xcel Energy and environmental groups like the Environmental Defense Fundworked together to produce a plan that met with the E.P.A.'s approval. When that was announced, the state's congressional delegation gave an unusual bipartisan backslap to all. 
But the agency's proposals to toughen some of the requirements on power plants in the remaining 20 states have created a buzzsaw of opposition in places like Oklahoma, North Dakota and, most recently, Arizona.

Those states are fighting back, arguing that the Obama administration should not be imposing major cleanup costs on electric generating companies when the overall economy is struggling and that the requirements could cause plant closings and eliminate jobs.
Arizona's plan was partly rejected on July 3. The E.P.A. called for the installation of new high-end equipment to control the release of oxides of nitrogen from three large power plants: Cholla, Coronado and Apache.
The agency said its proposal was intended to reduce nitrogen oxide emissions by 7,800 tons a year at Cholla, 4,700 tons a year at the Apache Generating Station and 4,500 tons a year at the Coronado Generating Station. "This proposal will make scenic vistas clearer while cleaning the air that Arizonans breathe," the E.P.A.'s regional administrator for the Pacific Southwest, Jared Blumenfeld, said in a statement.
 In an e-mail, an agency spokeswoman, Enesta Jones, said the three plants "affect visibility at 18 national parks and wilderness areas, including the Grand Canyon, Mesa Verde and thePetrified Forest."
Some of the plants are more than 100 miles from the parks involved, but with the right meteorological conditions in in the flat, dry landscape, a stream of smoke from the Cholla plant can be seen for many miles along Interstate 40.
But Henry Darwin, director of that state'sdepartment of environmental quality, said the E.P.A.'s requirements for the installation of six new pollution-control devices using selective catalytic reduction at the three plants were unnecessary.
He said the resulting difference in haze at the Grand Canyon would not be discernible and that the agency's methods for drafting the requirements failed to include state officials in the process, allowing them only to comment after the fact. 
In an interview, he argued that the addition of the devices, which cost tens of millions of dollars apiece, would cause the cost of electricity will go up as well as the cost of water, which is moved throughout the state's elaborate plumbing system with electrical power. "I think they had a predetermined policy" of requiring the advanced technology, no matter the cost, Mr. Darwin asserted.
The Navajo Generating Station on the Navajo Nation's reservation was not addressed in the recent E.P.A. ruling. Yet many expect that the agency will impose similar requirements on that plant, jeopardizing its continued operation and risking the jobs of Native Americans working there. 
The columnist George F. Will entered the fray last week, echoing arguments made by some Congressional Republicans in hearings that jobs are being sacrificed for imperceptible improvements in visibility. 
Opening a hearing last month, Representative James Lankford of Oklahoma, the chairman of a subcommittee of the House Government Oversight and Accountability Committee,said: "E.P.A. is attempting to federalize the program and imposing costs well beyond what the state had determined was necessary or justified. Ultimately, E.P.A.'s proposal will costs billions of dollars for visibility improvements that are undetectable to the human eye." 
E. Scott Pruitt, Oklahoma's attorney general, charged in subsequent testimony that "with the backing of the Obama administration, the E.P.A. is engaging in super-legislative activity that Congress has not authorized, resulting in unchecked rule-making." 
Shortly thereafter, Mr. Pruitt was challenged by Robert V. Percival, who directs the environmental law program at the University of Maryland's law school. "There has not been any change in E.P.A. that has in any way cut out the public from the process," he said.

HEADLINE: Money, Power, Politics and Corruption: U.S. vs. China

BYLINE: DIDI KIRSTEN TATLOW


HIGHLIGHT: We expect our leaders to be honest. But do we also expect them to be poor? In politics, when does influence peddling slip over into outright corruption? Where's the gray zone? Where, in fact, are the limits - in China, in the United States, or elsewhere? 

 BODY:
BEIJING - We expect our leaders to be honest. But do we also expect them to be poor? When does influence peddling slip over into outright corruption? Where's the gray zone? Where, in fact, are the limits - in China, in the United States, or elsewhere?
A penetrating article in Vanity Fair this month raised questions about the finances of presidential candidate Mitt Romney. 
Meanwhile, a recent story by Bloomberg Business News, "Xi Jinping Millionaire Relations Reveal Fortunes of Elite," caused a furor in China-watching circles and angered the Chinese government with its well-sourced account of the substantial wealth amassed by Mr. Xi's close relatives, including his siblings. It raised important questions about the nexus of political power and wealth.
In the story, Bloomberg emphasized there was no evidence of personal wrongdoing by Mr. Xi, who is widely expected to become China's next leader. Read my piece about him and expectations for his rule.
Yet it is taboo to talk about the personal or financial affairs of top leaders (Mr. Xi is currently vice president), so the report had the flavor of lèse-majesté. Bloomberg's Web site in China was quickly blocked by censors, and its social media accounts canceled.
Analysts have said the report is "embarrassing" - but is it damaging? Will it harm Mr. Xi's rise?
Consensus is, even if Mr. Xi's enemies - and while he is a broadly popular choice, he certainly has some - want to use the report to hinder his rise to the presidency, it would be futile because there isn't time to come up with another candidate before the 18th Communist Party Congress later this year.
"They can't find anyone to replace him at such short notice," said a former government employee now living overseas who researches corruption in China, requesting anonymity due to the sensitivity of the matter.
It has become extremely difficult to pick a leader in China, where there is no longer a strongman like Mao Zedong or Deng Xiaoping to decree who will be next, and where there is no democratic system to confer legitimacy, Chinese analysts agree. The process is tortuous and based on balancing many different interests and factions, both official and unofficial - up to thousands of people.
Another candidate would have to be accepted by Jiang Zemin, the former president; Hu Jintao, the current president; and Zeng Qinghong, a power broker on the Standing Committee of the Politburo. "And that's not easy," said the researcher.
"This won't be damaging as long as Xi can succeed to the top position and simultaneously remind his family members, 'Don't make trouble for me.' "
The fact that Bloomberg did not find any evidence of wrongdoing by Mr. Xi is telling, the researcher said, noting that people of Mr. Xi's stature "don't need to be corrupt." 
"The family members however are playing in a gray zone between what is legal and what is illegal," he said. "They are doing business and they are doing it through their connections.
"When the country belongs to you, you don't need to be corrupt," he said. "Xi himself is not operating in a gray zone."

HEADLINE: Dentsu of Japan to Buy Aegis of Britain for About $5 Billion

BYLINE: ERIC PFANNER


HIGHLIGHT: The Japanese advertising powerhouse Dentsu, which has struggled to expand internationally, made a big leap into Western markets on Thursday with its deal for Aegis, which is based in London. 

 BODY:
9:05 a.m. | Updated 
Dentsu, a Japanese advertising powerhouse that has struggled to expand internationally, made a big leap into Western markets on Thursday, saying it had agreed to buy Aegis, an agency company based in London.
The planned acquisition, valued at £3.167 billion ($4.92 billion), is one of the largest ever in the advertising business, rivaling the purchase of Young & Rubicam by the WPP 12 years ago and a deal for the parent company of Leo Burnett by Publicis Groupe in 2002.
The deal would combine Dentsu, the fifth-largest advertising company in the world, with the seventh largest. Aegis specializes in media buying, a steady source of earnings, and fast-growing digital marketing, leaving slower-growing businesses like the creation of television advertising to other agencies. 
 Aegis owns the media buying agency Carat, which counts General Motors among its clients, as well as a digital ad specialist, Isobar, and other agencies. It is strongest in Europe and has a significant presence in North America. 
Dentsu, while dominant in Japan, has tended to rely on partnerships abroad, rather than operating through its own agencies. 
"This is really about building Dentsu outside Japan," said Ian Whittaker, an analyst at Liberum Capital. "Buying Aegis gives them a good platform. It gives them a high-quality asset that, operationally, has been doing very well."
International expansion is critical, because the Japanese ad market has been shrinking in recent years. Dentsu this year acquired a boutique agency in New York, ML Rogers, and Bos, with offices in Toronto and Montreal. The deal for Aegis accelerates that the international push, which has been led by a former professional basketball player, Tim Andree.
"By forming the first communications group with true global reach, the growth strategies of both businesses will be enhanced as we provide more scale, geography, capability and investment to support clients," Jerry Buhlmann, chief executive of Aegis, said in a statement.
Merger and acquisition activity has been accelerating in the advertising business, which has weathered the global financial and economic crisis better than some other media industries. Last month, WPP, the world's biggest advertising company, agreed to buy control of AKQA, a digital agency, in a deal valuing it at $540 million. This month, Publicis agreed to buy the 51 percent of BBH that it did not already own.
There had been speculation that Dentsu would make a move since it ended a nine-year alliance with Publicis, the third-largest agency company after WPP and the Omnicom Group, in February. To unwind that partnership, Publicis bought back a 9 percent stake in Dentsu, giving the Japanese agency additional financial resources for acquisitions.
Still, the deal with Aegis was something of a surprise. The French investor Vincent Bolloré owns a 26.4 percent stake in the company, and is also the biggest shareholder in another advertising company, Havas. Many analysts had assumed that at some point Mr. Bolloré might try to link Havas and Aegis more directly.
Instead, Mr. Bolloré agreed to sell most of his stake to Dentsu at the offer price of 240 pence a share, 48 percent above the closing price of the stock on Wednesday. Mr. Bolloré bought his Aegis stake at an average price of 123 pence a share, meaning he nearly doubled his investment.
"He's reinforced his reputation as someone who knows how to make money," Mr. Whittaker said.
But the deal raises questions over Mr. Bolloré's other advertising investment. He has been shuffling his media portfolio of late, investing in Vivendi, the French conglomerate that owns Universal Music Group and a variety of other assets. 
"For Havas, given it is 30 percent owned by Bolloré and this deal leaves it as the remaining smaller global agency network, this may be viewed as the next potential target in the global agency space," analysts at Citigroup wrote in a note to clients.
While Aegis has been considered an attractive takeover target, analysts said a flurry of recent acquisitions by companies like WPP and Publicis made it less likely that counterbids to Dentsu's offer might emerge.
"Most other would-be acquirers have been active on other deal flow in recent weeks, so may not have the balance sheet capability to get involved," Alex DeGroote, an analyst at Panmure, wrote in a note to investors.

HEADLINE: Tribes of the Swing States

BYLINE: TIMOTHY EGAN


HIGHLIGHT: To win, Obama must do what Romney seems unable to do: connect with average Americans. 

 BODY:
What's little known, and certainly unmentioned on the campaign trail, is what Barack Obama and Mitt Romney have in common. Both have family histories with polygamy. Both had fathers born in foreign countries. Both went to Harvard. Both are wealthy.
Taken together, it's a narrow niche; there aren't enough rich Harvard grads with multiple-wife family albums and a bit of foreign otherness to fill the car elevators in Romney's beach manse.
Which leaves both candidates working the margins of different demographic fields. Mormons and African-Americans are taken. Same with passionate liberals and fist-pumping conservatives. The rural vote is pretty much all Romney's, and urban hearts belong to Obama. 
Romney can count on the often inchoate grudge block, people who vote against somebody, rather than for - a large part of the Republican base this year. Obama has certainly angered Wall Street, Southern whites and no small number of conservative Roman Catholics.
But Romney has a longer list of people who may be disinclined to vote for him. Latinos. Gays. Gay soldiers. People who were bullied as kids. Dog lovers. People who like sex. People who use contraception during sex. People who want "free stuff," as Romney classified those without health care on Wednesday. People who believe in science.
In sum, Romney needs voters who aren't just "a bunch of old, white guys," as the Republican strategist Ed Rollins said a few days ago, "fat like me."
Obama was casting for another tribe during his recent swing through the swing states. In the small town of Parma, Ohio, looking into a crowd of mostly white, middle-aged folks, he mentioned that he'd just had a beer on a hot day, and then said, "When I see your kids, I see my kids," and, "When I see your grandparents, I see my grandparents."
He had said a strikingly similar thing months ago when talking about Trayvon Martin, the black teenager shot in Florida. "If I had a son, he'd look like Trayvon." Then, he was talking about race. So, of course his kids don't look like the tweens of small-town Parma. But he's putting himself in another tribe, those disgusted by a man with Swiss bank accounts and four homes who still paid a lower tax rate than an Ohio firefighter. 
Obama personalized this reach later in Pittsburgh, with a story about his humble family outings. "I remember my favorite vacation when I was a kid, traveling with my mom and my grandma and my sister, and we traveled the country on Greyhound buses, railroads, and once in a while we'd rent a car, not that often, and stay at Howard Johnsons."
Buses, trains, HoJos? It's a throwback image, but it conjures memories of finding joy in small pleasures just off the interstate. "Didn't matter how big the pool was; if there was a pool, I'd jump in. I was 11 years old, and I was excited just to go to the vending machine and get the ice bucket and get the ice."
The calculation was obvious, at a time when the airwaves were saturated with pictures of Romney and his motorized water toys along the gilded shore of Lake Winnipesaukee.
The two images - rich guy on a Jet Ski, skinny kid with Grandma at the Howard Johnson's pool - tell you why Obama continues to hold a narrow lead in most of the swing states, despite the terrible economy. People don't mind rich politicians; 75 percent of voters in a Gallup poll this week said Romney's wealth would not be a factor.
But a significant number are bothered by people who fetishize their wealth or use tricks (like offshore tax havens) to avoid the burdens of normal citizens. In that Gallup poll, one in five independents, a crucial block, said Romney's wealth made them less likely to vote for him. 
The pictures of Romney and his fellow suits at Bain Capital ravenously stuffing bills in their mouths and pockets is repulsive for the same reason that almost two-thirds of Americans have an unfavorable view of the Romney surrogate Donald Trump.
This is as much about crass warfare as class warfare. The Romney who made fun of Nascar fans in see-through plastic rain slickers or insulted the small-town cookie makers is the person Mike Huckabee was referring to when he said voters don't want their candidate "to look like the guy who laid them off." A plutocrat should never preen. 
In most of the swing states, two of Obama's core constituencies - college grads and Latinos - have increased as a share of the electorate. White, blue-collar men - a group that gave only 40 percent of its vote nationwide to Obama in 2008 - are shrinking as a percentage. 
This is the tribe that Obama has to connect with if he expects to win a second term. They fill their beer coolers with motel ice, because it saves a couple of bucks, and are looking for a president who has their back.

HEADLINE: Geithner Tried to Curb Rate Rigging in 2008

BYLINE: BEN PROTESS


HIGHLIGHT: In the midst of the 2008 financial crisis, Timothy F. Geithner, now the United States Treasury secretary, saw problems with the process for setting key interest rates and raised concerns with his counterparts in London about Libor. 

 BODY:
7:59 a.m. | Updated 
When Timothy F. Geithner ran the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, he acknowledged fundamental problems with the process for setting key interest rates in the midst of the 2008 financial crisis, according to documents provided to The New York Times.
Mr. Geithner, who is now the United States Treasury secretary, questioned the integrity of the benchmark as reports surfaced that Barclays and other big banks were misrepresenting the rates. In 2008, Barclays had several conversations with New York Fed officials about the matter.
Mr. Geithner then reached out to top British authorities to discuss issues with the interest rate, which is set in London. In an e-mail to his counterparts, he outlined reforms to the system, suggesting that British authorities "strengthen governance and establish a credible reporting procedure" and "eliminate incentive to misreport," according to the documents.
But the warnings came too late, and Barclays continued the illegal activity.
For years, Barclays reported false rates in an effort to bolster its profit and deflect concerns about the British bank's health. Last month, the bank agreed to pay $450 million to American and British authorities to settle claims that it had manipulated key benchmarks, including the London interbank offered rate, or Libor.
Libor and other such rates affect the cost of borrowing for consumer and companies, providing a benchmark for trillions of dollars in mortgages and other financial products. The case against Barclays is the first action to stem from a broader multiyear investigation into how big banks set the rates. Authorities around the world are pursuing investigations against more than 10 big banks, including UBS, JPMorgan and Citigroup.
Since the Barclays settlement, regulators have faced scrutiny of their roles in the rate-manipulation scandal.
Lawmakers in London and Washington have questioned whether government officials turned a blind eye to years of misconduct at Barclays. The bank has disclosed that it informed regulators, including the Bank of England and the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, that it had reported artificially low rates, along with the rest of the Wall Street.
This week, the oversight panel of the House Financial Services Committee sent a letter to the New York Fed seeking transcripts from several phone calls involving regulators and Barclays' executives. The New York Fed plans to release the transcripts on Friday.
Mr. Geithner is not mentioned in the transcripts, a person briefed on the matter said who did not want to be identified because the investigation was continuing. But it is unclear if other documents will detail whether he had deeper knowledge of the issues with Libor, and what further actions - if any - Mr. Geithner took. According to the person briefed on the matter, New York Fed officials told regulators in Washington about the problems with Libor.
The New York Fed, which oversees the holding company at some of the nation's biggest banks, first got wind of brewing problems with Libor in the summer of 2007. At the time, Barclays executives started briefing the regulators in the United States and Britain about their interest rate submissions.
In April 2008, a Barclays employee acknowledged to the Financial Services Authority of Britain that the bank was lowering its Libor submissions. "So, to the extent that, um, the Libors have been understated, are we guilty of being part of the pack? You could say we are," the Barclays manager said, according to regulatory documents. Barclays made similar comments to the New York Fed, the documents say.
The bank never explicitly told regulators that it was reporting false interest rates that amounted to manipulation, according to regulatory documents.
In Basel, Switzerland, Mr. Geithner discussed the Libor with Mervyn King, the governor of the Bank of England, Britain's central bank, according to the documents provided to The New York Times. Mr. Geithner then followed up with a June 2008 e-mail to Mr. King, outlining in a two-page memo his suggested changes to the way big banks set the interest rate, a copy of the memo shows. Mr. Geithner made six main recommendations for "enhancing the credibility of Libor."
"We would welcome a chance to discuss these and would be grateful if you would give us some sense of what changes are possible," Mr. Geithner wrote.
Mr. King responded "favorably" the person briefed on the matter said. The person added that the respective regulators continued discussions.
Documents released by the Bank of England on Friday show that Mr. King and Paul Tucker, the central bank's deputy governor, passed on Mr. Geithner's recommendations to the British Bankers' Association, the trade body that oversees the Libor rate. 
Mr. Tucker also talked to William C. Dudley, the current president of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, who was the executive vice president of the central bank's markets group at the time of the discussion.
In a separate note, Angela Knight, the chief executive of the British Bankers' Association, told Mr. Tucker that the suggestions from U.S. authorities were being included in a review of Libor. The trade body published its findings at the end of 2008, but is now conducting a further review into how the rate is set.
The memo from Mr. Geithner, however, raises new questions about why the Bank of England failed to halt the actions. At a hearing this week, British politicians hammered Mr. Tucker, the senior Bank of England official who is now a front-runner to become the next head of the bank, for failing to thwart the misconduct.

HEADLINE: China's Growth Rate Slowed in the 2nd Quarter, Down Sharply From a Year Ago

BYLINE: By IAN JOHNSON; Patrick Zuo contributed research.

 BODY:
BEIJING -- China's growth slowed in the second quarter, adding to the worries about the ability of the world's second-largest economy to offset low growth elsewhere.
The country's gross domestic product grew at an annual rate of 7.6 percent in the April to June period, down sharply from the 9.5 percent a year earlier, according to government figures released Friday morning. The second-quarter growth rate was half a point below the 8.1 percent for the first three months of this year.
For the first half of the year, the economy grew 7.8 percent. 
''Even though the economy continued to decline, I think that compared to other countries it isn't bad,'' Sheng Laiyun of the National Bureau of Statistics told reporters. ''The economy remains steady.''
The decline is partly caused by a weak global economy. Europe, which until this year was China's biggest trading partner, is in recession, while the United States economy remains weak. Even developing countries like India and Brazil have weakened considerably.
But part of the downturn is self-induced -- an effort by China to wean itself off decades of inefficient growth caused by heavy investment in sometimes dubious projects.
''The most important context for looking at this data is that the boom years are over,'' said Andy Rothman of CLSA Research. ''The days of 20 percent growth in autos or luxury goods -- that's mostly over.''
Chinese officials say this reflects China's maturing economy.
''After 30 years of vigorous growth, China's economy has entered a period of transition,'' Mr. Sheng said. ''The potential growth will slump, but this is a universal rule.''
Still, the slowdown comes at a sensitive time. The country's top leadership is due to change in the coming months, and economists are debating whether the country has failed to push economic reforms.
The rate was the lowest since the 2008-2009 global recession, when growth dipped to 6.6 percent in early 2009 before a huge government stimulus package provided double-digit economic growth.
Now, however, that stimulus has worn off and economists are divided over China's prospects.
Signs abound of weakness. Housing prices are officially falling for the first time since 2009, albeit only by 1.2 percent for May.
Optimists point to a number of statistics that, while not exactly shining, do not portend doom. The Purchasing Managers Index remains steady at just above 50, the reading above which conditions are thought to be improving. That rate has not moved in about a year.
Retail sales are up 13.8 percent, which is slightly down over previous months but not out of line based on historic figures. Exports have also increased to most parts of the world, except struggling Europe.
The challenge, economists say, will be for Chinese companies to adapt to slower growth. Companies in construction and energy industries will face tougher times, but those aimed at consumers could profit.
The current turmoil is part of this transformation.
Top leaders have showed their concern, with China's premier, Wen Jiabao, warning over the weekend of a ''huge downward pressure'' on the economy and calling for ''a more aggressive manner'' in tackling the slowdown. Last week, the government cut bank lending rates for the second time in a month.
One reason for concern is that 8 percent has long been seen as a benchmark for acceptable growth. Lower growth, so went the conventional wisdom through the 1990s and 2000s, would lead to instability and unrest because of to the huge number of people entering the labor force each year. Over the last few days, Chinese news media has been anticipating the G.D.P. report, with one government site asking ''will it go below 8?''
Increasingly, however, analysts do not see the situation as so dramatic. ''We're seeing no reports of widespread layoffs and over all they have to be happy,'' said Mr. Rothman. ''As long as employment is holding reasonably steady, things will remain stable.''

HEADLINE: New Claims for Unemployment Benefits Fall by 26,000

BYLINE: By THE ASSOCIATED PRESS

 BODY:
WASHINGTON (AP) -- The number of Americans seeking unemployment benefits plunged last week, mainly because at least two big automakers pulled back on their traditional summer shutdowns to keep up with demand. That led to fewer temporary layoffs of autoworkers. 
Sales of new cars and trucks surged in June, extending the auto industry's rebound.
Weekly applications for unemployment aid dropped by 26,000 to a seasonally adjusted 350,000, the Labor Department said on Thursday. That's the lowest level since March 2008. The four-week average, a less volatile measure, fell to 376,500.
Economists expect most of the decline to be reversed in the coming weeks. ''Take July with a grain of salt,'' Jill Brown, an economist at Credit Suisse, said in a note to clients. The auto shutdowns ''often cause extreme volatility.''
Automakers traditionally close their plants for the first two weeks in July to prepare them to build new models, and their employees file for unemployment benefits. But the Ford Motor Company said in May that it would reduce its usual two-week closing to one week. And Chrysler also said then that it would skip the shutdown entirely.
When applications for benefits consistently fall below 375,000, it generally suggests hiring is strong enough to reduce the unemployment rate. They have fluctuated at or above that level since April as the unemployment rate remains stuck at 8.2 percent.
Also on Thursday, the Commerce Department reported that the United States trade deficit narrowed in May from April, helped by cheaper oil that lowered imports and an increase in American exports to Europe and China.
The Commerce Department said on Wednesday that the trade deficit fell 3.8 percent to $48.7 billion in May, down from $50.6 billion in April.
Exports rose 0.2 percent to $183.1 billion. The increase reflected stronger sales of telecommunications equipment and heavy machinery. Exports to the 27-nation European Union rose 2.6 percent in May from April.
Imports dropped 0.7 percent to $231.8 billion. The amount the United States spent on imported oil fell to the lowest level in 15 months.
America's trade deficit with China increased to $26 billion in May. Exports to China rose 5.2 percent, but imports rose by a faster 5.8 percent.

HEADLINE: The Folly of Sudan and South Sudan

 BODY:
When South Sudan declared independence from Sudan one year ago, it was well understood that the struggle to build a functioning new state would be long and hard. What was not understood was how much both countries would do to sabotage each other -- and themselves -- in a destructive game of cross-border attacks and economic showdowns. 
With independence, South Sudan inherited most of the former country's oil fields. But South Sudan is landlocked and Sudan controls the pipeline needed to get that oil -- the lifeblood for both governments -- to market. In January, South Sudan shut down oil production in a dispute with Sudan over how much it should pay to transport its crude oil through Sudan's pipeline.
In the months since, the two countries still have not agreed on a formula to share oil profits and each seems to be waiting for the other to blink -- a fool's game if there ever was one. South Sudan's economy was weak to begin with, and Sudan's is now in free fall. Hunger is getting worse in both places, and so is political instability.
Deprived of oil income, Sudan last month announced that it could no longer subsidize gas, sending prices for fuel and other goods soaring. President Omar Hassan al-Bashir is having trouble paying his army. And over the past few weeks, thousands of protesters have demonstrated against the government, prompting a crackdown.
In South Sudan, the government has begun to get tougher about collecting income taxes to finance basic services. People are understandably reluctant to pay when the government is known for rampant mismanagement and corruption. President Salva Kiir recently urged officials to return $4 billion in ''stolen'' government money. Officials also suggested that any budget shortfall would be filled by international donors. So far, that doesn't seem to be happening, and shouldn't. South Sudan, along with Sudan, created this crisis, and they have the means to fix it.
The two sides fought a civil war that killed more than two million people before a peace deal in 2005. In the past year, they barely avoided a return to all-out conflict. Violence continues in Darfur and in the Nuba Mountains of Sudan, a rebel-held area where the Khartoum government is trying to bomb and starve the people into submission. Thousands have been displaced.
In April, South Sudan's army occupied an oil-producing region claimed by Sudan and brought the countries close to a new war. South Sudan backed off after the United Nations threatened sanctions.
The joy that accompanied South Sudan's hard-won freedom has faded. The United States and other countries that advocated independence need to keep working with both sides to resolve disputes over oil, borders and protections for minorities. There's no changing the reality that these two nations are mutually dependent, now and long into the future.

HEADLINE: Weak Economies in the United States and Europe Weigh Down Asia

BYLINE: By BETTINA WASSENER

 BODY:
HONG KONG -- The gloom battering the United States and European economies is increasingly dragging down Asia, the world's global growth engine.
South Korea sought to aid its economy on Thursday with an unexpected interest rate cut, and the odds of a similar move in Australia rose after figures showed a weaker-than-expected job market.
In Japan, the central bank trimmed its outlook for growth. China, which dominates the region, is expected to release data Friday that will show a further slowdown in its giant economy. 
Combined, the events crystallize the sense that the Asia-Pacific region is increasingly vulnerable to economic chills elsewhere.
''We are worried about Asia,'' said Rob Subbaraman, an economist at Nomura in Hong Kong. ''The slowdown so far has been moderate, but there is a real sense that Asia is teetering, that it could reach a tipping point where the slowdown accelerates and companies really start to cut down on capital expenditures and hiring. We're not there yet, but we are edging closer to that point.''
The Asian Development Bank echoed that sentiment on Thursday, when it lowered its 2012 forecast for economic growth in developing Asian countries to 6.6 percent from 6.9 percent. That group includes India and Thailand. For next year, the bank now projects 7.1 percent growth, rather than the 7.3 percent it had forecast in April.
''Slower growth in the U.S. and euro area reduced demand for the region's exports,'' the bank said in a report. ''Worries over the economic strength of important developing economies have also emerged recently.''
Over the last five years, hypercompetitive Asia has withstood with relative health the United States financial crisis and then the European debt crisis.
So far, the weakness across the region is far less pronounced than after the collapse of Lehman Brothers in 2008. The question for many policy makers, economists and businesses is whether it will remain that way.
The drawn-out debt problems and austerity measures in Europe and the lethargic pace of growth in the United States have affected Asia and many other emerging-market economies directly by undermining demand for exports. Asia, and particularly China, is the world's factory, and exports remain an important driver for many Asian economies.
On the policy front, central bankers and officials also appear increasingly concerned about the slowing growth and have begun to follow the West with efforts to bolster it.
In South Korea, the central bank lowered its key base rate on Thursday to 3 percent from 3.25 percent. It was the first cut by the bank in more than three years and surprised economists, most of whom had expected the bank to keep interest rates unchanged.
The Bank of Korea cited the global environment for its move. Some economic indicators in the United States ''have shown signs of deteriorating, and the sluggishness of economic activities in the euro area'' has deepened, the central bank said in a statement.
''Growth in emerging market countries as well has continued to slow,'' it said, adding that the uncertainty surrounding the euro zone fiscal crisis and economic slumps in major countries presented ''downside risks.''
Elsewhere in the region, the Japanese central bank left its key interest rate unchanged at the already low level of 0.1 percent Thursday, but in a regular review of its economic forecast, it trimmed its outlook for the year ending next March to a growth rate of 2.2 percent, from an earlier projection of 2.3 percent.
''There is still a lot of uncertainty about the fiscal and structural reforms that Europe needs,'' Masaaki Shirakawa, the central bank governor, said, according to Reuters. ''Europe remains the risk factor that we have to watch out for the most.''
In Australia, employment fell by 27,000 in June, and the unemployment rate crept up to 5.2 percent from 5.1 percent in May. That is a low rate compared with that in the United States and Europe, but the unexpectedly weak outcome raised the likelihood that the central bank might lower interest rates again in coming months.
Like the rest of the region, Australia is heavily reliant on demand from China, whose cooling growth has added to the economic drag from elsewhere and undermined investor sentiment around the globe.

HEADLINE: Reinstating the Draft: Other Perspectives

 BODY:
To the Editor:
Re ''Let's Draft Our Kids,'' by Thomas E. Ricks (Op-Ed, July 10): Since the end of conscription in 1973, America has relied upon a virtual military class that is unfairly carrying the burden of war. Out of the more than two million men and women who were deployed to Iraq and Afghanistan, nearly half served on more than one tour of duty. Multiple deployments cause many soldiers to come home with post-traumatic stress disorder or without limbs. 
To bring fairness and accountability into our national defense, I have long called for a draft that requires all American men and women between 18 and 25 to serve two years in either the armed forces or civilian national service. Such universal service would not only lessen the burden on the 1 percent of our population currently serving in our military, but would also compel members of Congress and the American public to think twice before sending our children into harm's way.
CHARLES B. RANGEL Member of Congress, 15th Dist., N.Y. Washington, July 11, 2012
To the Editor:
Former Secretary of Defense Robert M. Gates has commented on the contrast he saw between young military service members in Iraq and Afghanistan, with their deep patriotism and ethic of national service, and the students he encountered as president of Texas A&M University who were focused on advancing their academic and professional careers.
A return to a military draft might, as Gen. Stanley A. McChrystal said, make Americans think more carefully before going to war. In addition, it would instill a sense of national pride and the responsibilities that go with it for millions of young Americans.
When I was a high school student, a course in civics was mandatory. Today civic courses are seen as obsolescent, as is national service for all but the 1 percent of young Americans who volunteer for the military.
WESLEY PORIOTIS New York, July 10, 2012
The writer is a co-founder of Veterans Across America.
To the Editor:
Thomas E. Ricks made a creditable argument for renewal of the draft in a modified form. As a draft lawyer during the Vietnam War, I heartily agree while also offering some caveats.
First, avoid reinstating the flawed Vietnam War draft. A new draft law would have to be equitable, something missing from the old law, under which the wealthy hired lawyers to assist their children while those who were economically deprived carried the burden.
Next, it should contain at least Mr. Ricks's three basic elements: 1) a two-tier military -- armed personnel and nondeployed service providers; 2) a civilian service counterpart, but with benefits and obligations equivalent to the military option; 3) free college tuition to all on completion of service.
Finally, it must include an exemption for those medically disqualified and those morally and ethically opposed.
DON BAY Ostersund, Sweden, July 11, 2012
To the Editor:
Thomas E. Ricks resurrects the old chestnut that if only the government would enslave the young for some period of time, then the country would be a better and safer place. I suggest we start with simpler measures.
Next time we go to war, let's first raise a tax to cover the cost. If we still feel it is the right thing to do, then we can worry about the draft.

HEADLINE: Taxi Commission Approves 17% Fare Increase

BYLINE: By MATT FLEGENHEIMER and MICHAEL M. GRYNBAUM

 BODY:
The cost to take a yellow cab in New York City is about to go up.
The Taxi and Limousine Commission voted on Thursday to raise taxi fares by an average of 17 percent, the first major increase in eight years. The new fares are expected to go into effect in September. 
The cost of a fare between Manhattan and Kennedy International Airport will rise by $7, to $52, exclusive of tolls and tip. The surcharge on rides to Newark Liberty International Airport will also go up, to $17.50 from $15.
Six members of the commission voted in favor; two voted against, and one abstained. The commission also approved a small adjustment in the amount that taxi owners can charge cabbies to rent their vehicles for a shift.
But the higher fares will go directly toward higher wages for cabbies, whose pay has lagged behind inflation.
''Taxi drivers have been working hard for six years with no raise,'' David S. Yassky, the chairman of the taxi commission, said on Thursday. ''There comes a time you need to make sure people can earn a decent living.''
Mr. Yassky acknowledged that ridership could fall with the increase, but he said that, historically, fare increases had led to only slight declines in demand.
Owners of large taxi fleets, however, complained that they would not receive a larger proportion of the higher fares, saying they should be able to charge drivers proportionately higher rates for renting a vehicle.
Michael Woloz, a spokesman for the Metropolitan Taxicab Board of Trade, which frequently sues the city's taxi commission, said the yellow cab industry would ''seriously look at all of our options, including legal options.''
''What happened today was not a package,'' Mr. Woloz said. ''It was a lopsided giveback to the drivers.''
The last across-the-board fare increase occurred in 2004, when metered fares rose by about 26 percent.
Nora C. Marino, one of the commissioners who voted against the fare increase, said she supported a raise for drivers but was concerned that the package was not ''balanced.''
''You could see it in the room,'' Ms. Marino said. ''When one half of the room is cheering and the other half of the room has long faces, that's not a balance.''
Cabbies' groups, who have complained for years that drivers could barely earn a living in their jobs, were thrilled by the outcome of Thursday's vote. As the results were announced, Bhairavi Desai, the executive director of the New York Taxi Workers Alliance, was handed a bouquet of flowers from a driver. Her eyes began to well.
''Today is a day of celebration,'' she said after the vote.
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

HEADLINE: In Oil Boom, a Housing Shortage and Other Issues

BYLINE: By KATE GALBRAITH. 
kgalbraith@texastribune.org

 BODY:
MIDLAND, Tex. -- In the desolate outskirts of this thriving West Texas oil town, two men recently showed off a new 400-square-foot wood cabin they hope to rent out for $1,500 a month. A planned expansion includes spaces for 30 recreational vehicles and nine additional cabins -- and maybe more.
''This morning, the boss man was asking if we could duplicate this across the fence,'' said Danny Wallace, who works for Jones Brothers Dirt & Paving Contractors, the company developing the site.
Housing as expensive as New York City's has become the norm in Midland, amid an oil boom that is rapidly reshaping the area. With oil prices hovering above $80 a barrel, more than double their level of early 2009, workers have flocked here from elsewhere in Texas and the nation, lured by jobs working on rigs or driving trucks. But the resulting housing shortages, traffic and strain on schools has some residents shaking their heads. 
''I was born and raised here in Midland, and it's never been like this,'' Kenney DeLaGarza, a building inspector for the city, said as he stood on a gravel road beside a patch of land covered with trailers. Fields where his parents once took him to shoot fireworks, he said, have turned into housing developments -- sometimes with pump jacks in the backdrop.
Booms -- and busts -- have been a way of life here since oil began flowing from Permian Basin wells in the 1920s. Midland is where George H. W. Bush and George W. Bush made their names in oil. The mayor, Wes Perry, is also an oilman, and he sometimes takes calls about city matters from his EGL Resources office.
Today, the Permian Basin accounts for 14 percent of the nation's oil production. That is far more than the combined output of other Texas fields, including the Eagle Ford Shale, and more than the Bakken Shale in North Dakota, another major drilling region.
This latest boom has been driven by hydraulic fracturing, or fracking, the technique of shooting water, sand and chemicals deep underground to crack hard rock and release oil. (The Permian Basin also produces natural gas, but some gets flared off, partly because of a pipeline shortage.)
Fracking has allowed drillers to produce more oil than ever before, although the wells are more expensive, according to Tommy Taylor, the drilling manager with Fasken Oil and Ranch, an oil company that is building a new headquarters on Midland's northwest edge. Also, fracking's demand on aquifers has added to deep concerns about water availability in a region so parched that oil field trucks can kick up clouds of dust that look like smoke.
Amid the resurgent drilling, Midland officials estimate that the city's population has swelled by about 8 percent in the last two years, to about 120,000. There is talk of eventually hitting the 150,000 mark. Unemployment in Midland in May stood at just 3.8 percent -- the lowest for a metropolitan area in the state -- followed by nearby Odessa, at 4.3 percent.
The oil fields offer generous pay, starting at around $15 an hour, Mr. Taylor said. That leaves other businesses scrambling for workers. Along a half-mile stretch of the Andrews Highway, an artery through the heart of Midland, ''help wanted'' signs are ubiquitous -- at Long John Silver's, Pizza Hut, Wendy's, Whataburger, CVS and the Way Out West Steak & Buffet.
''If you can't get a job in Midland, Tex., you're not going to make it,'' said Jack Naumann, a geologist who has lived here since 1969.
Even as more workers arrive, there is no guarantee they can find housing. That is why Jones Brothers, the company Mr. Wallace works for, is building the two-bed cabins and renting out trailer spaces with utility hookups.
Jones Brothers, whose products include crushed limestone, is thriving. (''We sell everything we can crush,'' Mr. Wallace said.) But it is struggling to find places to house prospective workers, who call about jobs from as far away as Indiana.
''We have to tell them we've got the work, but we've got a problem with living conditions,'' Mr. Wallace said. He plans to reserve some spaces in the new development for Jones Brothers workers and rent out the rest; a Craigslist ad, placed in late June, plus word of mouth, yielded at least 50 calls over two weeks, mostly for the R.V. spaces, he said.
Besides subdivisions, cabins and R.V. parks, which are sometimes called ''man camps,'' hotels are going up rapidly. On Midland's western edge, near the ballpark that is home to the city's minor-league RockHounds baseball team (which projects record-breaking attendance this year), four hotels are being built or expanded, essentially within sight of one another.
At the Sleep Inn & Suites, workers are rushing to complete a new wing in time for a major oil convention in October. ''All the rooms that you see are rented,'' said Dwayne Felker, who works for the construction company Shell Craft, speaking in the still-skeletal interior above the sounds of hammering and clinking.
The hotels and other new developments could even start to meld Midland and Odessa, which lie 20 miles apart but vie with each other on and off the high school football field.
'' 'Modessa' -- it's going to happen eventually,'' said Mr. DeLaGarza, who does frequent inspections at a vast new subdivision near the ballpark.
Some existing neighborhoods are wrestling with a different issue: drilling. Over the past 18 months, the City Council approved more than a dozen permits for drilling within city limits, and at least eight more are up for consideration in the next two months, according to John James, a councilman. Only a few have been rejected -- one of them in the northwest Midland neighborhood where Craig Tellinghuisen, a retiree who worked in the oil business decades ago, lives.
''One of the reasons that my wife and I moved out here was the peace and quiet and the country environment,'' Mr. Tellinghuisen said of the area, which he moved to 11 years ago. Now, he is concerned about truck traffic and the noise of drilling. (The oil company has reapplied for the permit.)
Regionwide, a surge in road accidents has raised concern. A recent report from the Midland-Odessa Transportation Alliance found that the traffic fatality rate for the Permian Basin area in 2010 was two and a half times higher than in the rest of Texas -- and crashes and deaths have only climbed since.
''We're very concerned,'' said James Beauchamp, the president of the alliance, which launched its Drive Smart campaign last week, with notices online and around town. In one especially awful week in June, he said, there were nine traffic deaths.
Even schools are feeling the strains of the boom. The Midland Independent School District has about 22,500 students and is adding about 750 a year, according to its superintendent, Ryder Warren. The district plans to seek a bond issue that will probably include money to build three elementary schools, Dr. Warren said. Meanwhile, dozens of portable classrooms have been set up.
All of the challenges have some people wondering when the boom is going to end, or at least ease. Longtime Midlanders say a bust is inevitable -- it is just a matter of time. Oil prices have fallen more than 20 percent from their highs of around $110 per barrel in February.
Mr. Taylor, the Fasken drilling manager, said that the recent price drop has already had an impact, and that for fracking -- an expensive process -- to continue, the economics must work.
''If they don't,'' he said, ''people will quit drilling wells.''

HEADLINE: Engineering and the Art of the Fail

BYLINE: By CORNELIA DEAN

 BODY:
TO FORGIVE DESIGN
Understanding Failure
By Henry Petroski
410 pages. The Belknap Press of Harvard University Press. $27.95.
In May 1987 the Golden Gate Bridge had a 50th birthday party. The bridge was closed to automobile traffic so people could enjoy a walk across the spectacular span.
Organizers expected perhaps 50,000 pedestrians to show up. Instead, by some estimates, as many as 800,000 thronged the bridge approaches. By the time 250,000 were on the bridge engineers noticed something ominous: the roadway was flattening under what turned out to be the heaviest load it had ever been asked to carry. Worse, it was beginning to sway. 
''Though crowds of people do not generally walk in step, if the bridge beneath them begins to move sideways -- for whatever reason -- the people on it instinctively tend to fall into step the better to keep their balance,'' Henry Petroski writes. ''This in turn exacerbates the sideways motion of the structure, and a positive feedback loop is developed,'' making matters worse and worse.
This time disaster was averted. The authorities closed access to the bridge and tens of thousands of people, caught in pedestrian gridlock, made their way back to land, a process that for some took hours.
The story is one of scores in ''To Forgive Design: Understanding Failure,'' a book that is at once an absorbing love letter to engineering and a paean to its breakdowns.
Disaster has long been grist for Dr. Petroski. His first book, in 1985, was ''To Engineer Is Human: The Role of Failure in Successful Design.'' Since then he has written widely on failure, in other books and in a regular column in the magazine American Scientist. He has also produced book-length discussions of design successes, like the pencil (point breakage notwithstanding) and the toothpick.
Like all of us, engineers hope their designs will succeed, solving old problems in new ways or making things faster, cheaper, more efficient or more pleasant. But, as Dr. Petroski writes, ''no matter what the technology is, our best estimates of its success tend to be overly optimistic.''
Failure is what drives the field forward.
''There is nothing new about things breaking,'' Dr. Petroski writes, be they teeth subjected to the ''cycles of stress'' we call chewing, cardiac stents exposed to the corrosive effects of -- who knew? -- human blood or large stone obelisks suddenly coming apart, which he tells us motivated Galileo's research into the strength of materials.
This book is a litany of failure, including falling concrete in the Big Dig in Boston, the loss of the space shuttles Challenger and Columbia, the rupture of New Orleans levees, collapsing buildings in the Haitian earthquake, the Deepwater Horizon blowout, the sinking of the Titanic, the metal fatigue that doomed 1950s-era de Havilland Comet jets -- and swaying, crumpling bridges from Britain to Cambodia.
Though he acknowledges that engineering works can fail because the person who thought them up or engineered them simply got things wrong, in this book Dr. Petroski widens his view to consider the larger arena in which such failures occur.
Sometimes devices fail because they are subjected to unexpected stress, like the Golden Gate under the weight of all those people, who collectively applied far more stress than the ordinary automobile traffic the bridge was supposed to carry.
Then there are the insulating O rings on the booster that launched the Challenger, which stiffened on an unusually cold morning in Cape Canaveral, Fla. Engineers alarmed by this issue recommended that the launch be postponed; managers overruled them.
Perhaps a good design is constructed with shoddy materials incompetently applied, factors Dr. Petroski says were at play in the concrete woes of Haiti's housing stock after its 2010 earthquake.
Or perhaps a design works so well it is adopted elsewhere again and again, with incremental, seemingly innocuous improvements, until, suddenly, it does not work at all anymore. That was the case in one of the most notorious engineering failures, the collapse of the Tacoma Narrows Bridge, in Washington State in 1940.
Its design was not that different from the design of other successful bridges. But people wanted an elegant structure, so they built it narrow, just two lanes wide. Shortly after it opened, in winds of only about 40 miles per hour, it began to sway, eventually contorting itself until it collapsed.
In a way, failure has shaped Dr. Petroski's career. As a young engineer at Argonne National Laboratory he worked on the fracture mechanics of nuclear-reactor vessels. But when job prospects dried up after the accident at Three Mile Island, he took a job at Duke University, where today he is a professor of civil engineering.
Readers of his earlier books will encounter stories they have heard before in ''To Forgive Design.'' But they will encounter new stories, too, and a moving discussion of the responsibility of the engineer to the public and the ways young engineers can be helped to grasp them.
After the 1907 collapse of a bridge under construction in Quebec, engineers in Canada instituted a ceremony by which new graduates entering the profession received iron rings meant to remind them of their responsibilities. A variation of this practice is spreading in the United States, even as this country struggles to enhance its engineering success in the world economy.
People who study the ecology of innovation say one of our biggest advantages may be our willingness to accept failure, however distressing, as an inevitable byproduct of ambition. In the United States, if some unanticipated factor causes your good idea to fail, relatively little stigma attaches to you. In fact, you will hear people in Silicon Valley say that if you have not gone bankrupt at least once or twice, you're not trying hard enough.
''Success is success but that is all that it is,'' Dr. Petroski writes. It is failure that brings improvement.

HEADLINE: In Latest Data, Economists See Signs of Pickup

BYLINE: By ANNIE LOWREY

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- Despite the recent run of disappointing economic data, a broad range of experts and forecasters expect the economy to improve slightly in coming months, thanks to lower oil prices and new signs of life from sectors like automobiles and housing.
Call it a firming up, if not quite a comeback. 
Economists at many of the most-watched forecasting organizations, both public and private, expect growth to pick up through the summer and into the fall, although only to a pace broadly considered sluggish, if not dismal.
This week, Macroeconomic Advisers, an economic consultancy often cited by policy makers, estimated the annual rate of growth in the second quarter at just 1.2 percent -- well below the pace needed to reduce the unemployment rate. But the firm also projected growth to accelerate to around 2.4 percent in the third quarter.
''The pace of economic growth is picking up, but not to a rate that is very robust,'' said Joel Prakken, the chairman of Macroeconomic Advisers. ''It certainly is no great shakes.''
Forecasters, including those at the Federal Reserve, have been overly optimistic at several points during the slump of the last few years, of course. But the recent fall in oil prices and the stabilization of the housing market do give some gravitas to the current predictions.
On Thursday, the Labor Department reported that new claims for jobless benefits dropped to their lowest level in four years, at 350,000 a week. Analysts said they were unsure how much of the decline stemmed from an actual improvement, as opposed to temporary factors in the auto industry.
The pace of economic growth will have huge implications for a country still trying to emerge from the worst downturn in 70 years amid a presidential campaign that will most likely turn on the economy.
United States growth began to surge in late 2011 and early 2012, before slowing significantly in the spring. Some of the recent headwinds -- like a re-escalation of the euro zone crisis, households that are paying down their debt, and a falloff in growth in big emerging markets, like China and Brazil -- remain.
With tax increases and across-the-board government budget cuts looming at the end of the year -- unless Congress acts to change the law -- some economic experts are wary.
''The soft patch could easily extend through year-end or almost a full year,'' Steven Ricchiuto, the chief economist at Mizuho Securities USA, wrote in a note to clients on Thursday. ''Companies are unlikely to hire, invest in new plants and equipment or build inventory. This pullback could very well last through year-end as the chances of any movement on the fiscal front are unlikely until after the election.''
The weaker-than-expected spring data has raised speculation that the Federal Reserve might announce a new round of bond buying this summer to spur growth. Some Fed officials want further action because they are not confident the economy will pick up soon.
But other headwinds have started to slack, leading some economists to believe that jobs and growth numbers will track up modestly.
Perhaps most significant is the falling price of oil. Gas prices rose steadily from January through March on concerns over a confrontation with Iran as the United States and its allies cut the producer out of the petroleum market. But tensions have faded and gas prices have fallen to $3.38 a gallon today from above $3.90 a gallon in April, which has left more money in American consumers' wallets and businesses' ledgers. Every penny that the price of gas falls leaves about a billion dollars in American pockets over the course of a year, economists estimate.
The lower gas prices ''will take a few months to show up'' in consumer spending and confidence numbers, said Mr. Prakken of Macroeconomic Advisers. But it should lead to higher sales for businesses and greater optimism among households.
James Bullard, the president of the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis, said that he saw ''modestly improving economic growth during the second half of 2012, along with a slow and intermittent decline in unemployment,'' when he spoke in London this week.
Economists pointed to surging new car sales as a good economic indicator: a sign that households are confident enough to make a major purchase and that they are accessing the credit markets. It is also a boon for auto businesses -- the auto industry reported a 22 percent jump in sales in June, with some carmakers reporting that revenue increased as much as 60 percent year-on-year.
''The surge in car sales is disproportionately important,'' said Ian Shepherdson, an economist and forecaster at High Frequency Economics. ''It means that you're willing and able to take out a loan -- and that's quite a good sign.''
Moreover, there are accumulating signs that housing has turned around, perhaps auguring a rise in residential investment, an upturn in construction jobs and growing sales.
''I do think that the economy is stronger than the recent data would suggest,'' said Mark M. Zandi, the chief economist of Moody's Analytics. ''We've had the numbers say underlying job growth is at 80,000 jobs a month, where we could see 150,000 jobs a month. Or G.D.P. at 2 percent, where it's really at 2.5 percent. That will become evident later in the year.''
Some economists pointed to private forecasts showing a stronger June than the one depicted in government reports. A Bureau of Labor Statistics survey showed that employers added just 80,000 new positions that month -- not enough to bring the unemployment rate down from its elevated rate of 8.2 percent.
But a closely watched monthly survey showed that private sector employers added a strong 176,000 jobs in June.
''Everybody has argued that A.D.P. got it wrong,'' said Mr. Shepherdson, of the survey. ''But it's a big survey, and a good survey. Maybe the Bureau of Labor Statistics got it wrong.''
Mr. Prakken said the initial unemployment claims ''suggest that the labor market has not fallen out of bed.'' He added, ''There's been a pause in hiring, a momentary pause in hiring.''

HEADLINE: Drug Makers' Growth Is Linked to Emerging Markets

BYLINE: By KATIE THOMAS

 BODY:
Rising incomes among consumers in emerging markets like China, India and Brazil are poised to drive global growth in pharmaceutical spending over the next five years, according to a report released Thursday by the IMS Institute for Healthcare Informatics.
The news is likely to be a welcome development for the drug industry, which is struggling to maintain sales in the United States and Europe as patent expirations and price controls eat into profits. The report predicts that the market for drugs will rebound in the next few years, to 5 to 7 percent growth in 2016 from an expected low point of 3 to 4 percent growth this year. Global spending will total almost $1.2 trillion by 2016, compared with about $956 billion in 2011.
Governments and insurers in the United States and Europe, eager to curtail growing health care costs, are expected to take an even more critical look at drug prices, said Michael Kleinrock, director of research development at the institute. 
''As payers continue to spend more and more on medicines, the questions of the value and return for that spend become even more front-of-mind,'' he said. The report found that rising incomes and more generous health care policies in emerging pharmaceutical markets -- countries that will see more than $1 billion in drug growth over the next five years, but where the per capita gross domestic product is less than $25,000 -- is leading to small but widespread increases in drug spending.
''As incomes rise, the ability to afford medicines is one of the first things that come to these people,'' Mr. Kleinrock said.
In China, the report estimates, drug spending will amount to about $121 a person in 2016, which is far less than the $892 a person expected to be spent in the United States. But given that two-thirds of the world's population lives in those emerging markets, even modest increases can make a big difference.
Spending is expected to double in these markets in the next five years, growing by a projected range of $150 billion to $165 billion, the report found. By 2016, 30 percent of global spending on medicines will be in the emerging markets, compared with 20 percent in 2011.
The story is very different in developed markets like the United States, Europe and Japan, where the share of global drug spending is expected to decrease to 57 percent in 2016, from 66 percent in 2011.
The decline is expected to be sharp in the United States. In 2006, the American share of global spending was 41 percent. By 2016, it is projected to be 31 percent. That decrease is driven largely by a wave of patent expirations and the spread of low-cost generic drugs, both in the United States and Europe. The brunt will be felt this year, with at least nine major drugs -- including Plavix, Seroquel and Singulair -- losing their patent protections in the United States. That will ebb by 2016, when just four major drugs are set to lose exclusivity in this country.
As the patent wave crests this year and next, Mr. Kleinrock said, growth in pharmaceutical spending in developed markets will be almost nonexistent, between zero and 1 percent. But by 2014, ''we'll start to see less negative impact on overall brand spending; we'll start to see slightly higher growth rates in developed markets,'' he said.
About half of the expected growth in the American market in 2014 -- about $6 billion, Mr. Kleinrock said --will be because of the health care law, which is predicted to increase demand for drugs as more people become insured.

HEADLINE: Wells Fargo Will Settle Mortgage Bias Charges

BYLINE: By CHARLIE SAVAGE

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- Wells Fargo, the nation's largest home mortgage lender, has agreed to pay at least $175 million to settle accusations that its independent brokers discriminated against black and Hispanic borrowers during the housing boom, the Justice Department announced on Thursday. If approved by a federal judge, it would be the second-largest residential fair-lending settlement in the department's history.
An investigation by the department's civil rights division found that mortgage brokers working with Wells Fargo had charged higher fees and rates to more than 30,000 minority borrowers across the country than they had to white borrowers who posed the same credit risk, according to a complaint filed on Thursday along with the proposed settlement. 
Wells Fargo brokers also steered more than 4,000 minority borrowers into costlier subprime mortgages when white borrowers with similar credit risk profiles had received regular loans, a Justice Department complaint found. The deal covers the subprime bubble years of 2004 to 2009.
Thomas Perez, the assistant attorney general for the civil rights division, said the practices amounted to a ''racial surtax,'' adding: ''All too frequently, Wells Fargo's African-American and Latino borrowers had no idea they could have gotten a better deal -- no idea that white borrowers with similar credit would pay less.''
Wells Fargo admitted no wrongdoing as part of the settlement. In a statement, the bank also announced that it would no longer finance mortgages through independent brokers, and noted that it had ceased making subprime loans in 2008.
''Wells Fargo is settling this matter because we believe it is in the best interest of our team members, customers, communities and investors to avoid a long and costly legal fight, and to instead devote our resources to continuing to contribute to the country's housing recovery,'' said Mike Heid, president of Wells Fargo Home Mortgage.
The bank agreed to pay $125 million to compensate individual borrowers. The Justice Department estimated that the minority borrowers who had been steered into costly subprime loans would receive an average of $15,000, while the victims who had been charged more costly fees would receive $1,000 to $3,500.
In addition, the bank has agreed to give $50 million to a program that assists people in making down payments or improving their homes in eight metropolitan areas: Baltimore, Chicago, Cleveland, an area east of Los Angeles, New York, Oakland/San Francisco Bay Area, Philadelphia and Washington.
Lending data showed, for example, that in 2007 customers in the Chicago area who borrowed $300,000 from Wells Fargo through an independent broker had paid an average of $2,937 more in broker fees if African-American, and $2,187 more if Hispanic, compared with white borrowers with a similar credit risk, the complaint said.
Similarly, it said, the data showed that nationwide, an African-American borrower who had qualified for a regular loan was 2.9 times more likely to be steered into a subprime loan, and a Hispanic borrower was 1.8 times more likely, than were similarly creditworthy white borrowers. Subprime loans, which are intended for riskier borrowers, carry higher interest rates.
Wells Fargo was also facing lawsuits by several entities beyond the Justice Department, including the city of Baltimore, the state of Illinois and the Pennsylvania Human Rights Commission. It settled with all of them as part of the deal, putting to rest its fair-lending cases from the bubble years.
The focus of the settlement is Wells Fargo's failure to police the behavior of its independent loan brokers. The complaint said that the bank had set basic credit guidelines but then had allowed the brokers discretion to charge higher rates or steer people into less attractive loans without ensuring there was no discrimination based on race or national origin
Wells Fargo and the Justice Department were unable to agree on whether the data had showed any evidence of discrimination in the lending practices of the bank's in-house ''retail'' mortgage agents. Instead, they agreed to a methodology to evaluate that data further. If it finds evidence of discrimination, the victims would receive similar compensation on top of the $175 million Wells Fargo has already agreed to pay.
Under federal civil rights laws, a lending practice is illegal if it has a disparate impact on minority borrowers, even without evidence of discriminatory intent.
During the housing boom, Wall Street firms developed a huge demand for subprime loans that they purchased and bundled into securities for sale to investors, creating financial incentives for lenders to make such loans. In early 2010, the Obama administration set up a unit in the civil rights division to focus on lending bias amid the fallout from the wave of foreclosures that had set off the financial crisis.
In December, the division settled a similar lawsuit with Bank of America for $335 million over loan discrimination by its Countrywide Financial unit. In May, SunTrust Mortgage agreed to pay $21 million in a similar case.

HEADLINE: A Playful Makeover for Perry Ellis

BYLINE: By STUART ELLIOTT

 BODY:
AN initiative by a maker of apparel, Perry Ellis International, to revitalize its flagship Perry Ellis men's wear brand will soon have consumers seeing spots, in the form of polka dots.
The dots are meant to evoke the heritage of the Perry Ellis brand and signal that a playful attitude for which the brand was known is coming back. For instance, in one print advertisement, the polka dots look as if they were produced by a puckish model wielding a hole puncher.
In addition to appearing in the print ads, the polka dots will decorate hang tags and turn up, discreetly, in garment linings. 
The print ads are part of a campaign for Perry Ellis clothing, with a budget estimated at $10 million, that is intended to stimulate demand for fall merchandise like men's shirts. The ads are being created by a new agency for the brand, Yard, based in New York. Knock, an agency in Minneapolis, worked on the new hang tags as well as a redesign of packaging and the Perry Ellis logo.
In addition to reviving heritage elements like the polka dots, the campaign will seek to freshen the brand image for contemporary consumers who may not be familiar with the designer Perry Ellis. At his death in 1986 at the age of 46, he was considered one of the Big Three of American fashion designers along with Calvin Klein and Ralph Lauren.
That effort is underlined by the theme of the campaign, ''Very Perry Ellis,'' which is also intended to remind shoppers of the days when those words were heard from Seventh Avenue to malls around the country.
''The brand, when it was first launched, was one of the first true designer brands,'' said Carmine Petruzello, president for Perry Ellis men's wear at Perry Ellis International in New York.
''The Perry Ellis dress shirt was very recognizable from the pleat on the sleeve,'' he added. ''It was like wearing a swoosh on a sneaker.''
The campaign comes after changes in the executive suite that included the arrival of Mr. Petruzello. ''There's a new team here,'' he said, one whose ''idea is what would it be like today if Perry were still driving the bus.''
So there is ''a little harken-back to Perry,'' he added, like the polka dots, and forward steps like offering garments that would appeal to ''a 20-something guy.''
For example, the brand is collaborating with the designers of the trendy Duckie Brown label for a line to come out in spring 2013.
The Perry Ellis brand needs to speak to younger men, according to the most recent Fashion Brand Index survey conducted by Brand Keys, a brand and customer-loyalty consulting company.
''It went from being a resonant brand to a classic brand to an old brand,'' said Robert Passikoff, president at Brand Keys in New York, adding that it did not finish among the top 15 men's clothing brands in the survey.
However, there is precedent for a makeover of a venerable apparel brand to succeed, Mr. Passikoff said, citing how Brooks Brothers, also once outside the top 15, is now in ninth place on the survey.
There was no consideration given to changing the Perry Ellis brand name because research by Perry Ellis International found there were still valuable aspects to the brand and its ties to Mr. Ellis.
''We looked for inspiration in Perry himself,'' said Stephen Niedzwiecki, co-founder and chief creative officer at Yard, and focused on the fact that ''in his short life he had a serious impact on the industry by not taking it all that seriously.''
''Along with his distinctive style and approach to life,'' Mr. Niedzwiecki said, ''he left a legacy of levity.'' That attitude could be appealing, said Ruth Bernstein, co-founder and chief strategic officer at Yard, to men who ''care about style but don't take fashion so seriously.''
The print ads try to display that insouciant spirit. In addition to the ad with the hole puncher, there is one with a younger man sporting an oversize bow tie made of paper and a satisfied expression.
In a third ad, a younger man wears a giant flower in his lapel and a dog leans in from the right side of the page as if interrupting the photo shoot. Some ads have a single polka dot; others have a lot.
''The dot is an optimistic shape we can play with,'' said another recent arrival at Perry Ellis International, Matt Cronin, vice president of marketing for the Perry Ellis brand, and is supposed to symbolize ''a fun, whimsical attitude.''
A goal of the campaign is to attract men ages 26 to 35 to the brand, he added, to join customers who ''right now are 45.''
To help accomplish that, the campaign will have a major presence in social media like Facebook and Twitter. The ads will also run in publications like Esquire, GQ, The New York Times, Out and WWD Men's Week and appear on signs in Los Angeles and New York.
In its attempts to revitalize the Perry Ellis brand, Perry Ellis International confronts an uncertain economy that has lately meant mixed results for department stores. That is the primary retail outlet for the brand, in chains like Dillard's, Lord & Taylor and Macy's.
''At retail, there's not a lot of growth,'' Mr. Petruzello acknowledged. ''Opportunities are more a matter of gaining market share. It's out there to be had.''
Now that is as optimistic as a parade of polka dots.

HEADLINE: Tales of Pain and Healing, From a Physician Who Knows Both

BYLINE: By ANEMONA HARTOCOLLIS

 BODY:
''This is where Tanisha came, all the way from Brooklyn,'' Dr. Eric Manheimer said, pointing to a forbiddingly cold stone doorway, as he walked around his old haunts at Bellevue, the nation's oldest and probably most famous public hospital, the other day.
''It was the dead of winter,'' he went on. Tanisha, a teenage foster child, walked across the Williamsburg Bridge to an intake center next to Bellevue to avoid being raped again in the home where she had been placed. She knew the city hospital would have to take her. ''She had to come here and get admitted to save her life.''
Most New Yorkers associate Bellevue Hospital Center with the criminally insane, and indeed, it is the place where prisoners in shackles and orange coveralls are sent for treatment. But Dr. Manheimer, 63, sees it as a refuge, a place where those who fear they have exhausted all their options in life often find hope and a last chance at redemption.
Tanisha is one of the 12 patients whose stories Dr. Manheimer, Bellevue's medical director for 15 years, tells in his first book, ''Twelve Patients: Life and Death at Bellevue Hospital,'' which was released this week by Grand Central Publishing. 
He recounted how he came to identify with his patients not just as their doctor, but as one of them -- he is, in fact, one of the 12 in the book. His discovery that he had throat cancer makes for one of the more poignant and harrowing chapters of the book.
He found that being a patient is lonely. A Hannibal Lecter-type mask was fitted to his face and bolted to a metal table below him to deliver radiation treatment. ''You're aware of life going on around you and you're just there, by yourself,'' Dr. Manheimer said.
In between treatments, the mask, labeled MANHEIMER, E., hung on a shelf along with dozens of others, ''like fencing masks.'' (He was treated at NYU Langone Medical Center, Bellevue's private sister hospital, because, he says, he did not want to be surrounded by people who knew him.)
The night before his first treatment, his son's wife went into labor with his first grandchild, at Bellevue. With a tinge of regret, he describes how he was so consumed by his own illness that he had to go home before the baby was born. Seven weeks later, miserable from the treatment, he wanted to discontinue it and allow himself to die. ''It was like gradually going into a black hole and going further and further away from everybody around you,'' he said.
His wife insisted that he go on, and saved his life.
To all appearances he is back to normal. But the platinum used in his cancer treatment has made it harder to hear and the radiation has restricted his swallowing. ''It feels like a dog's leash around your neck all the time,'' he said. At lunch, he only nibbles at his chicken and refuses dessert.
Dr. Manheimer said he had always been fascinated by the personal stories of his patients, and wrote them down, at first just for himself.
''I always have these,'' he said, pulling a notebook from his pocket as he walked Bellevue, leading a tour of the sites described in his book. ''I have 100 of these for 15 years. So when I wrote my book, I just ransacked my notebooks.''
Tanisha, like the names of other patients in the book, is a pseudonym. In an afterword, Dr. Manheimer wrote that he disguised the identities of his subjects while leaving intact the ''essential details.'' In an interview, he said that he had changed names and sometimes ages and addresses to protect vulnerable patients, including a ''high profile'' wealthy drug addict, but that they were not composites.
He grew up the son of an internist, in the Bronx, and recalled driving around with his father, Robert, as he made house calls. The family Peugeot was rigged with a spotlight to scout out house numbers on dark streets.
''We lived in back of his office,'' he said the other day. ''The kitchen was a lab. You'd have your toaster and your centrifuge.''
As a teenager, he took odd jobs at Montefiore Medical Center in the Bronx, from shaving patients before their operations to answering the phone and running errands in the urology ward. After graduating from medical school at SUNY Downstate Medical Center in Brooklyn, he became a doctor at Dartmouth Hitchcock-Medical Center in New Hampshire before returning to New York and taking a job at Bellevue.
His wife, Diana Taylor, a professor of performance studies and Spanish at New York University, grew up in Mexico, where her father was a mining engineer. The couple has a house near Cuernavaca, and Dr. Manheimer speaks fluent Spanish.
Walking through the 10th-floor intensive care unit, the soft beeping of monitors in the air, he points and says: ''The patient I took to Mexico was in this bed right here.''
The patient, another character in his book, was an illegal immigrant with rampant squamous cell cancer, and his last wish was to go home to his family in Mexico, a half-hour's drive from the Manheimer home. Dr. Manheimer used Bellevue's connections with the Mexican consulate to arrange the trip, then flew back with the patient to make sure everything went well.
When they got there, Ms. Taylor bought everyone ice cream, in a flavor called beso de angel, kiss of the angel.
''I broke every rule at Bellevue to take care of them,'' Dr. Manheimer said of his patients.
In the book, most of the patients' stories are accompanied by brief journeys into political or social commentary on subjects like the North American Free Trade Agreement, mental illness and immigration policy. ''This was a man and his wife trying to gain a millimeter toehold on a brutal economic ladder that was created by political and economic forces beyond their control,'' he wrote of the Mexican patient.
A few months ago, he left Bellevue for NYU Langone Medical Center, where he is working on reducing costs and improving quality and safety. He said felt depleted by the constant air of fiscal crisis in the public hospital system. ''It was time to dial down,'' he said.
In the I.C.U. during his recent visit, the nurses greet him, surprised to see him back.
''You couldn't stay away?'' one asks.
''I'm like a bad drug addict,'' Dr. Manheimer replies, grinning.
''We're trying to survive another July,'' the nurse says.
Dr. Manheimer understands the code. July is when the new interns, straight out of medical school, show up. Ever the medical director, he has a few parting words of advice: ''Do not get sick in July.''

HEADLINE: Split Among House Republicans Over How Deeply to Cut May Delay Farm Bill

BYLINE: By RON NIXON

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- The first major overhaul of the nation's nutrition and farm program is in jeopardy because of a split in the ranks of House Republicans over the degree of spending cuts, pitting conservatives who want deeper cuts against moderates and Democrats who think the bill goes far enough at a time of weak economic growth.
After a late-night drafting session that ended early Thursday, the House Agriculture Committee easily approved a farm bill but House Republican leaders, fearing a divisive and messy intraparty floor fight, may want to hold off a floor vote until after the November elections to avoid being portrayed by conservatives as big government spenders who approved $969 billion in outlays over 10 years, and by liberals as the party that wants to virtually gut school lunch and food stamp programs. 
The bill was not listed in the most recent summer legislative agenda sent out in May by Eric Cantor, the house majority leader and a Republican of Virginia. On Thursday, Speaker John A. Boehner, Republican of Ohio, said, ''No decisions have been made at this point.''
The bill cuts projected spending in farm and nutrition programs by $35 billion over the next 10 years. The Senate passed a similar bill last month, cutting spending by $23 billion. Like the Senate version of the farm bill, the House bill would eliminate direct payments to farmers, which are made annually whether they grow crops or not.
Currently, farmers who grow corn, wheat, soybeans, cotton and other crops receive about $5 billion in direct payments. The payments have become harder to justify as farm income has risen to historic levels -- a record $101 billion last year, according to the Agriculture Department. Billions of dollars saved by eliminating direct payments would be directed into other subsidy programs, including crop insurance and new subsidies for peanut, cotton and rice farmers.
Drafting the House bill in committee on Wednesday night attracted a hodgepodge of competing interests -- sugar and dairy producers; peanut farmers; nutrition and antihunger groups -- who crowded the committee room and an overflow room in support of special provisions in the bill.
Sugar producers scored big when the House basically left the sugar program alone, which kept restrictions on imports intact. Peanut and cotton farmers, who felt they were left out of the Senate farm bill, received new revenue insurance subsidies in the House version thanks to an aggressive lobbying campaign and backing from Southern lawmakers. Maple syrup producers in Vermont and New York received grants promoting the industry. In total, agriculture interests spent nearly $116 million lobbying this year on the farm bill and other issues.
The House bill passed the committee with strong bipartisan support but exposed a division in the Republican ranks over the size of cuts to the food stamp program, which has long been a target of conservatives.
''I don't think the leadership and many of the freshman Republicans who ran on cutting spending want to pass a nearly trillion-dollar bill this close to an election,'' said Steve Ellis, vice president for Taxpayers for Common Sense, a budget watchdog group.
On more than a few committee votes, Representative Frank D. Lucas, the Oklahoma Republican who is chairman of the committee, sided with Democrats and a few Republicans in defeating amendments to cut food stamps even more deeply, including one by Representative Tim Huelskamp, Republican of Kansas, that would have doubled the cuts in food stamps to $33 billion. Much of the savings in the House farm bill comes from cutting food stamps.
The food stamp program would take a $16.5 billion cut over the next 10 years. The bill also makes changes to eligibility requirements, and the Congressional Budget Office said two million to three million people would lose their food stamp benefits. Nearly 300,000 children would also be ineligible for the free lunch program under the new bill, the budget office found. Farm programs are not spared. If Congress does not pass a farm bill by Sept. 30, more than 100 farm programs would expire.
Still, Patrick Westhoff, professor of agriculture at the University of Missouri and director of the Food and Agriculture Policy Research Institute there, said it was not unusual for a farm bill to be delayed.
In recent decades, he said, only one farm law, in 2002, passed on time.
''Its not a major crisis if they don't get it passed by September 30,'' Mr. Westhoff said. ''They could always extend it for a few months.''
Perhaps anticipating the problem of getting a farm bill through Congress, some lawmakers had already mentioned an extension as a possibility.
In an interview with AgriTalk, an agriculture radio program, Mr. Lucas said an extension of the 2008 farm bill was a possibility if Congress did not pass a new bill.
''I can't have my producers, my fellow farmers and ranchers, caught in a twilight zone between the old farm bill and the new farm bill,'' Mr. Lucas said.
The agriculture industry representatives say they would like to have a farm bill done before the elections, but they are prepared for a possible extension.
''But even if we get an extension there is the uncertainty about what to grow, when to grow and under what programs,'' said Dean Norton, president of the New York Farm Bureau and a national Farm Bureau board member. ''Uncertainty is a big negative in the agriculture industry.''

HEADLINE: Bankruptcy In California Is Not Seen As a Trend

BYLINE: By MARY WILLIAMS WALSH

 BODY:
As San Bernardino, Calif., moved toward bankruptcy this week, municipal bond analysts were questioning how widespread the fiscal distress may prove to be, but were not predicting a wave of defaults.
San Bernardino's vote to authorize a bankruptcy filing came after filings this summer by the California cities of Stockton and Mammoth Lakes. Those cities were following Vallejo, which emerged from bankruptcy in 2011, after a three-year struggle to reduce its debts to investors, retirees and others.
''I don't believe that this is the beginning of a tidal wave of insolvency across the country,'' said Richard P. Larkin, director of credit analysis at the underwriting firm H. J. Sims. ''I am worried, however, that this phenomenon may grow in California.'' 
Over all, investors in municipal debt showed little sign of concern about the woes of either California or any other states. On Thursday the interest rate on the highest-quality 30-year municipal bonds fell below 3 percent for the first time ever, according to Daniel Berger, a senior market strategist at Municipal Market Data.
The nation's municipal bond market is ''still viewed very much as a safe haven for investors scared about the events unfolding in Europe,'' he said.
He said yields on California's 30-year bonds, now at 4.01 percent, had also fallen this year, although they did not enjoy the highest ratings.
Heavy burdens of bond debt are not always the main cause of municipal bankruptcy -- the rising cost of pensions and health care can also be major factors. But whether or not bonds are the trigger, they can be treated very differently under federal bankruptcy law than under the state laws that normally govern their issuance. General obligation bonds, for instance, are normally a city's best credit, but they can become unsecured credit in municipal bankruptcy.
The question of whether municipal bonds pose hidden risk flared up two years ago, when a noted securities analyst, Meredith Whitney, appeared on the television show ''60 Minutes'' and predicted hundreds of municipal defaults within the next year. Although her prediction did not come true, it caused a major sell-off of municipal bonds that continued for months. Lately, investors have been returning to the market, and this week traders said they saw only scattered signs that small investors were dumping San Bernardino's debt after its announcement.
Still, if more municipal bankruptcies are in store, chances are that at least some of them will be in California. Chapter 9 municipal bankruptcies are extremely rare, and large ones are almost nonexistent. Of the 641 cases that have been filed since 1937, most have involved relatively small municipal utilities, special-purpose districts and public hospital systems -- not big, complicated cities or counties with lots of people and debts.
Within that rarefied group, most have been cities and counties in California.
''Municipalities operate with a lot of autonomy in home-rule states such as California, and that autonomy leads to the freedom to get into trouble,'' analysts for Trident Municipal Research said in a report issued Wednesday.
The firm cited the kind of fiscal mismanagement that brought Stockton and San Bernardino to the brink, among other factors. But California's biggest risk may be the lasting effect of Proposition 13, the 1978 ballot initiative that drastically lowered property taxes and has made them difficult to increase since then. There is no equivalent check on the cost of operating a municipal government, so many California cities and counties are increasingly caught in a painful squeeze between their limited revenue and their rising fixed costs -- especially labor costs.
Many operate pension plans that relied on steady investment gains that have evaporated in recent years and now have no way to replace the lost money.
Trident's analysts suggested that San Jose might be one of the next California cities to seek refuge in bankruptcy court; its mayor has been outspoken about the need to reduce pension costs.
California lawmakers, sensing trouble ahead, passed a law this year making it harder for cities to declare bankruptcy. In doing so, however, they may have given the most distressed cities a road map to Chapter 9, by requiring cities considering bankruptcy to first go through a 60-day mediation session with their creditors.
San Bernardino was so intent on seeking shelter in bankruptcy that it said it wanted to avoid the mediation requirement. The new law has an exemption for cities that have declared fiscal emergencies, which San Bernardino has done several times.
The state also increased the fiscal pressure on cities earlier this year when it closed some 400 special redevelopment authorities and seized billions of dollars in property tax money that their host cities had previously controlled.
''San Bernardino estimates that this year they expect to lose $6 million'' as a result, said Mr. Larkin, of H. J. Sims. ''By itself, it wouldn't have caused bankruptcy, but when you add that to the city's overspending, it made a bad situation worse.''
James E. Spiotto, a Chapter 9 bankruptcy specialist at the law firm of Chapman & Cutler in Chicago, said the developments in California might not be a trend. But he sees them as a signal to other states to get ready to intervene in the affairs of their most troubled cities.
''When you let the problem go too long, there's no ready solution,'' he said. ''It's like working with a melting ice cube.''
Correction: July 20, 2012, Friday
This article has been revised to reflect the following correction: An article last Friday about the effect municipal bankruptcies in California have had on investor perceptions of the state's bonds misstated the interest that Daniel Berger of Municipal Market Data said California's 30-year bonds were paying. It was 4.01 percent, not 4.58 percent. (The higher figure was the interest given by Bloomberg L.P.)

HEADLINE: Internal Failures Disclosed At HSBC

BYLINE: By LANDON THOMAS JR. and MARK SCOTT

 BODY:
8:58 p.m. Updated
LONDON - HSBC, the largest financial institution in Europe, has become the latest British bank to reveal major internal-control problems, saying that senior officials would apologize to United States lawmakers next week for not cracking down soon enough on money-laundering activities in America.
The money laundering, which a United States Senate subcommittee indicates was linked to terrorism and drug deals, could result in HSBC paying fines of up to $1 billion, according to analysts. 
''Our anti-money-laundering controls should have been stronger and more effective, and we failed to spot and deal with unacceptable behavior,'' Stuart T. Gulliver, the chief executive of HSBC, wrote in a memo that became widely circulated after it was released to employees late Wednesday.
HSBC said Thursday that it would have no further comment before a hearing Tuesday in Washington.
The admission by HSBC, long seen as one of the more conservatively run and trustworthy of the financial giants based in London, came at an awkward time for the bank. It is under new management since the period when the money laundering occurred, from 2004 to 2010, and it has shifted corporate focus to fast-growing markets in Asia, which accounted for the bulk of its $16.8 billion in profit last year.
HSBC can distance itself from the money-laundering episode by chalking it up to the previous management. But the bank, along with more than a dozen financial institutions, also faces scrutiny by regulators on both sides of the Atlantic for any role the companies might have played in an the interest-rate manipulation scandal that has embroiled Barclays, a main HSBC competitor.
One big HSBC investor, who was not authorized to speak publicly, said that while it was a serious lapse not to have caught customer money laundering sooner, it did not necessarily indicate a deeper ethical problem within the bank.
That investor plans to closely follow developments to see what role - if any - the bank played in trying to manipulate key interest rates, including the London interbank offered rate, or Libor. If any issues arise, it could lead to more political pressure and damaging lawsuits, especially in London.
''We do not think there is a culture of money laundering at HSBC,'' the investor said. ''Management overlooked it but will fix it. But Libor is different.''
Adding another political wrinkle: HSBC's former chairman, Stephen Green, who was in office from 2006 to 2010 when many of the money-laundering detection problems occurred, is currently the trade minister in Prime Minister David Cameron's government. Mr. Green's office did not reply to a request for comment on Thursday.
Shares of HSBC fell more than 2 percent Thursday in London.
British politicians and regulators are in the middle of an inquiry into the banking practices of Barclays in the Libor scandal, for which the company has already agreed to pay fines in Britain and the United States of $450 million.
A broader investigation into the conduct and practices of all banks operating in Britain is likely to follow, and regulators in the United States are conducting their own wider sweep.
In the case of the money laundering, the United States authorities have been examining HSBC for several years. On Tuesday, officials from the bank are set to testify in Washington before the Senate Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations.
A subcommittee spokesman declined on Thursday to discuss the investigation, but the panel's Web site describes the agenda as ''a hearing on the money laundering and terrorist financing vulnerabilities created when a global bank uses its U.S. affiliate to provide U.S. dollars, U.S. dollar services, and access to the U.S. financial system to high risk affiliates, high risk correspondent banks, and high risk clients, using HSBC as a case study.''
Mr. Gulliver, HSBC's chief executive, is not expected to testify.
In his memo to employees, Mr. Gulliver said that since 2010, the bank has doubled its annual spending on regulatory compliance to $400 million, and now has about 3,500 people worldwide working on compliance - more than 1,000 of them in the United States. Over all, HSBC has about 295,000 employees.
Ian Gordon, a bank analyst at Investec in London, said Thursday that for HSBC, the money laundering ''is an historic issue and I don't think there will be any material repercussions in terms of civil liability.''
But Mr. Gordon is among those who note that HSBC's bigger issue in the near future is the Libor investigation.
At HSBC, unlike Barclays, profits come mainly from a mix of consumer and corporate businesses in Asia. Investment banking, which makes up as much as 70 percent of Barclays's profit, accounts for less than a third of HSBC's bottom line.
Mr. Gulliver is a recent appointee to the top spot at the bank, taking over in early 2011, and he has been vocal in shifting focus toward Asia - where he spends a large amount of his time - and away from slower growth developed markets.
Although he has an investment banking background, Mr. Gulliver is a low-key British national who has spent much of his career out of the public eye in Asia. Consequently, he is a less controversial public figure than Robert E. Diamond Jr., the recently ousted Barclays chief, whom the former British business minister, Peter Mandelson, once referred to as the ''unacceptable face'' of London banking.
In a recent report, analysts at Morgan Stanley estimated that the possible litigation exposure for the industry at large from the Libor fallout could be as much as $6 billion. That figure, while involving significant guesswork, was calculated on the basis of the potential profits a bank could have made by benefiting from a lower interest rate.
According to Morgan Stanley's calculations, HSBC's potential penalty if found culpable in the Libor investigation would be $348 million, which translates into a 1 percent earnings per share hit for 2013. The bank that would suffer the most was Royal Bank of Scotland, the Morgan Stanley analysts said, with possible legal exposure of $1 billion.
Neil Gough contributed reporting from Hong Kong.

Online Correction: July 12, 2012, Thursday
This article has been revised to reflect the following correction: An earlier version of this article referred incorrectly to the Congressional panel that will hold a hearing on money laundering next week. It is the Senate Permanent Subcommittee (not Committee) on Investigations.

HEADLINE: Who's Very Important?

BYLINE: By PAUL KRUGMAN

 BODY:
''Is there a V.I.P. entrance? We are V.I.P.'' That remark, by a donor waiting to get in to one of Mitt Romney's recent fund-raisers in the Hamptons, pretty much sums up the attitude of America's wealthy elite. Mr. Romney's base -- never mind the top 1 percent, we're talking about the top 0.01 percent or higher -- is composed of very self-important people.
Specifically, these are people who believe that they are, as another Romney donor put it, ''the engine of the economy''; they should be cherished, and the taxes they pay, which are already at an 80-year low, should be cut even further. Unfortunately, said yet another donor, the ''common person'' -- for example, the ''nails ladies'' -- just doesn't get it. 
O.K., it's easy to mock these people, but the joke's really on us. For the ''we are V.I.P.'' crowd has fully captured the modern Republican Party, to such an extent that leading Republicans consider Mr. Romney's apparent use of multimillion-dollar offshore accounts to dodge federal taxes not just acceptable but praiseworthy: ''It's really American to avoid paying taxes, legally,'' declared Senator Lindsey Graham, Republican of South Carolina. And there is, of course, a good chance that Republicans will control both Congress and the White House next year.
If that happens, we'll see a sharp turn toward economic policies based on the proposition that we need to be especially solicitous toward the superrich -- I'm sorry, I mean the ''job creators.'' So it's important to understand why that's wrong.
The first thing you need to know is that America wasn't always like this. When John F. Kennedy was elected president, the top 0.01 percent was only about a quarter as rich compared with the typical family as it is now -- and members of that class paid much higher taxes than they do today. Yet somehow we managed to have a dynamic, innovative economy that was the envy of the world. The superrich may imagine that their wealth makes the world go round, but history says otherwise.
To this historical observation we should add another note: quite a few of today's superrich, Mr. Romney included, make or made their money in the financial sector, buying and selling assets rather than building businesses in the old-fashioned sense. Indeed, the soaring share of the wealthy in national income went hand in hand with the explosive growth of Wall Street.
Not long ago, we were told that all this wheeling and dealing was good for everyone, that it was making the economy both more efficient and more stable. Instead, it turned out that modern finance was laying the foundation for a severe economic crisis whose fallout continues to afflict millions of Americans, and that taxpayers had to bail out many of those supposedly brilliant bankers to prevent an even worse crisis. So at least some members of the top 0.01 percent are best viewed as job destroyers rather than job creators.
Did I mention that those bailed-out bankers are now overwhelmingly backing Mr. Romney, who promises to reverse the mild financial reforms introduced after the crisis?
To be sure, many and probably most of the rich do, in fact, contribute positively to the economy. However, they also receive large monetary rewards. Yet somehow $20 million-plus in annual income isn't enough. They want to be revered, too, and given special treatment in the form of low taxes. And that is more than they deserve. After all, the ''common person'' also makes a positive contribution to the economy. Why single out the rich for extra praise and perks?
What about the argument that we must keep taxes on the rich low lest we remove their incentive to create wealth? The answer is that we have a lot of historical evidence, going all the way back to the 1920s, on the effects of tax increases on the rich, and none of it supports the view that the kinds of tax-rate changes for the rich currently on the table -- President Obama's proposal for a modest rise, Mr. Romney's call for further cuts -- would have any major effect on incentives. Remember when all the usual suspects claimed that the economy would crash when Bill Clinton raised taxes in 1993?
Furthermore, if you're really concerned about the incentive effects of public policy, you should be focused not on the rich but on workers making $20,000 to $30,000 a year, who are often penalized for any gain in income because they end up losing means-tested benefits like Medicaid and food stamps. I'll have more to say about that in another column. By the way, in 2010, the average annual wage of manicurists -- ''nails ladies,'' in Romney-donor speak -- was $21,760.
So, are the very rich V.I.P.? No, they aren't -- at least no more so than other working Americans. And the ''common person'' will be hurt, not helped, if we end up with government of the 0.01 percent, by the 0.01 percent, for the 0.01 percent.

HEADLINE: Candidates Racing for Future, Gaze Fixed Firmly on the Past

BYLINE: By PETER BAKER

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- President Obama's re-election slogan is ''Forward.'' But the campaigns he and Mitt Romney are waging these days might be more accurately described as ''Backward.''
At a time when the country faces an uncertain future economically and internationally, the conversation in the capital and on the campaign trail has dwelled largely on the past as the two contenders for the White House and their allies spend their time and energy relitigating old fights rather than focusing on new ideas for the next four years.
Mr. Obama's campaign on Thursday hammered Mr. Romney over business deals from the turn of the century, just days after the president summoned supporters to the East Room for the latest salvo over tax cuts enacted by his predecessor a decade ago. Mr. Romney's Republican supporters in Congress countered by voting in the House to repeal Mr. Obama's two-year-old health care program and by trying to force a Senate vote on President George W. Bush's tax cuts. 
''It's just rearguing and rearguing and rearguing,'' said Mickey Edwards, a former Republican congressman from Oklahoma and author of a book to be published next month about what he sees as the current dysfunction in American politics and governance. ''In most elections, especially for president, what you get is: Here is my vision, here's where I'm going to take the country. And there's none of it.''
Some of that may reflect the still-early stage of a campaign in which each side, fueled by ''super PAC'' money, is trying to define the other by arguing that past is prologue. But it also underscores the austere backdrop of the campaign. With federal debt rising, the economy sputtering and partisan divisions polarizing the capital, there is less room or appetite for the sorts of sweeping initiatives offered by previous presidents and challengers.
Any broad agenda a candidate could advance on the campaign trail this year might be unrealistic or involve pain for various constituencies. Mr. Obama's promises from 2008 to tackle climate change and immigration seem no more likely to succeed in a second term than they did in the first. And reining in government spending as Mr. Romney promises to do will involve potentially ox-goring choices that alienate certain voters.
That's not to say that Mr. Obama and Mr. Romney have not endorsed specific measures for the next term. Mr. Obama can point to budget proposals that outline in wrenching detail ideas for Medicare, military spending and so on, while Mr. Romney has issued position papers and embraced a controversial budget plan by Representative Paul D. Ryan, the Wisconsin Republican who leads the Budget Committee. And certainly the Bush-era tax cuts and Mr. Obama's health care program are important to the future.
But Mr. Obama and Mr. Romney are not proposing a comprehensive new tax code or a replacement health care system so much as a return to an earlier state. And to the extent they do have specific new ideas, the candidates tend not to emphasize them in stump speeches and they get little attention in the television advertisements and the nonstop flood of e-mailed statements issued by rival campaign headquarters in Chicago and Boston, as demonstrated once again on Thursday by the Obama campaign's relentless assault on Mr. Romney's tenure at Bain Capital.
''Romney wants to make this a referendum on Obama's last four years while Obama wants to make it a referendum on Romney's last 14 years,'' said John Feehery, a longtime Republican strategist. ''There are no easy choices to make looking forward, so both campaigns are probably more comfortable relitigating the past.''
Jim Jordan, a Democratic strategist who managed Senator John F. Kerry's presidential campaign in 2004, said the candidates were reflecting the electorate. ''It really does feel like 'retrenchment' is the watchword of the cycle,'' he said. ''Some combination, I guess, of the national mood of resignation and fatigue, the probably incorrect poll-driven perception that voters only want to hear about the economy, where each party long ago dug its trench, and the amazing timidity of the Romney campaign.''
Often obscured by the focus on the past, the candidates' messages for the future boil down to these: Mr. Obama vows to preserve and continue what he has been doing, arguing that his policies need more time to fully restore a troubled country. Mr. Romney essentially applies the same formula he recently did to Israel policy, about which he said ''you can just look at the things the president has done and do the opposite.''
Each of the campaigns, of course, blames the other for the focus. ''The discussion of the past in part is because that's all the Romney campaign talks about and because Romney's approach to the economy is completely derivative of what was tried in the last decade,'' said David Axelrod, the Obama campaign's senior adviser. Kevin Madden, a Romney adviser, said Mr. Obama ''has actually ceded the future argument in the campaign'' and is ''telling you the No. 1 issue Americans need to concern yourself with is the arrangement for how Romney left his private sector business in 1999.''
The consequence of that, though, may be a victor who wakes up the morning after Election Day without much of a mandate. Mr. Bush discovered that after the 2004 election when he opened his second term with a plan to restructure Social Security by allowing younger workers to divert some of their payroll taxes to investment accounts. While he had long supported such a move, it was not the centerpiece of his campaign speeches and the idea went nowhere.
Mr. Obama, for his part, did talk about big ideas for the future in 2008 and arguably did have a mandate for some of them. Yet he found that despite his election victory, the health care plan he passed did not enjoy public support and his plans to curb greenhouse gases and liberalize immigration rules had little traction in Congress. Now he promises to keep pursuing the same goals, but they do not seem to be motivating core supporters as much as attacks on his opponent.
''Perhaps in part because neither candidate is a classic populist, both camps are conspicuously reigniting old grievances to generate enthusiasm among their bases,'' said Paul Bledsoe, a senior adviser at the Bipartisan Policy Center, a Washington advocacy organization. ''Once they have voter attention this way, they seem to hope their more positive messages can then at least get a hearing from a notably wary electorate.''
In effect, then, the campaigns may be laying the groundwork for the conversation after Labor Day. ''In a larger sense, the focus on the past records of the candidates is prologue to the fundamental debate about the future we inevitably will be having in the fall,'' said Geoff Garin, a Democratic pollster working with Priorities USA Action, a super PAC supporting Mr. Obama.
Which comes back around to that Obama slogan, ''Forward.'' That's ''Forward.'' with a period. The campaign says that's for emphasis. But it is not an exclamation point. Perhaps after such high-flying talk in 2008, this is a president trying to temper expectations for the future.

HEADLINE: The Ad Agency Dentsu To Buy Aegis for $5 Billion

BYLINE: By ERIC PFANNER

 BODY:
9:05 a.m. Updated
Dentsu, a Japanese advertising powerhouse that has struggled to expand internationally, made a big leap into Western markets on Thursday, saying it had agreed to buy Aegis, an agency company based in London.
The planned acquisition, valued at $:3.167 billion ($4.92 billion), is one of the largest ever in the advertising business, rivaling the purchase of Young & Rubicam by the WPP 12 years ago and a deal for the parent company of Leo Burnett by Publicis Groupe in 2002.
The deal would combine Dentsu, the fifth-largest advertising company in the world, with the seventh largest. Aegis specializes in media buying, a steady source of earnings, and fast-growing digital marketing, leaving slower-growing businesses like the creation of television advertising to other agencies. 
Aegis owns the media buying agency Carat, which counts General Motors among its clients, as well as a digital ad specialist, Isobar, and other agencies. It is strongest in Europe and has a significant presence in North America.
Dentsu, while dominant in Japan, has tended to rely on partnerships abroad, rather than operating through its own agencies.
''This is really about building Dentsu outside Japan,'' said Ian Whittaker, an analyst at Liberum Capital. ''Buying Aegis gives them a good platform. It gives them a high-quality asset that, operationally, has been doing very well.''
International expansion is critical, because the Japanese ad market has been shrinking in recent years. Dentsu this year acquired a boutique agency in New York, ML Rogers, and Bos, with offices in Toronto and Montreal. The deal for Aegis accelerates that the international push, which has been led by a former professional basketball player, Tim Andree.
''By forming the first communications group with true global reach, the growth strategies of both businesses will be enhanced as we provide more scale, geography, capability and investment to support clients,'' Jerry Buhlmann, chief executive of Aegis, said in a statement.
Merger and acquisition activity has been accelerating in the advertising business, which has weathered the global financial and economic crisis better than some other media industries. Last month, WPP, the world's biggest advertising company, agreed to buy control of AKQA, a digital agency, in a deal valuing it at $540 million. This month, Publicis agreed to buy the 51 percent of BBH that it did not already own.
There had been speculation that Dentsu would make a move since it ended a nine-year alliance with Publicis, the third-largest agency company after WPP and the Omnicom Group, in February. To unwind that partnership, Publicis bought back a 9 percent stake in Dentsu, giving the Japanese agency additional financial resources for acquisitions.
Still, the deal with Aegis was something of a surprise. The French investor Vincent Bollore owns a 26.4 percent stake in the company, and is also the biggest shareholder in another advertising company, Havas. Many analysts had assumed that at some point Mr. Bollore might try to link Havas and Aegis more directly.
Instead, Mr. Bollore agreed to sell most of his stake to Dentsu at the offer price of 240 pence a share, 48 percent above the closing price of the stock on Wednesday. Mr. Bollore bought his Aegis stake at an average price of 123 pence a share, meaning he nearly doubled his investment.
''He's reinforced his reputation as someone who knows how to make money,'' Mr. Whittaker said.
But the deal raises questions over Mr. Bollore's other advertising investment. He has been shuffling his media portfolio of late, investing in Vivendi, the French conglomerate that owns Universal Music Group and a variety of other assets.
''For Havas, given it is 30 percent owned by Bollore and this deal leaves it as the remaining smaller global agency network, this may be viewed as the next potential target in the global agency space,'' analysts at Citigroup wrote in a note to clients.
While Aegis has been considered an attractive takeover target, analysts said a flurry of recent acquisitions by companies like WPP and Publicis made it less likely that counterbids to Dentsu's offer might emerge.
''Most other would-be acquirers have been active on other deal flow in recent weeks, so may not have the balance sheet capability to get involved,'' Alex DeGroote, an analyst at Panmure, wrote in a note to investors.

HEADLINE: Accusing Obama of Untruths Over Outsourcing

BYLINE: By TRIP GABRIEL

 BODY:
Mitt Romney's campaign released a blistering television advertisement on Thursday accusing President Obama of dishonesty in recent attacks on Mr. Romney. It also has a somewhat off-topic cameo by Hillary Rodham Clinton in which she scolds Mr. Obama during the 2008 Democratic primary race. The ad is the latest to reach the depths of nastiness that have characterized the presidential contest. 
THE SCRIPT ''When a president doesn't tell the truth, how can we trust him to lead? The Obama outsourcing attacks: 'misleading, unfair and untrue.' There was 'no evidence' that Mitt Romney shipped jobs overseas. Candidate Obama lied about Hillary Clinton. 'So shame on you, Barack Obama.' But America expects more from a president. Obama's dishonest campaign: another reason America has lost confidence in Barack Obama.''
ON SCREEN The first lines appear over grainy video of Mr. Obama speaking. Images of The Washington Post and of the Web site FactCheck.org appear behind quoted text. There is a video clip of Mrs. Clinton berating Mr. Obama in the heat of their 2008 primary race. The ad ends with Mr. Obama in rolled-up shirt sleeves mouthing words with no sound.
ACCURACY The ad, titled ''No Evidence,'' is the latest in an increasingly personal dispute between the campaigns over Mr. Romney's record at Bain Capital, the private equity firm he founded. The president has attacked Mr. Romney as an ''outsourcing pioneer'' because of investments he made at Bain, and an Obama campaign ad last month asked if Americans wanted an ''outsourcer in chief.''
The Romney ad quotes, correctly, a fact-checking column in The Post that was highly skeptical of the Obama ad. But the column appeared before a news article in The Post on June 21 that took a deeper look at Bain and identified companies that the firm had invested in that helped other companies move call centers and manufacturing overseas.
The Romney ad cites a second fact-checking column, by FactCheck.org, that found ''no evidence'' that Mr. Romney sent American jobs overseas while he was running Bain. That conclusion was based in part on the fact that Mr. Romney left Bain in 1999 to run the Salt Lake City Olympics, before two companies that Bain invested in moved work from the United States to Mexico, in 2000 and 2001.
On Thursday, that timeline was thrown into question by a report in The Boston Globe that securities filings named Mr. Romney as the owner, president and chief executive of Bain during the period. It is unclear whether he made hands-on decisions during that time.
SCORECARD The two campaigns are entrenched in hand-to-hand combat over details and the significance of Mr. Romney's years at Bain, which is the source of his personal wealth and his top credential in billing himself as a leader capable of improving the economy. The Obama campaign has barraged Mr. Romney on his Bain record, to the point of distorting some facts. But it is unlikely to call off the assault, which some polls show has persuaded a slice of voters in swing states to doubt Mr. Romney.

HEADLINE: Asian Leaders at Regional Meeting Fail to Resolve Disputes Over South China Sea

BYLINE: By JANE PERLEZ; Bree Feng contributed research.

 BODY:
PHNOM PENH, Cambodia -- Disputes in the strategically important South China Sea proved so contentious here on Thursday that an annual regional gathering ended without even a basic diplomatic communique, which appeared to have been blocked by China.
The host for the conference of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations, Cambodia, a close ally of China, refused to play the customary role of seeking agreement among the 10 participating countries, thus undermining the possibility of an accord, according to a senior diplomat from the association.
''China bought the chair, simple as that,'' said the diplomat, who declined to be identified publicly according to usual protocol. The diplomat pointed to an article on Thursday by China's state news agency, Xinhua, in which the country's foreign minister, Yang Jiechi, was quoted as thanking Cambodia's prime minister for supporting China's ''core interests.'' 
Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton, who met with foreign ministers at the conference of the Southeast Asian group, said in remarks clearly aimed at China that it was important that the disputes be resolved ''without coercion, without intimidation, without threats and without use of force.''
The influence of China, which was represented here by Mr. Yang, hung over the behind-the-scenes deliberations on the South China Sea in many respects, dividing countries that are beholden to China and those that are willing to stand up to the Chinese.
Cambodia receives large amounts of assistance from Beijing, including new military aid that it got a few months ago.
Indonesia, which has no territorial claims in the South China Sea, tried to forge a last-minute consensus at the meeting but without success. The Indonesian foreign minister, Marty Natalegawa, praised Mrs. Clinton for ''showing interest but giving space'' in the effort to reach an agreement.
Territorial disputes in the South China Sea have increased in the last several months between the Philippines and China, and between Vietnam and China. One conflict, which lasted for months, involved a standoff between lightly armed vessels belonging to China and to the Philippines at the Scarborough Shoal off the coast of the Philippines. Another dispute centered on a law enacted in Vietnam claiming sovereignty over the Paracel and Spratly Islands, which China also claims.
As the long-dominant United States and the fast-growing China both seek to increase their naval power in the Asia-Pacific region, the disputes have become more threatening.
China has repeatedly told American diplomats that the energy-rich South China Sea is none of Washington's business.
But the Obama administration has made clear that freedom of navigation is at stake in one of the world's most important bodies of water for commerce.
In her statement to the news media, Mrs. Clinton said, ''The United States is a resident Pacific power,'' a term intended to signal to China and the countries of the region that the United States is staying, and even increasing its presence.
''No nation can fail to be concerned by the increase in tensions, the uptick in confrontational rhetoric and disagreement over resource exploitation,'' Mrs. Clinton said.
''We have seen worrisome instances of economic coercion and the problematic use of military and government vessels in connection with disputes among fishermen,'' she said. The mention of economic coercion appeared to be a reference to China's decision to stop importing Philippine bananas and to clamp down on Chinese tourist groups.
China has made clear that it wants to deal with the South China Sea disputes with each country individually, and not through any regional forum. That stance has made the future of a code of conduct to resolve disputes in the South China Sea unclear.
Asian diplomats said Thursday that the main elements of a code of conduct, which the United States has urged the Southeast Asian group to adopt, had been agreed upon at this week's gathering. The diplomats declined to specify the content of the proposed code.
The spokesman for China's Ministry of Foreign Affairs has repeatedly said that China is willing to discuss a code of conduct only ''when conditions mature.''
Last Sunday, Mrs. Clinton began a tour of Asia that is intended to show that the administration's shift to that region reaches beyond military engagement.
The trip drew negative coverage in the Chinese press on Thursday. People's Daily wrote that a trade agreement that Washington is seeking, called the Trans-Pacific Partnership, which excludes China, was an effort to weaken Asian integration. China Business News referred to ''those hyping up the South China Sea issue,'' a veiled reference to the United States.
The meeting here was held in a white-pillared conference hall, called the Peace Palace, that was built for the occasion by the Chinese government. When a Cambodian reporter asked Mrs. Clinton about American assistance to Cambodia, she made a reference to the difference between Chinese aid and that provided by the United States.
''We can't point to a big building,'' she said, indicating that American aid was directed at feeding people in need, ensuring the survival of women who give birth and trying to improve people's lives, especially those of children.

HEADLINE: U.S. Pursuing A Middleman In Web Piracy

BYLINE: By SOMINI SENGUPTA

 BODY:
Richard O'Dwyer, an enterprising 24-year-old college student from northern England, has found himself in the middle of a fierce battle between two of America's great exports: Hollywood and the Internet.
At issue is a Web site he started that helped visitors find American movies and television shows online. Although the site did not serve up pirated content, American authorities say it provided links to sites that did. The Obama administration is seeking to extradite Mr. O'Dwyer from Britain on criminal charges of copyright infringement. The possible punishment: 10 years in a United States prison.
The case is the government's most far-reaching effort so far to crack down on foreigners suspected of breaking American laws. It is unusual because it goes after a middleman, who the authorities say made a fair amount of money by pointing people to pirated content. Mr. O'Dwyer's backers say the prosecution goes too far, squelching his free-speech right to publish links to other Web sites. 
Mr. O'Dwyer did not respond to requests for an interview, but his mother, Julia, a nurse with the state-run health service, described him as a somewhat reserved young man who grew up playing Super Mario games on his computer and became devoted to coding. He studies interactive media and animation at Sheffield Hallam University and, his mother said, long ago spent the money he had made from his Web site.
''He would take his mates to the cinema and pay for them,'' she said.
No matter how Mr. O'Dwyer's legal problems are resolved, the case against him reflects the complexities of wrestling with piracy in the digital age.
The entertainment industry lobbied Congress hard for the Stop Online Piracy Act, or SOPA, which was withdrawn this year after an online uproar led by Web companies and their consumers. Another bill on Capitol Hill would establish intellectual property attaches in American embassies. An international antipiracy treaty, the Anti-Counterfeiting Trade Agreement, or ACTA, was roundly rejected last week by the European Parliament.
In the last two years, the Obama administration has closed about 800 Web sites suspected of piracy, including those that stream new Hollywood films. In a widely publicized case, the Justice Department has sought to extradite the operators of Megaupload, a site that let users anonymously share movies and music, on criminal copyright infringement.
''There is a problem of copyright infringement on the Internet, and copyright owners have been struggling over how to deal with that,'' said Mark A. Lemley, a Stanford law professor who has represented Internet companies like Google in intellectual property disputes. ''The U.S. government is aggressively getting involved in turning what used to be civil lawsuits into criminal cases. The combination of that and reaching across the border is new.''
The extradition case against Mr. O'Dwyer has turned him into something of a cause celebre. Wikipedia's founder, Jimmy Wales, is leading a crusade to save him, with an online petition that has gathered over 225,000 signatures worldwide in two weeks.
Still, the British home secretary, Theresa May, approved the extradition order in March and said Monday that she would let the order stand. Mr. O'Dwyer has appealed; a hearing in Britain is expected this fall.
His lawyer did not respond to requests for comment. The federal prosecutors in New York who are handling the case also declined to comment. The criminal complaint against Mr. O'Dwyer is sealed.
Mr. O'Dwyer's story began in 2008 when he set up his Web site, TVShack.net, which allowed users to search for and link to other sites, including ones that the authorities say showed pirated movies and shows. Because the domain name was registered in the United States, it fell under the ambit of American law. The government shut down TVShack.net in summer 2010.
Mr. O'Dwyer was unbowed. TVShack.net had been growing in popularity, and it made about $230,000 from advertising over the course of two years, federal prosecutors say.
''America? They have nothing to do with me,'' Mr. O'Dwyer's mother said he had told her. He reopened his site as TVShack.cc, which he reckoned was beyond the reach of the United States.
A few months later came a knock on the door from the British police. A judge ruled that Mr. O'Dwyer would not be prosecuted in Britain. Instead, the United States would seek to extradite him.
His mother was stunned. ''This is for fugitives and murderers and terrorists,'' she recalled thinking. ''Richard has never fled the scene of a crime. He has never left the U.K.!''
A judge released Mr. O'Dwyer on bail. On his mother's orders, he shut down his site, which makes it difficult to tell how it operated.
At the heart of the O'Dwyer case is a question of what to do about Web sites that help users find unlicensed content.
According to British court documents examined by The New York Times, the Justice Department argues that Mr. O'Dwyer enabled Internet users to easily avail themselves of copyrighted material by providing links to third-party sites that contained thousands of pirated films and television programs.
Prosecutors say that on one day in 2010, his Web site contained links to seven films, described as the ''most popular movies today,'' that were still playing in theaters and had not been authorized for distribution on the Internet.
Mr. O'Dwyer, prosecutors suggest, was aware the material was copyrighted. They cite an announcement on TVShack that urged users to be patient with download times because they were ''saving quite a lot of money (especially when putting several visits to the theater or seasons together).''
Ted Shapiro, the Motion Picture Association of America's general counsel for Europe, said the fact that Mr. O'Dwyer had not stored illegal material on TVShack itself signaled that he knew how to evade the law.
''The fact that the U.S. government is willing to step up and protect content from the film industry and the copyright sector is an amazingly important thing,'' Mr. Shapiro said. ''We are talking about protecting things Americans are good at.''
Mr. O'Dwyer's backers say his site was effectively a search engine. To prosecute him, they argue, would set a dangerous precedent -- tantamount to holding one person accountable for the acts of another.
''Something that lets you find illegal content can also help you find legal content,'' said Mitch Stoltz, a lawyer with the Electronic Frontier Foundation. ''When you go after intermediaries, you're going to shut down legal and legitimate speech and commerce and innovation to get at what they perceive as illegal copyright violation.''
Peter Decherney, a professor at the University of Pennsylvania who wrote the book ''Hollywood's Copyright Wars: From Edison to the Internet,'' said the O'Dwyer case showed how difficult Hollywood has made it for people in other countries to consume American entertainment online.
Sites like Netflix, Hulu and iTunes have limited offerings overseas, if any. The demand for American entertainment drives a lucrative underground economy of pirated movies and television shows.
''In many other countries, unauthorized distribution is the only form of online distribution,'' said Mr. Decherney, ''and consumers will continue to make Robin Hoods out of anyone who can help them get to media online.''
This article has been revised to reflect the following correction: .

HEADLINE: Green Party, Still the Outsider Looking In, Has a New Face This Campaign

BYLINE: By SUSAN SAULNY;

 BODY:
BOSTON -- Jill Stein, presumptive nominee of the Green Party, is probably the only candidate on the campaign trail who spends an hour a day cooking her own organic meals -- and who was, not too long ago, the lead singer of a folksy rock band.But the differences do not end there. When Ms. Stein is introduced on the trail as ''Jill Stein for president,'' she is also very likely the only candidate to be asked, ''For president of what?''
That's what Keith Brockenberry, a cook, wanted to know at a meet-and-greet in Roxbury last week. After one of Ms. Stein's supporters clarified, ''for president of the United States,'' Mr. Brockenberry seemed both taken aback and delighted.
''Get out of here!'' he blurted out. ''I had no idea.'' 
What Ms. Stein lacks in name recognition, however, she is trying to make up for these days in high-energy organization and low-cost social media outreach. If her application for federal matching funds is approved, she will be the second Green nominee to qualify, after Ralph Nader in 2000 -- another milestone for this 11-year-old alternative party and potentially a major boost for a campaign that does not accept corporate donations.
The Green Party of the United States expects to be on the ballot in at least 45 states and to spend about $1 million on its campaign. At the moment, it has secured ballot access, an organizational test in itself, in 21 states, including the battlegrounds of Colorado, Florida, Michigan and Ohio, where the major party candidates, President Obama and Mitt Romney, who are raising tens of millions of dollars every month, are locked in a tight race.
While Ms. Stein barely registers a blip in national polling, experts point to Mr. Nader, who was seen by many Democrats as siphoning just enough votes from Al Gore in one state, Florida, to tip the election to the Republican, George W. Bush. Nationally, Mr. Nader had captured only 3 percent of the vote.
Could such a situation unfold again?
Unlike Ms. Stein, a physician on leave from her practice, Mr. Nader, a lifelong consumer advocate, enjoyed high name recognition. But now, more than a decade later, the Green Party has matured to the point at which Ms. Stein's lower profile may be balanced by a more savvy political operation.
''The Green Party only needs to pull a very small number to provide an upset in a state like Ohio, if the balloting is close,'' said Peter Ubertaccio, chairman of the department of political science and international studies at Stonehill College, in Easton, Mass. ''Then suddenly their insignificant overall numbers become hugely significant in deciding who gets the electoral votes in that state.''
It's a danger to their natural allies, the Democrats, he said.
Ms. Stein, 62, a graduate of Harvard College and Harvard Medical School, takes her ultra-long-shot odds in stride and is eager to explain to anyone who will listen ''how a nice doctor like me,'' she says, ''got to be in a Godforsaken place like this.''
A general internist who grew impatient with the social and environmental roots of disease, Ms. Stein said, ''I'm now practicing political medicine because politics is the mother of all illnesses.''
The Green Party's supporters tend to be young, but the party is also popular with liberals of all ages who are disenchanted with the Obama administration.
Emily Winter, 24, is one such voter. ''I voted for Obama because he preached change, and he's done impressive work in the area of women's rights, heath care and foreign policy,'' said Ms. Winter, a Boston University graduate student who approached Ms. Stein on a South End street to ask for a photo. ''But I feel like too many other policies are stuck where they've been for years.''
Ms. Stein, ever polished in bright scarves and slim pantsuits, is quick to point out that she is the only candidate who has experience debating Mr. Romney, which she did in the 2002 Massachusetts governor's race, her first of four unsuccessful attempts at elected office.
What did she learn? ''It's easy to debate a robot,'' she said of his speaking style.
While Ms. Stein ultimately lost big, with only 3 percent of the vote, a poll taken by a local television station immediately after one debate showed that 32 percent of voting viewers said she had won the debate, compared with 33 percent who gave it to Mr. Romney (he ultimately won the race).
''Stein wouldn't have struck you, if you were watching the debates, as a caricature of a third-party candidate,'' Professor Ubertaccio said. ''She was thoughtful and spoke about policy quite knowledgeably.''
Still, some detractors dismiss Ms. Stein as a perennial protest candidate who has never gained much traction with voters.
Now a major challenge for Ms. Stein, a native of the Chicago area who lives northwest of Boston with her husband, a surgeon (they have two adult sons), is to show that she can win support around the country. She longs to be included in the nationally televised debates, a high hurdle for any third-party candidate. According to the Commission on Presidential Debates, a candidate must have ''a level of support of at least 15 percent of the national electorate'' as determined by five national polling organizations.
Ms. Stein's problem, then, is of the chicken-and-egg variety: to get national name recognition, she needs television exposure in debates. But she does not qualify for debates because of a lack of national name recognition.
She thinks that is by design, to benefit major parties.
''If they actually have to debate a living, thinking, informed person, it's very hard for them,'' Ms. Stein added, referring to Mr. Obama and Mr. Romney. ''They have kind of a mutual agreement, which you can see evident in the nature of their debate right now. If it's important, they won't go there. Many issues are not on the table.''
Ms. Stein says she emphasizes issues like ecological sustainability, racial and gender equality, and economic justice. The centerpiece of her platform is a Green New Deal, a twist on the Roosevelt-era programs intended to stimulate job growth and the depressed economy. It could be paid for by ending the presence of American troops in Iraq and Afghanistan, the campaign says, and by eliminating waste in the health care system. Beyond that, Ms. Stein favors a progressive income tax that would raise rates on the wealthy.
''There are overwhelming benefits to moving to a green economy that provides jobs and good wages,'' she said.
Ms. Stein is quick to align Mr. Obama and Mr. Romney, saying their policies are nearly indistinguishable. She cites the former governor's policy on health care and the president's health overhaul as an example. (She supports a single-payer system.)
''We need to have people in Washington who refuse to be bought by lobbyist money and for whom change is not just a slogan,'' Ms. Stein said. ''It seems like there's a rebellion going on, and people are really ready for something different.''

HEADLINE: Lines Are Drawn Over Opting Out Of Medicaid Plan

BYLINE: By ABBY GOODNOUGH

 BODY:
MIAMI -- In the weeks since the Supreme Court ruled that states could opt out of a plan to vastly expand Medicaid under President Obama's health care law, several Republican governors have vowed to do just that, attacking the expansion as a budget-busting federal power grab.
But it may not be so easy. A battle is brewing here in Florida, where Gov. Rick Scott took to national television soon after the ruling to announce that he would reject the expansion. Advocates for the poor and some players in the health care industry -- especially hospitals, a powerful political lobby -- intend to push back.
Hospital associations around the country have already signed off on cuts to reimbursement rates under the health care law on the assumption that the new paying customers they would gain, partly through the Medicaid expansion, would more than cover their losses. 
''If we're going to walk away from that coverage, we'll simply see those dollars we contributed through cuts in hospital payments go to covering people in other states,'' said Bruce Rueben, president of the Florida Hospital Association. ''It's a bad deal for people in Florida if it plays out that way.''
Given Florida's size -- it is the fourth most populous state in the nation, and more than 20 percent of its 19 million residents lack health insurance -- the implications for Mr. Obama's goal of insuring most Americans are significant. And Florida's importance as one of the biggest battleground states in the presidential race adds potency to Mr. Scott's clash with the Obama administration. Supporters of the law here have hurried to paint the Medicaid expansion as crucial not just morally, but economically.
But there is noticeable frustration with the White House from some. State Senator Nan Rich, a Democrat running for governor in 2014, said the administration needed to do a better job of countering state-level opposition.
''The Obama administration needs to be more forceful in going out there and explaining what is true and what's not,'' she said.
Despite the governor's statements, leaders of the Republican-controlled state Legislature have not outright rejected the expansion, saying they will study their options over the coming months before making a decision.
''At the end of the day, we are going to take a rational approach that reflects the interests of Floridians, protects their hard-earned tax dollars and uses common sense, '' said Representative Will Weatherford, the incoming House speaker.
That more measured approach may reflect, in part, mixed public sentiment about the health care law. The boos that met Mitt Romney's vow to repeal the law in a speech on Wednesday at the N.A.A.C.P.'s annual convention in Houston were a reminder that while Republicans believe strident opposition is a winning strategy, it may not be so clear-cut.
Mr. Scott describes Medicaid as a dysfunctional program, saying the portion of the state budget devoted to it is growing at more than three and a half times the rate of general revenues. The program currently costs about $21 billion a year in Florida, with the federal government covering 55 percent, and serves about 3.2 million people. Childless adults are generally not eligible but would be under the expansion.
All told, the expansion would add some 17 million people to the Medicaid rolls nationally, including perhaps one million or more in Florida.
Under the law, the federal government would pay the full cost of each state's expansion for the first three years, starting in 2014, and gradually decrease its share to 90 percent in 2020 and beyond. Last week, Mr. Scott said in national television interviews that the state would owe an additional $1.9 billion a year if, as the law calls for, it expanded Medicaid to everyone with incomes up to 133 percent of the poverty level. That is currently about $15,000 for a single person and $31,000 for a family of four.
Mr. Scott has since backed off the $1.9 billion estimate; his spokesman, Lane Wright, said he had based it on an outdated report. But the state is still anticipating high costs, partly because it expects that a number of people who are currently eligible for Medicaid but have not signed up will do so, a concern shared by other states. The federal government would pay a lower share of the cost for that group.
In Florida, the federal government would contribute a total of $20 billion for the newly eligible group from 2014 through 2019, according to the Kaiser Family Foundation, a nonpartisan research group. The foundation estimates Florida's share of the expansion costs at between $1.2 billion and $2.5 billion from 2014 through 2019, depending on how many of those newly eligible for Medicaid actually enroll.
Without the expansion, Mr. Rueben and others in the health care industry said, the cost of uncompensated care -- emergency treatment for those who are uninsured and cannot afford to pay -- will continue to spiral upward and more costs will be shifted to the insured. Jackson Health System, the safety-net hospital system in Miami, provided more than $450 million in uncompensated care last year.
For the most part, hospitals are likely to hold their fire until after the election, said Jeff Goldsmith, a health industry analyst based in Virginia. ''If Obama is defeated and the Senate flips, it's all over,'' Mr. Goldsmith said. ''Do you spend a bunch of scarce political capital making people angry now, or wait until things have settled after November?''
Although clinics for the poor provide basic care to a constant stream of uninsured patients, those who need more complicated tests or procedures are often out of luck.
Dr. Edwin Bosa-Osorio, chief medical officer at Jessie Trice Community Health Center, which serves several poor neighborhoods in the Miami area, said it can take more than a year for his patients to get diagnostic tests or consultations even at Jackson, the safety-net hospital system, because it is so overburdened.
As a result, Dr. Bosa-Osorio said, the center's doctors too often have to take ''the Plan B approach to a condition.''
For Tracy Similien, a 22-year-old student who injured her hip in a fall several years ago and still has frequent searing pain, that means relying on Tylenol instead of seeing an orthopedist or neurologist.
Fatima Zafar, Ms. Similien's primary care doctor at Jessie Trice, said another of her patients has uterine fibroids that make her anemic and weak. She needs a hysterectomy, Dr. Zafar said, but is on a waiting list for it at Jackson. About 23 percent of Jessie Trice patients have Medicaid and can thus be referred to other hospitals that offer quicker appointments; most of the rest are uninsured. ''You feel very limited in your scope,'' Dr. Zafar said.
In a letter to governors on Tuesday, Kathleen Sebelius, the health and human services secretary, urged them to take advantage of ''the unusually generous federal resources'' and move ahead with expansions.
But State Senator Joe Negron, a Republican who is vice chairman of the Senate Budget Committee, said he was skeptical that the federal government could continue to pay for most of the expansion indefinitely given the size of the deficit.
''Medicaid should be a last-resort safety-net program and not a mechanism to reduce the number of uninsured,'' he said. ''We have to hope our economy keeps improving and more people get back to work and therefore would have access to private health insurance.''
Online Correction: July 12, 2012, Thursday
This article has been revised to reflect the following correction: Because of an editing error, an earlier version of this article contained a headline, appearing on the home page of NYTimes.com, that indicated that states could opt out of an expansion of Medicare. The program being expanded is Medicaid.

HEADLINE: Turning a Coal Mine's Gas Problem Into a Ski Resort's CO2 and Energy Solution

BYLINE: ANDREW C. REVKIN


HIGHLIGHT: A Colorado climate hawk cuts an energy deal with a mining company that sees warming as a delusion. 

 BODY:
Earlier this week, Climate Progress posted an interesting essay, "Climate Change is Fracking Society," written by Auden Schendler, who is vice president of sustainability at the Aspen Skiing Company and the author of "Getting Green Done: Hard Truths from the Front Lines of the Sustainability Revolution."
Schendler's summation of the science pointing to dangerous human-driven climate change is pretty overheated. But I really like how he describes the sometimes uncomfortable need to fracture old alliances and cross longstanding battle lines if you're serious about finding ways to cut greenhouse gas emissions that can work in the real world.
Here's an excerpt making his prime point, followed by more from Schendler on a climate-friendly energy deal he just helped broker between his employer, which runs four of the region's marquee* ski resorts, and a coal mine owner whose company is a member of a group promoting the myth that global warming is a "great delusion." Read on: 
From Schendler's Climate Progress post:
In Aspen, Colo., old school enviros who helped create the wilderness movement are fighting pitched battles against other environmentalists who support a 1 megawatt microhydro plant that would generate 8% of the city's power. "Protect the stream!" They yell. Climate activists, including the mayor, are fighting back, arguing that you lose the river anyway if you don't solve climate. Somebody's got to lead because everywhere is somebody's backyard.
And if Aspen-as a center of wealth and influence that can afford to try stuff and share those stories-can't lead, then it might as well throw in the towel and default to just doing conspicuous consumption. Solving climate is going to hurt. We're going to break things. And we're starting with our relationships, friendships, and old alliances. There is a kernel of hope in this, and it's that whenever an issue become so large it starts to cost you friendships, that means it's front and center in the public conversation. Civil Rights. Gay Marriage. Remember that taxation without representation split Ben Franklin from his son. And once a topic gets into the public blood, it's on its way to resolution.
Alliances will be the first to go, fracked forever or sometimes replaced by weird new bedfellows, like the kind of date you might pick up at the Star Wars bar. This month, ...my business inked a deal to capture methane vented from a coal mine-one of the largest point sources greenhouse gases in Colorado-to make electricity. [.]
The power produced is triple carbon negative because methane is 23 times more potent than CO2 as a greenhouse gas and this project destroys it. Our partner is a coal mine that carries membership in the Colorado Mining Association, which is a state climate denial machine that on its website cites a Fox report called "Global Warming: The Great Delusion." Uncomfortable? Hells yes. But desperate times call for desperate measures. It's a whole new world. [Read on.]
I sent Schendler a query asking for more detail on the coalbed methane project and also his view on another source of gas, the hydraulic fracturing, or fracking, that he alludes to in his "fracked" metaphor. Here's his reply:
So this project: it's 3 megawatts of baseload electricity, with three 1-megawatt piston engines sited at the coal mine and capturing that methane on site. It will make 25 million kilowatt hours of electricity annually, which is roughly the same amount of power our ski resort uses. Because it is destroying methane, our calculations show it eliminates three times the CO2 equivalent that our resort creates annually. We own the project, having invested $5.5 million into it, out of a total cost of $6 million. The project sells power to Holy Cross Energy, and is developed by a company called Vessels Coal Gas. The Elk Creek Mine, owned by Oxbow, is our partner as well.
It is the largest coal mine methane-to-electricity proejct in the U.S. by a factor of 20 -- there is a 150 kilowatt project in Pennsylvania also operated by Vessels. (There are also some projects that capture and sell the methane but don't make powe from it, the oldest being at Jim Walter resources in Alabama.) But these projects are all over Europe (Germany, England, France) and China, due to carbon regulation. Methane is the largest point source of greenhouse gases in Delta and Gunnison counties in Colorado, where there are lots of coal mines. It's interesting that the mine president refutes climate science and doesn't believe methane or coal are pollutants. But he told me he was green-lighting this project because he was a resource guy, and didn't like to see that methane wasted as it currently is. Last tidbit: to get this kind of carbon benefit with photovoltaics, you'd have to invest half a billion dollars, instead of $6 million. And interestingly: we could buy cheap RECs [] and declare ourselves carbon neutral for about $40,000 annually. EPA would bless us. But we wouldn't have done anything. So we decided to do a project where we couldn't take credit for the carbon, or get the power (we sell both to the utility) but which would actually do something material.
On fracking: I was at a conference of oil and gas folks, and they said something interesting: "When people started talking about fracking affecting groundwater, we just laughed it off because it's physically impossible and absurd. And that was a mistake--what happened is that we lost control of the message. We should have said: 'there are lots of concerns related to the fracking process, air quality, water use, and other issues, and we need to take those seriously. Here's how..'" 
Anyway, my take on fracking is that 1) it's what's for dinner, so we have to deal with it 2) it should be regulated so wells are lined properly and spills don't occur and 3) the public doesn't fully understand how it works and therefore is tying fracking itself to groundwater pollution. People around here say "NO FRACKING!" which to me is absurd. Isn't it "no sloppy unregulated fracking?"
On gas: several studies have argued that gas is no better than coal from a CO2 perspective, given methane leakage. That's obviously a big problem, but there are a few reasons gas still makes sense as a transition fuel from coal. 
1) The leakage is probably overestimated in those studies, based on my conversations with various people in that field and some of the assumptions the reseachers made.
2) Even if the leakage is high, there is a way, and an economic incentive, to reduce that leakage, whereas there is no such incentive or fix with coal. 
3) Gas ENABLES renewables because it can be turned on and off quickly, again, unlike coal and so is tied to future wind and solar development. The CEO of our utility says that for every megawatt of wind installed he needs 1 megawatt of gas to "firm" it 
4) Gas offers a variety of local air quality benefits (ozone, haze, soot reduction) and also mercury reduction over coal.
As you can imagine, I embrace his sense of climate and energy pragmatism and common sense. 
I noted in a reply to him that I'd had many conversations with folks in the gas industry or government that echo precisely Schendler's remarks on companies now regretting their early overinflated assurances of safety in pushing the gas rush. I capped my note this way: "That horse is way, way out of the barn."
| Related | There's a new peer-reviewed study by Lawrence Cathles of Cornell University (on Dot Earth previously) reinforcing existing research pointing to the substantial climate benefit in a shift from coal to gas. Here's the university news release and the paper, which was just published in the journal G-Cubed: Geochemistry, Geophysics and Geosystems: "Assessing the Greenhouse Impact of Natural Gas."

HEADLINE: How Big Is 50.7 Million Uninsured?

BYLINE: TARA PARKER-POPE


HIGHLIGHT: What would happen if everyone in 25 states suddenly lost their health insurance? We're asking readers to help put the 50.7 million uninsured into perspective. 

 BODY:
Some numbers are so big, they are meaningless. So when we hear public officials talk about the 50.7 million uninsured, most of us lack perspective on just how many people that really is.
But how big is 50.7 million uninsured? That's the question The Washington Post recently asked in devising a chart to give some perspective on the problem of the uninsured. They found that having 50.7 million people uninsured is equal to:

        
16 percent of the United States population (about 1 in 6 people).
        
The combined population of Oklahoma, Connecticut, Iowa, Mississippi, Kansas, Kentucky, Arkansas, Utah, Oregon, Nevada, New Mexico, West Virginia, Nebraska, Idaho, Maine, New Hampshire, Hawaii, Rhode Island, Montana, Delaware, North Dakota, South Dakota, Alaska, Vermont and Wyoming. (That's 25 states!) 
        
1.5 times the population of Canada.
        
1.8 times the number of Twitter users in the United States.
        
About equal to the number of people who voted for George W. Bush for president in 2000.
You can see more examples by viewing the complete Washington Post chart here.
Now it's your turn. Can you think of a good way to illustrate just how big 50.7 million really is? Share your examples by joining the discussion below.

HIGHLIGHT: As automakers like General Motors and Peugeot work to stem losses in Europe, Fiat perfects its espresso pour. 

 BODY:
In which we bring you motoring news from around the Web:
 Fiat announced this week that it would offer a single-capsule espresso maker as an option for European customers of its coming 500L. The device, developed for the Italian coffee brand Lavazza, fits in the tunnel between front passengers. The automaker has not committed to offering the feature in other markets. The 500L is expected to begin sales in Europe late this year. (Fiat)
Karl-Friedrich Stracke, the vice president of General Motors' European operations and head of the Opel brand, abruptly stepped down this week. G.M. appointed Steve Girsky, a member of the Opel board, to serve in the interim as the automaker searched for a replacement. "Karl Stracke worked tirelessly, under great pressure, to stabilize this business and we look forward to building on his success," Daniel F. Akerson, chairman and chief executive of G.M., said in a statement. Though the automaker has experienced robust growth in North America and Asia, its European operations have not shared in the good fortune, posting a $747 million loss in 2011. (General Motors)
 According to Bloomberg, BMW has moved to dissolve its joint venture with Peugeot, with which it intended to develop systems and components for electric vehicles. The two automakers entered the partnership in October 2011, but since then G.M. has taken a stake in PSA Peugeot Citroën, the French brand's parent, and BMW has announced a partnership with Toyota to develop alternative powertrains, including those for use in E.V.'s. (Bloomberg)
 The 2013 Ford Focus ST, scheduled to arrive in American dealerships late this summer, was certified by the Environmental Protection Agency with fuel-economy estimates of 23 miles per gallon in urban and 32 m.p.g. in highway driving. The ratings compare favorably with those of the Volkswagen GTI, at 21 m.p.g. in urban and 31 m.p.g. in highway driving when equipped with a 6-speed manual transmission. The ST is available with only a 6-speed manual transmission. (Ford)

HEADLINE: Chinese Love Free Markets as Much as Americans Do

BYLINE: CATHERINE RAMPELL


HIGHLIGHT: A new poll surveyed people around the world on how they view the state of their economies and their own financial circumstances. 

 BODY:
 are as likely to believe that most people benefit from a free market economy as Americans are, according to a new Pew Research Center report.
Three-quarters of Chinese people "completely agree" or "mostly agree" with the following statement: "Most people are better off in a free market economy, even though some people are rich and some are poor."
That's a decline from the share who agreed with the statement in 2010, but at 74 percent it's still about equal to the agreement level in America, which was 67 percent. (The margin of sampling error is plus or minus 4 percentage points in both countries, so the difference in the two responses is not statistically significant.)
This similarity in Chinese and American responses may seem kind of nuts. China is supposed to be communist, right?
Of course, there might be some translation issues in doing cross-country comparisons, given that the survey in China was conducted in Mandarin and 15 other Chinese dialects. Maybe the closest equivalent to "free market" in the Jiangxi dialect means something slightly different than it does in English.
Let's assume, though, that the translation was good. One way to explain why the Chinese like free markets is that China's economy has become considerably less regulated since the 1970s. Respondents there may have a different frame of reference for determining whether markets are "free" or not.
And this illustrates one of the prominent themes across the Pew report: The in economic activity, rather than the of economic activity, appears to be much more salient to people when evaluating the big economic picture. They've already adapted to their current economic circumstances, and are focused on where things are going.
Gross domestic product per capita is six times as high in the United States as it is in China. Yet the Chinese were generally more upbeat about their own domestic economic conditions than Americans were. In China, 83 percent said the economic situation in their country was "very good" or "somewhat good," compared to 31 percent in the United States.
The Chinese and Americans are not alone in focusing on the change in their economies when assessing their economic circumstances. This scatterplot shows 2011 economic growth versus what share of citizens in that country call present economic conditions "good," and you can see there's a pretty strong relationship between the two.
It's not only gross domestic product growth that seems important to respondents' assessments of their economies. Changes in their own financial situations seem to matter too, and Chinese and citizens of other poor but fast-growing economies are much more likely to report happy news on this front:
In China and Brazil, about 7 out of 10 people say they are financially better off today than they were five years ago. In the United States, just 1 in 4 can identify with that sentiment.
Citizens in poor but fast-growing countries are also more likely to achieve what those of us stateside call the American dream: being better off than one's parents were.
Why does all this matter? Because it's important to keep the developing world's economic growth in perspective, especially when those of us in rich countries begrudge poor countries their recent economic success.
China is a gigantic, fast-growing economy, which both excites the Chinese and terrifies Americans. Those knee-jerk reactions ignore the fact that China has a long, long way to go before its citizens have living standards that barely approximate what those of us in rich countries already enjoy.

HEADLINE: Cheneys Host Fund-Raiser for Romney in Wyoming

BYLINE: ASHLEY PARKER


HIGHLIGHT: More than 200 guests attended a fund-raising dinner at the Cheneys' home, but the Romney campaign took pains to avoid any images of the Republican candidate and the former vice president together. 

 BODY:
WILSON, Wyo. - When former Vice President Dick Cheney opened his Wyoming home to Mitt Romney Thursday evening for a private dinner fund-raiser, many donors and supporters viewed the moment as a symbolic passing of the torch from the last Republican administration to the hope of the next one.
But the Romney campaign made sure that the burning light was passed as quietly as possible.
Mr. Cheney remains unpopular with many Americans, and Mr. Romney's team went to great lengths to avoid any public images of the two men together. When Mr. Romney arrived at the reception, he greeted Mr. Cheney with a handshake and Mr. Cheney's wife, Lynne, with a kiss, but reporters who were within view were promptly escorted out by the campaign. (Typically, the campaign does not allow photos or videos inside its fund-raisers.)
Mr. Romney, who largely avoids mentioning former President George W. Bush and Mr. Cheney on the campaign trail, did not mention Mr. Bush at the first reception, which was open to a press pool. But once at Mr. Cheney's private residence - which backs up to a golf course - a pool reporter within earshot of Mr. Romney's remarks heard Mr. Romney invoke Mr. Bush but was not able to make out the context, and was again escorted away by a campaign staffer.
Mr. Cheney, meanwhile, offered a strong endorsement of Mr. Romney.
Recalling the four Republican presidents for whom he had worked, and the credentials necessary for a commander in chief, Mr. Cheney said he felt there was "only one man to be president of the United States who meets those requirements, and that's Gov. Mitt Romney."
"Whether it's 9/11 or the other kinds of difficulties and crises that arrive - they always do - and that's when you find out what kind of leader your president is," Mr. Cheney said. "I'm convinced that in addition to all of these other qualifications that you all know about, when I think about the kind of individual I want in the Oval Office in that moment of crisis, who has to make those key decisions, some of them life and death decisions, decisions as the commander in chief, who has the responsibility for sending our young men and women in harm's way. That man's Mitt Romney."

Mr. Romney, who spoke for about 20 minutes, returned the favor, calling Mr. Cheney "quite a man, quite a leader," and pointing out that he could have simply enjoyed Wyoming and stuck to fly fishing and hunting.
Though Mr. Romney's finance team had expected the events would bring in roughly $2 million, the day's fund-raisers brought in a haul of more than $4 million. Mr. Romney's National Finance Committee also used the trip to Jackson, Wyo. - a town where the population is just slightly higher than its elevation - to hold one of its group meetings, which occur roughly once a month.
Many high-dollar donors who had already maxed out and wanted to attend the event were told they had to recruit a new donor who could raise the $30,000 entrance price in order to attend. Attendees were treated to a picture of themselves with Mr. Romney, against a backdrop of a United States flag and the Wyoming state flag.
More than 200 guests attended the dinner, and included Foster Friess, a major contributor to a pro-Rick Santorum "Super PAC" that attacked Mr. Romney during the early nominating contests; Harold Hamm, the billionaire oil executive; Woody Johnson, the owner of the New York Jets; Lowry Mays, the founder of Clear Channel Communications; and L.E. Simmons, the president of a private equity firm with a focus on oil.
Though Mr. Cheney and Mr. Bush remain popular with the Republican base, both are polarizing figures among the broader electorate. Many Americans still blame the economic downtown on Mr. Bush's administration, and Mr. Bush is considered such a liability on the campaign trial that Mr. Romney rarely, if ever, mentions him. 
"It should come as no surprise that Vice President Cheney is hosting a fund-raiser for Mitt Romney," said Melanie Roussell, a spokeswoman for the Democratic National Committee, in an e-mail statement. "Not only has Romney suggested we return to the unilateral approach to foreign policy that got us bogged down in Iraq, but he also plans to carbon copy the failed economic policies of the past - the same policies that benefited a few, while leaving the middle class out to dry." 
In private, however, relations between Mr. Romney and the Bushes - both father and son - are warmer. Many of Mr. Romney's foreign policy advisers hail from both Bush administrations, and Condoleezza Rice headlined a fund-raiser for Mr. Romney in June. One of Mr. Romney's senior advisers, Ron Kaufman, was something of consigliore to the first President Bush. Mr. Bush and his wife, Barbara, endorsed Mr. Romney earlier in the campaign, and former President George W. Bush did so as well, in an awkward run-in with ABC News.
"I'm for Mitt Romney," the younger Mr. Bush said in May, before slipping into an elevator.
Though Mr. Romney rarely mentions Mr. Cheney on the campaign trail, he did bring him up at a town hall last September, recalling having watched the former vice president field a variety of questions during a C-SPAN interview he had seen.
"And I listened to him speak and said, Whether you agree or disagree with him, this is a man of wisdom and judgment, and he could have been president of the United States," Mr. Romney said. "That's the kind of person I'd like to have - a person of wisdom and judgment."
A source close to the event said the two men most likely stole some time on Thursday for a private meeting.
Thursday evening's event marked the first time Mr. and Mrs. Cheney opened their Wyoming home for a fund-raiser. The dinner was co-hosted by Dick and Maggie Scarlett, who served as Wyoming finance chairs of Senator John McCain's 2008 campaign.
And, of course, the dinner reflected the mood of Wyoming, as well. Wildflowers adorned all of the tables.

HEADLINE: Vinod Khosla: Maintain the Silicon Valley Vision

BYLINE: VINOD KHOSLA


HIGHLIGHT: Vinod Khosla, the prominent venture capitalist, says Silicon Valley is in danger of losing its way if a Wall Street mentality takes hold. "You want missionaries, not mercenaries," he writes in a guest post. 

 BODY:
Some people seem to think that getting acquired should be the highest aspiration for an entrepreneur in Silicon Valley. I disagree vehemently. 
In fact, I think that mindset does a disservice to the entrepreneurs in Silicon Valley and around the world. This is exactly the wrong way to think about building a start-up not only because it develops the wrong company culture, but on a large scale it can poison the unique and innovative ecosystem that has developed in Silicon Valley over the past 40 years. 
You want missionaries, not mercenaries -passionate, maniacally-focused founders who believe in a vision. Founders like this draw the most gifted and passionate employees, who maximize the chance of success, even if they ultimately fall short of their initial goals and get acquired. 
There are of course mercenaries and people setting up for "acqui-hires" in the valley as well, but that is not what Silicon Valley's special sauce is about.
In my view, it's irreverence, foolish confidence and naivety combined with persistence, open mindedness and a continual ability to learn that created Facebook, Google, Yahoo, eBay, Microsoft, Apple, Juniper, AOL, Sun Microsystems and others. 
Having a vision does not prevent you from being acquired, but starting a company to "do a deal" is not what Silicon Valley culture is about even if most companies that have a successful exit are acquired. An acquisition may be a safety net, a way to free yourself or learn to pursue another bigger or more interesting vision, but those are tools rather than goals of the true Silicon Valley entrepreneurs I have seen. (When I say Silicon Valley, I mean it how my Kleiner partner John Doerr meant it when he used to say "Silicon Valley is not a place but a state of mind.")
 The deal mentality is a Wall Street specialty and doesn't fit the valley culture. Yammer for instance (recently acquired by Microsoft for $1.2B) was not built to be exited quickly. But when an attractive offer came along the management team chose to take it. That happens quite often and is consistent with how the valley culture should work.
Seeking an acquisition from the start is more than just bad advice for an entrepreneur. For the entrepreneur it leads to short term tactical decisions rather than company-building decisions and in my view often reduces the probability of success. It can lead to sub-par "guns for hire'" rather than a team excited about a larger vision. It leads to a job not a lifestyle.
It makes the world poorer too. Imagine in 1980, if the highest goal of every start-up was to be bought by DEC or IBM for $20M in a couple of years. I'd assert that we'd still be in the Stone Age of high tech - using mainframes and cell phones that bolt to the floor of your car - no Internet, no biotechnology, no e-mail, no computers in the home, much less in your pocket. Imagine a world if Google was sold to Microsoft. Imagine the world of mobile based on Nokia and Motorola if Apple had not been restarted by a missionary entrepreneur named Steve Jobs who cared more for his vision than being tactical and financial. Each of those "no vision" start-ups looking for a quick sale would only try to do something safe and derivative that fit into IBM's, NBC's, Cisco's Pfizer's or Nokia's old models. 
It's hard to imagine all the things that wouldn't have happened, because it's easy to forget how much the world has changed due to dreamers and entrepreneurs. Many big company advances were also prompted by start-up visions. It was Nexgen, a little start-up, which forced Intel to work much harder on processor architectures. And before Juniper threatened it, Cisco did very little in TCP/IP Internet technologies. In fact, their chief technology officer told me when we were starting Juniper that they would never do an Internet router above OC12, a speed 8 times slower than the one that serves my house today, just because the major telecoms said they would never switch to TCP/IP. Now the world runs on it because we took a "build it and they will come" approach. 
In 1980, Ken Olsen, chief executive of DEC, couldn't imagine people ever needing even one computer in their home, and now even our washing machine, toaster, refrigerator and car have one (or many) processors. The Apple iPad, at a few hundred bucks, is far more powerful than the most powerful computer that DEC built twenty five years ago. 
All the best engineers and thinkers would work at big companies accomplishing only a little and maintaining the status quo rather disrupting the status quo or contributing to some part of the world's needs.
And we need that kind of disruption in food, agriculture, clean energy, healthcare and education among many other areas, which will likely be driven by a Silicon Valley state of mind.
The creativity, productivity and pace of innovation in Silicon Valley relies on brilliant and foolish entrepreneurs being unreasonable enough to believe they can be the exception to the "rule." As George Bernard Shaw said, "all progress depends on the unreasonable man." If everyone played it safe, we wouldn't get anywhere.

HEADLINE: Wells Fargo Posts $4.6 Billion Profit, Up 17%

BYLINE: NATHANIEL POPPER


HIGHLIGHT: Wells Fargo reported its 10th consecutive quarter of earnings growth as a result of a booming mortgage business. 

 BODY:
5:37 p.m. | Updated 
Wells Fargo reported its 10th consecutive quarter of earnings growth, propelled by a booming business originating and refinancing mortgages.
The bank's second-quarter profit was $4.6 billion, a record for Wells and a 17 percent increase from the $3.9 billion profit it reported a year earlier. Wells, which is based in San Francisco, earned 82 cents a share for the quarter, above the 81 cents that analysts polled by SNL Financial had expected.
Wells has largely skirted the trading and derivatives controversies that have hit many of its large competitors, and it recently passed JPMorgan Chase to become the largest American bank by stock market capitalization. (JPMorgan has lost $25 billion in market value in recent months, after it disclosed a trading loss that could top $7 billion.)
Wells has expanded its Wall Street operations, like commercial lending, as others have cut back. But it has continued to rely largely on its consumer banking business, and particularly its mortgage lending division, which has benefited from record-low interest rates.
The bank originated $131 billion of mortgages in the second quarter, up from $129 billion in the first quarter of the year and up from $64 billion a year ago.
"Mortgage volumes have been much stronger than anyone expected a year ago, or even three months ago," the bank's chief financial officer, Timothy J. Sloan, said in a conference call on Friday morning.
The bank also expanded its lending to customers for car purchases and credit cards, which Mr. Sloan attributed to the improving financial situation of American consumers. The improving credit quality of the bank's customers has allowed the bank to set aside less money for loan losses.
"While consumers are still under stress on average, their health continues to improve," Mr. Sloan said in an interview.
Revenue across Wells Fargo was up to $21.3 billion, from $20.4 billion in the period a year ago. Profit was up at each of the bank's three business divisions: wholesale banking, community banking and wealth management.
"This quarter the numbers looked good, and the outlook generally remains pretty strong as well," said R. Scott Siefers, a bank analyst at Sandler O'Neill.
Wells took a hit on Thursday when it was announced that it would pay $175 million to settle Justice Department accusations that it discriminated against some minority homeowners seeking loans from 2004 to 2009. In making the settlement, Wells denied the charges.
Wells shares closed Friday up 3.2 percent, to $33.91. The company began the year trading at about $28.

JPMorgan Reports Second-Quarter Profit and Will Restate First-Quarter Figures | JPMorgan Chase on Friday reported a second-quarter profit of $5 billion, down 9 percent, despite continuing losses from a multibillion-dollar botched credit position. The company also said it would restate its first-quarter earnings because it was no longer confident that the company's traders had fairly valued positions within the office that handled the controversial trades.
The bank also gave an update on the amount of money it has lost so far in credit derivatives, made by traders in London who worked in the bank's chief investment office. The bank said it has lost $4.4 billion within that office, up from the $2 billion loss it initially reported in May.
Doug Braunstein, JPMorgan's chief financial officer, told analysts on Friday that the year-to-date losses from the bungled trade were $5.8 billion. 
JPMorgan Chase said it earned $1.21 a share in the second quarter of 2012, down from $1.27 a share a year earlier. Revenue rose to $22.9 billion, down 16 percent from $27.4 billion in the same quarter a year ago. Net income also fell to $4.96 billion, from $5.4 billion a year ago.

Geithner Tried to Curb Rate Rigging in 2008 | When Timothy F. Geithner ran the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, he acknowledged fundamental problems with the process for setting key interest rates in the midst of the 2008 financial crisis, according to documents provided to The New York Times.
Mr. Geithner, who is now the United States Treasury secretary, questioned the integrity of the benchmark as reports surfaced that Barclays and other big banks were misrepresenting the rates. In 2008, Barclays had several conversations with New York Fed officials about the matter.
Mr. Geithner then reached out to top British authorities to discuss issues with the interest rate, which is set in London. In an e-mail to his counterparts, he outlined reforms to the system, suggesting that British authorities "strengthen governance and establish a credible reporting procedure" and "eliminate incentive to misreport," according to the documents. But the warnings came too late, and Barclays continued the illegal activity.

HEADLINE: Bank of England Supported Geithner's Rate Advice

BYLINE: MARK SCOTT


HIGHLIGHT: The Bank of England released emails on Friday detailing conversations about the setting of key interest rates in 2008 with Timothy F. Geithner when he ran the Federal Reserve Bank of New York. 

 BODY:
LONDON - The Bank of England released emails on Friday detailing conversations about the setting of key interest rates in 2008 with Timothy F. Geithner when he ran the Federal Reserve Bank of New York.
The documents show that senior central bank officials in Britain had raised questions over how the London interbank offered rate, or Libor, is set at the height of the financial crisis. 
While the e-mails indicate that officials raised questions about the rate-setting process, it's unclear what actions they took to address the issues. The British central bank, and other regulators, also failed to stop the illegal activity. Even after the conversation between the Bank of England and the New York Fed, Barclays continued to manipulated key interest rates, according to regulatory documents. 
On Friday, the British central bank released the emails from Mervyn A. King, the governor of the Bank of England, and his deputy, Paul Tucker from early June, 2008. The two men were responding to questions from Mr. Geithner, who queried the integrity of the benchmark rate that underpins trillions of dollars of financial products, including mortgages and loans.
Mr. Geithner, the current United States Treasury secretary, suggested British authorities should "strengthen governance and establish a credible reporting procedure" and "eliminate incentive to misreport," according to documents provided to The New York Times. 
In response, the Bank of England documents show that Mr. King passed on the recommendations to the British Bankers' Association, the trade body that oversees the Libor rate. 
"The recommendations proposed by the New York Fed seem sensible to us," Mr. King said in one of the emails.
Mr. Tucker, who was grilled by British politicians last week about his role in the Libor scandal, also arranged to talk to William C. Dudley, the current president of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, who was the executive vice president of the central bank's markets group at the time of the discussion.
Mr. Tucker, a front-runner to become the next governor of the Bank of England, had a phone call with Robert E. Diamond Jr., the former chief executive of Barclays, during which they discussed the bank's position in the financial markets. 
The conversation was later interpreted by one of Mr. Diamond's top executives, Jerry del Missier, that Barclays should lower its Libor submissions. Regulators say Mr. del Missier, who has resigned because of the trading scandal, misinterpreted the discussion.
In a separate note released by the Bank of England on Friday, Angela Knight, the chief executive of the British Bankers' Association, said the suggestions from U.S. authorities were being included in a review of Libor. 
"Changes are being made to incorporate the views of the Fed," Ms. Knight, who is stepping down from her position at the end of the summer, said in the email. "There is no show stopper as far as we can see."
The trade body published its initial findings days after receiving Mr. Geithner's recommendations, though did not finalize the report until the end of 2008. 
The British Bankers' Association is now conducting a further review into how Libor is set, though a separate British government inquiry also is being established to improvie the governance of the rate after the recent scandal.

HEADLINE: New York Fed Knew of False Barclays Reports on Rates

BYLINE: MICHAEL J. DE LA MERCED and BEN PROTESS


HIGHLIGHT: A Barclays employee notified the Federal Reserve Bank of New York in April 2008 that the firm was underestimating its borrowing costs, and there were warning signs as early as 2007 that the banks were undermining the integrity of key interest rates. 

 BODY:
9:27 p.m. | Updated 
The Federal Reserve Bank of New York learned in April 2008, as the financial crisis was brewing, that at least one bank was reporting false interest rates.
At the time, a Barclays employee told a New York Fed official that "we know that we're not posting um, an honest" rate, according to documents released by the regulator on Friday. The employee indicated that other big banks made similarly bogus reports, saying that the British institution wanted to "fit in with the rest of the crowd."
Although the New York Fed conferred with Britain and American regulators about the problems and recommended reforms, it failed to stop the illegal activity, which persisted through 2009.
 British regulators have said that they did not have explicit proof then of wrongdoing by banks. But the Fed's documents, which were released at the request of lawmakers, appear to undermine those claims.
The revelations fuel concerns that regulators are ill-equipped to police big banks and that financial institutions can game the system for their own purposes.
Even after authorities have beefed up oversight and lawmakers have enacted new rules, blowups on Wall Street continue to occur with some regularity. Amid the rate-manipulation scandal, regulators are also dealing with the fallout from the multibillion-dollar trading losses at JP Morgan Chase and the collapse of a second brokerage firm, just months after the failure of MF Global.
"I wish I could say I'm shocked, because it is shocking," said Frank Partnoy, the George E. Barrett professor of law and finance at the University of San Diego School of Law. "But regulators have not been particularly effective or aggressive in the past two decades of finance."
Regulators are now expanding their global investigation into the manipulation of key interest rates, a multiyear inquiry that has already examined more than 10 big banks, including UBS, JPMorgan Chase andCitigroup. In June, Barclays agreed to pay $450 million to settle claims that it reported bogus rates to deflect concerns about its health and bolster profits.
The Barclays case is the first major action stemming from the inquiry into how big banks set major benchmarks like the London interbank offered rate, known as Libor. The rate is essentially how much interest banks would pay to borrow money on a short-term basis from other financial firms, a process that is overseen by the British Bankers' Association, an industry trade group. Such benchmarks are used to determine the price of trillions of dollars of financial products, including mortgages and credit cards.
Since the Barclays settlement, lawmakers have focused their attention on regulators' role in the rate-manipulation controversy.
"As much as $800 trillion in financial products are pegged to Libor, so any manipulation of this rate is of serious concern," said Representative Randy Neugebauer, the chairman of the House Financial Services Subcommittee on Oversight and Investigations, which initially requested the documents from the New York Fed. "We'll continue looking into this matter to determine who was involved in this practice and whether it could have been prevented by regulators."
Timothy F. Geithner, who served as the head of the New York Fed during the crisis years, and other regulators raised concerns about Libor. But they did not stop the problems. As the regulators sought more information about the rate-setting process, they were consumed with trying to save the global financial system after the near collapse of Bear Stearns in 2008 and the failure of Lehman Brothers later that year.
Mr. Geithner, who is now the Treasury secretary, will most likely address the matter in Congressional testimony this month. The New York Fed has defended its actions.
"Following the failure of Bear Stearns and shortly before the first media report on the subject, we made further inquiry of Barclays as to how Libor submissions were being conducted," the New York Fed said in a statement. "We subsequently shared analysis and suggestions for reform of Libor."
The New York Fed learned about concerns over the integrity of Libor in summer 2007, when a Barclays employee e-mailed a New York Fed official, saying, "Draw your own conclusions about why people are going for unrealistically low" rates. Barclays wrote in a September report, "Our feeling is that Libors are again becoming rather unrealistic and do not reflect the true cost of borrowing."
But the New York Fed thought the reports amounted to market chatter and did not provide definitive proof of widespread manipulation. "In the context of our market monitoring following the onset of the financial crisis in late 2007, involving thousands of calls and e-mails with market participants over a period of many months, we received occasional anecdotal reports from Barclays of problems with Libor," the New York Fed statement said.
The regulator started to identify real problems with the interest rates several months later. In April 2008, the Barclays employee mentioned to a New York Fed official, "where I would be able to borrow" in the Libor market, "without question it would be higher than the rate that I'm actually putting in."
That same day, New York Fed officials wrote in a weekly internal memo that banks appeared to be understating the interest rates they would pay.
"Our contacts at Libor contributing banks have indicated a tendency to underreport actual borrowing costs," New York Fed officials wrote, "to limit the potential for speculation about the institutions' liquidity problems."
After the April 2008 conversation, the New York Fed started notifying other American regulators, including the Treasury Department. Mr. Geithner reached out to British authorities as well, notably Mervyn King, the governor of theBank of England, and his deputy, Paul Tucker. Mr. Geithner suggested British authorities should "eliminate incentive to misreport."
In response, Mr. King passed on the recommendations to the British Bankers' Association , according to documents released by the Bank of England Friday. Mr. Tucker also arranged to talk toWilliam C. Dudley, the current president of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, who was then executive vice president of the regulator's markets group.
Angela Knight, the chief executive of the British Bankers' Association, who is stepping down at the end of the summer, said the suggestions from United States authorities would be included in a review of Libor. The trade body published its initial findings days after receiving Mr. Geithner's recommendations.
But regulators never addressed the fundamental problems with the rate-setting process. When the New York Fed raised concerns in 2008, Barclays has been trying to manipulate the interest rate for nearly three years, and the practice continued until 2009.

HEADLINE: New Fraud Inquiry as JPMorgan's Loss Mounts

BYLINE: JESSICA SILVER-GREENBERG


HIGHLIGHT: Amid a swirl of questions about a multibillion-dollar trading loss, JPMorgan said Friday that it would be forced to restate its first-quarter results, indicating that its traders may have intentionally been trying to conceal the extent of the red ink on the disastrous credit bet. 

 BODY:
9:07 p.m. | Updated 
JPMorgan Chase disclosed on Friday that losses on its botched credit bet could climb to more than $7 billion and that the bank's traders may have intentionally tried to obscure the full extent of the red ink on the disastrous trades.
Mounting concerns about valuing the trades led the company to announce that its earnings for the first quarter were no longer reliable and would be restated. Federal regulators, who were already examining the trades, are now looking at whether employees of the nation's biggest bank by assets intended to defraud investors, according to people with knowledge of the matter.
The revelations left Jamie Dimon, the bank's chief executive, scrambling for the second time within two months to contain the fallout from the trading debacle. It has already claimed one of his most trusted lieutenants, compelled Mr. Dimon to appear before Congress to account for the blunder and prompted the bank to claw back millions in compensation from three traders in London at the heart of the losses. A top bank official said that the board could also seize pay from Mr. Dimon, but did not indicate that it would do so.
 Since announcing initial losses of $2 billion in May, Mr. Dimon, once vaunted for his risk prowess after navigating the bank deftly through the financial crisis, has worked to prove that any flaws in risk management are limited to the chief investment office, a once-obscure unit with offices in London and New York. But the latest news is prompting fresh questions about whether risk controls throughout the bank are weak.
"This points to fundamental and potentially widespread risk management failure," said Mark Williams, a professor of finance at Boston University, who also served as a Federal Reserve Bank examiner.
Much more than profits are at stake for Mr. Dimon. The mounting problems from the soured bets strengthen the hand of lawmakers in Washington who have been pushing to curtail the kind of risk-taking that led to the trading losses.
The possible deceptions came to light in a regulatory filing early Friday just before the bank reported its second-quarter earnings. While the bank posted a profit of nearly $5 billion despite the trading losses of $4.4 billion for the quarter, some analysts and regulators zeroed in on the valuation of the trades.
"If traders misrepresented a fact with the intent to defraud, they can be subject to criminal charges," said Alan R. Bromberg, a securities law expert at Southern Methodist University.
In contrast, investors appeared to accept Mr. Dimon's pledges that the bank had rooted out the problems and could reap record annual profits. They rallied behind the bank, sending its shares up nearly 6 percent, the best among its peers on an overall strong day for American stocks.
If the trades had been properly valued, the bank said it would have lost $1.4 billion on the position in the first quarter, bringing the total losses to $5.8 billion so far this year. In a conference call with analysts on Friday, Mr. Dimon said that the trade, under the worst market conditions, could result in another $1.7 billion in losses.
In a rare move, the bank seized millions in pay from three managers in the unit's London office who had "direct responsibility" for the blunder. People with knowledge of the clawbacks said that pay was taken back from Achilles Macris, Javier Martin-Artajo and Bruno Iksil, the trader who gained infamy as the London Whale for his large credit trades.
A lawyer for Mr. Macris declined to comment. A lawyer for Mr. Martin-Artajo could not be reached. Raymond Silverstein, a lawyer for Mr. Iksil, said his client believed he had "done nothing wrong and that he will be exonerated in due course." While the company did not indicate the total tally for the clawbacks, Douglas Braunstein, the bank's chief financial officer, said the bank could claim roughly two years of total compensation, including stock options.
Ina R. Drew, the senior executive who resigned as head of the chief investment office shortly after the trading losses, volunteered to give back her pay. The giveback is a precipitous fall for Ms. Drew, once one of Mr. Dimon's most trusted executives. Ms. Drew earned roughly $14 million last year, making her the bank's fourth-highest-paid officer. Ms. Drew declined to comment.
JPMorgan said that an internal investigation, led by Mike Cavanagh, a former chief financial officer at the bank, unearthed questions about how traders in the bank's chief investment office were valuing their bets. After combing through thousands of e-mails and phone call records of traders, senior executives at the bank feared that traders, in an attempt to disguise the magnitude of the losses, improperly marked their trades.
"Certain individuals may have been seeking to avoid showing the full amount of the losses in the portfolio during the first quarter," the bank said in a statement, but didn't indicate how many traders may be embroiled in the mismarking.
Certain tough-to-exit trades can be extremely difficult to value, according to current and former traders in the chief investment office. On some positions, "valuing a trade is like throwing a ball at a target while blindfolded," said a former trader who requested anonymity because of the continuing investigations into the trade. The Securities and Exchange Commission, which is one of several federal regulators investigating the trading losses, is interested in the valuation of the trades, according to a person briefed on the investigation.
Separately, federal regulators from the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency and the Federal Reserve Bank of New York stationed at the bank's Manhattan headquarters have been examining the valuation of the trades in weekly meetings with the staff at the chief investment office, according to current regulators who insisted on anonymity because the investigations have not concluded.
Mr. Cavanagh said that the executives within the unit were outmatched by the increasing complexity of the bets being made as the unit grew over the last several years. JPMorgan, Mr. Cavanagh, emphasized, is undertaking a "complete revamp of C.I.O. management." Part of that change began Friday, when the bank announced that Irvin Goldman, who had overseen risk for the chief investment office, was resigning.
Started roughly five years ago, the unit, which grew from a sleepy operation into a profit center, was also torn by internal strife between deputies in New York and London, according to current and former traders.
Mr. Dimon emphasized that the investment office was going to focus on conservative investments. The bank has moved the majority of the soured trade to JPMorgan's investment banking unit, where Mr. Cavanagh told analysts risk controls were strong.
Mr. Braunstein, the chief financial officer, told analysts that the decision to refile first-quarter earnings was made on Thursday, the day before the bank reported its second-quarter results. The change means that revenue for the first quarter fell by $660 million, and net income dropped by $459 million.
Mr. Dimon urged analysts Friday to focus on the bank's overall strength.
The bank reported a $4.96 billion profit for the second quarter, down 9 percent from $5.43 billion a year earlier. Revenue also fell to $22.2 billion, down 17 percent from the same period last year.
"All of our client-driven businesses had solid performance," Mr. Dimon said.
At one point during the earnings call, Mike Mayo, an analyst with Crédit Agricole Securities, asked whether the bank had reached a "tipping point" where it had become too unwieldy to manage.
Mr. Dimon answered with a succinct "no."

HEADLINE: Among Moguls, Affection for Obama Wanes

BYLINE: EVELYN M. RUSLI and AMY CHOZICK


HIGHLIGHT: While the president still has plenty of fans at Allen &#038; Company's annual gathering of media and technology magnates, some who were once ardent supporters of the president last time are ready to switch their vote to Mitt Romney. 

 BODY:
If President Obama is looking to raise money for his campaign this weekend, he may want to cross Sun Valley off his list. 
While the president still has plenty of fans at Allen & Company's annual gathering of media and technology magnates, the love has definitely waned since the last election. And some who were once ardent supporters of the president last time are ready to switch their vote to Mitt Romney. 
 "Four years ago, 85 percent of the people here were voting for Obama," said Wilbur L. Ross Jr., the billionaire investor. "Now, I'd be surprised if he had 50 percent." 
 "I voted for Obama last time, but not this time," said Roy J. Bostock, a Morgan Stanley director, who considers himself a liberal Republican. "The mood has definitely shifted."
 The posh retreat is known for deals not politics. But on this election year, it's impossible to avoid. 
Allen & Company, the investment firm that hosts the conference, is conducting its own straw poll and has distributed paper ballots to attendees, one media executive told DealBook. 
The list of attendees also includes several prominent politicians including Michael Bloomberg, the mayor of New York, and Rahm Emanuel, and the mayor of Chicago and former White House chief of staff. Gov. Chris Christie of New Jersey, who many believe is a future contender for the top job, also came back this year. 
All were out in full force on Thursday evening, working the lobby of the Sun Valley Resort, slinging back drinks, and chatting up moguls in the bustling Duchin Lounge. 
But politics has also bubbled to the forefront because of the economy. As titans of their industries, the elites of media and technology are naturally worried about the state of the consumer, jobless claims, the growing deficit, the regulatory environment and tax policies.
The anxiety was underscored on Thursday, when Warren Buffett told CNBC's Becky Quick, that the United States economy was slowing down and that Europe has "really started to slip pretty fast." 
At a separate panel that morning that featured Mr. Buffett, the former Wyoming senator Alan Simpson and the former White House chief of staff Erskine Bowles, Mr. Bowles said "chances are we're goin' over the fiscal cliff." The three also discussed Mr. Bowles and Mr. Simpson's proposed budget plan, which never received the full backing of President Obama. 
 "There's a lot of people here that really backed Simpson-Bowles. And I believe that Obama should have endorsed the plan," said Mr. Bostock. "This is not just the financial community."
The defections come as President Obama's campaign struggles to match Mr. Romney's fundraising prowess. Backed by some big billionaires, like the Las Vegas tycoon Sheldon Adelson, the former Bain Capital executive has become a magnet for deep-pocketed investors and corporate chieftains. 
As Nick Confessore of The New York Times wrote this week, Mr. Romney racked up $106.1 million in June, compared to just $71 million for Obama. 
Despite the headwinds for President Obama, some of his ardent supporters held their ground in Sun Valley, such as the old Hollywood guard.
"It doesn't matter about the opinion here, he's going to get re-elected 100 percent," said Jeffrey Katzenberg, chief executive of DreamWorks Animation and a 2009 Democratic National Committee fundraiser.
Robert L. Johnson, founder of BET, said that Mr. Obama "has done a terrific job art trying to solve a crisis that was handed to him." He added: "I think voters are willing to give him a second chance."
Still, other prominent Democratic donors expressed trepidation about Mr. Obama's chances at reelection, even as they reaffirmed support. "My opinion is that the people at this conference will vote how the financial industry and Wall Street will vote, and that's for Romney," said the billionaire Haim Saban. He added that he and his wife remain "staunchly for Obama."
Mr. Emanuel, in a black shirt and ivory-colored pants, arrived in Sun Valley late Thursday night and headed to the Duchin. When asked whether he thought the crowd of media and tech elites that packed the place would back Mr. Obama, Mr. Emanuel, using his colorful language, said he didn't know. "I just got here four hours ago," he said.
As the night wound down, Governor Christie, who some believe is a prime candidate for Mr. Romney's ticket, finally emerged from the bar. He strode through the lobby in high spirits, guffawing with friends, with his arm around Bobby Kotick, chief executive of Activision Blizzard.

HEADLINE: A Plea for Public Lands

BYLINE: JOANNA FOSTER


HIGHLIGHT: A mini-documentary series makes the case for shielding public lands from uranium and coal mining and natural gas drilling, saying that such activity only benefits industry. 

 BODY:
Theodore Roosevelt once said of the Grand Canyon: "Leave it as it is. You cannot improve on it." Addressing an audience at a conservation event this week in Washington, John Podesta, chairman of the Center for American Progress, had an addendum: "But we can sure mess it up."
He spoke after the premiere of the mini-documentary series "Public Lands, Private Profits" (see the trailer above), a collaboration between the Center for American Progress and the Sierra Club, at the event, billed as The Status of American Conservation 2012.
The films focus on three treasured places in the public trust that are threatened by private mining and drilling proposals, including areas around the Grand Canyon that are still open to uranium mining, a proposal to expand coal mining near Bryce Canyon National Park in Utah and the introduction of natural gas drilling around Bridger-Teton National Forest in Wyoming.
After the screening, Mr. Podesta and Michael Brune, executive director of the Sierra Club, jointly led a discussion about the appropriate use of the 700 million acres of public lands that belong to all Americans. One issue on the table was, Does the Obama administration's "all of the above" energy strategy mean an all-of-our-acres strategy?

Mr. Podesta noted that in recent years, conservation efforts have been under an enormous amount of pressure. "We have an anti-environment Congress, the likes of which I'm not sure have ever been seen before," he said. "There's also a lot of pressure to create an energy base in the U.S. for both economic and security reasons. The administration has also been so preoccupied by the recession that conservation issues have been on the back burner."
Despite all this, Mr. Podesta said, recent studies have shown that public support for the national parks is as high as it was back in 2009 and that every area that had been declared a national monument over the last 30 years has experienced above-average economic growth.
Mr. Brune called on President Obama to make the most of the next couple of months and use the Antiquities Act to permanently protect some of the most important landscapes in the country, including 1.7 million acres within the Grand Canyon watershed, half a million acres of grasslands in New Mexico and 1.5 million acres in the Arctic.
"if you look at what's happening in Congress on a daily basis or look at drilling plans across the West or up in Alaska, in areas we've worked for half a century to protect, it's easy to get into a defensive crouch and just put all your energy into trying to prevent the worst things from happening," Mr. Brune said. "As advocates, it's important for us to play defensive, but we need to put more energy into our offensive, because that produces the victories we can celebrate for decades to come."
"There are places that are just worth protecting because they are part of our national character," Mr. Podesta said.
"I think when any president looks back at his years in office, it is so often his efforts to protect public lands that our the proudest part of his legacy," he added.

HEADLINE: The Early Word: In With the Old

BYLINE: EMMARIE HUETTEMAN


HIGHLIGHT: Both parties seem to be stuck in the past this presidential election, and experts say the economy will grow, albeit slowly, in the coming months. 

 BODY:
In Today's Times:

        
While presidential campaigns often focus on new ideas for the future, both sides are spending this election relitigating old battles over health care and taxes. It may just be early in the race, but perhaps it's also a reflection of the austere economic and political times, Peter Baker writes.

        
The economy should pick up a little through the summer and heading into the fall, a broad range of experts say. Despite recent less-than-encouraging economic data, some economists point to lower gas prices and encouraging signs in the housing market and new car sales, though they caution that the pace of growth will be sluggish, Annie Lowrey reports.

        
Gov. Rick Scott was quick to say Florida would opt out of expanding Medicaid under President Obama's health care law, but it may not be so easy. Advocates for the poor and hospitals are some of those who plan to push back, saying opting in is not just the right thing to do morally but also economically, Abby Goodnough reports.

        
The Obama and Romney campaigns continued to trade shots Thursday over whether Mitt Romney was in charge of Bain Capital when some of its companies moved workers overseas. In the absence of definitive proof, the Obama camp called it the "Bain lie," while Mr. Romney's campaign manager said the Obama campaign had "hit a new low," Michael D. Shear reports.

        
Facing the prospect of a divisive intraparty fight on the House floor, Republicans may delay voting on the first significant overhaul of the country's farm and nutrition program until after the elections, Ron Nixon reports.

HEADLINE: With Charlie Rose, Obama Reflects on Lessons Learned

BYLINE: REBECCA BERG


HIGHLIGHT: In an interview scheduled for broadcast this Sunday, President Obama now says he should have focused more on creating a positive narrative for Americans. 

 BODY:
In an interview with Charlie Rose for CBS News, scheduled for broadcast this Sunday, President Obama reflected on the lessons he has gleaned from his first term. In the past, he has faulted himself for not being tough enough with his opposition in Congress.
But in the interview, which was taped in the Blue Room of the White House on Thursday and will be broadcast in full on "CBS Sunday Morning," Mr. Obama said he should have focused more on creating a positive narrative for Americans.
"The mistake of my first couple of years was thinking that this job was just about getting the policy right, and that's important," Mr. Obama said. "But, you know, the nature of this office is also to tell a story to the American people that gives them a sense of unity and purpose and optimism, especially during tough times."
When Mr. Obama considered a similar question late last year in an interview with Barbara Walters of ABC News, he said he thought "probably once a day" about his shortcomings in his first few years as president. During that interview, Mr. Obama said his mistakes included not being firmer in negotiating with Republicans in Congress.
In his interview with Mr. Rose, in a week that saw heightened public scrutiny of Mitt Romney's tenure at the private equity firm Bain Capital, Mr. Obama not surprisingly said he thinks a thorough examination of Mr. Romney's record at Bain is "entirely appropriate."
"Well, I think that when you run for president, everything is called into question," Mr. Obama said. "When you're president, everything is called into question."
Because Mr. Romney has trumpeted his business bona fides on the campaign trail, Mr. Obama said, his record on job creation should be subject to scrutiny.
"When some people question why I would challenge his Bain record, the point I've made there in the past is, if you're a head of a large private equity firm or hedge fund, your job is to make money," Mr. Obama said. "It's not to create jobs. It's not even to create a successful business, it's to make sure that you're maximizing returns for your investor.
"Now that's appropriate," Mr. Obama continued. "That's part of the American way. That's part of the system. But that doesn't necessarily make you qualified to think about the economy as a whole, because as president, my job is to think about the workers. My job is to think about communities where jobs have been outsourced."
The president's comments coincided with elevated acrimony between his campaign and Mr. Romney's, driven by a report in The Boston Globe this week. The report cited Securities and Exchange Commission documents that suggested that Mr. Romney was still chairman and chief executive of Bain Capital as late as 2002, during a period when Bain invested in companies that outsourced jobs to other countries. Mr. Romney has stated previously that he left Bain in 1999 to run the Salt Lake City winter Olympics.
In response, Charlyn Lusk, a spokeswoman for Bain, said Thursday that Mr. Romney "has had absolutely no involvement with the management or investment activities of the firm or with any of its portfolio companies since the day of his departure" in 1999.
Mr. Romney will also be appearing Friday in interviews with CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN and Fox News.

HEADLINE: In Interviews, Romney Demands Apology From Obama

BYLINE: MICHAEL D. SHEAR


HIGHLIGHT: In several network interviews, Mitt Romney said President Obama's campaign made "absurd" allegations about his role at Bain Capital. 

 BODY:
9:19 p.m. | Updated A revised version of this post is available here.
6:33 p.m. | Updated Mitt Romney on Friday night demanded an apology from President Obama for making what he called "reckless" and "absurd" allegations about his record while repeating his insistence that he left Bain Capital in 1999 to run the Olympics.
In several network interviews, Mr. Romney said Mr. Obama "absolutely" owes him an apology for an adviser's comment that the Republican candidate might have committed a felony by lying about his role at the private equity firm.
"What kind of a president would have a campaign that says something like that about the nominee of another party?" Mr. Romney asked during a brief interview with CBS News. Earlier, on CNN, Mr. Romney called the accusation of criminal behavior, which came on Thursday from Mr. Obama's deputy campaign manager, "disgusting" and "demeaning" and said it was destructive to the political process.
"It's something that I think the president should take responsibility for and stop it," Mr. Romney said.
Instead, Mr. Obama on Friday added his voice to the attacks on Mr. Romney's record at Bain Capital, telling a local news anchor in Virginia that Mr. Romney should answer lingering questions about what his role was at the firm.
"I think most Americans figure if you are the chairman, C.E.O. and president of a company that you are responsible for what that company does," Mr. Obama said on WJLA, an ABC affiliate. "Ultimately Mr. Romney, I think, is going to have to answer those questions."
The back and forth between the rivals for the presidency capped one of the most intense 48 hours of the 2012 campaign, with both sides angrily accusing the other of outright lies and distortions. 
Mr. Obama is running millions of dollars in television advertisements calling on Mr. Romney to reveal more about his personal taxes, offshore bank and investment accounts, and linking him to investments made at Bain from 1999 to 2001, when Mr. Romney says he was no longer at the company. On Thursday, the president's aides said Mr. Romney was either lying on federal documents or to the American people.
That allegation, in particular, has clearly made Mr. Romney angry. He repeatedly denounced it during the interview on CNN, asking "is this the level that the Obama campaign is willing to stoop to?"
Mr. Romney's rare appearances on five networks Friday night attested to his campaign's desire to respond to the president's charges. But in all five interviews, Mr. Romney stuck firmly to his campaign's defense, saying that he was not at Bain after 1999 and refusing to release multiple years of tax returns.
"I left any responsibility whatsoever, any effort, any involvement whatsoever in the management of Bain Capital after February of 1999," Mr. Romney said on ABC News. He said Mr. Obama and his team were making false charges "because the president's failed to do the job that he was elected to do, which was to get this economy turned around."
Mr. Romney's campaign has produced television ads this week charging Mr. Obama with running a dishonest campaign and using clips of Hillary Rodham Clinton, the secretary of state, angrily denouncing Mr. Obama during the 2008 Democratic primaries.
But the interviews on Friday night may in part be designed to bolster the reach of Mr. Romney's advertising campaign, which has been hampered by a quirk in financing which has temporarily left Mr. Romney without the resources to mount an overwhelming response to the Democratic attacks, according to sources close to the campaign.
Most of the money that Mr. Romney has raised in the last several months can be used only in the general election, which begins after the party's national convention this summer, the sources said. The long and contentious Republican primary drained Mr. Romney of much of the money he could spend before then.
That has left Mr. Romney somewhat short of cash, though the campaign is broadcasting advertisements this week slamming Mr. Obama for misleading attacks.
By granting interviews to all the major networks, Mr. Romney is likely to ensure that clips from the interviews will be replayed all weekend long. And what he says is likely to be the subject of conversation during the Sunday morning news programs.
An earlier version of this post misstated the time of the CNN interview. It will take place at 6 p.m. Eastern time, not 4 p.m.

HEADLINE: In Search for Female Running Mate, a Shortlist for Romney

BYLINE: NATE SILVER


HIGHLIGHT: If Mitt Romney wanted to pick a woman this year, whom might he choose? FiveThirtyEight looks at 14 potential candidates. 

 BODY:
Correction Appended
I'm not going to waste my time, or yours, speculating about whether Condoleezza Rice might become Mitt Romney's running mate when there is no credible reporting to that effect.
But it does seem as though the days when the four candidates on the major-party tickets are all men will be coming to an end, and soon. Sarah Palin gave women a shot at shattering the glass ceiling four years ago. If Mr. Romney wanted to pick a woman this year, whom might he choose?
Actually, Mr. Romney has a bit of a problem. The Republican women with the most traditional qualifications for the vice presidency tend to be moderates, especially on abortion choice, probably making them unacceptable to the Republican base. Another group of up-and-coming female governors and senators may not be adequately seasoned for the rigors of the campaign trail. The few exceptions are probably too old, or too controversial, to be smart choices with swing voters. It has nothing to do with their gender, but any of the women that Mr. Romney might choose would be at least a little risky.
Let's start by drawing up a "long list" of potential candidates. The qualifications for this are pretty straightforward. You have to be a woman, and a Republican. And you have to have served as governor or U.S. senator in the past five years, or as an alternative, have run for president before.
There are 14 women that meet these criteria. However, all 14 fall into one or more of the problematic categories that I described before.
Potentially Unacceptable to Republican Base
Senator Susan Collins of Maine
Former Gov. Linda Lingle of Hawaii
Senator Lisa Murkowski of Alaska
Former Gov. M. Jodi Rell of Connecticut
Senator Olympia J. Snowe of Maine
Senator Kay Bailey Hutchison of Texas
The first five women on this list have generally supported abortion choice -- some mostly so, and some more emphatically. That could make them unacceptable options to many Republican base voters, and to many of the delegates at the Republican National Convention, especially since Mr. Romney's history of varied positions on abortion makes him somewhat wobbly on the issue. (Ms. Rice would also have problems along these lines; she has described herself as "mildly pro-choice.")
Recall that four years ago, John McCain's strategists concluded that picking Ms. Palin, while risky, was nevertheless less of a risk than picking a running mate like Tom Ridge who supported abortion rights. Mr. Romney, who has generally run a prudent and cautious campaign, is unlikely to break form.
Most of the women on this list, like Ms. Snowe, take moderate stances on a host of issues along with abortion. The closest thing to an exception is Ms. Hutchison, who takes a conservative view on most issues. Though opponents of Ms. Hutchison have pointed to ambiguous statements she has made that seemed to suggest she supported abortion rights in certain cases, her press secretary, Dean Pagani, said the senator "considers herself to be pro-life on abortion." In any case, Ms. Hutchison did herself few favors with the Republican base by running to Texas Gov. Rick Perry's left in a primary challenge, and failing in that effort.
Potentially Unacceptable to Swing Voters
Representative Michele Bachmann of Minnesota
Gov. Jan Brewer of Arizona
Former Gov. Sarah Palin of Alaska
Most vice presidential nominees, like the presidential nominees themselves, tend to be roughly in the middle of their parties rather than at one of the wings. While the selection of Ms. Palin or Mrs. Bachmann might excite the Republican base, they are deeply unpopular figures with independent voters and would represent a clumsy attempt by Mr. Romney to thread the needle. 
Ms. Brewer is less well known as a national figure. But her very conservative stances on immigration would bring that issue to the fore, when Mr. Romney would presumably rather focus on the tepid economic recovery.
Would Be Oldest Vice President at Inauguration
Former Senator Elizabeth Dole of North Carolina
Ms. Dole is the only name on this list, apart from Mrs. Bachmann, to have officially run for president before -- although her candidacy, in 2000, was mostly a flop. Her strong personal qualities and long history of public service might nevertheless make her an interesting choice, but she would be 76 years old upon her inauguration next year.
That would make her the oldest vice president on inauguration by some margin; the current record-holder is Alben W. Barkley, who was sworn in at 71 in 1949. Since Mr. Romney, 65, is himself fairly old, and since the Constitutional function of the vice president is to be ready to step in if the president dies or resigns, that is probably disqualifying.
Limited National Exposure and Experience
Senator Kelly Ayotte of New Hampshire
Gov. Mary Fallin of Oklahoma
Gov. Nikki Haley of South Carolina
Gov. Susana Martinez of New Mexico
All four of these women were elected to their current positions for the first time in the Republican wave year of 2010, and all come from small or medium-size states.
Some of them, particularly Ms. Ayotte and Ms. Martinez, have nevertheless drawn buzz as potential choices. But they would present several risks to Mr. Romney. 
First, none of them has much of a national profile (although Ms. Ayotte has sometimes been a surrogate for Mr. Romney on the campaign trail). It is simply hard to predict how a candidate will fare when they receive massive national exposure for the first time. Consider how many candidates who, like Mr. Perry and former Utah Gov. Jon M. Huntsman Jr., had eminently strong credentials, but were soon exposed as weak campaigners. Vice presidential nominees, who are thrown into the news media spotlight with just a few months remaining until the election, have even less opportunity to learn on the job.
The best hedge is to pick someone who has actually run for president or vice president before: a description that fits only Ms. Palin, Mrs. Bachmann and Ms. Dole, all of whom are likely unacceptable for other reasons. Absent that, the closest approximation might be picking someone from a large state with competitive media markets and a diverse population, which better simulates the national environment than a state like New Hampshire might. 
Or you might pick someone who had been in office for long enough to have built up some national name recognition, making them less of an unknown. Any of these women might meet that standard in four or eight years, but they do not right now.
Apart from the fact that an untested vice presidential nominee might be a mediocre campaigner, there is also some chance of a serious problem turning up in his or her background. Vice presidential vetting processes have missed large problems in candidates including Spiro T. Agnew and Thomas Eagleton (and possibly John Edwards, depending on the timing of his marital improprieties). There is no reason to suspect women like Ms. Ayotte of any wrongdoing, but from an actuarial standpoint, these problems seem to occur more often with relatively inexperienced candidates.
Finally, even if these candidates proved to be adept campaigners and had few or no vetting problems, their relative lack of experience could itself be an issue to voters, as it was for Mrs. Palin.
Of course, if Mr. Romney feels as though he needs to pursue a high-risk strategy to win the White House, then he might be willing to take a chance on an inexperienced candidate, or one who might anger his base. Many of these women are bright, talented politicians who will be in the national spotlight for decades to come.
For the time being, however, Mr. Romney remains close to President Obama in the polls, and could easily win the election without circumstances changing much. And an unsuccessful vice presidential choice generally harms a candidate more than a good one can help. If he's playing it safe, it will probably be another four years until the glass ceiling is broken.

HEADLINE: Options For Savers Seeking Better Rates

BYLINE: By TARA SIEGEL BERNARD

 BODY:
If you're a saver, you're probably frustrated, even angry. There's nothing worse than being punished for good behavior, and that's exactly how it feels if you're trying to amass a pile of cash before making a big purchase, particularly when banks pay interest rates that don't come close to keeping pace with inflation.
That frustration is precisely what prompted Mark Sweeting, a high school history teacher in Portland, Ore., to pull his emergency savings fund out of an online savings account at ING Direct. It had lured him two years ago with an annual rate of 1.25 percent that has since dwindled by more than a third.
''It just seemed so obnoxious,'' he said, adding that he recently moved his money to Barclays, which is paying 1 percent. ''The more money I had in my emergency account, the less and less it made.'' 
He said that he was well aware that his new rate might eventually sink, too, but that he would continue playing the rate-chasing game.
Other consumers are tempted, or at least curious, about potentially riskier options beyond the world of federally insured savings -- perhaps short-term bonds or dividend-paying stock funds. But what sort of trade-off does that entail? And are there any safer alternatives?
I asked several advisers how comfortable they were with the risk of options that might pay a little more.
Some were slightly more cautious, but most offered similar advice: if you're more concerned about the return ''of'' your capital, then you probably shouldn't get too ambitious with the return ''on'' your capital, as advisers like to say, particularly if you expect to tap the savings in five years or less.
''Consumers also need to be aware of their natural behavioral instinct to believe that someone out there can find the silver bullet for them that will give them the return they want at minimal risk,'' said Barry Korb, a financial planner and president of Lighthouse Financial Planning in Potomac, Md.
You don't have to dig too far back to find examples of people burned by investments that promised higher yields in exchange for only a tad more risk. Remember auction-rate securities? Sold by brokers, these investments froze during the financial crisis, locking investors out, even though the securities were billed as safe and liquid as cash.
And then there was Charles Schwab's YieldPlus Fund, which was marketed as a cash alternative but whose value plunged by more than 42 percent during the financial crisis.
Given that rates are at record lows and are expected to stay that way for the next few years, finding options that beat the national averages will take a bit of work.
Currently, the national average on an interest-bearing, federally insured savings account is a meager 0.13 percent, according to Market Rates Insight, a financial data research firm, down from 0.79 percent in July 2007.
And the national average rate on certificates of deposit -- with maturities from three months to five years -- is 0.70 percent, down from 4.56 percent in July 2007.
''Based on a statistical analysis that I did going back even further, almost 50 years, interest rates on deposits have never been this low,'' said Dan Geller, executive vice president at the firm.
Considering that the inflation rate is running at about 1.7 percent a year (and many consumers are experiencing even higher costs), many savers are losing purchasing power. So here are a few options to consider.
LESS THAN A YEAR OR TWO For people who need to tap their funds within a year -- whether for an emergency or a short-term goal like a down payment on a home or a car -- experts advise keeping your money as liquid and safe as possible.
So you might start searching for a higher-yielding online savings account on Web sites like MoneyRates.com, Bankrate.com or MoneyAisle.com, where bank and credit unions ''bid'' on how much they're willing to pay you in interest (though a recent search in my Brooklyn ZIP code yielded an unimpressive 0.50 percent).
When evaluating these accounts, pay close attention to any investment minimums, fees or other restrictions. For now, TIAA Direct appears to be offering one of the highest-yielding savings rates at 1.24 percent.
The Web site Nerd Wallet has come out with a monthly interest-rate monitor, which lists deposit accounts that beat one measure of inflation, as my colleague Ann Carrns recently pointed out on our Bucks blog. Many of the accounts were offered by credit unions, which usually have eligibility restrictions, but it's worth perusing.
Certificates of deposit obviously aren't as liquid as savings accounts, but you can seek out higher-yielding C.D.'s with terms that will mature when you need the money. Or, you can consider playing a little game with Ally Bank's five-year C.D., which pays 1.73 percent; it charges a penalty that amounts to 60 days' worth of interest if you withdraw your money before the C.D. matures. This lets you take advantage of a relatively attractive rate with a minimal penalty should rates spike and you want to reinvest your money elsewhere, Mr. Korb said. He figures that plunking your money into Ally's five-year certificate of deposit, as long as you can keep your money there for about six months, would be a better choice than its one-year C.D., which pays 1.01 percent.
Savings accounts, C.D.'s and money market deposit accounts are generally insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation up to $250,000per depositor per bank. Federally insured credit unions generally follow the same rules as banks. (And money market deposit accounts shouldn't be confused with money market mutual funds, which are not insured; the seven-day average rate on taxable money funds was a mere 0.03 percent as of July 3, not far from its record low, according to iMoneyNet.)
TWO TO OVER THREE YEARS Several financial planners recommend sticking with the ultrasafe options described above even if you have a little more time. But short-term bond funds may be appropriate for some savers, as long as they fully understand and can handle the risks.
So what are the risks? Rising interest rates, for one. When rates rise, bond prices will fall. This is especially important for bond fund investors; if you hold an individual bond until maturity, you will generally receive your initial investment back. But assembling this type of portfolio typically isn't cost-effective for smaller investors.
Bond funds with shorter maturities are less susceptible to interest rate risk. That's why it is important to pay attention to a fund's duration, which measures its sensitivity to rate changes. Generally speaking, for every percentage point that rates rise, a bond's value will decline by its duration (stated in years). So if rates climb by one percentage point, the value of a bond fund with an average duration of two years will drop by 2 percent.
''If you absolutely need X amount on a certain date, such as for a college tuition bill that must be paid by Aug. 25, that's one thing,'' said Russell Wild, an investment adviser and bond expert. But if you have some ''fudge room'' for hitting a short-term goal, like buying a car, he said you may consider splitting your money between a savings account and a short-term bond fund that invests in high-quality, or investment-grade, bonds, like the Vanguard Short-Term Investment-Grade Fund. The fund currently pays 1.59 percent (after expenses) for those with at least $3,000 to invest, and pays an even higher 1.70 percent for people who put in more than $50,000. (A more diversified but lower-yielding alternative is the Vanguard Short-Term Bond Index fund.)
The danger, of course, is that you can lose money. Beyond interest rates, there are other potential pitfalls, including the risk of default. Mr. Wild points out that, during the height of the financial crisis in 2008, the investment-grade bond fund lost 4.65 percent. ''It's a gamble you're taking, for sure,'' he said. ''But the odds are heavily in your favor.''
Other low-cost options recommended by planners included the Vanguard Short-Term Treasury Fund, which invests only in government-backed Treasury securities and has an average duration of 2.2 years (but it currently yields a meager 0.23 percent). People in higher tax brackets may consider the Vanguard Short-Term Tax-Exempt Fund, which invests in municipal securities -- meaning investments that are generally exempt from federal income taxes, unless you're subject to the alternative minimum tax -- with an average duration of 1.2 years and currently yielding 0.42 percent.
''If one is considering investing in an ultrashort bond fund, keep in mind that they can vary significantly in their risks and rewards,'' said George Kiraly Jr., president of the LodeStar Advisory Group in Short Hills, N.J. Review the credit quality and maturity dates of the fund's investments, as well as its duration and overall costs, he added. Also look at how well it performed during the crisis of 2008. And he said all bets were off if the financial crisis in Europe intensifies, which could increase the risk of default, potentially for corporate as well as government bonds.
''Always be skeptical of any investment that promises you a greater potential for return at no additional risk,'' he cautioned.
Several advisers said the extra returns that some funds might provide were simply not worth the risk. ''In the current environment, people need to save their way to meet short-term financial goals,'' said Jerry Verseput, a financial adviser in Folsom, Calif., ''and not try to invest their way to short-term goals.''

HEADLINE: As Bad as It May Be Here, It's Worse in Europe

BYLINE: By FLOYD NORRIS. 
Floyd Norris comments on finance and the economy at nytimes.com/economix.

 BODY:
THE pace of job growth fell sharply in the United States this spring, according to the Labor Department, and consumer spending weakened.
But while the June numbers showed no uptick in hiring, they did contain indications that consumers had more money to spend because those with jobs were working longer and being paid more. 
''The latest report held some very good news, which was widely overlooked,'' said Ed Yardeni, of Yardeni Research, an economist and longtime Wall Street strategist. ''This could very well lead to surprising strength in retail sales in June and July.''
He pointed to a Labor Department index of total hours worked, which rose to the highest level since 2008, and to an index of total private sector payrolls. As can be seen in the accompanying charts, that index, after being basically flat for three months, accelerated. As a result, he said, ''consumer spending should soon show renewed vigor.''
The fact that those with jobs are working longer hours may eventually lead to an uptick in hiring, but few expect rapid improvement. The minutes of the June meeting of the Federal Open Market Committee, released this week, said most members had reduced their expectations of employment growth.
A slow decline in the unemployment rate, now at 8.2 percent, would be unimpressive when compared with past recoveries, a point Republicans are sure to make often as President Obama seeks re-election.
But if the American economy were to be graded on a curve -- measured against the performance of other countries -- that performance might seem very impressive.
The Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, whose members include all large industrialized countries, issued its annual employment outlook report this week, forecasting rising unemployment in many countries.
An accompanying chart shows the forecasts for unemployment rates in all 34 countries that belong to the organization. The figures for each year are the average of the monthly numbers, so the forecast of 8.1 percent in 2012 for the United States implies that the rate will fall below 8 percent by late 2012. The average for 2013 is predicted to be 7.6 percent, 1.3 percentage points below the 2011 rate.
In most countries, the organization expects that rates in 2013 will be higher than they were in 2011. Only in Estonia and Iceland are rates expected to have fallen faster than in the United States.
''You may think you've got it bad in the U.S.,'' said Mark Keese, the head of the O.E.C.D.'s employment division, ''but they are a lot worse in Europe.''
Of the 15 Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development members that use the euro, only Germany and Estonia are expected to have a decline in unemployment. The five countries with the highest forecast increases in unemployment are all users of the euro. Four of them -- Italy, Portugal, Spain and Greece -- are widely viewed as troubled, but the presence of the Netherlands near the bottom is a bit of a surprise and an indication that the economic slowdown in Europe is not restricted to countries whose governments are having difficulties in borrowing.

GRAPHIC: CHARTS: A Little Light Amid the Gloom: A run of poor job reports has raised concerns about the United States economy, but one economist says a June increase in wages and total hours worked may indicate that consumer spending, which has lagged recently, is recovering. And the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development forecast this week that the United States unemployment rate was likely to continue declining while similar rates would rise in many other developed countries.

HEADLINE: Cash Proves Seductive, High Times or Down

BYLINE: By DANIEL M. GOLD

 BODY:
It's no surprise that ''Serious Money,'' Caryl Churchill's feral 1987 satire of London traders and corporate raiders, seems as relevant as ever. But still. Even as this revival opens at Atlantic Stage 2, the Libor rate-rigging scandal continues to shake global markets. Timely? One character -- an American arbitrageur who buys companies to plunder them and winds up running for president -- is named Bain, er, Baines. If there's a sharper-edged evening of entertainment in Manhattan at the moment, it involves juggling knives.
Ms. Churchill wrote ''Serious Money'' in the wake of the Big Bang, the Thatcher-era deregulation of British markets. It was unruly and relentless, much more savage than either Oliver Stone's film ''Wall Street'' or Jerry Sterner's play ''Other People's Money,'' two American productions that would subsequently try to confront the ethics of that gilded age. ''Serious Money'' was a sensation in London and then Off Broadway. (When it was hustled from the Public Theater to Broadway, though, it closed in two weeks.) 
In the Potomac Theater Project production, the over-the-top comedy remains raw and urgent, a scathing critique of capitalism that has no use for balance. Even if ''Serious Money'' is regarded as one of the finest works of Ms. Churchill (''Cloud 9,'' ''Top Girls,'' ''A Number''), it's also one of the most demanding, on cast and audience alike. Most actors assume multiple roles, talk fast and in verse (the dialogue, salted with vulgarities, is mainly written in couplets), interrupt one another or overlap. Matching elements of Restoration comedy and Brechtian theatricality with the clamor of the trading floor, this play maintains a breakneck pace and doesn't really care if you can keep up.
All of the nearly two dozen characters are willing to swap whatever other values they prize for a big score. The plot nominally concerns Jake (Mat Nakitare) and Scilla (Tara Giordano), brother-and-sister traders equally committed to achieving the life of high rollers. When Jake turns up dead, Scilla hopes to find his killer, though over time it's clear she just wants a share of his payoffs for the inside information he's sold to his contacts.
There's Zackerman (David Barlow), an American wheeler-dealer working with Corman (Alex Draper), a British raider looking to take over an old-line company, Albion. As Albion responds, and Corman redoubles his efforts, other investors are brought in, including Marylou Baines (Megan Byrne) from the States, and Jacinta Condor (Jeanne LaSala Taylor), from Peru. Forget about your murder, Jake; it's high finance.
This production, smartly directed by Cheryl Faraone, is swift and sleek; the cast is nimble, dancing in tightly choreographed numbers, chanting wickedly amusing songs (with lyrics by Ian Dury) at the end of each of the two acts.
Of special note are Ms. Giordano's cleareyed Scilla, Mr. Barlow's oily Zackerman and Ms. Taylor's seductive Jacinta, wielding her purring accent like the financial instrument it is: ''Sexy greedy,'' the play notes, ''is the late '80s.'' The spare, clever set by Hallie Zieselman features chandeliers that double as telephone banks and Champagne bars.
''Serious Money'' opens with a brief excerpt from a 17th-century comedy, ''The Stock-jobbers,'' by Thomas Shadwell, and the message is clear: Financial manipulations have been going on for hundreds of years. Rarely, though, have they been more wittily skewered from the stage.
''Serious Money'' continues through July 29 at Atlantic Stage 2, 330 West 16th Street, Chelsea; (212) 279-4200, ptpnyc.org.

HEADLINE: A Thriving Business in Mortgages Lifts Profit at Wells Fargo

BYLINE: By NATHANIEL POPPER

 BODY:
5:37 p.m. Updated
Wells Fargo reported its 10th consecutive quarter of earnings growth, propelled by a booming business originating and refinancing mortgages.
The bank's second-quarter profit was $4.6 billion, a record for Wells and a 17 percent increase from the $3.9 billion profit it reported a year earlier. Wells, which is based in San Francisco, earned 82 cents a share for the quarter, above the 81 cents that analysts polled by SNL Financial had expected. 
Wells has largely skirted the trading and derivatives controversies that have hit many of its large competitors, and it recently passed JPMorgan Chase to become the largest American bank by stock market capitalization. (JPMorgan has lost $25 billion in market value in recent months, after it disclosed a trading loss that could top $7 billion.)
Wells has expanded its Wall Street operations, like commercial lending, as others have cut back. But it has continued to rely largely on its consumer banking business, and particularly its mortgage lending division, which has benefited from record-low interest rates.
The bank originated $131 billion of mortgages in the second quarter, up from $129 billion in the first quarter of the year and up from $64 billion a year ago.
''Mortgage volumes have been much stronger than anyone expected a year ago, or even three months ago,'' the bank's chief financial officer, Timothy J. Sloan, said in a conference call on Friday morning.
The bank also expanded its lending to customers for car purchases and credit cards, which Mr. Sloan attributed to the improving financial situation of American consumers. The improving credit quality of the bank's customers has allowed the bank to set aside less money for loan losses.
''While consumers are still under stress on average, their health continues to improve,'' Mr. Sloan said in an interview.
Revenue across Wells Fargo was up to $21.3 billion, from $20.4 billion in the period a year ago. Profit was up at each of the bank's three business divisions: wholesale banking, community banking and wealth management.
''This quarter the numbers looked good, and the outlook generally remains pretty strong as well,'' said R. Scott Siefers, a bank analyst at Sandler O'Neill.
Wells took a hit on Thursday when it was announced that it would pay $175 million to settle Justice Department accusations that it discriminated against some minority homeowners seeking loans from 2004 to 2009. In making the settlement, Wells denied the charges.
Wells shares closed Friday up 3.2 percent, to $33.91. The company began the year trading at about $28.
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

HEADLINE: What They Knew

 BODY:
As the Barclays rate-rigging scandal threatens to engulf other big banks, politicians in Washington and London are asking whether regulators allowed years of manipulation of benchmark interest rates that are tied to trillions of dollars of loans and other transactions worldwide. The answer is hiding in plain sight. 
The rate-rigging settlement last month between Barclays and the Department of Justice includes a litany of findings that each side agrees are ''true and accurate.'' The document says that, in late 2007 and in 2008, Barclays employees raised concerns with the Bank of England, the Federal Reserve Bank of New York and other officials that Barclays and the other banks involved in setting the key London interbank offered rate, or Libor, were reporting rates that ''were too low'' and did not accurately reflect the market. It also said that Barclays told regulators it wanted to report ''honest rates'' and would if other banks did, too.
How did the regulators respond? According to the settlement, the communications from Barclays ''were not intended and were not understood as disclosures through which Barclays self-reported misconduct to authorities.''
That sounds to us as though neither Barclays nor presumably the other banks were told to stop the false reporting.
That basic outline of events is supported by documents released on Friday by the New York Fed. The documents, requested by a House subcommittee, indicate that, in April 2008, a Barclays employee told the New York Fed that Barclays was not reporting honest rates. In response, the Fed made inquiries into Barclays's reporting and passed its findings on to other authorities. In May 2008, Timothy Geithner, then the chief of the New York Fed, made recommendations to British authorities for reforming the Libor process. But those actions did not thwart Barclays's illegal activity, which continued through 2009.
Cleaning up and reining in the financial system will require exposing and reforming regulatory failures that let banks run amok. As several Democratic senators wrote to the Justice Department this week: ''Just like the banks and executives they oversee, regulators who were involved should be held to account for any failures to stop wrongdoing that they knew, or should have known about.''
But reform cannot stop there. The Justice Department is conducting criminal investigations into rate-rigging, and civil investigations and lawsuits are under way. Those are crucial to restoring trust in the system.

HEADLINE: For 1st Time in Four Months, Producer Prices Rose in June

BYLINE: By BLOOMBERG NEWS

 BODY:
Producer prices for finished goods unexpectedly rose in June for the first time in four months, reflecting an increase in food costs.
The 0.1 percent gain in the producer price index came after a 1 percent decrease in May, the Labor Department reported on Friday. The median estimate in a Bloomberg News survey of 70 economists called for a 0.4 percent fall. Excluding volatile food and energy, the so-called core measure increased 0.2 percent as projected. 
Also Friday, a survey showed confidence among consumers unexpectedly declining in July to the lowest level this year as Americans grew more pessimistic about their finances.
Weak growth in the United States may also limit price pressures through the production pipeline, reinforcing Federal Reserve policy makers' projections that inflation is likely to be subdued.
''Producer prices will be pretty much contained in coming months as commodity costs have come off,'' Kevin Cummins, an economist at UBS Securities in Stamford, Conn., said before the report. ''That's likely to persist. There are worries about global growth and demand in the U.S. is also slowing.''
Economists' estimate for producer prices ranged from an increase of 0.2 percent to a decline of 1.3 percent.
Compared with the same month a year ago, companies paid 0.7 percent more for goods, matching the 12-month gain in May as the smallest since October 2009.
The core index increased 2.6 percent in the 12 months ended in June, the smallest year-to-year gain since June 2011.
The gains in the producer price index were led by a 0.5 percent increase in food, reflecting the biggest increase in meat prices since July 2011, the report showed. Energy costs dropped 0.9 percent from May, which included a record 2.1 percent drop in residential electricity.
About 70 percent of the increase in the core measure was attributed to a 1.4 percent advance in the cost of light motor trucks, the biggest in a year.
Producer prices are one of three monthly inflation gauges reported by the Labor Department. The import price index fell 2.7 percent in June, the biggest plunge since December 2008, a report showed Thursday. Prices excluding fuel fell 0.3 percent, the most in almost two years.
The cost-of-living index, the broadest of the three measures, may have been little changed last month, economists predicted ahead of the July 17 data.
The Thomson Reuters/University of Michigan index of consumer sentiment dropped to 72 this month from June's 73.2 reading. The gauge was projected to rise to 73.5, according to 69 economists surveyed by Bloomberg News.
The weakest quarter of hiring by companies in two years along with stock market volatility tied to Europe's debt crisis threaten to hold back the household spending that accounts for about 70 percent of the economy.
''The labor market has been pretty slow to recover, house prices are still low and there's a lot of nervousness about what's going on in Europe'' and Washington, said Michael Hanson, a senior United States economist at Bank of America. ''The economy looks like it's slowing.''

HEADLINE: Return of Debtors' Prisons

 BODY:
A tenet of the American legal system is that it treats the poor and rich alike. The Supreme Court made this clear in 1970, 1971 and 1983, ruling that it is fundamentally unfair and violates equal protection under the Constitution for a judge to lock up an indigent or unemployed person because he cannot afford to pay a speeding ticket or a fine for a misdemeanor. 
Yet judges routinely jail people to make them pay fines even when they have no money to pay. As Ethan Bronner reported last week in The Times, minor offenders who cannot pay a fine or fee often find themselves in jail cells.
And felony offenders who have completed their prison sentences are often sent back to jail when they cannot pay fees and fines they owe because they could not earn money while locked up. Often, these defendants are not told that they have a right to a court-appointed lawyer to challenge their detention.
This devastating problem has gotten far worse the past five years, the result of budget-strapped state courts looking for sources of revenue and ever more poor people becoming ensnared in the court system. For decades, state court systems have gotten short shrift in the budget process and are often starved of revenue. Since the recession began, courts have increasingly had to fend for themselves by imposing fees on criminal defendants to address budget gaps. In Cambria County, Pa., for example, the Court of Common Pleas imposed 26 fees on a woman convicted of a drug crime, including $8 each for postage and judicial computers.
This revenue-oriented approach is made worse by the increasing use of for-profit companies to collect fees owed to the courts. They add hefty fees of their own to make their profits and have gotten judges to issue arrest warrants if someone has not paid up -- with no apparent need to consider a person's inability to pay.
State judicial leaders need to take on these indefensible practices. They should require trial judges to assess individuals' ability to pay and reduce fines to what an offender can afford or to impose community service time in lieu of fines. They also need to monitor and discipline judges who continue to allow the poor to be imprisoned, flouting the Constitution, Supreme Court holdings and basic fairness.

HEADLINE: A New and Better Tappan Zee: Albany's View

 BODY:
To the Editor:
Re ''Replacing the Tappan Zee Bridge'' (letter, nytimes.com, July 6): 
Most people agree that the Tappan Zee Bridge needs to be replaced now. It's a 56-year-old bridge that was built to last 50 years, its accident rate is double the state average, and it's a traffic nightmare with regular congestion and delays. Local residents and all New Yorkers deserve a new bridge that's safe and reliable.
Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo is committed to building a new and better bridge in a financially responsible way. The new bridge will be built to last for at least 100 years, and include eight general traffic lanes as well as additional wider lanes that would accommodate a pedestrian-bike lane, emergency breakdown lanes and a dedicated bus lane.
Building it now will help create or sustain more than 45,000 jobs and provide new economic opportunities for businesses on both sides of the Hudson River and across the entire Northeast region.
The new bridge will be equipped to support enhanced express bus service, bus rapid transit and commuter rail the day it opens. We are spending about $300 million today to maximize the public investment and guarantee that transit options are not prevented or delayed in the future.
The problem is not a lack of transit on the new bridge, but rather that the planning and construction of a separate, multicounty transit system would cause years of additional study and delay, and result in skyrocketing tolls and large local tax increases. We simply must build a new bridge, and build it now.

HEADLINE: Facing a Slowing Economy, China Turns to American Exports

BYLINE: By KEITH BRADSHER

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- A weakening Chinese economy, underlined by a further slowdown disclosed on Friday in Beijing, is starting to pose a headache for United States officials and the two presidential campaigns, as Chinese companies shift toward a greater reliance on selling to the American market.
A real estate bust in China and sweeping layoffs in the country's construction sector, together with slower growth in retail sales and declining exports to Europe, have left one area that is thriving: exports to the United States. 
But the result is a swelling American trade deficit with China in an election year. The bilateral deficit widened 10.2 percent in the first five months of this year compared with the gap in the period a year earlier, and preliminary data suggest that it widened further in June.
The deficit could swell even more as November approaches. The weakness of the Chinese economy is holding down its demand for American exports, even as Chinese exporters show a laserlike focus on selling to the American market.
The Obama administration has stayed silent about the Chinese export surge to the United States because it does not appear to stem from an explicit policy drafted in Beijing. The American market has become more appealing for many companies in China because of slowing demand in their home market and from Europe, as opposed to government subsidies or other policies.
But a call by China's premier, Wen Jiabao, on Tuesday for increased investment spending has stirred some concern in Washington. American officials had been pressing China to expand consumption instead of building ever more factories that could someday produce even more exports.
''I think it's worrisome because if China is going to do its tried and tested way of responding to an economic slowdown by increasing investment, it just sets the stage in the future for increased trade frictions,'' said an American trade official who spoke on the condition of anonymity because of diplomatic sensitivities.
Exporters like the Shenzhen Ezoneda Technology Company, a manufacturer of electrical extension cords and computer cables in southeastern China, are finding an attractive market in the United States and are becoming better able to supply it. After struggling as recently as late winter to recruit enough workers, exporters are now able to run assembly lines flat out as companies supplying the domestic Chinese market lay off workers or slow their hiring.
''It is easier to find workers now than in February, it is easier to find workers this year compared to last year,'' said Nick Tan, the sales manager at Shenzhen Ezoneda.
At the same time, slumping demand for steel and other commodities by construction companies and other businesses supplying the Chinese domestic economy has made it cheaper for exporters like Shenzhen Ezoneda to buy materials.
China announced on Friday that its economy grew at an annual rate of 7.6 percent in the second quarter, down from 9.5 percent in the period a year earlier. It was the sixth consecutive quarter of falling growth and the weakest officially acknowledged growth rate since the first quarter of 2009, at the bottom of the global financial crisis.
But the Chinese government also said on Friday that nationwide electricity production actually dropped 0.9 percent in June from a year earlier. That could be a sign of a much deeper slowdown. Lombard Street Research in London estimated China's annualized growth rate during the second quarter at a little less than 4 percent.
The Obama administration portrays its China policies as a success over the last three and a half years, pointing to a 7.2 percent appreciation in the renminbi against the dollar since President Obama took office. This has made Chinese exports costlier in the United States and American goods more affordable in China.
Add in faster inflation in China than in the United States over most of this period and the renminbi's real appreciation was 10.2 percent through May.
But the renminbi has slipped 1 percent against the dollar from its peak on May 2. The difference in inflation rates has also reversed in recent months, with producer prices in China down 2.1 percent in June from a year ago, even as they rose 0.1 percent in the United States.
The administration has stayed silent during the renminbi's modest retreat, not least because there is little evidence that the Chinese government has played much role in it. The renminbi has fallen less against the dollar than most emerging-market currencies in recent weeks.
Chinese companies have been slower in recent months to convert the dollar receipts from their exports back into renminbi, reducing demand for the Chinese currency. The renminbi has seemed less likely to appreciate and many companies are seeking ways to diversify their operations and investments overseas.
China's central bank has actually been restraining what would otherwise be a faster fall in the renminbi. It has done so by frequently pegging the start of each day's trading at a stronger level against the dollar than the close of the previous day's trading.
Chinese economic weakness, coupled with rising exports, poses challenges for presidential campaigns. Mitt Romney, the presumptive Republican presidential nominee, has portrayed China as an economic powerhouse that bends trade rules and has called for labeling China as a currency manipulator and challenging it on trade policies from his first day in office.
Asked about the latest signs of economic weakness in China, Andrea Saul, a spokeswoman for the Romney campaign, responded in a statement on Friday that, ''Regardless of China's economic performance, Governor Romney will insist from Day 1 that they put an end to their intellectual property theft, market restrictions and currency manipulation.''
The Obama administration faces constant pressure from labor unions to take a more confrontational stance toward China on trade. But the unions, generally supportive of his re-election bid, have stayed largely quiet in recent weeks.

HEADLINE: British Spymaster Says Iran Is 2 Years From Nuclear Bomb Capability

BYLINE: By ALAN COWELL

 BODY:
In an unusually public forum, the head of Britain's foreign intelligence agency, MI6, has forecast that Iran would likely achieve a nuclear weapons capability within two years, a British newspaper reported Friday.
The newspaper, The Daily Telegraph, quoted Sir John Sawers, once the ranking British diplomat on the Iranian nuclear issue and now head of the Secret Intelligence Service, as making the disclosure last week to a gathering of around 100 high-ranking civil servants.
The reported remarks play into a highly contentious debate over Iran's intentions and capabilities, in which estimates have varied widely. 
American intelligence agencies have cited a 2007 assessment stating that Iran, in fact, suspended research on nuclear weapons technology in 2003 and had not decided to take the final steps needed to build a bomb.
But Britain and Israel in particular, have interpreted the same data to mean that a decision has been made to move to a nuclear weapons capability. For its part, Iran has frequently said it has no intention of building such weapons.
Sir John was also said to have maintained that covert operations by British intelligence agents had prevented Iran from acquiring the technology as early as 2008. A British government official, speaking in return for anonymity under departmental rules, said Sir John had been ''speaking off the record to civil servants at a leadership event and what he said has been said by others before.''
According to The Daily Telegraph, the remarks were Sir John's first publicly reported assessment of Iran's nuclear ambitions since his appointment as head of MI6 in 2009. Iran, he said, was now ''two years away'' from becoming a ''a nuclear weapons state,'' The Daily Telegraph reported and when it achieved that status, the United States and Israel would have to decide whether to strike.
''The Iranians are determinedly going down a path to master all aspects of nuclear weapons; all the technologies they need,'' he said. ''It's equally clear that Israel and the United States would face huge dangers if Iran were to become a nuclear weapon state.''
Iran says its nuclear program is designed for peaceful purposes but, reflecting the assessment that Tehran is seeking a nuclear weapons capability, the United States and its allies have imposed a tightening vise of economic sanctions, the latest Thursday, accompanying thus far inconclusive diplomatic efforts to persuade Iran to abandon nuclear enrichment.
Sir John said it was up British intelligence to ''delay that awful moment when the politicians may have to take a decision between accepting a nuclear-armed Iran or launching a military strike against Iran.''
''I think it will be very tough for any prime minister of Israel or president of the United States to accept a nuclear-armed Iran.'' Without previous efforts by British intelligence, he was quoted as saying, ''you'd have Iran as a nuclear weapons state in 2008 rather than still being two years away in 2012.'' He did not elaborate.
In recent years, several Iranian scientists have been assassinated on the streets of Tehran and a computer virus called Stuxnet has disrupted computer systems at nuclear facilities in Iran. Tehran has accused the American, Israeli and British secret services of conducting covert operations against it.
Sir John said MI6 has ''run a series of operations to ensure that the sanctions introduced internationally are implemented, and that we do everything we can within the Middle East to slow down these remaining problems.''
Earlier this month, low-level talks between Iran and the group of big powers over the Iranian nuclear program ended early with both sides saying the deputies of their top negotiators would meet at a later date. Their announcement gave no hint of progress but nonetheless suggested that neither side was ready to declare the effort a failure.
The talks, in Istanbul, were part of a series of negotiations this year and were held against a backdrop of increasingly bellicose oratory by Iran and the United States because of the nuclear impasse, which has started to raise tensions again in the Middle East.
Iran has renewed a threat to close the Strait of Hormuz, a vital Persian Gulf oil conduit, in response to intensified American and European sanctions meant to paralyze the Iranian oil industry as a pressure tactic in the nuclear talks. Iran has also said the new sanctions will have no effect on its resolve to prevail in the nuclear dispute.
Since 2010, Iran has been enriching some of its processed uranium to raise its purity from around 5 percent to 20 percent, saying it needs the concentrated fuel for a research reactor in Tehran. The purity is less than the 90 percent level needed for nuclear weapons, but facilitates further purification to weapons grade.
In 2011, Tehran said it would triple the amount of uranium enriched to 20 percent and slowly move the operation to a once secret enrichment plant known as Fordo deep inside a mountain near the holy city of Qum and widely considered by experts to be invulnerable to bombing.

HEADLINE: New York Fed Knew of False Barclays Reports on Rates

BYLINE: By MICHAEL J. DE LA MERCED and BEN PROTESS; Mark Scott contributed reporting from London.

 BODY:
9:27 p.m. Updated
The Federal Reserve Bank of New York learned in April 2008, as the financial crisis was brewing, that at least one bank was reporting false interest rates.
At the time, a Barclays employee told a New York Fed official that ''we know that we're not posting um, an honest'' rate, according to documents released by the regulator on Friday. The employee indicated that other big banks made similarly bogus reports, saying that the British institution wanted to ''fit in with the rest of the crowd.''
Although the New York Fed conferred with Britain and American regulators about the problems and recommended reforms, it failed to stop the illegal activity, which persisted through 2009.
British regulators have said that they did not have explicit proof then of wrongdoing by banks. But the Fed's documents, which were released at the request of lawmakers, appear to undermine those claims. 
The revelations fuel concerns that regulators are ill-equipped to police big banks and that financial institutions can game the system for their own purposes.
Even after authorities have beefed up oversight and lawmakers have enacted new rules, blowups on Wall Street continue to occur with some regularity. Amid the rate-manipulation scandal, regulators are also dealing with the fallout from the multibillion-dollar trading losses at JP Morgan Chase and the collapse of a second brokerage firm, just months after the failure of MF Global.
''I wish I could say I'm shocked, because it is shocking,'' said Frank Partnoy, the George E. Barrett professor of law and finance at the University of San Diego School of Law. ''But regulators have not been particularly effective or aggressive in the past two decades of finance.''
Regulators are now expanding their global investigation into the manipulation of key interest rates, a multiyear inquiry that has already examined more than 10 big banks, including UBS, JPMorgan Chase andCitigroup. In June, Barclays agreed to pay $450 million to settle claims that it reported bogus rates to deflect concerns about its health and bolster profits.
The Barclays case is the first major action stemming from the inquiry into how big banks set major benchmarks like the London interbank offered rate, known as Libor. The rate is essentially how much interest banks would pay to borrow money on a short-term basis from other financial firms, a process that is overseen by the British Bankers' Association, an industry trade group. Such benchmarks are used to determine the price of trillions of dollars of financial products, including mortgages and credit cards.
Since the Barclays settlement, lawmakers have focused their attention on regulators' role in the rate-manipulation controversy.
''As much as $800 trillion in financial products are pegged to Libor, so any manipulation of this rate is of serious concern,'' said Representative Randy Neugebauer, the chairman of the House Financial Services Subcommittee on Oversight and Investigations, which initially requested the documents from the New York Fed. ''We'll continue looking into this matter to determine who was involved in this practice and whether it could have been prevented by regulators.''
Timothy F. Geithner, who served as the head of the New York Fed during the crisis years, and other regulators raised concerns about Libor. But they did not stop the problems. As the regulators sought more information about the rate-setting process, they were consumed with trying to save the global financial system after the near collapse of Bear Stearns in 2008 and the failure of Lehman Brothers later that year.
Mr. Geithner, who is now the Treasury secretary, will most likely address the matter in Congressional testimony this month. The New York Fed has defended its actions.
''Following the failure of Bear Stearns and shortly before the first media report on the subject, we made further inquiry of Barclays as to how Libor submissions were being conducted,'' the New York Fed said in a statement. ''We subsequently shared analysis and suggestions for reform of Libor.''
The New York Fed learned about concerns over the integrity of Libor in summer 2007, when a Barclays employee e-mailed a New York Fed official, saying, ''Draw your own conclusions about why people are going for unrealistically low'' rates. Barclays wrote in a September report, ''Our feeling is that Libors are again becoming rather unrealistic and do not reflect the true cost of borrowing.''
But the New York Fed thought the reports amounted to market chatter and did not provide definitive proof of widespread manipulation. ''In the context of our market monitoring following the onset of the financial crisis in late 2007, involving thousands of calls and e-mails with market participants over a period of many months, we received occasional anecdotal reports from Barclays of problems with Libor,'' the New York Fed statement said.
The regulator started to identify real problems with the interest rates several months later. In April 2008, the Barclays employee mentioned to a New York Fed official, ''where I would be able to borrow'' in the Libor market, ''without question it would be higher than the rate that I'm actually putting in.''
That same day, New York Fed officials wrote in a weekly internal memo that banks appeared to be understating the interest rates they would pay.
''Our contacts at Libor contributing banks have indicated a tendency to underreport actual borrowing costs,'' New York Fed officials wrote, ''to limit the potential for speculation about the institutions' liquidity problems.''
After the April 2008 conversation, the New York Fed started notifying other American regulators, including the Treasury Department. Mr. Geithner reached out to British authorities as well, notably Mervyn King, the governor of theBank of England, and his deputy, Paul Tucker. Mr. Geithner suggested British authorities should ''eliminate incentive to misreport.''
In response, Mr. King passed on the recommendations to the British Bankers' Association , according to documents released by the Bank of England Friday. Mr. Tucker also arranged to talk toWilliam C. Dudley, the current president of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, who was then executive vice president of the regulator's markets group.
Angela Knight, the chief executive of the British Bankers' Association, who is stepping down at the end of the summer, said the suggestions from United States authorities would be included in a review of Libor. The trade body published its initial findings days after receiving Mr. Geithner's recommendations.
But regulators never addressed the fundamental problems with the rate-setting process. When the New York Fed raised concerns in 2008, Barclays has been trying to manipulate the interest rate for nearly three years, and the practice continued until 2009.

 BODY:
8 P.M. (HBO) IN TIME (2011) The director Andrew Niccol (''Gattaca'') imagines a future in which everyone stops aging at 25, after which a glowing green digital clock on the left forearm starts counting down 365 days and stops for good when those days run out -- unless people buy more time. Justin Timberlake plays Will, who has managed to add three years to his life, only to watch the cost of breathing keep going up. Matt Bomer is Henry Hamilton, a rich 105-year-old stranger who transfers a century to Will, thus ending his own life. Amanda Seyfried, above with Mr. Timberlake, is Sylvia, a babe whose father (Vincent Kartheiser, of ''Mad Men'') helps control the global time market. 
And Cillian Murphy is the head of the policelike Timekeepers, who blame Will for Henry's death. ''There's plenty to enjoy about that genre standard, which, with the help of the cinematographer Roger Deakins (shooting in digital), Mr. Niccol transforms into a neonoir gaudily washed in green and gold,'' Manohla Dargis wrote of what she called ''a couple-on-the-run flick'' in The New York Times. ''But then the characters open their mouths and start going on about minutes and hours, clocks and watches, and their time running out and not having enough time, and where's my time, don't waste my time, that time will get you killed, brother can you spare some time because, well, I'm all out.''
10:30 A.M. (13) RELIGION & ETHICS NEWSWEEKLY Tim O'Brien examines charges that some federal prosecutors have wrongfully withheld material evidence from defense lawyers.
NOON (13) RICHARD HEFFNER'S OPEN MIND Raymond W. Kelly, the New York City police commissioner, discusses crime, terrorism and new policing techniques.
12:30 P.M. (Reelz) MIDNIGHT EXPRESS (1978) The director Alan Parker draws on the real-life tale of Billy Hayes (Brad Davis, far right, with Mike Kellin), a 23-year-old college student who was sentenced to 30 years in Sagmalcilar, a Turkish prison with horrific conditions, after being convicted of smuggling hashish in 1970. The film earned six Oscar nominations and two wins, including one for Oliver Stone for best adapted screenplay.
1 P.M. (TNT) A PERFECT MURDER (1998) Steven Taylor (Michael Douglas), a reptilian Wall Street bond salesman about to lose his shirt, plots to knock off his wife, Emily (Gwyneth Paltrow, below with Mr. Douglas), a United Nations interpreter, and inherit her fortune in this update of Frederick Knott's play (and Alfred Hitchcock's film) ''Dial M for Murder.'' Viggo Mortensen portrays Emily's lover, a handsome painter, whom Steven offers $500,000 to do the dastardly deed or be exposed for the con man and gigolo he really is. ''Money, money, money,'' Stephen Holden wrote in The Times about this film from Andrew Davis. ''The creepiest aspect of 'A Perfect Murder' is that there really is no contest between love and money. The movie is right in tune with the icy Darwinian mood fostered by the booming late-'90s economy.''
8 P.M. (NBC) AN AMERICAN GIRL: McKENNA SHOOTS FOR THE STARS (2012) Jade Pettyjohn plays McKenna Brooks, a talented young gymnast who turns trials into triumphs in this latest adventure inspired by the American Girl dolls. McKenna has a shot at making a regional gymnastics team -- if she can maintain her grades. When a teacher suggests a tutor, an embarrassed McKenna is desperate to keep it a secret from her friends. Then a bad fall at the gym sidelines her, turning her dreams into something of a nightmare. Nia Vardalos, Ian Ziering, Kerris Dorsey and the former Olympic gymnast Cathy Rigby star.
10 P.M. (HBO) GEORGE LOPEZ: IT'S NOT ME, IT'S YOU In his third stand-up special on this network, taped at the Nokia Theater in Los Angeles, Mr. Lopez riffs on dating and marriage, alcohol and drugs, parenthood, irritating pets, Latino environmentalism, growing old and teaching children ''the hard way.''

At 12:40 a.m. the commission devises a way to link the Olympics with Queen Elizabeth's Diamond Jubilee: ''Jubilympics.'' KATHRYN SHATTUCK

HEADLINE: A Fuller Picture in the Small-Business Tug of War

BYLINE: By TRIP GABRIEL

 BODY:
Is it only right that wealthy Americans chip in more to help the government meet its obligations? Or does raising taxes on the rich hobble the country's ''job creators''?
When President Obama proposed this week to let the Bush-era tax cuts expire for high earners, polar-opposite reactions from Republicans and Democrats were as swift as they were consistent.
Mitt Romney repeated an argument he makes in almost every stump speech: that a tax increase on upper earners will slow hiring because most Americans work for small businesses, whose owners report earnings on their individual returns. 
''Fifty-four percent of American workers work in businesses taxed as individuals,'' Mr. Romney said at a fund-raising event in Montana on Wednesday, repeating a figure he uses often. ''So when the president wants to raise taxes on individuals -- as he's proposed from 35 percent to 40 percent -- he kills jobs.''
Mr. Obama had anticipated this objection when he proposed on Monday to extend middle-class tax breaks beyond 2012, while urging -- once again -- that rates rise on earned incomes of more than $200,000 for individuals and $250,000 for couples.
''Now, we can already anticipate -- we know what those who are opposed to letting the high-end tax cuts expire will say,'' Mr. Obama said at the White House. ''They'll say that we can't tax 'job creators.' ''
But most small-business owners would be exempt, he said, because ''97 percent of small businesses fall under the $250,000 threshold.''
Republicans, by reframing the issue of taxes on the wealthy into a debate about job creation, have cannily evoked Americans' patriotic support of small businesses as an engine of economic growth. Democratic and Republican politicians are equally given to praising small businesses for creating a majority of jobs.
But the world of small businesses -- more specifically, of individuals who report business earnings on their tax returns -- is complex. Many enterprises do not fit the rosy image of a tech start-up in a garage or a mom-and-pop florist.
Mr. Obama is correct that only a tiny sliver of business owners make enough to land in the top tax brackets. The Joint Committee on Taxation, a nonpartisan Congressional office, estimated last month that 3.5 percent of taxpayers with business income in 2013 would fall in the tax brackets that would rise under the president's proposal.
But the tax committee also supported Mr. Romney's assertion that this sliver represents a significant share of the economy: those top earners generate 53 percent of all small-business income.
Mr. Romney's figure that a majority of Americans, 54 percent, are employed at companies whose owners file taxes as individuals is from a report by the accounting firm Ernst & Young, according to the Romney campaign.
The report examined all types of ''flow-through'' businesses, in which profits pass from the business to the individual owners for tax purposes, including partnerships, sole proprietorships and other entities not subject to corporate taxes.
The number and share of the economy of flow-through businesses have steadily grown in recent decades, to the point that many would hardly be considered small businesses. Seventeen percent of workers in flow-through enterprises work at companies with more than 500 workers, according to Ernst & Young.
Flow-through businesses include large law partnerships and hedge funds. Before it went public in 1999, Goldman Sachs was a flow-through business.
Republicans often argue that the owners of flow-through businesses are sensitive to marginal tax rates in making hiring decisions.
''I used to run a small business; I used to have pass-through income,'' the House speaker, John A. Boehner, said on Tuesday, promising to kill the president's proposal in a vote later this month. ''I would have been affected by this tax increase that the president's calling for. This is not going to help our economy.''
But the question of whether small-business owners are encouraged or deterred by marginal tax rates is robustly debated by economists.
''If I've got $100 after taxes and you raise my tax rate and it goes down to $80, I might be less likely to go out and hire an additional worker, because I don't have enough cash on hand,'' said Douglas Holtz-Eakin, a former economic adviser to President George W. Bush. Mr. Holtz-Eakin has done research linking an entrepreneur's lower individual tax rate with a decision to hire more workers.
Another expert, William G. Gale, a director of the nonpartisan Tax Policy Center, disputed the notion that raising marginal tax rates on small-business owners depressed hiring. These businesses can deduct wages from their revenues, he said, with the potential to lower their effective tax rate.
''They can deduct everything in full,'' Mr. Gale said. ''It's a canonical result in economics that if you can immediately deduct the investment, then the effective tax rate should be zero.''
In any event, recent studies have challenged the notion that small businesses are a key engine of job creation. Older small businesses, it seems, cut more jobs than they create. Research by the economist John C. Haltiwanger and others showed that the only small businesses that create more jobs than they destroy are those less than five years old -- in other words, start-ups.
''The small-business sector per se is not necessarily a dynamic part of the economy,'' Mr. Gale said. Reducing taxes on high individual incomes across the board is applying too broad a brush, he said, to stimulate the fraction of small businesses that are young and innovating and generating most new jobs.

HEADLINE: At Times, Obama And His Cyberself Differ on Tactics

BYLINE: By MARK LANDLER

 BODY:
VIRGINIA BEACH -- For a moment on Friday, the cyber-Barack Obama was perfectly at odds with the flesh-and-blood version.
Speaking to 1,400 supporters at a high school here, President Obama voiced his familiar lament that ''there is so much negativity and so much cynicism'' in politics that he could understand if voters tuned out the election. Minutes earlier on Twitter, he had written, ''Why Mitt Romney's end date at his buyout firm matters,'' linking to a blog post about the tempest over his Republican challenger's departure from Bain Capital.
Mr. Obama's Twitter account is maintained by his campaign staff, which makes clear that only posts signed with the initials B.O. are actually written by him. That's fairly obvious, given that on Thursday, in between pounding Mr. Romney for perceived discrepancies in the Bain story, ''Barack Obama'' tweeted: ''Stickers! Get them here.'' 
But it underscores the vivid contrast between what Mr. Obama says, and what is often said in his name. The president did not address the questions about Bain Capital in his stump speech. In his first stop of the day, he even left out a line he has used about how Mr. Romney's buyout firm was celebrated as a ''pioneer'' of outsourcing.
As a busy day of campaigning unfolded, however, Mr. Obama shrugged off his reluctance to talk about Mr. Romney and Bain. The line about Bain being an outsourcing pioneer reappeared later in a speech in Hampton. And in an interview with a local TV station, WJLA, Mr. Obama said that Mr. Romney ought to answer questions about his relationship with the firm after he left in 1999 to run the Salt Lake City Olympics.
''Ultimately, Mr. Romney, I think, is going to have to answer those questions because if he aspires to being president, one of the things you learn is, you are ultimately responsible for the conduct of your operations,'' he said.
The Romney campaign did not give Mr. Obama any quarter either. Mr. Romney welcomed the president to Virginia with an open letter in The Virginian-Pilot, in which he said, ''Your insistence on slashing our military to pay the tab for your irresponsible spending could see over 200,000 troops forced from service.''
Virginia, a once reliably Republican state that Mr. Obama became the first Democrat to win since 1964, looms as one of the most hotly contested battlegrounds in 2012. The president acknowledged its potentially decisive role, telling an overflow crowd in Hampton before his speech, ''If and when we get Virginia, we will win this election.''
''Virginia, the reason I ran and the reason you supported me wasn't just to get back to where we were in 2007,'' the president said. ''The reason we came together was to restore that promise for middle-class families, and all who are striving to get into the middle class. That's what we're fighting for, and we've got a lot more work to do.''
Time to Talk Coaching
Mr. Obama's advisers say he savors unscripted encounters with voters, and occasionally these moments can be revelatory.
Dropping in for a beer last week at Ziggy's Pub and Restaurant in Amherst, Ohio, the president found himself explaining to a table of curious school administrators why the White House was waiving states' compliance with the No Child Left Behind law. Moments earlier, he had an intense exchange with Art Davis, a veteran of Iraq and Afghanistan, who complained about delays in processing disability claims for veterans.
But then there are encounters like his kitchen-table conversation with a Cedar Rapids couple, Jason and Ali McLaughlin. Though avidly promoted by the campaign, it got off to a desultory start, with Mr. McLaughlin and the president comparing notes about how they coach girls' sports teams (''Now, they run plays!'' Mr. Obama marveled about his daughter Sasha's team). Neither said a word about middle-class tax cuts -- the ostensible subject of the meeting -- until after the reporters had been ushered out.
Help for Veterans
Mr. Obama has assiduously cultivated military veterans, giving tax credits to employers that hire returning veterans and extracting pledges from companies like Procter & Gamble and Tyson Foods to hire 100,000 veterans and their spouses. He also brought home the last soldiers from Iraq and is winding down the war in Afghanistan.
The Romney campaign, however, is determined to sour any affection these voters have for Mr. Obama, warning that the automatic cuts in Pentagon spending that are part of the White House's budget deal with Congress could undermine the military-dependent economy in Virginia, with its large bases and shipbuilding industry.
''Virginia is probably going to be more devastated than any state in the union by this,'' said John F. Lehman Jr., a secretary of the Navy in the Reagan administration and foreign-policy adviser to Mr. Romney, on a call organized by the campaign. ''The president just doesn't understand defense. He just doesn't understand how it works.''
On Friday, Mr. Obama stopped at a smoky Veterans of Foreign Wars hall here and had lunch at Rick's Cafe with three wives of servicemen. ''I love the fact that this administration is focusing more on military families,'' said one, Jennifer Farlin. ''Prior to this, we felt lost.''
While the president is likely to make inroads with veterans of Afghanistan and Iraq, the broader military vote seems destined to stay in the Republican column. According to a Gallup poll conducted in April and May, 58 percent of veterans said they favored Mitt Romney, while only 34 percent supported Mr. Obama.
Music to Suit the Crowd
As Mr. Obama's campaign rallies settle into a routine, so, too, does his choice of music: a mix tape released by the campaign that runs the gamut from Arcade Fire to REO Speedwagon. The president usually takes the stage to U2's hit ''City of Blinding Lights,'' as he did in 2008. The opportunities for creativity, such as they are, come at the end of his stump speech, when Mr. Obama shakes hands and poses for pictures.
Then, the campaign seems to tailor its music to local tastes. Mr. Obama greeted auto workers in Toledo, Ohio, and veterans in Virginia Beach to the thumping chords of Bruce Springsteen's blue-collar anthem ''We Take Care of Our Own.'' In Cedar Rapids, the artsy city in Iowa where voters have known Mr. Obama from the earliest days of his first campaign in 2007, the soundtrack was U2's ''Even Better than the Real Thing.''
In Sandusky, Ohio, the local organizers chose a tune not on the playlist: ''Only in America,'' the politically androgynous country hit by Brooks & Dunn that has been a standard for years at Republican and Democratic rallies.

HEADLINE: Egypt's New President Is Being Undercut By State-Run Media

BYLINE: By DAVID D. KIRKPATRICK and MAYY EL SHEIKH; Mai Ayyad contributed reporting.

 BODY:
CAIRO -- Egypt's state news media, the traditionally admiring chronicler of Egypt's head of state, are at war with the new president.
To be sure, state broadcasters and newspapers here still appear to celebrate President Mohamed Morsi of the Muslim Brotherhood as Egypt's first democratically elected leader. That is also the official position of Egypt's top generals who took power at the ouster of Hosni Mubarak and now insist that Mr. Morsi's swearing-in fulfilled their promise of a civilian democracy.
But as Mr. Morsi moved this week to challenge the generals, the state media have quickly allied with the generals, persistently undercutting the new president while still ostensibly honoring his position.
That apparently contradictory result has made it clear who still holds the real power over the Egyptian bureaucracy. On Tuesday, for example, Mr. Morsi summoned back into session the democratically elected Parliament that the generals had dissolved after a hurried court ruling. But the headline in the newspaper Al Ahram reported only the statement of the ruling generals: ''The armed forces belong to the people and will remain on the side of the constitution and legitimacy.'' 
The only front-page article to focus on Mr. Mori's decision to recall the Parliament blamed it for causing the Egyptian stock market to tank. A front-page photograph depicted the president shoulder to shoulder -- and notably shorter -- next to the top military officer, Field Marshal Mohamed Hussein Tantawi.
While private news channels interviewed defiant lawmakers leaving the Parliament, the main state network switched to documentaries, including an anniversary tribute to Egypt's secret police.
The state media campaign against Mr. Morsi is part of a bewildering power struggle in the streets, the courts and back rooms that has all but paralyzed Egypt's government. With its economy sputtering and its currency at risk of collapse, Egypt badly needs a stable government that can make credible commitments to the lenders, beginning with the International Monetary Fund. But in the continuing standoff between Mr. Morsi and the generals, almost no one can say for sure who is in charge.
''It is like a psychological war in our midst, and no knows what is going on,'' said Mohamed Salem, 26, selling cigarettes in the street because he could not find a job.
The military council had seemed to be ''out of the game'' but still seized Parliament, Mr. Salem continued, growing agitated. And then Mr. Morsi had taken his oath before the constitutional court but immediately defied its authority. ''Who can understand this?'' he complained.
The war within the Egyptian state media offensive against the president has extended to coverage of a planned visit by Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton this weekend as well. Al Ahram has emphasized all week that Washington is divided and wary about the first president from the Muslim Brotherhood, an Islamist group long critical of Israel and the West.
But the front page of its English-language weekly took an opposite tack to undercut the president by portraying him as the pawn of Washington. Although wildly counterintuitive, that conspiracy theory has tapped into the deep popular distrust here of the United States.
Mr. Morsi's decree restoring Parliament ''was intended to send a message to the military and other authorities, warning them that the Americans want him to assume full powers and that they are ready to protect him to achieve this objective,'' Al Ahram Weekly quoted Diaa Rashwan of Al Ahram Center for Political and Strategic Studies as saying. The report noted that Mr. Morsi issued the order not long after meeting with Deputy Secretary of State William J. Burns.
The paper even quoted a former leftist presidential candidate, Abul-Ezz El-Hariri, suggesting that the United States hoped to use the establishment of a religious state as a pretext for invasion. Emad Shahin, a political scientist at the American University in Cairo, said the state media's attacks on the head of state made the situation perfectly clear: Mr. Morsi represented a double threat as the first civilian and the first Islamist to hold the presidency.
''This is a deliberate and well-orchestrated campaign to shake Morsi's image, ensure his failure and frustrate the revolution,'' Mr. Shahin said.
Ahmed Abu Baraka, a lawyer for the Muslim Brotherhood, said the issue was deeper than bias. ''It is an incurable disease in state media that needs surgery,'' he said, blaming 60 years of parroting the ideology of secular dictatorship.
Taghrid Wafi, a state television producer, said she and her colleagues were in ''confusion.''
''They don't know who is in charge,'' she said, noting that in some ways the military's grip on the news media had loosened since Mr. Morsi's election. For the first time, she said, she could interview activists who criticized the military for court-martialing civilians. ''You know we don't work on our own; we need approval for our guests.''
''I think this is like the time right after the revolution, when nobody understood anything and we could present whatever we wanted,'' she said. ''But when the military took hold of the building, it became forbidden to mention the military. If you did something like that you'd be called 'an agenda with ulterior motives.' ''
But she also acknowledged that she and many of her colleagues distrust Mr. Morsi's background in the Muslim Brotherhood, saying, ''Maybe in the future a person who says something about the Brothers could be accused of an 'agenda' as well!''
Others in the state media stuck to the generals' line that Mr. Morsi was the new boss. ''The president is elected by the public, and he is naturally the person with the power,'' said Osama Abdel Aziz, a managing editor at Al Ahram, though he acknowledged that Mr. Morsi ''didn't receive all of his powers'' because of the military's recent decree taking over lawmaking and budgetary authority.
He insisted that Al Ahram was no longer ''the newspaper with one reader'' -- that was President Mubarak -- but now sent its reporters out to truly cover the news. On Wednesday, he promised that Thursday's front page would feature the photograph of an 84-year-old man who had brought a complaint to President Morsi's new grievance office -- a demonstration of the paper's new empathy for the common man and fairness to President Morsi.
But the picture did not appear; the headline featured a misleading quotation from Mr. Morsi suggesting he had backed down before a new court order again dissolving Parliament.
''The media looks to the center of power,'' said Hala Mustafa, editor of the state-financed journal Democracy. ''I think everybody knows that the military council represents the center of power, the real comprehensive authority in the country.''

HEADLINE: Romney Seeks Obama Apology For Bain Attacks

BYLINE: By MICHAEL D. SHEAR

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- Mitt Romney demanded an apology from President Obama on Friday for making what he called ''reckless'' and ''absurd'' allegations in an escalating battle over whether Mr. Romney's business record included outsourcing American jobs.
After days in which the Obama campaign persistently goaded Mr. Romney and even raised questions about whether he might have broken the law by lying on a Securities and Exchange Commission filing, Mr. Romney finally hit back hard, giving five television interviews in which he said the attacks on him were ''beneath the dignity of the presidency.''
''What kind of a president would have a campaign that says something like that about the nominee of another party?'' Mr. Romney said to CBS News. In an interview with ABC News, he added: ''He sure as heck ought to say that he's sorry for the kinds of attacks that are coming from his team.''
Mr. Obama showed no signs of backing down, and while avoiding the more provocative language used by some of his aides, said Mr. Romney should answer lingering questions about what his role was at Bain Capital, a private equity firm. 
''I think most Americans figure if you are the chairman, C.E.O. and president of a company that you are responsible for what that company does,'' Mr. Obama said on WJLA-TV in northern Virginia earlier in the day. ''Ultimately, Mr. Romney, I think, is going to have to answer those questions.''
The back and forth between the rivals for the presidency capped one of the most intense 48-hour periods of the 2012 campaign, with each side angrily accusing the other of outright lies and distortions as the election became a matchup of war-room tactics far removed from the big issues of the day.
While Mr. Romney has sought to keep public attention on the weak economy, Mr. Obama's team spent the week trying to focus the campaign on undermining Mr. Romney's claim to being an effective economic manager by highlighting reports that Bain Capital had invested in companies that moved jobs overseas. That battle in turn descended into a brawl over Mr. Romney's position that he had already left Bain during the period in question, starting in 1999.
Mr. Romney reiterated on Friday that he had no role in running Bain after early 1999, when he left to take over management of the Salt Lake City Olympic Games. The Boston Globe reported Thursday on S.E.C. documents listing Mr. Romney as chief executive of Bain through 2002, a period in which Mr. Romney has said he was negotiating his formal departure from the company but was not involved in its management or investment decisions.
''I was the owner of an entity which was a management entity,'' Mr. Romney said on CBS, calling the questions about Bain the ''height of silliness'' to be having. ''That entity was one which I had ownership of until the time of the retirement program was put in place. But I had no responsibility whatsoever after February of '99 for the management or ownership -- management, rather, of Bain Capital.''
Though he hit back hard at the president on Friday, Mr. Romney's willingness to plunge fully into the fray over the issue was a victory for Mr. Obama in the sense that the campaign spent another day being fought on the Obama campaign's choice of turf. As Mr. Romney himself said in an interview this week on Fox News, ''If you're responding, you're losing.''
Mr. Romney used the television interviews on Friday to try to shift attention back to the economy.
''You just had very bad news on the economic front, with now 41 straight months with unemployment above 8 percent,'' he told Fox News. ''And what does the president do? He says he is going to raise taxes on people. He is trying to gut welfare reform as we know it. And he launches attacks of this nature. Well, it is just beneath the dignity of his office.''
But with the Obama forces apparently fully committed to portraying him as out of touch with the middle class and secretive about his wealth, Mr. Romney faced continuing questions about his willingness to disclose more information about his personal finances. He responded that he does not intend to disclose much more than he already has.
Mr. Romney said he had released his 2010 tax return and would release his full 2011 tax return when it was ready. But he said voters should not expect any more than that, despite Democrats' calls for him to release a decade's worth of returns or more, citing the example of his father, George Romney, who when he ran for the Republican presidential nomination in 1968 released 12 years of returns.
''I know there will always be calls for more. People always want to get more,'' Mr. Romney said on CNN. ''And, you know, we're putting out what is required plus more that is not required. And those are the two years that people are going to have. And that's -- that's all that's necessary for people to understand something about my finances.''
Mr. Obama is running millions of dollars in television ads calling on Mr. Romney to reveal more about his personal taxes, offshore bank accounts and investment accounts, and linking him to the investments made at Bain between 1999 and 2001, when Mr. Romney says he was no longer at the company. On Thursday, the president's aides said Mr. Romney was either lying on federal documents or to the American people.
That allegation, in particular, has clearly angered Mr. Romney. He called the accusation of criminal behavior ''disgusting'' and ''demeaning'' and said it was destructive to the political process.
''It's something that I think the president should take responsibility for and stop it,'' Mr. Romney said. ''Is this the level that the Obama campaign is willing to stoop to?''
Mr. Romney's rare appearances on five networks on Friday attested to his campaign's desire to respond to the president's charges. But the media blitz also highlighted how he is being outgunned at the moment in the advertising wars, where Mr. Obama's campaign is greatly outspending his in the states that will decide the election.
Mr. Romney has outraised Mr. Obama in the last several months, but most of the money he has raised can be used only in the general election, which formally begins after the Republican National Convention this summer. The long, contentious Republican primary campaign drained much of the money Mr. Romney could spend before then.
That has left Mr. Romney somewhat short of cash, though the campaign is broadcasting advertisements this week slamming Mr. Obama for misleading attacks.
By giving interviews to all the major networks, Mr. Romney is likely to ensure that clips will be replayed all weekend. And what he says is likely to be the subject of conversation during the Sunday morning news programs.
Mr. Romney's campaign has produced television ads this week charging Mr. Obama with running a dishonest campaign and using clips of Hillary Rodham Clinton, the secretary of state, angrily denouncing Mr. Obama during the 2008 Democratic primaries for lying about her record.
''So shame on you, Barack Obama,'' the ad says.

HEADLINE: 7 Officials in Afghan Investment Agency Quit, Protesting Graft

BYLINE: By GRAHAM BOWLEY and JAWAD SUKHANYAR

 BODY:
KABUL, Afghanistan -- Just days after President Hamid Karzai assured the United States and international donors that he was serious about fighting corruption, seven top members of the agency that promotes investment in Afghanistan resigned to protest what they said was rampant nepotism, corruption and mismanagement in their organization.
In a letter sent to Mr. Karzai late Thursday, the seven senior members of the Afghanistan Investment Support Agency accused the new head of the agency, appointed two months ago, of disregarding proper hiring procedures and instead promoting friends who shared the same tribal or ethnic allegiance or belonged to the same political party. They said that they had no choice but to resign. 
The seven officials said the agency, whose mission is to promote private business investment by Afghan and international companies, had enjoyed a good reputation among private sector companies and investors. But, they wrote, ''we can no longer argue that A.I.S.A. is free from corruption.''
Copies of the letter were sent to senior figures in the international aid community and companies investing in Afghanistan.
As Mr. Karzai has come under increasing pressure to stanch corruption, the resignations came at a critical time for the country. With American and coalition troops leaving and international donors cutting their aid budgets, the government is trying to attract outside investment to stimulate an economy that has relied heavily on aid and military spending.
Among those who resigned were the director of investment promotion, Rohullah Ahmadzai, and the director of research and policy, Omar Joya.
The allegations, voiced at a televised news conference by those who signed the letter, ignited another debate about corruption in Afghanistan.
Last Sunday, an international donors' conference in Tokyo pledged $16 billion over four years for the country's economic development. But for the first time, the pledges included a condition that the Afghan government focus on reducing corruption before it receives all of the money.
At that conference, Mr. Karzai conceded that corruption had undermined the legitimacy of his government. Foreign governments have helped pay for anticorruption efforts, but the Afghans have often quashed high-profile prosecutions of senior officials, and Mr. Karzai has instead regularly blamed foreigners for the corruption of Afghan officials.
The new president of the investment agency, Wafiullah Eftekhar, was appointed in May with the support of the commerce minister, Anwar ul-Haq Ahady, who is known as a Pashtun nationalist.
Mr. Eftekhar had worked for Mr. Ahady at the Finance Ministry. The officials who resigned accused him of appointing 10 of his allies in senior posts, forcing out longstanding and better-qualified staff members, and appropriating funds to move to expensive new offices in a different district of Kabul.
The officials said that the changes at the agency were causing it to lose credibility with investors. ''The recruitment of these people has taken place without considering the recruitment procedures, competition and the H.R. policy of A.I.S.A. itself, and this can be entirely qualified as 'corruption,' '' they said in the letter.
The agency falls under the responsibility of the Commerce Ministry, but the appointment of the agency chief is approved by Mr. Karzai. The president's office said he had not yet received the resignation letter.
The former acting president of the agency, Naseem Akbar, resigned in May after he was passed over and Mr. Eftekhar was brought in.
Mr. Eftekhar vehemently denied the allegations leveled at him by the seven former staff members. He said that the spending and promotions were legitimate, free of any political motives. ''Nothing is moving here with political aims,'' he said. Mr. Ahady said he would look into the matter but pointed out that Mr. Eftekhar's appointment had been approved by Mr. Karzai.
In an interview, Mr. Ahmadzai, who resigned as the director of investment promotion, said the lack of coordination at the agency had already caused two potential projects to be lost, both in eastern Nangarhar Province: a $10 million business park with Indian investors and a plan with another investor to install electricity poles and cables.
Mr. Joya, who left as director of research and policy, said of Mr. Eftekhar: ''Types of corruption exist in A.I.S.A. under his leadership, from nepotism to cronyism and maladministration and failed leadership. He has still not finished with visitors who came with bouquets of flowers to congratulate him as the new head of A.I.S.A.''
On Friday, in Laghman Province, the head of women's affairs there, Hanifa Safi, died after a bomb that was apparently attached to her car exploded, the Laghman governor's office said.
The bomb went off as Ms. Safi's car was traveling though Mehtar Lam, the provincial capital, around 10 a.m., said Zowak Sarhadi, the governor's spokesman. Ms. Safi's husband and driver were among 11 people wounded in the explosion.

HEADLINE: Myanmar's Leader Invites U.S. Businesses to Return

BYLINE: By JANE PERLEZ

 BODY:
SIEM REAP, Cambodia -- President Thein Sein of Myanmar addressed a dinner of American business executives in this city near the ancient ruins of Angkor Wat on Friday, inviting them to invest in his impoverished country after an absence of 25 years.
The appearance of Mr. Thein Sein, who traveled to Cambodia from his nearby country for the occasion, was the latest sign of a significant warming of relations between the United States and Myanmar, a Southeast Asian country that had been firmly in China's orbit. 
Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton welcomed Mr. Thein Sein to the gathering on the last full day of her Asia trip, one intended to show that Washington's commitment to the region reached beyond strengthening of military alliances to economic ties. Most countries in the region, with the Philippines as an exception, do more trade with China than with the United States.
The meeting followed President Obama's announcement on Wednesday of the easing of sanctions on American investments in Myanmar, a decision reached after two months of debate within the administration over how much and how quickly to reward the Myanmar government for the reforms it has undertaken so far.
The administration placed some conditions on investments, including the requirement that American companies investing more than $500,000 must report to Washington on their human rights policies and anticorruption efforts. American energy companies that conclude deals with the state-owned Myanmar Oil and Gas Enterprise -- which the opposition leader, Daw Aung San Suu Kyi, wanted to be kept under sanctions -- will be required to report their investments to Washington within 60 days.
The meeting of American business executives at a hotel in the city that is a base for tourism to the hundreds of temples near here was organized weeks ago in anticipation of Mrs. Clinton's Asia trip. The easing of sanctions and the quick invitation to Myanmar's president turned what had looked to be an ordinary visit into something special. While few chief executives of major companies made the trek to this out-of-the-way location, the audience of several hundred, many of them regional representatives of United States corporations, received Mr. Thein Sein, a former military general, warmly. Dressed in a business suit instead of the traditional Myanmar attire he wears at home, Mr. Thein Sein spoke in English about how his government was dropping the ''centralized system'' of the past 50 years.
Antiquated laws that prevented foreign investment in the past are in the process of being removed, he said, adding that bigger challenges lay ahead. ''We must also reform the bureaucratic system and the mind-set of government officials,'' he said.
Mrs. Clinton and Mr. Thein Sein met for an hour before the dinner, and Mr. Thein Sein stressed, according to a senior State Department official, that his government wanted to attract American businesses that not only exported Myanmar's plentiful raw materials but also brought added value to the country to aid in its development.
For example, the president told Mrs. Clinton, Myanmar exports teakwood, but not finished teak products. The country exports rubber but imports tires, he said.
Mrs. Clinton told Mr. Thein Sein the United States was concerned about the treatment of the Rohingya Muslim ethnic group, which has suffered killings at the hands of Buddhists, the State Department official said.
The announcement of the easing of the sanctions will allow executives of nearly 50 American companies who attended the dinner, including those of FedEx, Cargill and Chevron, to leave here on Saturday for a trip to Myanmar. Robert D. Hormats, the under secretary of state for economic growth, energy and environment, leads the delegation.
''It is more than a quarter of a century since a high-level United States government and business delegation went to Burma,'' Mr. Hormats said. Burma, the traditional name of Myanmar, is used by the State Department.
The first American ambassador to Myanmar since 1990, Derek J. Mitchell, who arrived at his post this week, attended the dinner here with Mr. Thein Sein.
Western business executives say they are aware of the opportunities in Myanmar, but that there are also big hurdles. A modern banking system does not exist, communications are spotty, and ingrained corruption linked to military officers is widespread.

HEADLINE: New Fraud Inquiry as JPMorgan's Loss Mounts

BYLINE: By JESSICA SILVER-GREENBERG

 BODY:
9:07 p.m. Updated
JPMorgan Chase disclosed on Friday that losses on its botched credit bet could climb to more than $7 billion and that the bank's traders may have intentionally tried to obscure the full extent of the red ink on the disastrous trades.
Mounting concerns about valuing the trades led the company to announce that its earnings for the first quarter were no longer reliable and would be restated. Federal regulators, who were already examining the trades, are now looking at whether employees of the nation's biggest bank by assets intended to defraud investors, according to people with knowledge of the matter.
The revelations left Jamie Dimon, the bank's chief executive, scrambling for the second time within two months to contain the fallout from the trading debacle. It has already claimed one of his most trusted lieutenants, compelled Mr. Dimon to appear before Congress to account for the blunder and prompted the bank to claw back millions in compensation from three traders in London at the heart of the losses. A top bank official said that the board could also seize pay from Mr. Dimon, but did not indicate that it would do so. 
Since announcing initial losses of $2 billion in May, Mr. Dimon, once vaunted for his risk prowess after navigating the bank deftly through the financial crisis, has worked to prove that any flaws in risk management are limited to the chief investment office, a once-obscure unit with offices in London and New York. But the latest news is prompting fresh questions about whether risk controls throughout the bank are weak.
''This points to fundamental and potentially widespread risk management failure,'' said Mark Williams, a professor of finance at Boston University, who also served as a Federal Reserve Bank examiner.
Much more than profits are at stake for Mr. Dimon. The mounting problems from the soured bets strengthen the hand of lawmakers in Washington who have been pushing to curtail the kind of risk-taking that led to the trading losses.
The possible deceptions came to light in a regulatory filing early Friday just before the bank reported its second-quarter earnings. While the bank posted a profit of nearly $5 billion despite the trading losses of $4.4 billion for the quarter, some analysts and regulators zeroed in on the valuation of the trades.
''If traders misrepresented a fact with the intent to defraud, they can be subject to criminal charges,'' said Alan R. Bromberg, a securities law expert at Southern Methodist University.
In contrast, investors appeared to accept Mr. Dimon's pledges that the bank had rooted out the problems and could reap record annual profits. They rallied behind the bank, sending its shares up nearly 6 percent, the best among its peers on an overall strong day for American stocks.
If the trades had been properly valued, the bank said it would have lost $1.4 billion on the position in the first quarter, bringing the total losses to $5.8 billion so far this year. In a conference call with analysts on Friday, Mr. Dimon said that the trade, under the worst market conditions, could result in another $1.7 billion in losses.
In a rare move, the bank seized millions in pay from three managers in the unit's London office who had ''direct responsibility'' for the blunder. People with knowledge of the clawbacks said that pay was taken back from Achilles Macris, Javier Martin-Artajo and Bruno Iksil, the trader who gained infamy as the London Whale for his large credit trades.
A lawyer for Mr. Macris declined to comment. A lawyer for Mr. Martin-Artajo could not be reached. Raymond Silverstein, a lawyer for Mr. Iksil, said his client believed he had ''done nothing wrong and that he will be exonerated in due course.'' While the company did not indicate the total tally for the clawbacks, Douglas Braunstein, the bank's chief financial officer, said the bank could claim roughly two years of total compensation, including stock options.
Ina R. Drew, the senior executive who resigned as head of the chief investment office shortly after the trading losses, volunteered to give back her pay. The giveback is a precipitous fall for Ms. Drew, once one of Mr. Dimon's most trusted executives. Ms. Drew earned roughly $14 million last year, making her the bank's fourth-highest-paid officer. Ms. Drew declined to comment.
JPMorgan said that an internal investigation, led by Mike Cavanagh, a former chief financial officer at the bank, unearthed questions about how traders in the bank's chief investment office were valuing their bets. After combing through thousands of e-mails and phone call records of traders, senior executives at the bank feared that traders, in an attempt to disguise the magnitude of the losses, improperly marked their trades.
''Certain individuals may have been seeking to avoid showing the full amount of the losses in the portfolio during the first quarter,'' the bank said in a statement, but didn't indicate how many traders may be embroiled in the mismarking.
Certain tough-to-exit trades can be extremely difficult to value, according to current and former traders in the chief investment office. On some positions, ''valuing a trade is like throwing a ball at a target while blindfolded,'' said a former trader who requested anonymity because of the continuing investigations into the trade. The Securities and Exchange Commission, which is one of several federal regulators investigating the trading losses, is interested in the valuation of the trades, according to a person briefed on the investigation.
Separately, federal regulators from the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency and the Federal Reserve Bank of New York stationed at the bank's Manhattan headquarters have been examining the valuation of the trades in weekly meetings with the staff at the chief investment office, according to current regulators who insisted on anonymity because the investigations have not concluded.
Mr. Cavanagh said that the executives within the unit were outmatched by the increasing complexity of the bets being made as the unit grew over the last several years. JPMorgan, Mr. Cavanagh, emphasized, is undertaking a ''complete revamp of C.I.O. management.'' Part of that change began Friday, when the bank announced that Irvin Goldman, who had overseen risk for the chief investment office, was resigning.
Started roughly five years ago, the unit, which grew from a sleepy operation into a profit center, was also torn by internal strife between deputies in New York and London, according to current and former traders.
Mr. Dimon emphasized that the investment office was going to focus on conservative investments. The bank has moved the majority of the soured trade to JPMorgan's investment banking unit, where Mr. Cavanagh told analysts risk controls were strong.
Mr. Braunstein, the chief financial officer, told analysts that the decision to refile first-quarter earnings was made on Thursday, the day before the bank reported its second-quarter results. The change means that revenue for the first quarter fell by $660 million, and net income dropped by $459 million.
Mr. Dimon urged analysts Friday to focus on the bank's overall strength.
The bank reported a $4.96 billion profit for the second quarter, down 9 percent from $5.43 billion a year earlier. Revenue also fell to $22.2 billion, down 17 percent from the same period last year.
''All of our client-driven businesses had solid performance,'' Mr. Dimon said.
At one point during the earnings call, Mike Mayo, an analyst with Credit Agricole Securities, asked whether the bank had reached a ''tipping point'' where it had become too unwieldy to manage.
Mr. Dimon answered with a succinct ''no.''
JPMorgan, for its part, has emphasized that the trading loss is a blip in terms of the bank's overall profitability. Mr. Dimon added that while the bank is ''not proud of this moment, we are proud of this company.''
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

HEADLINE: Reefs in the Anthropocene - Zombie Ecology?

BYLINE: ANDREW C. REVKIN


HIGHLIGHT: Scientists debate the state and fate of coral reefs. 

 BODY:
[4:28 p.m. | Updated below | ]
The Op-Ed section has published "A World Without Coral Reefs," a provocative and disturbing essay by Roger Bradbury, an ecologist studying resource management at Australian National University. He asserts that these dynamic biological communities, long heralded as the rain forests of the sea, are doomed "zombie ecosystems" -- with the triple whammy of overfishing, pollution and ocean acidification from the global buildup of carbon dioxide bound to overwhelm conservationists' efforts.
Needless to say, his essay is eliciting reactions as varied and passionate as those greetingPeter Kareiva's very different critique of conventional conservation strategies.
Randy Olson, the marine biologist who turned to filmmaking, blogging and authorship (with "Don't Be Such a Scientist"), first alerted me to Bradbury's line of thinking and said he's thrilled with the piece.
John Bruno, a marine ecologist at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill and co-creator of the "Sea Monster" blog, said the piece does not reflect the science on reef conditions and threats and fundamentally disagreed with the author's views on conservation options. Below you can read missives from Olson and Bruno, with a coda laying out my views.
But first here's a snapshot of coral reef conditions in Belize from 2010, when I traveled there with Pace University students to make a film on efforts to farm shrimp with the environment (including the reefs) in mind:
Read on for the discussion of the zombie reef thesis: 
Randy Olson, who described the article as a "huge blow for the truth" in an e-mail message this morning, said (I added links for context):
It's about "finished baselines." For a decade Jeremy Jackson and others have been pointing out the problem of "shifting baselines" for coral reefs -- looking at today's degraded ecosystems and not realizing what they once were (the baselines). Bradbury is saying it's time to stop pointing out "what we've lost" and move on to just, "we've lost" for coral reefs.
The key social point he is addressing is the struggle that's emerged for environmental groups between "hope versus truth." What do you do when the patient's heart is no longer beating? Do you keep saying, "Sometimes people come back from the dead?" Do you end up like Monty Python's Black Knight, missing all his limbs but still pretending there's a serious fight? I don't know. It's very sad.
But I do know that I value the truth more than anything else, and when environmental groups get so caught up in their motivational efforts that they've lost track of the truth, that is when the door is open for serious disaster. It's as bad as war correspondents who embed themselves with the troops and lose all perspective.
When I sent the piece to John Bruno this morning, he offered this reaction:
As soon as I read this op-ed, I wrote a few colleagues to share it with them and to get their views. Then I went to Twitter and searched for coral reefs; there was a string of tweets about the piece -- all of them accepting the main argument without question, e.g., "Scariest thing I've read in a while. Apparently, coral reefs are doomed and there's nothing we can do about it." []
It is scary, but is it true? I don't think so. I have been called a pathological optimist, but on the other hand, I've watched reefs change radically from the dangerous wild places I experienced as a kid in the Florida Keys, to simplified systems with few corals and fewer predators. And this is in just 30 years.
One aspect of my research is focused on documenting and understudying the degradation of coral reef ecosystems, mainly in terms of the loss of reef-building corals. [] The story is more grim in the Caribbean, where there has been a decline of at least 50 percent (and probably more than 75 percent) of coral populations. 
But the picture of coral loss is roughly the same globally. More recently, we've been working on the extent of overfishing and predator loss on Caribbean reefs. A healthy unfished reef is inhabited by top predators like sharks and grouper and total fish biomass is roughly 500 grams per square meter. Yet, the average reef has only 20 grams per square meter -- obviously an extreme decrease in fish biomass.
So that aspect of Rogers Bradbury's Op-Ed in today's New York Times is generally accurate. The world's coral reefs have indeed changed, are under enormous pressure, and their future is threatened. 
But are they really "on a trajectory to collapse within a human generation"? No.
Is there really "no hope of saving the global coral reef ecosystem"? No, there is hope.
And is the "scientific evidence for this is compelling and unequivocal"? No, not remotely.
I think these are valid opinions, but they are not science, nor are they supported by science. What the science say? It is a complicated picture and there isn't any way to scientifically test the idea that "reefs are doomed." Like everything else in conservation (and life) it depends. It depends on when greenhouse gas emissions are reduced and eventually halted. It depends on how big the human populations gets. It depends on when we start managing coral reef fisheries with a modicum of intelligence. 
If we increase the atmospheric concentration of CO2 to 2000 parts per million, yeah, I'd agree reefs will probably be toast. [.] But I am pretty sure they will persist - albeit in a much diminshed state -- if we halted the increase in pressures today.
And what about those pressures? Are they really "accelerating"? No. There is no evidence that the rates of overfishing, ocean acidification and pollution are "accelerating." I am doubtful that overfishing and pollution are even increasing. (For one, there isn't a lot left to overfish.) Temperature and acidification are increasing and these pressures do have great inertia, but they are certainly NOT "unstoppable and irreversible".
We have many examples of places where local threats like fishing and pollution have been reduced or reversed and in some cases like the Florida Keys National Marine Sanctuary, with great success. We also have some -- though not many -- reefs even in the Caribbean that have a lot of healthy coral and are patrolled by sharks, grouper, snapper, barracuda, and other large carnivores. 
The challenge for my generation of scientists is to increase the number of these "quasi-pristine" coral reefs (I'd like to see a tenfold increase) and to halt the decline of the other 90 percent of the world's reefs. Are this optimistic goals? Sure. But the science suggests this is doable and I'm far from ready to give up on reefs.
As for me, I've seen the degradation in many places -- most vividly in French Polynesia, where I spent time after college (in 1978) living in a tiny village on the island of Raiatea. [A narrated slide show describes how this trip led me to journalism.] I spent every spare moment snorkeling around coral heads that were dizzylingly dynamic. No matter how close I pressed my mask to some feature, new levels of complexity were revealed. I returned in 1988 and all was changed. While the coral structures were intact, the system was clearly up-ended, with far fewer large fish and weed intruding in many places. (Just as a sidenote, Bruno, who has studied the "turf war" between coral and seaweed, has told me that research shows weedy reefs can be as biologically diverse as coral reefs.)
But like Bruno, I see a lot of evidence for resilience in these systems, if given a chance. Pollution of coastal zones can be cut. Marine protected areas, although the picture is complicated, have the potential to serve as nurseries sustaining fisheries for nearby communities dependent on ocean resources.
Like Bradbury and Olson, I also see a need to recognize that the ecology of the Anthropocene is stunningly different than what preceded the dawn of this era in which humans are the dominant force shaping that thing once called "nature."
In an exchange with Olson this morning, I discussed an element I think is missing from the Bradbury piece. What is being lost is reef systems that humans long exploited and valued as a source of everything from food to building material and -- most recently -- aesthetic and experiential pleasure (as in the video above). That's the source of the sense of loss, and, in some people, despair.
But it's clear to me that corals as a group of living things will almost assuredly outlast humanity and construct glorious reefs in millenniums to come of unimaginable richness.
It would be nice to think that our successors will be around to witness that resurgence, perhaps because our species has overcome its tendency to experience, but not notice or respond to, such "slow drip" losses, hiding in plain sight.
Going forward, on coral conservation and other matters bundled as sustainability, the challenge humans face, to me, is summed up well in the "Serenity Prayer": to have the serenity to accept the things you cannot change, the courage to change the things you can, and the wisdom to know the difference.
4:28 p.m. | Updated | The marine scientist, conservationist and author Carl Safina sent these thoughts this afternoon: 
I can't remember who dragged me to see the movie "Jurassic Park," but one resonant line in that movie was worth the price of admission, this unforgettable sentence: "Life finds a way." It popped out at me because it so economically summed up a truth behind all of nature's stunning diversity and the continuity of the living adventure of Life on Earth. 
Yes, things die, lineages go extinct, and coral reefs are in a world of hurt. All true. Also true is there exist heat-tolerant corals, corals that are regularly exposed to (and routinely survive) the extreme stress of finding themselves out in the tropical air at low tide, and many ocean organisms that live through large swings in pH through tidal cycles. 
Yes many coral reefs are degraded. Yes it doesn't look good. But sometimes living diversity supplies marginal adaptations that suddenly fit perfectly into new conditions. Someone (not Darwin) called it "survival of the fittest." That's what the phrase means; not survival of the strongest but of the ones who find themselves in the right place at the right time as conditions change to suddenly suit them. Look around; it works. 
Agreed, it is past due to raise the alarm that coral reefs in many areas have largely collapsed, and that their future looks bleak. As an anguished lover of reefs and living things generally, and as an ecologist by profession, I cannot picture what it will take for coral reef systems to survive and thrive. But I also cannot picture a world in which no reef corals adapt, persist, and flourish, simply because it's true: Life finds a way.
Bradbury seems to suggest giving up and spending money on ways to replace the values (for example, fish) that coral reefs have provided. But what would giving up look like? Overfishing is old news, and plenty of people are, in fact, spending money trying to raise fish. Some are making money. Overpopulation: also old news and crucial to everything from water supplies to prospects for peace. One doesn't need to certify future coral reef destruction to realize that overpopulation is bad for human health and dignity, not to mention a catastrophe for wild living systems. These problems have caused the losses to date and they continue. Warming and acidification are also building. 
But to accept that reefs are doomed implies that the best response is to give up hope, thus give up effort. That means we give up on curbing overfishing and allowing rebuilding (yet these two goals are in fact are increasingly working in many places, specifically because people have not given up, and because letting fish recover can work). It means we give up on controlling pollution (in the U.S., the Clean Water Act brought great improvement to rivers so polluted that they actually caught fire multiple times; developing nations deserve to do no less for themselves). It means we give up on population, whose most effective solving strategy is to teach girls to read and write.
Giving up, while reefs still flourish in many places, means accepting what is unacceptable, and abandoning work on situations that can likely be improved. It means deciding to be hopeless. It means giving up on the reefs, the fishes, and the people, who need all the combined efforts of those who both know the science best-and who, while life exists, won't give up. 
The science is clear that reefs are in many places degraded and in serious trouble. But no science has, or likely can, determine that reefs and all their associated non-coral creatures are unequivocally, equally and everywhere, completely doomed to total non-existence. In fact, much science suggests they will persist in some lesser form. Bleak prospects have been part of many dramatic turnarounds, and, who knows, life may, as usual-with our best efforts-find a way.

HEADLINE: Sartre and Camus in New York

BYLINE: ANDY MARTIN


HIGHLIGHT: The roots of the schism between the two French philosophers can be glimpsed in their different reactions to the United States. 

 BODY:
In December 1944, Albert Camus, then editor of Combat, the main newspaper of the French Resistance, made Jean-Paul Sartre an offer he couldn't refuse: the job of American correspondent. Perhaps, in light of the perpetual tension and subsequent acrimonious split between the two men, he was glad to get him out of Paris. What is certain is that Sartre was delighted to go. He'd had enough of the austerities and hypocrisies of post-liberation France and had long fantasized about the United States. Camus himself would make the trip soon after, only to return with a characteristically different set of political, philosophical and personal impressions. 
In some sense, existentialism was going home. The "roots" of 20th-century French philosophy are canonically located on mainland Europe, in the fertile terrain of Hegel, Kierkegaard, Nietzsche, Husserl and Heidegger. But it was not entirely immune to the metaphysical turmoil of the United States at the end of the 19th century. French philosophy retained elements of the pragmatism of C.S. Peirce and the psychologism of William James (each receives an honorable mention in Sartre's "Being and Nothingness"). More significantly, both Camus and Sartre had learned and borrowed from 20th-century writers like Faulkner, Hemingway and dos Passos -and, of course, from the films of Humphrey Bogart. Camus, in particular, cultivated the trench coat with the upturned collar and described himself as a mix of Bogart, Fernandel and a samurai.

When Sartre stepped off the plane in New York in January 1945, only months after the liberation of Paris, his head full of American movies, architecture and jazz, he might have expected to feel in his natural habitat - the pre-eminent philosopher of liberté setting foot in the land of freedom, a nation temperamentally and constitutionally addicted to liberty. Was there not already something of the existential cowboy and intellectual gunslinger in Sartre's take-no-hostages attitude? Camus must have thought so in dispatching him to the United States. 
Sartre wrote dozens of articles for Combat while in the States, often phoning them back to Camus in Paris, and eventually went on to talk philosophy at Harvard, Princeton, Yale and elsewhere. In the process, he acquired an American girlfriend (about whom he wrote abundantly and explicitly to Simone de Beauvoir: "I am killed by passion and lectures."). But the very personal article he wrote for Town & Country, "Manhattan: The Great American Desert," records that he suffered on arrival from "le mal de New York." He never really recovered. 
Sartre, leaving the confines of the Plaza Hotel, walked up Fifth Avenue beneath a frozen sky, looking for New York, but not finding it. There was nothing on which to focus his gaze; it was a city for "the far-sighted," he wrote, since the natural focal point was somewhere around infinity, over the horizon. He missed the intimate quartiers of Paris, finding in their place only "filmy atmospheres, longitudinally stretched masses with nothing to mark a beginning or end." Just the kind of place, one might think, where an expatriate existentialist ought to fit right in. And yet he suffered stubbornly from a sense of disorientation. "In the numerical anonymity of roads and avenues, he wrote, "I am just anybody, anywhere." New York put him in mind of the steppes or the pampas.
But soon enough he started to realize what his fundamental objection really was. The whole point of the city was to fortify itself against nature. But Manhattan failed to do that: an "open" city with a limitless sky above, it let nature in on every side. It was, of course, an island, and thus too exposed to the elements: to storm, hurricane, snow, heat, wind, floods. It had no real protection against anything. "I feel as though I were camping in the heart of a jungle crawling with insects."` Therefore he learned to appreciate it only while crossing it in a car, as if he were "driving across the great plains of Andalusia." 
And just as he inverts the perception of the American city, so too Sartre turns the notion of American freedom inside out. By February, having been shuttled to and fro across the States, wined, dined and given propaganda tours to industrial installations, he comes to the conclusion in another article, written for Le Figaro, that America is the land of conformism. He finds that beneath its notional attachment to "individualism," America does not actually trust the solitary individual. Despite the "liberal economy," America is an embodiment of a Rousseauist "social contract" in which the general will of the "collectivity" dominates: "Each American is educated by other Americans and he educates others in turn. Everywhere in New York, in colleges and beyond, there are courses in Americanization." Existentialist anomie is prohibited: America is hyper-normative, producing citizen clones. 
It is Sartre's most powerful and recurrent complaint: that people are being treated as things. The "nausea" of the 1930s, elicited by pebbles and trees and ocean depths (and thus, as in New York, nature in general) morphed, in the '40s and '50s, into a specific aversion to the nonorganic products of economic forces. In America he understood that things (the "in-itself"), in all their massiveness, were threatening to reify the amorphous human (or "for-itself") and produce what he called in a later formulation the "practico-inert." 
Still, Sartre holds out the hope that New York is moving in a generally Sartrean and semi-apocalyptic direction. All those skyscrapers? Obviously, they are doomed. "They are already a bit run-down; tomorrow, perhaps, they will be torn down. In any case, their construction required a faith that we no longer have." The Chrysler and the Empire State already appear to Sartre like ancient ruins. 
Camus - officially a cultural emissary of the French government - followed in Sartre's footsteps in 1946, providing an ironic commentary on his predecessor. Where Sartre was obsessed with architecture, Camus was indifferent, oblivious. "I notice that I have not noticed the skyscrapers, they seemed to me perfectly natural." He had no issues with commodity capitalism. He admired colors, foodstuffs, smells, taxis, tie shops, ice cream, the "orgy of violent lights" that was Broadway, a jazz bar in Harlem and the giant Camel advertising icon of "an American soldier, his mouth open, puffing out clouds of real smoke." 
He fell in love several times over, notably with Patricia Blake, a 19-year-old student and Vogue apprentice. He read her pages from "The Plague" and she, in return, noting his fascination with the American way of death, found him issues of undertakers' trade magazines - Sunnyside, Casket,and Embalmer's Monthly. He particularly admired a funeral parlor ad: "You die. We do the rest."
At Vassar he gave a lecture on "The Crisis of Mankind" and was dazzled by the spectacle of "an army of long-legged young starlets, lazing on the lawn." But he was preoccupied by what he thought of as the "American tragedy." The tragedy of the students was that they lacked a sense of the tragic. For Sartre the tragic was the mechanization and objectification of the human. For Camus, the tragic was something more elusive: whatever it was, it was missing in America. 
There was an obvious difference of context between Camus and the students he was addressing. He'd come from Europe, which had just spent several years tearing itself apart, whereas they remained more or less physically untouched by the war. Camus was welcomed both as literary luminary (the translation of "The Outsider" came out during his stay) and Resistance hero. But his tragic perception of life was not reducible to the question of the Second World War. Sailing back from New York to France, at night in the middle of the Atlantic, staring down from the deck into the ocean, mesmerized by the wake of the ship, Camus spoke of his love for "these seas of forgetfulness, these unlimited silences that are like the enchantment of death." 
Camus, the Resistance philosopher of solidarity, discovered (or perhaps re-discovered) the problem of other minds in New York. Unlike Sartre, he had no difficulty with things, trees, the Empire State Building, the impersonal ocean. It was only on looking into the face of another human being that he fully experienced a sense of the tragic. While hell-is-other-people Sartre came to invoke a notion of the "group-in-fusion," Camus - who had to keep explaining to the students that he was not and never had been an "existentialist" - increasingly redefined the "absurd" in terms of an inevitable failure of language to bridge the gap between individuals. And it was not just the problem of inadequate English in speaking to Americans. He had the same feeling in Quebec. 
The clash between Sartre and Camus would come to be defined by their political divergence in the '50s, crystallized by the publication of "The Rebel" by Camus. But already, in their different reactions to the United States - and particularly New York - we have the ingredients of a philosophical schism. Sartre, on his return to Europe, recalls above all America's racism and practice of segregation, the inevitable counterpart to its drive to conformity. He writes a play, "The Respectful Prostitute," that dramatizes the episode of the Scottsboro Boys in the '30s. The split between contending forces - East and West, black and white, bourgeoisie and proletariat, humans and things - becomes the defining concern of his philosophy, summarized in the (admittedly rebarbative) phrase he comes up with in his "Critique of Dialectical Reason" to define boxing, but which also applies to his relationship with Camus: "a binary praxis of antagonistic reciprocity." Existentialism in this form, inflected with Marxism, infiltrates the American intelligentsia, is absorbed into black power philosophy ("black existentialism") and finds an echo in writers as disparate as Richard Wright and Norman Mailer.
Camus, on the other hand, begins to sound more like Samuel Beckett. While Sartre after the war was more than ever a self-professed "writing machine," Camus was increasingly graphophobic, haunted by a "disgust for all forms of public expression." Sartre's philosophy becomes sociological and structuralist in its binary emphasis. Camus, all alone, in the night, between continents, far away from everything, is already less the solemn "moralist" of legend ("the Saint," Sartre called him), more a (pre-)post-structuralist in his greater concern and anxiety about language, his emphasis on difference and refusal to articulate a clear-cut theory: "I am too young to have a system," he told one audience. And it is this anti-systematic aspect of America that he retains and refuses to clarify: "After so many months I know nothing about New York."
Paradoxically, it is clear that Sartre took his notion of collective action from what he witnessed in the United States rather than in the Soviet Union. It is typical that he should choose to frame his notion of freedom and the fate of individual identity in essentially literary (or textual) terms. Beware the editor! He didn't like the way his articles were butchered when they appeared in American journals and admits to being apprehensive of something similar - "le rewriting" - happening to his plays, should they ever be put on in the United States. The F.B.I., while accusing Camus of writing "inaccurate reports," also misidentified him as "Canus" and "Corus."
Sartre and Camus's love-hate relationship was played out and reflected in their on-off romance with America. As Camus put it, "It is necessary to fall in love if only to provide an alibi for all the random despair you are going to feel anyway." Above all the two thinkers emphasize that America is always balanced precariously, like a tight-rope walker, on the thread of a philosophical dialectic.

HEADLINE: Economic Inequality and the Changing Family

BYLINE: JASON DEPARLE


HIGHLIGHT: A look at some of the findings of scholars looking at growing inequality, changes in marriage patterns, and the connection between the two. 

 BODY:
As my article this weekend about two families in Ann Arbor, Mich., points out, the widening in many measures of inequality can be traced in part to changes in marriage patterns, rather than just changes in individual earnings. A number of scholars have looked at the varied dimensions of this thesis -- growing inequality, changes in family structure, and the connection between the two. Here is a look at some of their findings. 
 
An interesting pattern over the last four decades is that inequality has grown much faster for households with children than it has for households over all - an indication that changes in family structure (as opposed to wages and employment alone) have increased inequality.
 Bruce Western and Tracey Shollenberger of the Harvard sociology department compared households at the 90th percentile and the 10th percentile. In 1970, the top households had 8.9 times the income of the bottom. By 2011 they had nearly 11.7 times as much -- inequality between them grew 31 percent. 
But among households with children it grew 121 percent. (The ratio went from 4.8 in 1970 to 10.6 last year.)
Most of that growth, it should be noted, occurred by 1994 - while births to unwed mothers have continued to rise. But no one has suggested that single parenthood is the sole or even main force driving the increases in inequality, just an important one that is sometimes overlooked. Had single parenthood not continued to increase, there would be less inequality now. 
(Households with children at 90th percentile have annual income of $158,000, while those at the 10th percentile receive $14,800. Adjusted for inflation, those at the bottom have suffered a decline of nearly 40 percent in the past four years.)
As the article notes, one thing affluent do with their money is buy enrichment activities for their children, such as tutors, sports and private schools. The gap between what upper- and lower-income families spend in this way has grown rapidly, from about $2,700 a year in the early 1970s to $7,600 a year in the mid-2000s. 
The estimate comes from Greg J. Duncan of the University of California, Irvine and Richard J. Murnane of Harvard in a book they edited, "Whither Opportunity: Rising Inequality, Schools, and Children's Life Chances.'' It was published last year by the Russell Sage and Spencer foundations.
Decades ago, single parenthood was largely limited to poor people and minorities. Now it is increasingly common across middle America. 
The article shows how single parenthood has grown in the middle income third. The data, from Mr. Western and Ms. Shollenberger, can also be analyzed by fourths, as it is below.
 While the decline of two-parent families is most striking in the bottom quarter, that is a familiar story and had largely occurred by 1990. Much of the recent growth has occurred in the second-lowest quarter, sometimes called the working class. In that group, the share of households with children headed by unmarried parents has soared to nearly 40 percent and the growth has continued in recent years:
Readers interested in the association between single parenthood and children's life chances might consult a 2008 article by Sara McLanahan of Princeton and Christine Percheski of Harvard published in the Annual Review of Sociology. They write: 
"A large body of research indicates that living apart from a biological parent (typically the father) is associated with a host of negative outcomes that are expected to affect children's future life chances or ability to move up the income ladder.
"Children who grow up apart from their biological fathers score lower on standardized tests, report poorer grades, and view themselves as having less academic potential than children who grow up with both biological parents. More importantly, they are also more likely to drop out of high school, less likely to attend college, and less likely to graduate from college.''
That does not prove that single parenthood caused those outcomes. It may be that single parents have other differences from married parents, besides family structure per se. But Ms. McLanahan and Ms. Percheski do find that single parenthood has some independent effect and conclude that "family structure has become an important mechanism for the reproduction of class, race, and gender inequalities.''
 
 Changes in family structure may explain anywhere from 15 to 40 percent of the increased inequality in recent decades. Readers may wonder why there is such a broad range of estimates. It depends on the time period examined, the income rungs examined, and assumptions about how much the absent parent might have brought into the household.
 Mr. Western's estimate that the rise in single parenthood explains 21 percent of the growth in inequality comes from a 2008 article in the American Sociological Review (with Christine Percheski and Deirdre Bloom). He examined the change from 1975 to 2005. 
 Gary Burtless looked at different years (1979 to 1996) for the European Economic Review but came up with the same figure: 21 percent. He also found that the increased tendency of educated people to marry each other accounted for another 13 percent of inequality's growth. 
 The other estimate cited in the article comes from Robert Lerman of the Urban Institute. His unpublished analysis examines families with children at the 25th percentile and the 75th percentile. In 1975, the higher group had 2.16 times the income of the lower group. By 2008, it had risen to 3.09. Mr. Lerman estimated that 40 percent of that rise was the result of increasing single parenthood.
 There is a lot of research showing that single parenthood puts children at a higher risk of experiencing poverty. But there is not much that examines its long-term effects on a child's chances of moving up the income ladder.
 Scott Winship did an unpublished analysis and found that children with single parents were less likely to rise out of the bottom third than those with married parents. Since his analysis stopped when the adults were still in their 20s, it may understate the impact that family structure may have. Many high achievers - medical students, for instance - do not experience the large pay off to their education until they are older. 
 At the same time, Mr. Winship warned that the analysis could mask other factors that are more important than family structure per se - like underlying differences in race or education.
 His results are broadly consistent with those found in , which used a different data set.

HEADLINE: U.S. Is Building Criminal Cases in Rate-Fixing

BYLINE: BEN PROTESS and MARK SCOTT


HIGHLIGHT: The prospect of criminal cases related to the Libor scandal is expected to rattle the banking world and provide a new impetus for financial institutions to settle with the authorities. 

 BODY:
As regulators ramp up their global investigation into the manipulation of interest rates, the Justice Department has identified potential criminal wrongdoing by big banks and individuals at the center of the scandal.
The department's criminal division is building cases against several financial institutions and their employees, including traders at Barclays, the British bank, according to government officials close to the case who spoke on the condition of anonymity because the investigation is continuing. The authorities expect to file charges against at least one bank later this year, one of the officials said.
The prospect of criminal cases is expected to rattle the banking world and provide a new impetus for financial institutions to settle with the authorities. The Justice Department investigation comes on top of private investor lawsuits and a sweeping regulatory inquiry led by the Commodity Futures Trading Commission. Collectively, the civil and criminal actions could cost the banking industry tens of billions of dollars.
Authorities around the globe are examining whether financial firms manipulated interest rates before and after the financial crisis to improve their profits and deflect scrutiny about their health. Investigators in Washington and London sent a warning shot to the industry last month, striking a $450 million settlement with Barclays in a rate-rigging case. The deal does not shield Barclays employees from criminal prosecution.
The multiyear investigation has ensnared more than 10 big banks in the United States and abroad. With the prospects of criminal action, several firms, including at least two European institutions, are scrambling to arrange deals, according to lawyers close to the case. In part, they are trying to avoid the public outcry that stemmed from the Barclays case, which prompted the resignation of top executives.
The criminal and civil investigations have focused on how banks set the London interbank offered rate, known as Libor. The benchmark, a measure of how much banks charge one another for loans, is used to determine the borrowing costs for trillions of dollars of financial products, including mortgages, credit cards and student loans. Cities, states and municipal agencies also are examining whether they suffered losses from the rate manipulation, and some have filed suits.
With civil actions, regulators can impose fines and force banks to overhaul their internal controls. But the Justice Department would wield an even more potent threat by bringing criminal fraud cases against traders and other employees. If found guilty, they could face jail time.
The criminal investigations come at a time when the public is still simmering over the dearth of prosecutions of prominent executives involved in the mortgage crisis. The continued trouble in the financial sector, including the multibillion-dollar trading losses at JPMorgan Chase, have only further fueled the anger of consumers and investors.
But the Libor case presents a potential opportunity for prosecutors. Given the scope of the problems and the number of institutions involved, the rate-rigging investigation could provide a signature moment to hold big banks accountable for their activities during the financial crisis.
"It's hard to imagine a bigger case than Libor," said one of the government officials involved in the case.
The Justice Department has jurisdiction over the London bank rate because the benchmark affects markets in the United States. It could not be learned which institutions the criminal division is chasing next.
According to people briefed on the matter, the Swiss bank UBS is among the next targets for regulatory action. The Commodity Futures Trading Commission is pursuing a potential civil case against the bank. Regulators at the agency have not yet decided to file an action against the bank, nor have settlement talks begun. UBS has already reached an immunity deal with one division of the Justice Department, which could protect the bank from criminal prosecution if certain conditions are met. The bank declined to comment.
The investigation into the global banks is unusually complex and it could continue for years, and ultimately end in settlements rather than indictments, said the officials close to the case. For now, regulators are building investigations piecemeal because the facts of the cases vary widely. That could make it difficult to compile a global settlement, although some banks would prefer an industrywide deal to avoid the harsh glare of the spotlight, said a lawyer involved in the case.
American authorities face another complication as they build cases. Investigators still lack access to certain documents from big banks.
Before gathering some e-mail and bank records from overseas firms, the Justice Department and American regulators need approval from British authorities, according to the people close to the case. But officials in London have been slow to act, the people said. At times, British authorities have hesitated to investigate.
By contrast, the Justice Department and the Commodity Futures Trading Commission have spent two years building cases together. Lanny Breuer, head of the Justice department's criminal division, has close ties with David Meister, the former federal prosecutor who runs the commission's enforcement team.
In the Barclays case, the British bank was accused of reporting false rates to squeeze out extra trading profits and fend off concerns about its health. During the crisis, banks feared that reporting high rates would suggest a weak financial position.
Lawmakers in London and Washington are examining whether regulators looked the other way as banks artificially depressed the rates. On Friday, it was disclosed that a Barclays employee notified the Federal Reserve Bank of New York in April 2008 that the firm was underestimating its borrowing costs. Despite the warning signs, the illegal actions continued for another year.
But in April 2008, a senior enforcement official at the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, Vincent McGonagle, opened an investigation. He directed the case along with another longtime official, Gretchen Lowe.
At first the case stalled as the agency waited months to receive millions of pages of documents when Barclays pushed back against the American regulators, according to the officials close to the case. By the fall of 2009, the trading commission received a trove of information, providing a broad view into the wrongdoing.
A series of incriminating e-mail and instant messages, regulators say, laid bare the multiyear scheme. In one document, a Barclays employee said the bank was "being dishonest by definition."
The case gained further traction in early 2010, when the agency's enforcement team engaged the Justice Department. The department's criminal division, led by Mr. Breuer, agreed that regulators had a strong case. The investigation continued until January 2012, when the trading commission notified Barclays lawyers that they were entering the final stages before deciding about an enforcement action.
As part of the deal, regulators pushed the bank to adopt new controls to prevent a repeat of the problems. Among other measures, the bank must now "implement firewalls" to prevent traders from improperly talking with employees who report rates.
The bank says that it provided extensive cooperation during the three inquiries, and has spent around $155 million on its own three-year investigation. Because it agreed to settle with British authorities, Barclays received a 30 percent fine reduction.
In the United States, Barclays offered to pay a fine of $200 million to the C.F.T.C., slightly below the initially proposed range, according to government officials close to the case. Mr. Meister's team soon accepted the offer, securing the biggest fine in the commission's history.
On June 27, British and American authorities announced the deal with Barclays, which agreed to pay more than $450 million total. "For this illegal conduct, Barclays is paying a significant price," Mr. Breuer said then.

HEADLINE: July 14: Another Recount in Florida?

BYLINE: NATE SILVER


HIGHLIGHT: With a new poll of Florida from Mason-Dixon, released on Saturday, showing Barack Obama with a nominal 1-percentage point lead there over Mitt Romney, the FiveThirtyEight model shows Florida as close as can be. 

 BODY:
We haven't usually been running forecast updates on the weekend, but a Florida poll will always get our attention. In this case, it's a new poll from Mason-Dixon, released on Saturday, that shows Barack Obama with a nominal 1-percentage point lead there over Mitt Romney.
Our model shows Florida as close as can be. It projects the Nov. 6 result as Mr. Obama 49.5 percent, Mr. Romney 49.4 percent -- an outcome that would be close enough to trigger another recount.
Mr. Obama has led in the majority of Florida polls recently -- five of seven since June 1. The model hedges against these polls a bit because Florida is normally a bit Republican-leaning and since its economy is doing quite poorly. That's how it gets a tie there.
Still, Mr. Obama's polling in Florida seems to have improved by a percentage point or so since a couple of months ago -- at a time when national polls have generally been quite steady. That has brought it a bit closer to the national average and increased its ranking on our list of tipping point states that are most likely to decide the election.

HIGHLIGHT: Political news from today's Times and around the Web, plus a look at the president's weekly address and the latest happenings in Washington. 

 BODY:
Today's Times

        
Mitt Romney demanded an apologyfrom President Obama on Friday, capping one of the most intense 48 hours of the 2012 campaign, Micheal D. Shear writes. While Mr. Romney has sought to keep attention on the weak economy, Mr. Obama's team said Mr. Romney's dealings at Bain Capital should be fair game, with each side angrily accusing the other of outright lies and distortions.

        
Republicans, by reframing the issue of taxes on the wealthy into a debate about job creation, have evoked American's patriotic support of small businesses as an engine of economic growth, Trip Gabriel reports. But the world of small business is complex, with many enterprises not fitting the rosy image of a tech start-up or a mom-and-pop florist, and recent studies have cast doubt on the idea that small businesses are major job creators.

        
While President Obama lamented to a crowd of supporters in Virginia that "there is so much negativity and so much cynicism" in politics, a tweet was released from his account about the tempest over Mitt Romney's departure from Bain Capital, Mark Landler writes. The account is maintained by his campaign staff, but it underscores the vivid contrast between what Mr. Obama says, and what is often said in his name.

        
With the help of several former White House chiefs of staff, a bipartisan group called No Labels has fashioned a blueprint for the presidency that would make whoever wins in November both more powerful and more accountable, Peter Baker reports. If the proposals were enacted, the next president would have more latitude to reorganize the government, appoint his own team, reject special-interest measures and fast-track his own initiatives through Congress.
 
Weekly Address

        
President Obama used his weekly address to denounce "top-down economics," saying that Republicans in Congress believe spending "trillions more on tax cuts for the wealthy, it'll somehow create jobs - even if we have to pay for it by gutting education and training and by raising middle-class taxes." He pointed to the tax cuts of the last decade as an argument for why they should not be preserved for wealthy Americans, blaming those policies for taking the country from surpluses to deficits and failing to provide a "promised" rise in wages and middle class jobs. "What we need are policies that will grow and strengthen the middle class," he said. "And that's why, this week, I called on Congress to immediately stop the January 1st tax hike from hitting any American on the first $250,000 of their income."

HEADLINE: Obama Ad Features a Singing Romney

BYLINE: MICHAEL D. SHEAR


HIGHLIGHT: President Obama's campaign continued on Saturday to prosecute its case against Mitt Romney for holding offshore accounts, releasing a new television ad that mockingly shows the Republican candidate singing "America the Beautiful." 

 BODY:
President Obama's campaign continued on Saturday to prosecute its case against Mitt Romney for holding offshore accounts, releasing a new television ad that mockingly shows Mr. Romney, the Republican candidate, singing "America the Beautiful."
The president's campaign has spent more than a week hammering Mr. Romney's personal wealth and calling on him to disclose more information about his personal finances by releasing his tax returns.
The new ad - which the campaign said was running in Colorado, Florida, Iowa, North Carolina, Nevada, New Hampshire, Ohio, Pennsylvania, and Virginia - reminds viewers of those issues even as it shows a clip of Mr. Romney singing at a campaign event in Florida earlier this year.

It says Mr. Romney shipped jobs to Mexico, China and India - accusations that Mr. Romney's campaign vehemently denies. And it notes that Mr. Romney had "millions" in a Swiss bank account and "tax havens" in Bermuda and the Cayman Islands.
"Mitt Romney's not the solution," the ad states. "He's the problem."
Amanda Henneberg, a spokeswoman for the Romney campaign, said of the ad, "As the failures of his presidency become more evident, Barack Obama has resorted to the tactics of a typical politician - dishonest and totally unsubstantiated attacks meant to distract from his own record by smearing the reputation of his opponent. The Obama campaign appears to be stuck in their own 'groundhog day,' repeating the same, debunked charges they've waged for weeks in an effort to distract voters from this administration's failure to fix the economy and create jobs."
Mr. Romney's campaign has repeatedly defended the offshore accounts, saying that he paid all the taxes he was legally required to pay. On Friday, Mr. Romney again refused to release multiple years of his tax returns.
"I know there will always be calls for more. People always want to get more," Mr. Romney said on CNN. "And, you know, we're putting out what is required plus more that is not required. And those are the two years that people are going to have. And that's - that's all that's necessary for people to understand something about my finances."

HEADLINE: The Bronx is Yearning

BYLINE: By ADAM DAVIDSON. 
Adam Davidson is co-founder of NPR's ''Planet Money,'' a podcast and blog.

 BODY:
Earlier this year, Miguel Sanchez decided he wanted out of Manhattan. So he uprooted his digital creative agency to an Internet incubator in a restored red-brick building with a sleek, modern design. For a few hundred bucks a month, Sanchez, who has recently done work with brands like Belvedere and Mercedes-Benz, joined a community of entrepreneurs who share ideas and get advice on nitty-gritty start-up matters. He just recorded his best month of billings ever.
This may sound like another Brooklyn success story, but Sanchez is operating out of Sunshine Bronx, an ambitious new development in Hunts Point, a neighborhood known for unemployment and rampant prostitution. There's no Ping-Pong table, but Sunshine is nevertheless trying to make entrepreneurs feel as though they've left the South Bronx and stepped into Silicon Valley. 
This may seem overly ambitious, but Ruben Diaz Jr., the borough president, reminded me that the Bronx is home to nearly a dozen colleges and universities and the research arms of the New York Botanical Garden and the Bronx Zoo. (''There are so many scientists here,'' he said.) Diaz, like many officials I spoke to, claimed that the area's problems are largely based on perception. This may be partly true, but nearly a third of its residents over age 25 lack a high-school diploma. Only 17 percent have finished college.
The Bronx's inability to catch up with the rest of the city's phenomenal economic growth has been disconcerting. In the early 1970s, the Bronx and Brooklyn had similar average household incomes. Since then, though, the gap has grown significantly. The average Brooklyn resident is now around 23 percent richer than the average Bronxite; people in Queens are roughly 32 percent richer. (Manhattan residents are 265 percent wealthier; Staten Island residents, by the way, are 55 percent richer.) What happened?
''It's not an accident,'' says Dart Westphal, a former community developer who has lived in the Bronx for decades. Brooklyn and Queens were once collections of independent towns whose homegrown economies were rooted in Long Island agriculture, not Manhattan mercantilism. Local elites built expensive town houses on tree-lined streets. These neighborhoods fell on hard times during the 1970s, but their expensive stock was perfectly positioned for revitalization as the Manhattan boom of the past few decades pushed young professionals across the river. The Bronx, however, never developed its own economic drivers. It became, by the late 19th century, a haven for immigrants attracted to (but unable to afford) Manhattan. The borough developed far fewer wealthy areas, and many neighborhoods became devoted to less-gentrifiable housing units.
As a result, the most productive parts of the Bronx's economy have long come from industrial-size activities that rely on Manhattan. Sunshine Bronx is located near the Hunts Point cooperative market, which supplies fresh produce, fish and meat to essentially all of the region except Hunts Point. Though pretty much all fresh food in every New York supermarket comes from there, the area currently doesn't have a single supermarket itself. ''Finding lunch in the neighborhood is a big problem,'' says Sanchez, who spends much of the week meeting clients in Manhattan anyway.
After spending an afternoon in Hunts Point with Sanchez, I realized that he and his colleagues, just like the cooperative, are, economically speaking, barely in the Bronx at all. Manhattan is where their income comes from and where they spend their money on contract employees, computer supplies, even lunch. Though Borough President Diaz spoke with hope about a revival led by tech jobs, the economic triumphs that he ticked off were more redolent of a small Rust Belt town -- a new BJ's Wholesale Club and an indoor mall that could bring 2,000 construction jobs and 1,700 permanent positions. The borough is hoping to lure a luxury hotel near Yankee Stadium so that visitors will spend the night, and more of their money, in the Bronx. Diaz also boasted of the $600 million for new housing developments -- partly government funded -- for senior citizens and low- or moderate-income families.
These sorts of projects may contain little of the thrill of a tech boom, but they are ''at least serving the real, immediate needs of residents,'' says Bruce Katz, director of the Metropolitan Policy Program at the Brookings Institution. The Bronx may look troubled when compared with Brooklyn or Manhattan, but comparison with a Rust Belt city is probably more appropriate. ''It looks good in comparison with Buffalo, Detroit, Cleveland, St. Louis,'' says Kenneth T. Jackson, the renowned New York City historian. Indeed, the borough has recovered remarkably from the 1970s, when the buildings were famously burned, and it still fulfills a crucial role in the city's economic cycle. It remains the place, Jackson says, where many ambitious immigrants can ''get started on the ladder of life and success.''
So perhaps the Bronx shouldn't try to become a more affordable Greenwich Village (like parts of Brooklyn) or an enclave of the young, hip and ambitious (like parts of Queens). For economic inspiration, Katz suggests, the Bronx should look outside New York. Pittsburgh lost its steel industry, but the city -- home to Carnegie Mellon, Pitt and other research institutions -- redefined itself as a solid second-tier educational and research center. The Bronx, Katz says, is also strong in the highly coveted ''eds and meds'' sector. ''It boggles the mind,'' he says, how much hospitals and universities spend. As a result, they offer extensive potentially valuable service jobs without degree requirements.
Unlike former industrial cities that are struggling to find a new economic logic, the Bronx also happens to be a short train ride away from the financial capital of the world. And that might just be the borough's real challenge. Manhattan is filled with so many clever businesspeople that it can suck up any great value created in its proximity. Can the Bronx somehow take advantage of its presence in the Manhattan economic orbit without being lost in it?
I thought of this as I talked to Theodore Livingston, better known as Grandwizzard Theodore, the creator of ''scratching'' and master of the needle drop. As a kid in the 1970s, he and a small group of friends pioneered hip-hop in the South Bronx. It was a movement, he says, that could have been born only in that natural incubator. In the South Bronx, Grandwizzard says, there was a mix of James Brown's political songs, conga-beat drumming and the lyrical music played by new immigrants from Jamaica. ''We all lived in the same building,'' he said. ''We all intertwined.''
Hip-hop, of course, made billions of dollars worldwide, but not a lot of it stayed in the Bronx. Now Miguel Sanchez and his colleagues are hoping that the borough's unique mix of diversity and low-cost real estate will again make it an entrepreneurial playground. Only this time they need to prevent Manhattan from swallowing up the profits.
Deep thoughts this week:
1. The Bronx has always had a complicated relationship with Manhattan.
2. Let's stop comparing it with Brooklyn.
3. And compare it instead with Pittsburgh.

HEADLINE: A Bigger 'Jumbo' Market

BYLINE: By VICKIE ELMER

 BODY:
THE so-called jumbo mortgage market is strong, competitive and growing, with more lenders, and more loan products now being offered, which means it's more important than ever to comparison-shop.
''Most lenders -- large and small, even credit unions now -- will make jumbo mortgages,'' said Guy Cecala, the publisher of Inside Mortgage Finance, a trade publication. ''That's something we haven't seen before.''
As recently as 2009, just a handful of big banks had dominated the market for jumbo mortgages, also called nonconforming loans, which exceed $625,500 in high-cost areas like New York. (Conforming mortgages meet specific guidelines of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, which repurchase the loans and resell them to investors. Because lenders assume less risk, interest rates for conforming loans typically have been lower than for nonconforming.) 
Some experts had predicted that higher-end real estate would suffer after Fannie and Freddie lowered the maximum amount on conforming mortgages last October from $729,500. Instead, lenders have added products and even eased qualifications for some borrowers.
Jason Auerbach, a divisional manager at First Choice Bank in Manhattan who specializes in jumbo mortgages, estimates that the number of lenders making jumbo loans in the New York region alone has jumped 20 percent. He says lenders have become especially more competitive for loans up to $2 million, with 30 to 40 percent down.
The acceleration in activity has occurred over the last six months, with smaller lenders jumping into the fray, said Melissa Cohn, the chief executive of the Manhattan Mortgage Company, a large mortgage broker. ''Banks are flush with cash and need to lend,'' she said.
Lenders made $63.8 billion in jumbo loans in the first quarter, 18 percent more than in the first quarter of last year, according to the latest data available from Inside Mortgage Finance, which estimated that jumbo loans accounted for 16.6 percent of all loan originations in the first quarter, up from 9.9 percent for all of 2009.
Mr. Cecala says that lenders see the jumbo market as profitable because it is generally populated by borrowers who tend to have a higher net worth and credit scores, and because borrowers are often required to make larger down payments, usually starting at 30 percent of the purchase price.
As they compete for business, some lenders are seeking to carve out niches -- based, for example, on geography, or on a borrower's credit quality or background. Mr. Auerbach said that First Choice had been lending to many foreigners and people returning from overseas markets. It also provides ''superjumbo lending'' of up to $6 million, he said.
Other lenders are loosening requirements on self-employed borrowers and even offering interest-only mortgages to borrowers who meet certain income standards, according to Keith Gumbinger, a vice president of HSH.com, a financial publisher in Pompton Plains, N.J.
And there is also what Ms. Cohn describes as an asset liquidation loan, in which lenders can qualify people who may have large bank balances and other assets but not enough income. ''There's far more creativity in the jumbo space than there is in the conforming market,'' she said.
Because there are ''57 flavors in the jumbo market'' it's important for borrowers to take the time to compare loan products. Mr. Cecala suggests starting with smaller lenders like community banks, some of which may be more likely to approve a mortgage application if a borrower already has an account there.
Mr. Auerbach says borrowers should get preapproved, because some lenders tailor their requirements to the size of the loan. They may, for example, have higher credit standards or require bigger down payments for loans above $1.5 million.

HEADLINE: This Season, Cold Facts Are Getting In the Way

BYLINE: By JEFF SOMMER

 BODY:
IN the middle of a hot summer, the last thing anyone needs is more bad news about the economy.
Mountain breezes and ocean waves, ice-cold beer and frosty ice cream -- these refreshing things bring a smile when the temperature rises. But bleak economic reports? No one really wants to hear about them.
Yet the unpleasant news has been pouring in anyway, and not just from the usual trouble spots, like Greece and Spain and other battered countries in the euro zone. In the rapidly developing economies of China and Brazil, the rate of growth has been slowing. 
The numbers in the United States have been worrisome, too. The growth rate of the gross domestic product fell to 1.9 percent in the first quarter, down sharply from 3.0 percent in the fourth quarter of 2011. Preliminary data for the second quarter suggests that growth was quite weak, and that the sluggishness could deepen in the months ahead.
Of course, you don't need to crunch numbers to know that the state of the economy is hardly cheering. Not if you're looking for a job or running a business or trying to decide whether to save, spend or hire (and certainly not if you're an incumbent seeking re-election in November).
In the belief that simply ignoring these problems won't make them go away, I took a closer look at some of the recent data and reviewed the work of some of the economists who are sifting through it.
The American economy is so vast and complex that it's hard even to measure it and impossible to predict its direction with any certainty. Still, this much is clear: An economic recovery that had not been very rapid in the first place has lost some momentum. Whether this is just a temporary stumble or something deeper -- the sign, perhaps, of an incipient recession -- is an open question.
Michael Thompson, managing director of S.&P. Capital IQ Global Markets Intelligence, says that he isn't sure which way the economy is heading, but that the flood of negative numbers made him decide last week to switch ''from a glass-half-full to a glass-half-empty point of view.''
He sharply upgraded his estimate of the probability of a recession to 50 percent from 20 percent, and downgraded his estimate of economic growth this year to the range of 1 to 1.5 percent -- low enough that an actual economic contraction could easily occur. ''It wouldn't take very much to push the economy into a negative quarter,'' a downturn that would feel like a recession to just about everyone, he said.
At the very least, the economy has hit another soft patch. He said that was evident in the labor market, which has never fully recovered from the last recession. The unemployment rate is stuck at 8.2 percent, after all, and unless growth picks up, the jobless epidemic will persist for the foreseeable future. In June, the Bureau of Labor Statistics reported, United States employers created only 80,000 jobs, far fewer than needed just to keep up with population growth. It was the third consecutive month of significantly subpar jobs numbers.
Mr. Thompson also cited the June Purchasing Managers' Index report from the Institute for Supply Management, which dipped to a reading of 49.7 -- the first time it was below 50 since July 2009. A number that low implies a reduction in G.D.P., which ''could be a game-changer,'' he said.
Lakshman Achuthan, chief operations officer of the Economic Cycle Research Institute, an independent research firm, has been predicting a recession since September, and says that the recent spate of weak data ''unfortunately supports our view, which is that a recession has, quite likely, already begun.'' Mr. Achuthan said it was possible that ''sometime at the end of the year or early next year the data will be revised and we'll start to get some clarity about when the recession actually started.''
This kind of delay in recession dating is nothing unusual, he observed. For the last six recessions, he said, there has been a six-month median lag from the beginning of a recession to the first quarterly decline in G.D.P. In other words, he said, it's quite possible that the United States is in a recession but that it won't be obvious until after the November election.
At the Federal Reserve, the perspective is more upbeat than this, without being entirely positive. The consensus is that the economy -- which had not been growing briskly -- has slowed further and is likely to grow at only a ''moderate'' pace for an extended period and then ''pick up very gradually,'' according to the minutes of the Fed's June policy-making meeting, which were released last week.
''Most participants saw the incoming information as indicating somewhat slower growth in total demand, output, and employment over coming quarters than they had projected in April,'' the minutes said. At that last meeting, Fed officials also said they expected growth of only 1.9 to 2.4 percent this year, half a percentage point lower than they forecast in April. That's roughly the same as the Wall Street consensus.
OF course, the Fed isn't merely an observer. It could try to spur growth itself through yet another round of monetary stimulus. That might not do much for economic growth, but it could easily set the stage for a stock market rally. And while fiscal stimulus before the election is unlikely, Congress and the White House could improve conditions by averting the so-called fiscal cliff that looms at year-end, when taxes are scheduled to rise and spending is to fall.
Furthermore, while the recent data has darkened the short-term outlook, not everyone believes that this situation will deepen or persist. James W. Paulsen, chief investment strategist at Wells Capital Management, says he believes that the clouds are likely to lift soon. ''This economy is healthier than you think,'' he said, ''and I expect it to pick up speed in the second half of the year.''
Stocks are already priced for trouble, he said, so it may not take much to get a rally started. Mr. Paulsen, for one, advises investors to find ways to stay cool -- and to stay in the market.

HEADLINE: Sartre and Camus in New York

BYLINE: By ANDY MARTIN. 
Andy Martin is a lecturer at Cambridge University and the author of ''The Boxer and the Goalkeeper: Sartre vs. Camus.''

 BODY:
In December 1944, Albert Camus, then editor of Combat, the main newspaper of the French Resistance, made Jean-Paul Sartre an offer he couldn't refuse: the job of American correspondent. Sartre, who had long dreamed about the United States, was delighted to get out of post-Liberation Paris. Camus himself would make the trip soon after, only to return with a characteristically different set of political, philosophical and personal impressions. Both would be kept under close surveillance by the F.B.I., who naturally suspected all philosophers of being subversives.
In some sense, existentialism was going home. Twentieth-century French philosophy was not immune to the metaphysical turmoil of the United States at the end of the 19th century. More significantly, both Camus and Sartre had borrowed from 20th-century writers like Faulkner, Hemingway and Dos Passos -- and, of course, from the films of Humphrey Bogart. Camus, in particular, cultivated the trench coat with the upturned collar. 
When Sartre stepped off the plane in New York in January 1945, his head full of American movies, architecture and jazz, he might have expected to feel in his natural habitat -- the pre-eminent philosopher of liberte setting foot in the land of freedom. Existential cowboy meets Wild West. He soon acquired an American girlfriend (about whom he wrote abundantly and explicitly to Simone de Beauvoir: ''I am killed by passion and lectures''). But in an article written for Town & Country, ''Manhattan: The Great American Desert,'' he records that he suffered on arrival from ''New York sickness,'' more metaphysical than physical.
Sartre walked up Fifth Avenue beneath a frozen sky, looking for New York but not finding it. He missed the intimate quartiers of Paris, finding in their place only ''filmy atmospheres, longitudinally stretched masses with nothing to mark a beginning or end.'' Just the kind of place, one might think, where an expatriate existentialist ought to fit right in. And yet he suffered stubbornly from a sense of disorientation. ''In the numerical anonymity of roads and avenues,'' he wrote, ''I am just anybody, anywhere.'' The whole point of a city, Sartre argued, is to fortify itself against nature. But New York, an ''open'' city with a limitless sky above, was porous to storm, snow, heat, wind, floods. It had no real protection against anything. ''I feel as though I were camping in the heart of a jungle crawling with insects.''
And just as he inverts the perception of the American city, so too Sartre turns the notion of American freedom inside out. He finds that beneath its notional attachment to ''individualism,'' America does not actually trust the solitary individual: ''Each American is educated by other Americans and he educates others in turn. Everywhere in New York, in colleges and beyond, there are courses in Americanization.'' Conformism rules. Existentialist anomie is prohibited.
It is Sartre's most powerful and recurrent complaint: that people are being treated as things. The ''nausea'' of the 1930s, elicited by pebbles and trees and ocean depths, morphed, in the '40s and '50s, into a specific aversion to the nonorganic products of economic forces. In America he understood that things were threatening to reify the amorphous human. Sartre holds out the hope that New York is moving in a generally Sartrean and semi-apocalyptic direction. All those skyscrapers? Doomed. ''They are already a bit run-down; tomorrow, perhaps, they will be torn down. In any case, their construction required a faith that we no longer have.'' The Chrysler and the Empire State already appear to Sartre like ancient ruins.
Camus followed in Sartre's footsteps in 1946, providing an ironic commentary on his predecessor. Where Sartre was obsessed with architecture, Camus was indifferent. ''I notice that I have not noticed the skyscrapers, they seemed to me perfectly natural.'' He admired colors, foodstuffs, smells, taxis, tie shops, ice cream, the ''orgy of violent lights'' that was Broadway, a jazz bar in Harlem and the giant Camel advertising icon of ''a G.I., his mouth open, puffing out clouds of real smoke.''
He fell in love several times over, notably with Patricia Blake, a 19-year-old student and Vogue apprentice. He read to her from ''The Plague,'' while she, noting his fascination with the American way of death, found him issues of undertakers' trade magazines -- Sunnyside, Casket and Embalmer's Monthly.
At Vassar, Camus was dazzled by the spectacle of ''an army of long-legged young starlets, lazing on the lawn.'' But he was preoccupied by what he thought of as the ''American tragedy'': that the students lacked a sense of the tragic.
For Sartre the tragic was the mechanization and objectification of the human. Camus, the Resistance philosopher of solidarity, discovered (or rediscovered) the problem of other minds in New York. Unlike Sartre, he had no difficulty with things, trees, the Empire State Building, the impersonal ocean, ''these seas of forgetfulness, these unlimited silences that are like the enchantment of death.'' It was only on looking into the face of another human being that he fully experienced a sense of the tragic. While hell-is-other-people Sartre came to invoke a notion of the ''group-in-fusion,'' Camus increasingly redefined the ''absurd'' in terms of a failure of language to bridge the gap between individuals.
The clash between Sartre and Camus would come to be defined by their political divergence in the '50s. But already, in their different reactions to the United States, we have the ingredients of a philosophical schism. Sartre, on his return to Europe, recalls above all America's racism and practice of segregation, the inevitable counterpart to its drive to conformity. The split between contending forces -- East and West, black and white, bourgeoisie and proletariat -- becomes the defining concern of his philosophy, summarized in the phrase he comes up with in his ''Critique of Dialectical Reason'' to define boxing but that also applies to his relationship with Camus: ''a binary praxis of antagonistic reciprocity.'' Existentialism in this form infiltrates the American intelligentsia and finds an echo in writers as disparate as Richard Wright and Norman Mailer.
Camus, on the other hand, begins to sound more like Samuel Beckett. All at sea in the night, between continents, far away from everything, Camus is already less the solemn ''moralist'' of legend, more a (pre-) post-structuralist in his greater concern and anxiety about language, his emphasis on difference and refusal to articulate a clear-cut theory: ''I am too young to have a system,'' he told one audience. And it is this anti-systematic aspect of America that he retains and refuses to clarify: ''After so many months I know nothing about New York.''
Sartre and Camus's love-hate relationship was played out and reflected in their on-off romance with America. As Camus put it, ''It is necessary to fall in love ... if only to provide an alibi for all the random despair you are going to feel anyway.'' Above all the two thinkers emphasize that America is always balanced precariously, like a tightrope walker, on the thread of a philosophical dialectic.

HEADLINE: With Gambling in Decline, a Faded Reno Tries to Reinvent Itself

BYLINE: By NORIMITSU ONISHI; Malia Wollan contributed reporting from San Francisco.

 BODY:
RENO, Nev. -- Apple? The outdoors? Bowling?
As Reno, that other city in Nevada, seeks to move beyond an economy and a downtown dominated for decades by mammoth casinos, it is grasping at various possibilities that have little to do with the industry that defined it.
Apple announced in late June that it would build a $1 billion data center here, even as Reno was cementing its reputation as one of the country's bowling meccas by hosting several tournaments at the 78-lane National Bowling Stadium.
Meanwhile, an advertising campaign promoting the area's outdoor activities is aimed at a diverse array of tourists, including, for the first time, same-sex couples. ''What's your passion?'' asks the campaign, which has nearly no mention of gambling.
The arrival of Indian casinos and the spread of state-sanctioned gambling across the nation have cut deeply into the revenues of former monopolies on legalized gambling like Las Vegas and Atlantic City. But none was as devastated as Reno, whose customers came mostly from the Bay Area and other corners of California. Instead of driving a couple hundred miles and crossing the Sierra Nevada, Californians just headed for slot machines at Indian casinos close to home. 
In what many here considered a sign of the times, downtown Reno's showcase gambling establishment, the Silver Legacy Resort Casino -- a 35-story, 1,700-room giant whose opening in 1995 was supposed to usher in a new golden age for the city -- filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection in late May. Its owners have said the filing will not affect operations, a pledge seemingly reinforced by announcements of the coming acts, including Cheap Trick on Aug. 3, on a billboard next to its 120-foot replica of a mining rig.
Other fading casinos and some empty buildings loom over a small downtown that has been largely abandoned by residents. Reno, which was also hit particularly hard during the housing crisis, has struggled to reinvent itself precisely because it has been a single-industry city, experts say. Even before gambling, Reno made a name for itself by offering quick divorces, but it also lost that business in the 1960s after other states loosened restrictions on divorce.
''Reno has had it easy until recently because it had a monopoly on things that were illegal in the other states,'' said Alicia Barber, a historian at the University of Nevada, Reno, and the author of ''Reno's Big Gamble.'' ''But now it's facing tough questions for the first time. It's like a child star that still wants the world's attention.''
After peaking in 2000, when Indian casino gambling took off in California, gambling revenues in Reno have fallen by a third. What is more, gambling revenues per square foot of floor space are down nearly a quarter, according to the Center for Gaming Research at the University of Nevada, Las Vegas.
City officials and experts say that gambling will not disappear from Reno, but that its importance to the city, as well as its influence, has been waning.
Wanting to keep gamblers inside their buildings, hotel casinos did not support and sometimes opposed the development of other city attractions, businesspeople say. They had little interest in the University of Nevada, Reno, whose campus lies just a few blocks north of downtown, because students have little money to gamble.
''In the past, we had hotels turn down our business because they didn't want bowler groups,'' said Joe Kelley, the general manager of the National Bowling Stadium.
Until around 2000, Mr. Kelley said, a dozen tour buses would arrive daily at the Silver Legacy or the Eldorado next door. ''As the patrons got off the bus,'' he said, ''somebody would hand them a roll of quarters and a coupon for the buffet. Every morning. And the buses, they don't come here anymore. So they look to us to fill their property.''
Also completed in 1995, the bowling stadium is scheduled to undergo a $15 million renovation, including the addition of 10 lanes. Last month, the United States Bowling Congress agreed to hold championship tournaments here through 2030.
Christopher Baum, the chief executive of the Reno-Sparks Convention and Visitors Authority, which owns the stadium, said bowling would be a cornerstone of the new Reno. The emphasis on bowling was in keeping with the ''What's your passion?'' campaign to rebrand Reno as a destination for activities other than gambling, said Mr. Baum, who was recruited here half a year ago from the Detroit Metro Convention and Visitors Bureau.
''Reno is much easier to sell than Detroit because you don't have a negative to overcome as much as a lack of information,'' he said.
But like Detroit, Reno is also wrestling with the future of its downtown. The construction of several giant hotel casinos in the 1970s pushed residents out of the area, a trend that culminated with the closing of its last supermarket when the Silver Legacy was completed, said Ms. Barber, the historian.
Downtown has become a major issue in local politics.
''The reality is that the casinos are never going to be as successful as they once were, so what do you do with those big buildings downtown?'' said Bernie Carter, a candidate for the City Council.
Mr. Carter is the biggest developer in Midtown, a district just south of downtown where young entrepreneurs have opened restaurants and cafes in the last couple of years. The emerging district, formerly dotted with X-rated shops and check-cashing businesses, is fueling hopes that residents will gravitate downtown to patronize nongambling establishments.
CommRow, a major downtown developer, is transforming three former casino buildings into a hotel and restaurants, said Dean Hanson, the general manager. Only a fourth building will be renovated into a small new casino.
But city officials and businesspeople say that only new jobs downtown will attract locals. In recent years, they say, most casinos that were converted into condominiums have done poorly because of the housing crisis and a lack of incentives for living downtown.
Andrew Clinger, the city manager, said Apple would help. Besides a data storage center on the city's outskirts, Apple will open an office downtown in a new building that may house other technology companies the city is wooing. Critics have said that overly generous tax breaks were given to attract Apple, but Mr. Clinger said the benefits could extend beyond future revenues and jobs by changing Reno's image.
''Attracting an international icon to Reno puts us on the map,'' Mr. Clinger said, adding that the new building would also help change downtown's landscape by replacing ''seedy motels'' that are there now.
But others say it will take more than Apple to change downtown, much less Reno. ''The recent announcement by Apple is a positive sign,'' said Mark Nichols, the acting chairman of the economics department at the University of Nevada, Reno. ''But, frankly, it's not really obvious what Reno's new direction will be.''

HEADLINE: Many Governors Are Still Unsure About Medicaid Expansion

BYLINE: By MICHAEL COOPER

 BODY:
WILLIAMSBURG, Va. -- How well the new health care law succeeds in covering millions of the poorest Americans will depend largely on undecided governors of both parties, who gathered here this weekend and spoke of the challenges of weighing the law's costs and benefits in a highly charged political atmosphere and a time of fiscal uncertainty.
The Supreme Court's ruling last month that the states should have the choice of whether to expand their Medicaid programs has set the stage for a frenzied year and a half in which governors will have to analyze their options, devise plans, negotiate with the federal government and successfully navigate the thorny statehouse politics that often accompany any big change. Much of the law is set to take effect in 2014, when many governors will be facing re-election.
The initial reaction to the court's ruling split along party lines. More than half a dozen Republican governors -- including those of Texas and Florida, which have the nation's largest populations of poor uninsured residents -- said they would not expand their programs because Medicaid already eats up an unsustainable share of their budgets. A slightly bigger number of Democratic governors said they would move swiftly to expand coverage in their states, with the federal government pledging to pick up all the costs at first and 90 percent of them after 2020. 
But as they gathered here this weekend at a meeting of the National Governors Association, most governors in both parties said that faced with a choice they did not expect to have, they needed to study how to proceed with this significant change in federal-state relations. Not all Democrats were leaping at the chance to expand their programs, and not all Republicans were ruling it out.
''This deals with hundreds of thousands of Missourians, it deals with their health care, it deals with billions of dollars, and we will be involved in a process that defines the best fit for our state and respects the sovereignty of our state and the individuality of our state,'' said Gov. Jay Nixon of Missouri, a Democrat who is facing re-election this year, as well as a Republican-led legislature.
Gov. Bob McDonnell of Virginia, the chairman of the Republican Governors Association, has been one of the sharpest critics of the health care law, but he did not rule out the possibility that he might ultimately decide to expand his state's Medicaid program. ''Honestly, I don't think it's responsible for my state, fully, to make the decision now,'' he said.
Many Republican governors who opposed the law delayed taking action on it before the court ruled. Several, including Gov. Scott Walker of Wisconsin, now say they will wait to act until after November in the hopes that Republicans will win the presidency and the Senate and dismantle it. But Mr. Walker did not wholly reject the idea of expanding Medicaid. ''We're not ruling it one way or the other,'' he said on Saturday after a meeting about controlling health care costs.
Once governors make up their minds, many could face battles with their legislatures. Gov. Mark Dayton of Minnesota, a Democrat, has made expanding Medicaid a top priority, but he faces some strong resistance from the state's Republican-controlled Legislature. And Gov. Chris Christie of New Jersey, a Republican who has expressed doubts about expanding the program, faces a Legislature controlled by Democrats, many of whom want to implement the new law.
When Rhode Island's legislature failed to reach an agreement on setting up a health care exchange after a disagreement about how abortions would be covered, Gov. Lincoln Chafee, an independent and former Republican, decided to create one by executive order. Mr. Chafee said here that he was moving ''full speed ahead'' to expand the Medicaid program because ''the status quo is not acceptable.''
Even governors who seemed to be leaning in one direction or another were keeping their options open. Gov. Jack Markell of Delaware, a Democrat, said he thought the expansion would be good for his state, noting that ''there is a significant cost to doing nothing,'' because right now poor people without coverage get care in emergency rooms, which eventually drives up the costs for people who do have insurance. But he said he was still seeking clarifications from the federal government before absolutely committing to the expansion.
Gov. Mary Fallin of Oklahoma, a Republican, said that she was skeptical that expanding Medicaid made sense, but that her state would nonetheless do a thorough study of its options. ''We wanted to come here to this meeting and to visit with the other governors, certainly to listen to the experts talk about the Supreme Court ruling and the implications, especially the staff that we have that's doing in-depth study of the Supreme Court ruling itself,'' she said.
Their decisions will have ramifications for years. Richard P. Nathan, a senior fellow at the Nelson A. Rockefeller Institute of Government who has written about American federalism, called the health care law ''the biggest change in state-federal relations since the enactment of Medicaid and Medicare in the Great Society.''
Mr. Nathan pointed out that there was initial resistance in many states to the original Medicaid program, but that all states eventually signed up, with Arizona becoming the last to do so in 1982. He said the same thing could happen this time. ''I think it's not unreasonable to believe that even these posturing, recalcitrant states will, in the final analysis, come in,'' he said.
But many states worry about expanding their Medicaid programs, which generally do not currently cover childless adults. The health care law sought to expand the programs to cover all people earning up to 133 percent of the poverty level; those with higher incomes would receive federal subsidies to buy private insurance. But while the law initially threatened to withdraw all Medicaid funding from states that failed to expand their programs, the Supreme Court ruled that such a threat was coercive ''economic dragooning'' and gave them the choice.
The expansion was expected to cover 17 million people, with the federal government paying a vast majority of the costs: through 2022 the federal government will pay an estimated $931 billion to expand Medicaid coverage, leaving the states with a bill of $73 billion, according to an analysis by the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities.
But as health care costs have soared, many states are struggling to pay for their existing Medicaid programs, which have edged out education to become the largest share of state spending. And states are nervous about counting on the federal government, as Washington is consumed by talk of spending cuts. Gov. Tom Corbett of Pennsylvania, a Republican, asked, ''What's it going to cost the people of Pennsylvania?''
The uncertainty was clear at a news conference of the Democratic Governors Association.
Gov. Peter Shumlin of Vermont, a strong supporter of the expansion, had just finished exhorting governors from both parties to ''have a spine'' and declare whether or not they would take the federal money and expand their Medicaid programs, when Gov. John W. Hickenlooper of Colorado joined the news conference and was asked what his state's plans were.
''We are evaluating that,'' he said.

HEADLINE: 'Your Land,' And Guthrie's, Preserved

BYLINE: By LARRY ROHTER

 BODY:
WASHINGTON
THE SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION'S ''Woody at 100,'' a three- CD boxed set commemorating the centennial of Woody Guthrie's birth, begins, as it must, with ''This Land Is Your Land,'' his most famous song. But instead of the standard, sanitized lyrics taught to schoolchildren as a kind of patriotic bromide, it offers an alternate version with an extra verse that is a biting, defiant and subversive jab at what today would be called the 1 percent.
''Woody at 100'' proves to be full of unexpected moments like that, seemingly designed to compel listeners to reassess their image of America's best-known folk singer. Guthrie's political side is certainly on display, with his left-wing sentiments in even sharper relief. But what also emerges is the notion of an artist rooted in country music and the blues, capable of writing in any style, from earnest Appalachian ballad to topical broadside, from hillbilly lament to whimsical children's song. 
''I wanted a slightly different take from the way Woody Guthrie is normally painted, as the hobo or urban folk singer,'' said Jeff Place, chief archivist at the Smithsonian's Center for Folklife and Cultural Heritage and co-producer of the new collection. ''Along with the iconic songs, I also wanted to sprinkle in some obscure stuff to turn people on to a side they may not know, that of Woody as a singer out of Oklahoma'' who absorbed all the many styles of music he heard growing up there.
''Woody at 100'' was released on Tuesday, four days before what would have been Guthrie's 100th birthday; it has 57 tracks, including 6 songs that have never been heard on record and almost an entire CD of performances from radio broadcasts and live shows. It also contains a pair of musicological essays and dozens of Guthrie's drawings, paintings and handwritten lyrics, drawn from the vast collection bequeathed to the Smithsonian 25 years ago by the estate of Moe Asch, founder of Folkways Records, the label for which Guthrie recorded much of his best work.
The country music strain emerges early in the set, with ''Philadelphia Lawyer'' -- a Guthrie original later recorded by Tennessee Ernie Ford, Flatt & Scruggs, and Merle Haggard -- and continues throughout. The last CD not only has Guthrie performing the standard ''Wabash Cannonball,'' a hit for both the Carter Family and Roy Acuff, but also includes four songs broadcast in 1937 by the Los Angeles radio station KFVD, newly surfaced performances that are the earliest known recordings made by Guthrie and are full of the kind of down-home patter, clearly aimed at Guthrie's fellow Okies and other Dust Bowl refugees, that wouldn't have been out of place at the Grand Ole Opry.
''Woody's birth as a musician begins with country music, and he was a country artist,'' said his daughter Nora Guthrie, the founder and director of the Guthrie Archives. ''He's in the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame and the Songwriters Hall of Fame, though not the Country Music Hall of Fame, but that has to do with politics, not his music. He was always plugged into Jimmie Rodgers and the Carter Family, and he identified himself as a hillbilly music performer.''
The collection includes only a couple of blues tracks, the most notable of which may be a version of ''Stagger Lee'' that Guthrie performed for the BBC during World War II, when he was serving in the Merchant Marine ''warshin' dishes on a Liberty Ship,'' as he puts it to the program's clearly baffled host. But blues licks percolate in his guitar parts throughout the boxed set -- a result, he suggests to his BBC host, of being raised in a place where ''the population is one-third Indians, one-third Negroes and one-third white people.''
The politically charged populist anthems are present too, of course, and one revelation of the boxed set is just how many of them have been made current by the Great Recession that began in 2008. ''The Jolly Banker'' takes a swing at the money men who, when ''the times they are rotten'' and ''the bugs get your cotton'' will ''come and foreclose, take your car and your clothes,'' while ''Jesus Christ'' recasts the New Testament as a lesson in class warfare, and ''Pretty Boy Floyd'' includes the couplet ''Now as through this world I ramble, I've seen lots of funny men/Some will rob you with a six-gun, some with a fountain pen.''
Meanwhile the unexpurgated version of ''This Land Is Your Land,'' which Bruce Springsteen and Pete Seeger sang at the Obama inauguration in 2009, has become one of the anthems of the Occupy Wall Street movement, thanks in part to Tom Morello of Rage Against the Machine. The version that opens the set includes a passage that eventually evolved into this verse:
There was a high wall there
That tried to stop me
A sign was painted that said 'Private Property'
But on the other side it didn't say nothin'
That side was made for you and me.
''Here we are at 100 years, and yet through an unfortunate turn of events he is as valid an artist as ever,'' said Robert Santelli, author of the book ''This Land Is Your Land: Woody Guthrie and the Journey of an American Folk Song'' (Running Press) and Mr. Place's co-producer on the CD set. ''He wrote about immigration, banks, the disenfranchised, and many of those topics are with us still. We wanted to show the vision and poetic beauty of these songs, but also how music can act as an agent for social and political change, and Woody is the poster boy for that.''
Indirectly ''Woody at 100'' also makes an argument for Guthrie's continued artistic relevance. Nearly every book ever written about Bob Dylan notes how central an influence he found Guthrie, who died in 1967 after struggling for nearly two decades with Huntington's disease, a nerve disorder. But the music on these discs, especially talking blues like ''Talking Centralia'' and various songs in which Guthrie was playing guitar and a harmonica in a rack, suggest that he was a prototype for the entire singer-songwriter movement that began in the 1960s and continues today.
Beyond that, ''Woody at 100'' suggests that Guthrie was also the progenitor of the genre that has come to be known as Americana, heartland or roots rock, whose practitioners include Mr. Springsteen, John Mellencamp, Ry Cooder, Steve Earle, Son Volt and Wilco, which in the late 1990s put music to three CDs worth of Guthrie lyrics together with the British protest singer Billy Bragg, just rereleased as a boxed set. A new CD from Neil Young and Crazy Horse, ''Americana,'' contains a version of ''This Land Is Your Land'' that consists only of the three verses that have generally been ignored, and both John Lennon and Joe Strummer of the Clash have publicly expressed their admiration for Guthrie.
''It's hard to think of another folk musician who has had more influence on American vernacular music today than Woody Guthrie,'' Mr. Santelli said. ''If you pick up a guitar or write songs, you know about this man, you know his story, and at some point you will borrow from or be impacted by him.''
The Guthrie boxed set is perhaps the most ambitious indication of the continuing revitalization of Folkways Records, which Asch founded in New York in the 1940s as an outlet for musical styles outside the commercial mainstream. Already this year the label has issued previously unheard live recordings by Louis Armstrong and Mr. Seeger, and it is about to release the jaunty collection ''Classic Harmonica Blues,'' the latest CD in a series aimed at documenting America's musical heritage in all its forms.
But in keeping with the original Folkways mandate of creating ''an encyclopedia of sound,'' the label has also stepped up its releases of world music, both archival and newly commissioned recordings. A 10-volume ''Music of Central Asia'' series, consisting of CD/DVD packages with extensive, highly informative liner notes, has just concluded. But ''Tradiciones,'' a 38-volume-and-counting series dedicated to the music of the Americas, ranging from Venezuelan carnival music and Uruguayan cowboy songs to recordings by Latinos in the United States, continues.
The estate of Asch, Folkways' eccentric founder, sold the label to the Smithsonian on the condition that none of the more than 2,000 recordings in its catalog be allowed to go out of print. That would have been a deal killer for a conventional commercial label, but for the Smithsonian, whose recording operations are nonprofit and do not rely on taxpayer money, that demand meshed perfectly with what curators there regard as their central mission. In addition to Folkways, the Smithsonian has acquired a dozen other labels specializing in odd corners of the industry, like spoken word and children's recordings and including, most recently, the worldwide rights to Unesco's collection of recorded music from around the globe.
''The Smithsonian is in the business of making everything available forever,'' said Dan Sheehy, director of the Center for Folklife and Cultural Heritage. ''We are mission driven here, with the twin missions of valuing world cultures and understanding the American experience, so money is not the bottom line. Our priority is to build our collection and get it out there.''
That philosophy, which relies heavily on adept use of the Internet to stimulate interest in the material, seems to be yielding the desired results. Though Smithsonian Folkways' revenues are modest, they have nearly doubled, to just under $4 million last year, during a decade in which the record industry as a whole has seen its revenues decline by 50 percent.
Dozens of other discs that Woody Guthrie recorded for Folkways remain stored in the Smithsonian's climate-controlled musical archives here -- which also contain treasures like an original 78 r.p.m. version of Robert Johnson's ''Dust My Broom'' -- as do the lyric sheets for songs he wrote but was unable to record before his disease debilitated him. All told there are more than 3,000 songs written in barely a decade, which suggests that much more of Guthrie's unheard music could be released.
''Woody was like Jimmie Rodgers, Robert Johnson, Hank Williams or Jimi Hendrix,'' Mr. Place said. ''He was a supernova who came through rapidly, but in the short time he was around he influenced everything after.''

HEADLINE: Honeymoon Package: Bride, Benz and Sunshine

BYLINE: By ROBERT PEELE

 BODY:
SAN FRANCISCO
FOR several years my daily driver has been the F train, and it's been good to me. Indeed, it's where I met my wife, Sarah, a twist of fate that led us, in a roundabout way, to the San Francisco airport, where we stood outside the terminal one Sunday last September, waiting for the car we'd be driving on our honeymoon.
I'd managed to keep the car a secret, so this was the big reveal. It appeared from nowhere, as if a wand had been waved: a steel-gray Mercedes-Benz E550 Cabriolet, practically glowing among the dusty airport vans and rental-car shuttles. We stood by our suitcases, gaping like two rubes at a state fair.
From the moment I took the wheel, I knew I was out of my depth. How do you assess a thing so far removed from your everyday experience? Our last rental was a Kia Rio, for Pete's sake. Besides, I'd be test-driving this vehicle on the Pacific Coast Highway, in pharmaceutical-grade sunshine, on my honeymoon. These are not real-world driving conditions. 
Still, I felt some obligation to remain objective about the car. So I came up with a methodology: every time something wasn't perfectly awesome, I wrote it down. What follows is a diary of petty grievances, any of which could be filed under ''Problems, First World.''
DAY 1 We acquaint ourselves with the E-Class cabriolet. Introduced for the 2011 model year, it replaced the CLK convertible in the Mercedes lineup. It's a four-seater that wears its sportiness in a reserved way, like a light sweater thrown over the shoulders of a country-club wife, with a high waistline that helps to maintain an impression of solid respectability. The front windshield, by contrast, is set at a sharp, racy angle, and the driving position is correspondingly low -- the window sill came up to my shoulder, meaning I wouldn't be able to prop my elbow on the door frame. Isn't that half the point of a convertible?
Mercedes chose a fabric roof rather than a retractable hardtop, and its three-layer construction damps exterior noise effectively. The interior is black leather with walnut trim and, equipped with a premium package, promises all manner of Bluetooth-era technical coddling. I spend the drive from the airport playing with the 14-way power-adjustable front seat while Sarah figures out the sound system.
And already, a complaint! It appears the Sirius XM subscription has expired, so there will be no ''70s on 7'' satellite radio this week; fortunately my iTunes library basically replicates their playlist. We find the iPod/MP3 connection, and the system recognizes our iPhones immediately. Crisis averted.
Other complaints: The fruit in the Mark Hopkins hotel's complimentary honeymoon gift basket was Cezanne-quality to gaze upon -- we spent 10 minutes trying to photograph it -- but a little hard on the teeth.
DAY 2 We make our first try at putting the top down at the Golden Gate Bridge scenic lookout, and something's not right. Though I can hear the whirring of a motorized contraption behind the rear seat, the top won't budge. After consulting the owner's manual and popping the trunk to examine the underpinnings of the retractable-roof mechanism, I'm flummoxed. Sarah stands by patiently, pondering the prospect of several decades of this kind of thing.
Finally she figures it out: there's a latch in the trunk that must be locked into place. She pulls it into position, and suddenly the roof unhinges from the front pillars and smoothly retracts. It takes about 20 seconds for the top to disappear into its cubby behind the rear seats, and several more minutes for Sarah to stop gloating.
The next morning we realize there's no way to lower the roof with all of our luggage in the trunk. We spend the rest of the trip with my wife's large purple suitcase in the back seat. I can't speak to the comfort level for rear passengers -- legroom would appear to be compromised if the driver and front-seat passenger choose to stretch their limbs -- but the suitcase never complained.
DAY 3 Here are a couple of tips for your next driving tour of San Francisco. First, unless you're really willing to upset your fellow tourists, twisty Lombard Street, a k a ''the crookedest street in the world,'' is not the place to test the limits of your car's handling. Second, it's tough to roar Bullitt-style over the city's hills while also trying to follow Google Maps.
And I have a genuine criticism. When the 7-speed automatic transmission is set to its default Economy mode, the E550 takes a moment to acknowledge a firm foot on the gas. I noticed this first on the drive from the airport to the hotel, and the last two days confirmed it. Each time I try to lead-foot, the 382-horsepower engine seems to pause to ask ''Are you sure?'' After a half-second it acquiesces with a deep, guttural growl from the 5.5 liter V-8, and a corresponding burst of speed.
In Sport mode that burst is instantaneous, and the difference is that much more obvious now that we're officially on Highway 1, heading south toward Monterey. The solution is to keep it in Sport mode. You're on your honeymoon, fool.
It's only fair to note that I was driving the 2011 E550; the 2012 model features, along with a new transmission, a twin-turbocharged 4.6-liter V-8 that makes 402 horsepower. Still, my lame-duck 2011 Cabriolet is plenty quick, especially when it comes to passing power. After rocketing past four cars on a straight stretch of highway somewhere south of Half Moon Bay, I can confidently estimate that the E550 goes from 45 to 80 in about 3 seconds.
Complaints: We get all the way to Pacifica before realizing there's no In-N-Out Burger there, and make a 10-minute detour back to Daly City for lunch.
DAY 4 The 17-Mile Drive at Pebble Beach is as visually stunning as promised. What the photos don't tell you is that a good portion of it smells like a Mrs. Paul's processing plant. It's the one failing of the Cabriolet's AirCap system, a spoiler that rises above the windshield at the push of a button, with a corresponding air dam behind the rear seats. AirCap does an excellent job of reducing wind turbulence in the cabin, but alas it's not a force field. Next time we'll bring air freshener.
This leg of the trip poses a serious problem: the deep, winding curves north of Big Sur are the ideal performance challenge for the E550, but those same curves offer breathtaking vistas of the jagged cliffs and rocky shore of the Pacific. The thin metal guardrails separating us from the edge of those cliffs, bent crudely back into shape in many places, are a constant reminder that you cannot enjoy both the road and the view at the same time.
I'd say the E550 is dialed in just right for someone like me, a novice who wants to play helldriver now and then but be forgiven for some occasional overexuberance. You can dive into corners and be cradled like a hammock; the wheels hang tight, not sliding a bit as you accelerate perhaps a little too quickly from the apex of a turn. The steering is responsive without being touchy, and the suspension provides a nice combination of comfort and seat-of-the-pants feel.
Complaints: The Caveman Room at the Madonna Inn in San Luis Obispo is kitschy, roadside-America fun until you try to sleep there, at which point the faux-Stone Age walls become claustrophobic and a little creepy.
DAY 5 The problem with my Nit-Picker's Guide to the E-Class is that it can't account for a day like today, when everything is just about perfect. So let's substitute a few quibbles about the mostly excellent 2012 model, which I drove more recently in New York.
The smaller, more powerful engine of the 2012 sedan seemed overeager in Sport mode, as if the direct-injection V-8 were in a hurry to prove its extra 20 horses were worth the trouble. It's hard to say whether this was a characteristic of the new powertrain or of the more leisurely mind-set evoked by the longer, wider sedan. Whatever the cause, with the 2012 sedan I actually preferred driving in Economy mode. The car still lagged a bit in the lower gears, but as it approached highway speeds the E-Class seemed to find its ideal rhythm.
The same could be said of the 2011 Cabriolet, actually. Maybe it's because we've reached a flatter, straighter portion of Highway 1, negating the temptation for me to play with the paddle shifters in manual-transmission mode, but the E550 seems best suited for this kind of casual daylong cruise.
We approach Los Angeles in late afternoon with Katy Perry blasting from the speakers -- a husband quickly learns to make compromises -- and somehow this becomes the thing I'll remember most, driving into Malibu with the top down and the wind blowing and my wife singing along to ''Teenage Dream.'' I'm iffy on the song at first, but Sarah's winning me over with an impromptu dance routine, acting out the lyrics and throwing her arms up into the wind, and at that moment I am head-over-heels in love, not just with the girl, but with the car, the music, the ocean, the sunshine, California, everything.
Complaints: It is embarrassing to have a half dozen valets at the Hollywood Roosevelt Hotel tripping over themselves to help us unload the E-Class. How much do you tip a guy for carrying a pair of sandals?
DAY 6 It's the last full day of our trip, and I'm already nostalgic. Despite the prospect of a long drive back to San Francisco, we spend the early afternoon curling through Topanga Canyon and along Mulholland Drive, squeezing a last few hours of playtime out of the E-Class. After refueling in Studio City, we get to experience an authentic L.A. traffic jam just before sunset.
I haven't mentioned mileage because, to be honest, I didn't keep track of it. For the record, the E.P.A. rates the latest E550 Cabriolet at a mediocre 16 miles per gallon in the city, 25 for the highway, which is actually an improvement over the 2011 model, whose larger engine's thirst was rated at 15/22. But I'm guessing that, with a list price approaching $75,000 with options, fuel economy isn't a top concern of the E550 customer.
Complaints: Kitchen worker at Jack in the Box on Interstate 5 south of Bakersfield is seen leaving the bathroom without washing his hands.
DAY 7 After saying a wistful goodbye to the E550 at the airport valet stand, we fly back to New York to resume our regular, pedestrian lives. The harsh reality doesn't truly set in until we've landed at La Guardia, where in the taxi line a dispirited Crown Vic waits, like a yellow pumpkin, to carry us home.
It's amazing how fast one can become a snob about these things.

MONUMENT 14
By Emmy Laybourne
296 pp. Feiwel & Friends. $16.99. (Young adult; ages 13 and up)
NO SAFETY IN NUMBERS
By Dayna Lorentz
263 pp. Dial Books. $17.99. (Young adult; ages 12 and up)
Even in an economic downturn, who isn't still wooed by the material Mecca of a superstore, whether it's to goggle at the luxury goods or merely to sample the high-fat comfort fare of the food court? Holly Golightly's assertion that nothing bad can ever happen to you at Tiffany's resonates because it seems instinctively true. Shimmering ladders of gold chains, polished rows of perfect produce or neat rainbow stacks of cotton T-shirts can provide a sense of well-ordered security often lacking in the outside world. Two chilling post/apocalyptic novels, ''Monument 14'' and ''No Safety in Numbers,'' both debuts, play with this collective sense of safety in retail therapy, suggesting that something darker may lie beneath the pretty surfaces. 
In ''Monument 14,'' by Emmy Laybourne, a comedian and actress, the consumer refuge is a fictitious Greenway store in Monument, Colo. Set in 2024, the story unfolds in a world where all students have tablet computers that run on an uber-reliable national network; its collapse is the first sign something is awry since, as we learn, ''the Network had never, ever gone down.'' After surviving a horrific morning school bus crash caused by a freak hailstorm, Dean Grieder, a high school junior who is the book's narrator, and 13 other surviving children find themselves in a state of profound shock, forced to organize a makeshift community within Greenway's Walmart-like walls. Once inside, they learn via television that a Canary Island volcano set off a tsunami that has taken out the entire Eastern Seaboard of the United States. The eruption also initiated intense storms that have pummeled the rest of the country. And, in short order, the devastation is followed by an 8.2 earthquake, which compromises the seals of Monument's chemical-weapon storage facility. This causes the release of deadly poisons that, depending on blood type, leave victims paranoid, violent, sterile or dead. Whoa.
While shopping therapy cannot possibly assuage the grim aftershocks of the accumulated disaster, the older teenagers among the group quickly realize their incredible luck in landing in Greenway -- especially after they realize they have enough resources to live on for almost two years as long as they ration and allow no one else inside. Yet when they discover that the escaped contaminants can be passed not only through air but also through running water, their refuge threatens to become their final resting place. Laybourne's strong characterizations of the resourceful, optimistic children who make up this improvised family intensify the horror of the situation and make the almost cartoonish series of catastrophes frighteningly real. After last year's deadly events in Japan, the novel's rapidly amassing disasters seem disturbingly plausible.
Unlike the sanctuary of the Greenway in ''Monument 14,'' the mall at the center of Dayna Lorentz's ''No Safety in Numbers'' is the target of a biological terrorist. When a bomb releasing a deadly flu virus is discovered inside the ventilation system of the Shops at Stonecliff, the Westchester megamall is quickly locked down to keep the potentially infected shoppers from contaminating the greater New York area. The ensuing life-or-death crisis unfolds for four teenagers from different levels of the high school hierarchy: working-class Marco; Lexi the computer whiz; the football rookie Ryan; and Shay, an actress. While Lorentz's attempt to diversify the young adult character pool is laudable (Marco's grandparents are Costa Rican, Lexi is African-American, Shay says her classmates see her as ''the Indian chick''), her profiles lean more toward tell than show, and the third-person narration lacks the nuance and first-person intensity of ''Monument 14.''
Nevertheless, her detailed depiction of the escalating chaos over the course of seven long days is deeply unsettling. When the dire extent of the situation is finally revealed, it leads to group panic, mob violence and worse. As the teenagers' increasingly desperate attempts to escape the marbled halls of plenty make clear, once personal choice is taken away, the notion that the mall is anything but a prison is shown to be little more than a carefully constructed fantasy.
What we're really buying when we scoop up that hot toy, trendy shoe or carton of organic milk, both authors seem to suggest, is not the purchase itself, but what that coveted object represents: a sense of identity, a feeling of community, the illusion of safety. Surrounded by coffee-table art books, fancy watches and slick cellphones, it's easy to feel that the monsters will be kept at bay. As the tightly bonded teenagers quickly learn in these two riveting disaster novels, it is not our perfectly maintained belongings that will save us, but our messy, rewarding relationships.

HEADLINE: The Murky Math of an Ethanol Mix

BYLINE: By NORMAN MAYERSOHN

 BODY:
AS my colleague Matthew L. Wald noted on Wednesday, a filling station west of Kansas City, Kan., recently began pumping E15, the fuel blend of 15 percent ethanol and 85 percent gasoline. The formulation was approved for use by the Environmental Protection Agency late in 2010. 
Though the government cannot compel filling stations to stock the fuel, the Energy Department frames the use of E15 as falling within its broader objective of reducing petroleum imports. (The ethanol is produced primarily from corn grown in the United States.) However, the cost and efficiency benefits for the fuel's end user are not so apparent. As Mr. Wald wrote, ''Some car experts say that the savings are illusory, because a gallon of ethanol has only about two-thirds as much energy as a gallon of gasoline, so it will take a car fewer miles on a gallon.''
At the filling station in Lawrence, Kan., visited by Mr. Wald, the price on Tuesday for E15 was $3.279, 2 cents a gallon less than the standard E10 formulation. The lower per-gallon price means that drivers will pay less to fill their tanks, but it doesn't necessarily mean they are getting a bargain.
The Web site of the Energy Department says motorists can expect their cars to travel ''3 to 4 percent fewer miles per gallon on E10 than on straight gasoline.'' Logically, E15, with its higher concentration of ethanol, will further erode a vehicle's estimated fuel economy.
Using 5 percent as a rough estimate of the fuel economy loss (compared with straight gas, which is difficult to find), the E15 fuel ought to be in the range of 15 cents a gallon cheaper to power that vehicle the same number of miles for each dollar spent.
The more relevant comparison, of course, is to the E10 on sale at the same station. The netted savings of 2 cents a gallon still falls short -- E15 should probably be in the range of 4 to 6 cents a gallon cheaper to yield the same miles-per-dollar result as E10. The E15 may be more attractive to drivers of cars that require premium fuel, as Mr. Wald points out, because the ethanol blend has an octane rating of 90.

HEADLINE: Who Cares

BYLINE: By MONA SIMPSON

 BODY:
When I was first pregnant, years ago, the husband of a novelist I admired told me I was lucky to be a writer. ''No one has to know how much you're with your child,'' he said. ''Relatives who think you should be home all the time can assume you are, and professionals will think the baby's in day care.'' 
This struck me as disturbing advice, but I understood that I was a novice. And in fact, a vagueness about how much we worked, whether that work was financially mandatory, voluntary or somewhere in between, became the lingua franca of my conversations with other mothers when my son was small. You were either ''being a mom,'' as was the preferred way of describing the position in Los Angeles during those years, or you were ''being a mom and something.'' Being a mom and a pulmonary surgeon. Or being a mom and a writer, in my case. We were vague to cover the awkwardness of our differences. Those ''just'' being a mom felt pressure to append an ''and.'' (Why could other women be mothers, too, and get the rewards, both social and financial, of a career?) You could be a mom and spend 15 minutes a day with your child, as a children's-television executive at my preschool confessed, or you could be a mom and spend almost every hour with her.
As an older relative who had a career once told me: Your behind can sit in only one chair at a time. If a mother is sitting in a chair at the office, someone needs to be at home with her child. In some cases, that is a father. Much of the time, the material manifestation of the conflict is a nanny.
Seeing Michele Asselin's portraits, I remember the heightened sensitivity of my first months as a parent. The pictures are beautiful and idealized. The women look at the children with love. No one looks frustrated. No one looks bored. No child is having a meltdown. They conjure the dome of tender air that encloses a mother, whose body is coursing with hormones, and a newborn.
But these moments of private contentment, with the serenity and depth borrowed from the portraiture legacy of the Madonna and child, do not depict mothers with their infants. The women holding the children are nannies. Part of what's striking about the pictures is that they position front and center a person who is often left on the editing-room floor when a family's memories are being assembled. Nannies have told me that their employers crop them out of photographs of their children. On the wall of a West Los Angeles home, I noticed a blown-up photo of a baby in a pretty white dress, held by a pair of hands of a darker color. In her photos, Asselin captures a radiance between caregivers and children, often of different races.
When I met Asselin last month, she was pregnant, weeks away from having her second child. Over the course of two years, while her daughter was a toddler, she interviewed nannies in her TriBeCa neighborhood as she made their portraits. She told me she had been working as a commercial photographer -- work that required her to travel. She liked the idea of long, in-depth undertakings closer to home, because they would allow her to spend more time with her children.
She mentioned that when referring to the person who was taking care of her daughter, she sometimes caught herself slipping between the term ''nanny'' -- with its associations of full-time household staff in 19th-century England -- and ''baby sitter'' -- with its connotations of a high-school girl, part time, perhaps off the books.
I smiled, remembering those strange codes. In a whole generation -- the children of the novelist and her husband were now in their 20s, the photographer's were a toddler and one not yet born -- not much had changed in terms of the given ease women feel about working and child care, even in places like New York and Los Angeles. The transparency men have enjoyed for generations, about their ability to frankly work while also reveling in fatherhood, is still complicated for women. Which is not to say that anyone can have everything.
Slightly more than four million babies are born in the United States every year, and 55 percent of their mothers remain in the work force. We go to college, live together or marry and have kids -- often with little more thought to the daily routines of raising children than our grandparents gave them, when women by and large stayed at home.
Given the mobility of American families (making a nearby grandparent a luxury) and the absence of public day-care options, a significant number of children (and not only those born into the 1 percent) are raised -- at least for a few years -- by paid helpers.
When I had my first child, I fell in with a group of nannies at a park near where I lived in Santa Monica. It was less terrifying than the mothers' group I attended. The nannies congregated on the playground late afternoons, a better time for my writing schedule, dictated in those days by my son's naps. I sat with the English speakers, who were mostly Filipinas: women whose children were grown and in graduate school, women whose babies were being raised by yayas across the Pacific and women who had not yet married. The leader of the group was a 52-year-old mother of five who made eight times what her husband earned as an executive back in Manila. (And of the group, she didn't even hold the highest-paying job. She worked for two college professors.) She grew up with servants. Her father was a judge. She was president of her neighborhood organization and a member of five social clubs. Here, she worked as a live-in nanny. She called herself the C.E.O. of Filipinas in Santa Monica.
One of her proteges was a woman in her 30s from Mindanao, who was educated as a doctor before she came to the United States with her sister. She intended to study for the tests she needed to pass to become a doctor here. She heard of a job taking care of a newborn, and though she had never been in charge of a baby before (she was the youngest in her family), she accepted the position, thinking she would do it for a year or two. A few months later, already working, she learned that her mother died across the Pacific. But she and her sister had come on visitor visas. They couldn't leave the United States and return. They stayed and spent money they saved from their jobs to buy black clothes, which she laundered every night during the months of their mourning. She told the baby boy she took care of about her mother.
We don't like to mix love with money. We want love to come as a gift that offers as much pleasure and reward to the giver as to ourselves. No one receiving love wishes to break it down to its component parts, of good sense and feasibility, much less to consider that payment may be necessary to inspire the whole project.
Even more than we want good love for ourselves, we want it for our children, those vulnerable satellites of our hearts that we send, unsteady, into the world. Lewis Hyde, in his study of gift-exchange societies, tells us that in those economies, the gift needs to go ''around a corner.'' There must be a middle person or the gift becomes a trade. So the person handing over the money cannot be purchasing love for herself. This is an alchemy that works for working parents. You can pay a person who almost certainly will not love you but, with any luck, may love your child.
A husband and wife I knew during those early years had a nanny who became certified as an R.N. Their son, a toddler, was attached to her. She had asked for an increase that would amount to doubling her salary. She could earn that as a nurse, she said, but she would stay because she loved him.
The husband used cliches: ''held up'' and ''highway robbery.''
The wife said she would pay anything. Her son loved the nanny. But they gave their nanny two weeks' notice.
I remember thinking their son might not recover. But by all visible signs, I was wrong.
One day, the woman who called herself the C.E.O. of Santa Monica's Filipinas was given notice when the boy she took care of was old enough for preschool. She devoted her last weeks with him to a crash course in memory making. She took him to a machine that took pictures and paid $7 at Kinko's to have the picture put on a mug.
Her next charge was a girl who had given $5 to another girl at school to be her friend. The nanny had never had this problem at home. With her own daughters, the problem was the opposite: too many friends.
''When you try to buy things that should never be sold,'' she said to the girl, ''they turn into something else, like the princess who turned into a bird.'' She said, ''Money cannot buy love.''
But maybe it could. Her employer paid her, and she loved the daughter.
My children are no longer babies, and the women who helped me raise them, both the people I hired and the women from the playground, have moved on. The C.E.O. of Santa Monica worked for a movie director in Europe, taking care of two children whose monthly clothing budgets nearly matched her salary, and now, at 70, she has retired, back in the Philippines, home, as she always planned. I recently received a text from her: ''I am O.K. Little bored.''
The young woman from Mindanao did not become a doctor here. She married and had two children. She and her husband own their home in Nevada. When she took the children to see the Philippines, I tagged along to do research for a novel I was writing. We went to see her nephews, outside Manila, and delivered basketball jerseys and athletic shoes from their mother, a nanny I knew who was working in Los Angeles. The boys lived in a house their parents owned, but neither parent was there. They were on two different continents, making the money that paid for the house and for private school. Their yaya set dinner on the table. She was the daughter of someone who worked in the family house in the province, when their mother and her sister were growing up there.
The yaya seemed more gifted as a nanny than their mother, I whispered to my friend.
''Well, of course,'' my friend said. ''My sister is educated. Think of you, if you were a nanny.''
Now that my children are older, all this feels a little less poignant, and a few things seem clear.
Pity is a satisfying emotion, easy to set off and without the imaginative moral challenge posed by real empathy. And it is easy to make a case for the tragedy of women taking care of affluent American babies while their own children grow up, parentless, across an ocean or south of a border. Even in places like New York and Los Angeles, where some nannies are paid more than they could make in other jobs available to immigrants, their positions are perilous, subject to the will of one or two bosses. (In 2010, New York passed a basic bill of rights for domestic workers, requiring overtime compensation and three paid days off a year to cover sick days, holidays and vacation. Legislation is pending in California but with no provision for paid days off.)
But few of these immigrants wish to return home, where their families would be paralyzed without the infusion of cash sent from here.
Economists posit that pink-collar jobs -- work usually done by women -- are underpaid, not least because we like to believe that the products involved (love, tenderness, care) are given not sold.
I once asked the nanny from Mindanao who was educated as a doctor whether she minded her job here. She shrugged and said: ''No, Mona. It is dignified work.'' Though less recognized and less valued in our culture, nannies understand the significance of their contribution. They know it every night, as they are being tugged at and begged not to leave.
No one can dispute the importance of raising a child. Most parents, holding a new baby, face the most monumental work of their life. Perhaps the reason we often deny caregivers the social position and the respect they deserve is that we are uncomfortable with our absence from the particular chair they occupy, many hours of the day, many days of the year.
When I started out as a mother, I knew two older women who were raising children and working. One hired au pairs, a different one every year, and then helped the young women get jobs. The other, who had work that required her to travel, had a full-time nanny who stayed with the family for years. I remember thinking that it must have been easier for the mother who hired the au pairs.
I attended a wedding a few years ago. The nanny who stayed with the family for years stood next to the two parents (by then long divorced) for the marriage of the girl they had all raised.

HEADLINE: An Existential Crisis For Law Schools

BYLINE: By LINCOLN CAPLAN

 BODY:
July is the cruelest month for recent law school graduates. State bar exams next week are make-or-break affairs, determining how many will be allowed to practice law. Those exams once set a graduate on the path to a lifelong career. Not anymore. A huge number of new graduates, if lucky enough to find work, will not be employed in legal jobs that require passing the bar.
Only 55 percent of 43,735 graduates in 2011 had a law-related job nine months after graduation, said William Henderson of the Indiana University Maurer School of Law, who analyzed recent data from the American Bar Association. Twenty-eight percent were unemployed or underemployed. And at the 20 law schools with the highest employment, 83 percent of graduates were working as lawyers. At the bottom 20, it was a dismal 31 percent. 
These numbers are far worse than jobs data going back a generation and should be a deep embarrassment to law schools, which have been churning out more graduates than the economy can employ, indulging themselves in copious revenues that higher tuitions and bigger classes bring in. A growing list of deans acknowledge that legal education is facing an existential crisis, but the transformation to a more sustainable model will be difficult and messy.
The number of law office jobs began to decline in 2004, well before the recession. And demand for new lawyers isn't expected to grow much even when the economy recovers. Outsourcing of legal work to places like India and greater efficiencies made possible by smarter software to search documents for evidence, for example, are allowing firms to cut the positions of multitudes of low-end lawyers. In 2009, twice as many people passed bar exams as there were legal openings -- a level of oversupply that may hold up for years. There is, of course, tremendous need for lawyers to serve the poor and middle class, but scant dollars to pay them.
Law schools have hustled to compensate for these shifts by trying to make it look as if their graduates are more marketable, even hiring them as research assistants to offer temporary employment. But those strategies won't fix legal education, particularly when students are starting to see that a high-priced degree, financed by mountains of loans, may never pay off. The number of people taking law school admissions tests fell 24 percent in the last two years, to the lowest level in a decade. Law schools will be crushed if they don't remake themselves, said Frank Wu, dean of Hastings College of the Law at the University of California in San Francisco. ''This is Detroit in the 1970s: change or die.''
Hastings, for example, is reducing the number of its J.D. students by 20 percent in the next three years. It trimmed staff jobs to cut costs, and it increased the teaching load of each faculty member by 20 percent to reduce the need for adjunct professors, among other reasons. But Mr. Wu says the school has no plans to cut the size of its full-time faculty or its compensation or tuition -- and tuition is an unavoidable problem.
Brian Tamanaha reports in ''Failing Law Schools'' that in-state annual tuition at public law schools rose to an average of $18,472 in 2009 from $2,006 in 1985, and tuition at private law schools increased to $35,743 from $7,526.
A lot of money went to raising faculty salaries. With salary and summer pay, the average now is likely close to $170,000 -- and some law professors make $350,000 or more.
As tuition has soared, so has student debt. Nearly 9 out of 10 graduates have sizable debt, with $98,500 the average for the class of 2010, or about $1,200 a month in loan payments over 10 years. Most schools and many students have banked on students' being able to pay back enormous loans with ample salaries, but that flawed model is irretrievably broken.
It will be hard for any school to alter its cost structure without making substantial changes to its faculty and pay, though some schools are earnestly considering two-year J.D. programs and beginning to experiment with more virtual learning in selected courses. Course-sharing among law schools in lecture courses is another cost-saving option.
But in some ways the crisis of law schools goes well beyond the unsustainable economics. Their missions have become muddled, with a widening gap between their lofty claims about the profession's civic responsibility and their failure to train lawyers for public service or provide them with sufficient preparation for practical work.
Some schools are trying to break out of this dead end. Boston's Suffolk University Law School is planning to focus on the justice gap by preparing more students to serve the middle class and poor. At Washington and Lee School of Law in Virginia, the third year is now devoted to practical training. Others have increased courses in negotiation, counseling and other skills. The A.B.A., which accredits law schools, could help by allowing much more experimentation and differentiation among schools -- and by being much more skeptical of diploma mills.
This crisis makes it easy to forget that the law attracts pragmatic types, able to handle changed circumstances. And in fact, huge law firms, hot areas of practice and outsized salaries at top firms are fairly recent developments. Law schools need to be pragmatic, too, finding ways to ensure that graduates can afford to take jobs where the salary is less important than the impact.

HEADLINE: Sunday Dialogue: Are Americans Selfish?

 BODY:
Readers debate whether our political culture has changed.
The Letter
To the Editor:
Is selfishness at the root of America's political and economic problems?
As Kurt Andersen (''The Downside of Liberty,'' Op-Ed, July 4) observed, worries about the relationship between individualism and selfishness are as old as the Republic itself. And in the 1820s, Alexis de Tocqueville voiced his concern that the extreme individualism of the new American democracy could, if not curbed, sap ''the virtues of public life.''
Across a broad range of public policy concerns, the debate over the role of government and ''entitlements'' has been hijacked by those who appeal to the selfish instincts of voters. Just consider the opposition to expansion of health insurance, regulation of the financial markets, increasing taxes on the very wealthy or spending to stimulate the economy.
Appeals to selfishness and its next of kin -- envy -- have been used to justify the gutting of pensions and benefits to public employees. Why should they enjoy benefits that you don't have? Efforts to provide relief to homeowners facing foreclosures and college graduates mired in debt have been stymied by the mantra, Why should my tax dollars be used to help someone who was less frugal than I was? 
Although actions rooted in selfishness may provide some short-term benefits to those who strive to maintain their relative advantages, they are destructive to society as a whole. As each generation's winners institutionalize their advantages, the opportunities for those who are left behind become increasingly fewer. Economic inequality and powerlessness become the norms.
In the 1950s John Kenneth Galbraith bemoaned the existence of ''private affluence and public squalor.'' This disparity has only grown worse in the past 60 years.The prognosis for a political culture in which citizens have been conditioned to think only in terms of ''me'' is grim since democracy requires, for its continued vitality, an understanding that we are all in this together.
PAUL L. NEVINS Boston, July 9, 2012
The writer, a lawyer, is the author of ''The Politics of Selfishness.''
Readers React
There is clearly a crisis in America today, but it is not that we have become more selfish. Research simply doesn't support that assertion.
Numerous surveys show that Americans remain, generally speaking, generous and community-oriented. For example, a significant majority of the American public supports most of the key elements of health care reform when presented to them piecemeal as opposed to as ''Obamacare''; believes the very rich should pay more in taxes; and supports safety net programs such as Social Security. These are not the beliefs of a selfish nation. What, then, is the problem?
The problem is the emergence of 24-hour propaganda-spewing partisan media and the blogosphere at the same time that traditional media, particularly print media, are being both drowned out and financially battered by the Internet. Special interests have taken advantage of the resulting chaos. The result is that many well-meaning and decent Americans who are anything but selfish simply don't know where and whom to turn to for facts and leadership anymore.
Unable to decipher the truth from spin on issues ranging from climate change to deficit spending during a recession, and facing a scary and rapidly changing global economy, more Americans than ever are susceptible to the snake-oil-selling agents of special interests.
TAL J. ZLOTNITSKY Trinity, Fla., July 11, 2012
Mr. Nevins claims that our political and economic problems are due to ''selfishness.'' But since ''selfishness'' is in the eye of the beholder, it can be used to characterize almost any position and used (as Mr. Nevins does here) to demonize opponents. Thus, for example, those who oppose health care reform on the ground that it will lead to an even more wasteful and expensive health care system are merely being selfish, in the author's view -- and their arguments need not be taken seriously.
Of course, one could just as easily portray Mr. Nevins's positions as the product of selfishness, such as that taxes should be raised only on the ''very wealthy'' (and not on the author himself). But this does nothing to advance useful debate.
Indeed, since selfishness is not always a bad thing -- after all, our free market economy depends on actions individuals take every day to advance their own self-interest -- it can hardly be used to gauge the rightness of one's political beliefs.
RANDALL J. PEACH Whitehouse Station, N.J., July 12, 2012
If most Americans cast a selfish vote, we would have had national health insurance decades ago, a more equitable tax system, more government services for citizens who need them, and fewer for large corporations that don't. And we might have avoided misadventures in places like Vietnam and Iraq.
The problem is that those at the top of the socioeconomic pyramid tend to vote in their self-interest, and tens of millions of others vote with them and undermine their own interests in the process. I have never subscribed to Ayn Rand's top-down advocacy for the ''virtue of selfishness,'' but from the bottom up it might be just what we need.
DAVID EISEN Cambridge, Mass., July 11, 2012
Mr. Nevins is quite correct in providing an affirmative answer to the question: ''Is selfishness at the root of America's political and economic problems?'' But he has it all backward.
Hard-working, productive and frugal taxpayers are not exhibiting ''selfishness'' or ''envy'' when they question ''efforts to provide relief to homeowners facing foreclosures and college graduates mired in debt'' by asking, ''Why should my tax dollars be used to help someone who was less frugal than I was?''
Rather, it is irresponsible homeowners and debt-ridden college graduates themselves who are acting selfishly when then ask, ''Why shouldn't other people's tax dollars be used to bail me out just because I've been less responsible, less productive or less frugal than they were?''
ALAN J. MILLER New York, July 11, 2012
Mr. Nevins opines that the ''private affluence and public squalor'' decried by John Kenneth Galbraith has been exacerbated over the last 60 years, but is this really the case? Certainly chief executives today earn salaries that are many times greater than those of their 1950s counterparts, and the wealthiest Americans bear a far less onerous tax burden.
However, it is less clear that the standard of living of the rest of Americans has fallen as dramatically as the fortunes of the wealthy have risen. Social progress since the 1960s has in part compensated for, if not completely counteracted, wage stagnation and narcissism.
To give just a few examples: Compared with 60 years ago, women have far more options when faced with an unwanted pregnancy, public assistance for the poor is more readily accessible, blacks and other minorities face far less discrimination in the job market, and home mortgages and credit are more easily obtained by ordinary citizens.
Increasing the purview of government and strengthening regulations brought this progress about. It is arguable, even probable, that these developments have contributed to a rising, rather than a declining, quality of life for most Americans.
JAMES THAJUDEEN Brooklyn, July 11, 2012
High levels of selfishness in today's modern society are a reflection of desperation and a seismic shift in perceived opportunities for the masses. The advantaged classes of the past were often the object of scorn, just as today's 1 percent generate the ire of a population that feels it is swimming upstream.
The difference is that the ''haves'' of the past inspired others toward achievements of their own. Fifty years ago, a solid education and hard work were enough to guarantee upward mobility. By contrast, today's average American fears that future generations will not live as well as past generations, and that a solid education and strong work ethic guarantee nothing.
The impression is that the ''pot'' of prosperity is fixed; that one person's gain is necessarily another person's loss. This zero-sum view of the future places the focus on the ''me'' instead of the ''we,'' dominating American politics and weakening our economy and standing in the world.
SHARON MADNEK Milwaukee, July 11, 2012
I share Mr. Nevins's conclusion that the health of democracy benefits from a shared understanding of the advantages of collective action and responsibility. I disagree, however, with his diagnosis that selfishness is the root cause of an erosion of that understanding.
Mr. Nevins sees appeals to ''the selfish instincts of voters'' as the basis for justifying public policy positions on a variety of issues, including health insurance reform, financial regulation, tax policy, mortgage relief, student loans and public employee benefits. To the contrary, the appeals driving these debates cultivate the opposite of selfishness.
The advocates of limited government whose emphasis on individualism alarms Mr. Nevins are, paradoxically, collectivists. Their core message is that the collective power of markets solves problems. For instance, the conservative argument against expanding health insurance is not that the uninsured are less deserving of coverage or that the insured shouldn't worry about the uninsured; it's that given an opportunity, unfettered markets will magically take care of the problem.
A genuine appeal to selfishness would invoke obligations for individuals to take responsibility for their actions and the consequences. Arguments built on market illusion give citizens a pass on personal responsibility. They invite us to fantasize that unseen forces beyond ourselves will solve everyone's problems.

The writer is a professor of management at Vanderbilt University.
I had just completed a year as a health policy fellow serving on the staff of the Senate Committee on Health, Education, Labor and Pensions during the battle for health care reform early in the Obama administration. On my last day in Washington before returning to my faculty position at M. D. Anderson Cancer Center in Houston, I toured the National Portrait Gallery with my son. He wanted to see the display about the 14 men who ascended to the presidency from the vice presidency.
As we strolled through the gallery, a television monitor was playing videos of famous presidential speeches. On came John F. Kennedy's Inaugural Address on Jan. 20, 1961. For my son, it was history. For me, it was yesterday: ''Ask not what your country can do for you -- ask what you can do for your country.''
After a year of witnessing countless lobbyists jostle for position among the staff of the Senate to improve the revenue streams of their various clients -- hospitals, insurers, pharmaceutical companies -- to formulate something more akin to a deal than a bill, I thought I had lost track of why I started on the journey through medical school to research and public policy in the first place.
With one sentence, I remembered how it all began when I was 12.
Let's ''ask not'' again.
LEONARD A. ZWELLING Bellaire, Tex., July 11, 2012
The Writer Responds
Some readers think that we are not selfish enough, others that we misunderstand the meaning of selfishness.
Mr. Peach argues that selfishness is not always a bad thing and that the free market economy depends upon actions in pursuit of one's own interests. But isn't that precisely the problem? Wasn't the current Great Recession, in large part, caused by giving avarice and selfishness free rein as regulation of the financial markets was emasculated?
Mr. Eisen has a point that too many voters don't understand their own self-interest, but I think that there is an important distinction between selfishness (which is based upon short-term calculations) and self-interest (which requires a long-term perspective). Thomas Frank's book ''What's the Matter With Kansas?'' seems to have correctly identified the etiology of this political malady.
Lastly, I agree with Mr. Zlotnitsky that the 24-hour media have enabled special interests to fill the void with partisan rhetoric, but I disagree that Americans remain ''community-oriented.'' Research by Robert Putnam, a Harvard professor and author of ''Bowling Alone,'' challenges this assumption.
Over the decades, as Americans migrated from cities to suburbs and exurbs, their ties to community, already weakened by the residual individualism of our culture, have unraveled. Ever larger amounts of time are expended commuting. Neighborhoods have become merely places to sleep and to mow the lawn. This sense of isolation has numbed the ability of many of us to feel that we are members of a broader political community in which all of us, as citizens, must play a part for our mutual advancement.

HEADLINE: Boom Promises 20,000 New Jobs but Shortages Too

BYLINE: By KATE GALBRAITH.

 BODY:
FREEPORT, Tex. -- The largest chemical complex in the Western Hemisphere resembles a city of pipes and stacks. And Dow Chemical, its owner, is spending more than $4 billion to make it even larger.
''In terms of dollars, this is the biggest expansion since we built the place,'' said Earl Shipp, vice president for Dow's Texas operations, who works out of the vast Freeport facility that dates to 1940.
More Texas chemical plants -- a dozen, at least -- are also moving forward with new projects. The hydraulic fracturing technology that sparked a drilling frenzy around Texas and the nation has proved a boon for the petrochemical industry, which is converting cheap and abundant natural gas into resins and polymers that go into items like synthetic clothing and cellphones. Experts say this represents the largest petrochemical expansion in Texas since the days of cheap oil in the 1980s.
But the growth comes amid concerns about future shortages of water and electric power statewide, as well as worries about the industry's impact on air pollution in the Houston area. 
Although the cheap natural gas presents an ''enormous opportunity'' for the petrochemical industry, ''we want to be sure that as all of this activity takes off, it's not creating a lot of bads'' like water scarcity or air pollution, said Kenneth B. Medlock III, the deputy director of the Energy Forum at Rice University's James A. Baker III Institute for Public Policy. (Rice University is a corporate sponsor of The Texas Tribune.)
Texas already includes the country's largest concentration of petrochemical plants, with more than 200 manufacturing facilities, according to the Texas Chemical Council. The industry started in the decades after Texas' first big oil discovery in 1901, and growth accelerated during World War II, when the Allies sought synthetic rubber and material for explosives.
Modern plants use mostly natural gas, rather than oil, to make the chemicals. Whereas power plants run on methane, a component of natural gas, chemical plants use other, hotter-burning components -- ethane, propane and butane.
The Texas Commission on Environmental Quality says that eight petrochemical plant operators have applied for air permits within the past 16 months. These include big names like Exxon Mobil (which plans expanded facilities at Baytown and Mont Belvieu), Chevron and Occidental.
A few plants, including Exxon, have filed for two permits. Some plants are not even on the list; they may not need new air permits or may not have yet filed for them. (Dow, which is not on the list, is completing the applications for its recently announced facility in Freeport that will convert ethane to ethylene, a product whose ultimate uses include plastic bags and medical tubing.)
Not all the facilities planned may be fully built, said Hector Rivero, the president of the Texas Chemical Council. Conditions can change. For example, chemical companies are watching the fiscal turmoil in Europe, a major manufacturing hub, Mr. Rivero said. Dramatically tighter regulation of hydraulic fracturing, or a surge in natural-gas vehicles that drives up demand and prices for the fuel, could also affect petrochemical operations.
Nonetheless, it is a remarkable turnaround for an industry that was in the doldrums just four years ago, as natural gas prices soared to $13 per million British thermal units and China strengthened its manufacturing advantage. Gas prices are now less than $3. That allows Texas to compete because natural gas and energy account for more than half of a plant's operating cost, according to Mr. Rivero.
''The mood is much better. You see a lot of smiling faces out there,'' said Chris Witte, the site manager for another expanding Freeport plant that is adjacent to Dow's and owned by BASF. The chemical industry, he added, has fought hard not to ''go the way of the steel industry.''
Texas is also fighting to stay ahead of a competitor state along the gulf. ''People may say, 'Well, Texas is getting the big ones,' '' said Dan Borne, president of the Louisiana Chemical Association. ''Well, I can tell you this much -- we're getting some substantial ones, too.''
Often, the plants can take advantage of local incentives to expand, like tax abatements. Some plant operators have applied to the Texas Enterprise Fund, which provides money for job-creating projects. Dow, for example, received a $1 million grant from the fund in April, and Kuraray America, a chemical company expanding in Harris County, is getting nearly that much.
Mr. Rivero estimates that the expansions already announced total $15 billion in investment and will create about 20,000 jobs. Most will be in construction, but about a quarter will be permanent, he said. Dow anticipates 4,500 construction jobs in the coming years, with 300 permanent jobs resulting from the expansion. In Brazoria County, which includes Freeport, unemployment stands at 7 percent, and residents are hoping to benefit.
''They're excited -- 'Oh my gosh I'm going to have a job,' '' said Mayor Norma Garcia of Freeport.
Chemical companies say they are eager to ensure that enough skilled workers are available to fuel the boom -- like pipe fitters, welders and electricians. Mr. Witte of BASF said that about 40 percent of workers at his plant were eligible to retire over the next five years.
''We were looking at a significant concern from a personnel standpoint anyways,'' he said. BASF has provided money to a program to train skilled workers at Brazosport College in Lake Jackson.
But the expansions come at a time when Texas is facing critical questions about the availability of water and power. The crippling drought, which has abated but not ended, forced a Formosa Plastics facility along the coast in Point Comfort to temporarily adjust to receiving as much as 20 percent less water from a nearby lake as its level receded. Chemical plants need vast amounts of water for cooling and cleaning.
Mr. Shipp of Dow said that intensive new conservation efforts resulted in water-use cutbacks of 10 percent last year at existing facilities, and that the savings should ensure there is enough water for the expansion. During the drought, Dow also began using cleaned-up wastewater from a nearby operation.
''We may not want to drink it, but we can certainly wash a rail car out with it,'' Mr. Shipp said.
Dow's new facilities will also be less water-intensive than those using earlier technologies, but the company also bought land last year to build another reservoir.
As for power, even a brief blackout can cause potentially critical disruptions at chemical plants. The Texas electric grid has recently come under scrutiny for not having enough power reserves to accommodate a growing population, especially during hot summers in the future (although abundant natural gas has created cheap power, which helps the plants).
Many chemical plants generate electricity themselves. Dow produces enough to operate independent of the grid, but some plants do not.
''I don't know that anyone is immune to the questions of reliability,'' said James LeBas, a fiscal consultant to industry groups.
Environmentalists, for their part, are worried about air pollution. Matthew Tejada, executive director of Air Alliance Houston, said the major concern was ozone levels, which were high in Texas last year.
In the Houston area, Mr. Tejada said in an e-mail, ''the next several years could be the worst for ozone in terms of adding new sources of ozone precursors since regulations began in the 1970s.''

HEADLINE: Two Classes, Divided by 'I Do'

BYLINE: By JASON DePARLE

 BODY:
ANN ARBOR, Mich. -- Jessica Schairer has so much in common with her boss, Chris Faulkner, that a visitor to the day care center they run might get them confused.
They are both friendly white women from modest Midwestern backgrounds who left for college with conventional hopes of marriage, motherhood and career. They both have children in elementary school. They pass their days in similar ways: juggling toddlers, coaching teachers and swapping small secrets that mark them as friends. They even got tattoos together. Though Ms. Faulkner, as the boss, earns more money, the difference is a gap, not a chasm.
But a friendship that evokes parity by day becomes a study of inequality at night and a testament to the way family structure deepens class divides. Ms. Faulkner is married and living on two paychecks, while Ms. Schairer is raising her children by herself. That gives the Faulkner family a profound advantage in income and nurturing time, and makes their children statistically more likely to finish college, find good jobs and form stable marriages.
Ms. Faulkner goes home to a trim subdivision and weekends crowded with children's events. Ms. Schairer's rent consumes more than half her income, and she scrapes by on food stamps. 
''I see Chris's kids -- they're in swimming and karate and baseball and Boy Scouts, and it seems like it's always her or her husband who's able to make it there,'' Ms. Schairer said. ''That's something I wish I could do for my kids. But number one, that stuff costs a lot of money and, two, I just don't have the time.''
The economic storms of recent years have raised concerns about growing inequality and questions about a core national faith, that even Americans of humble backgrounds have a good chance of getting ahead. Most of the discussion has focused on labor market forces like falling blue-collar wages and lavish Wall Street pay.
But striking changes in family structure have also broadened income gaps and posed new barriers to upward mobility. College-educated Americans like the Faulkners are increasingly likely to marry one another, compounding their growing advantages in pay. Less-educated women like Ms. Schairer, who left college without finishing her degree, are growing less likely to marry at all, raising children on pinched paychecks that come in ones, not twos.
Estimates vary widely, but scholars have said that changes in marriage patterns -- as opposed to changes in individual earnings -- may account for as much as 40 percent of the growth in certain measures of inequality. Long a nation of economic extremes, the United States is also becoming a society of family haves and family have-nots, with marriage and its rewards evermore confined to the fortunate classes.
''It is the privileged Americans who are marrying, and marrying helps them stay privileged,'' said Andrew Cherlin, a sociologist at Johns Hopkins University.
About 41 percent of births in the United States occur outside marriage, up sharply from 17 percent three decades ago. But equally sharp are the educational divides, according to an analysis by Child Trends, a Washington research group. Less than 10 percent of the births to college-educated women occur outside marriage, while for women with high school degrees or less the figure is nearly 60 percent.
Long concentrated among minorities, motherhood outside marriage now varies by class about as much as it does by race. It is growing fastest in the lower reaches of the white middle class -- among women like Ms. Schairer who have some postsecondary schooling but no four-year degree.
While many children of single mothers flourish (two of the last three presidents had mothers who were single during part of their childhood), a large body of research shows that they are more likely than similar children with married parents to experience childhood poverty, act up in class, become teenage parents and drop out of school.
Sara McLanahan, a Princeton sociologist, warns that family structure increasingly consigns children to ''diverging destinies.''
Married couples are having children later than they used to, divorcing less and investing heavily in parenting time. By contrast, a growing share of single mothers have never married, and many have children with more than one man.
''The people with more education tend to have stable family structures with committed, involved fathers,'' Ms. McLanahan said. ''The people with less education are more likely to have complex, unstable situations involving men who come and go.''
She said, ''I think this process is creating greater gaps in these children's life chances.''
Ms. Schairer's life offers a vivid example of how rapidly norms have changed. She grew up in a small town outside Ann Arbor, where her life revolved around church and school and everyone she knew was married.
''I thought, 'I'll meet someone, and we'll marry and have kids and the house and the white picket fence,' '' she said. ''That's what I wanted. That's what I still want.''
She got pregnant during her first year of college, left school and stayed in a troubled relationship that left her with three children when it finally collapsed six years ago. She has had little contact with the children's father and receives no child support. With an annual income of just under $25,000, Ms. Schairer barely lifts her children out of poverty, but she is not one to complain. ''I'm in this position because of decisions I made,'' she said.
She buys generic cereal at about half the brand-name price, takes the children to church every week and posts their happy moments on her Facebook page. Inequality is a word she rarely uses, though her family life is a showcase of its broadening reach.
''Two incomes would certainly help with the bills,'' she said. ''But it's parenting, too. I wish I could say, 'Call your dad.' ''
Path to Single Motherhood
The van with the cracked windshield arrived on a recent day at 7:30 a.m., and three people emerged, the smallest stifling yawns. Several days a week, Ms. Schairer opens the child care center 45 minutes before she can send her two youngest children to school. Bored children in work spaces make mornings tense.
Savannah, 7, crossed the play area on stilts. Steavon, 10, threw a ball. As parents with infants and toddlers hurried past, Ms. Schairer chided the two to stay out of the way. ''They're really not supposed to be here,'' she said.
Steavon has Asperger syndrome, a mild form of autism that can lead to sharp mood swings. He slumped on her desk, wanting $2 to buy a bagel at school. Ms. Schairer does not carry cash -- one way not to spend it -- and handed him pretzels from home. ''I don't like those!'' he said, shoving them away.
Ms. Schairer is known for a spotless desk. Steavon found a leaky pen.
''I'm ready for you to go,'' she said.
Time away is money lost -- Ms. Schairer punched a clock by the door -- so she hurried the children to school and returned with a look of relief. A stop in Ms. Faulkner's office brought a bit of rejuvenating gossip: two teachers were having a tiff. Adult diversions are absent at home.
''I talk to myself a lot,'' Ms. Schairer said.
Although she grew up in the 1990s, Ms. Schairer's small-town childhood had a 1950s feel. Her father drove a beer truck, her mother served as church trustee and her grandparents lived next door. She knew no one rich, no one poor and no one raising children outside of marriage. ''It was just the way it was,'' she said.
William Penn University, eight hours away in Iowa, offered a taste of independence and a spot on the basketball team. Her first thought when she got pregnant was ''My mother's going to kill me.'' Abortion crossed her mind, but her boyfriend, an African-American student from Arkansas, said they should start a family. They agreed that marriage should wait until they could afford a big reception and a long gown.
Their odds were not particularly good: nearly half the unmarried parents living together at a child's birth split up within five years, according to Child Trends.
Ms. Schairer has trouble explaining, even to herself, why she stayed so long with a man who she said earned little, berated her often and did no parenting. They lived with family (his and hers) and worked off and on while she hoped things would change. ''I wanted him to love me,'' she said. She was 25 when the breakup made it official: she was raising three children on her own.
She had just answered an ad from a child care center that needed a teacher's assistant. Ms. Faulkner hired her and promoted her twice, most recently to assistant director.
''She was always stepping out of the classroom and helping,'' Ms. Faulkner said. ''She just had that drive, that leader in her. I trust her completely.''
Ms. Schairer took night classes and earned a degree from Washtenaw Community College. A supervisor from the corporate office wrote, ''We are so lucky to have you.'' Still, after nearly six years, she remains an hourly employee making $12.35 an hour, simultaneously in management and on food stamps.
After Ms. Schairer had an operation for cervical cancer last summer, the surgeon told her to take six weeks off. She went back to work five weeks early, with a rare flash of class anger. ''It's easy when you make $500 an hour to stand there and tell me to take six weeks off,'' she said. ''I can't have six weeks with no pay.''
A Broadening Gap
Despite the egalitarian trappings of her youth, Ms. Schairer was born (in 1981) as a tidal surge of inequality was remaking American life. Incomes at the top soared, progress in the middle stalled and the paychecks of the poor fell sharply.
Four decades ago, households with children at the 90th percentile of incomes received five times as much as those at the 10th percentile, according to Bruce Western and Tracey Shollenberger of the Harvard sociology department. Now they have 10 times as much. The gaps have widened even more higher up the income scale.
The reasons are manifold: the growing premium a college education commands, technological change that favors mind over muscle, the growth of the financial sector, the loss of manufacturing jobs to automation and foreign competitors, and the decline of labor unions.
But marriage also shapes the story in complex ways. Economic woes speed marital decline, as women see fewer ''marriageable men.'' The opposite also holds true: marital decline compounds economic woes, since it leaves the needy to struggle alone.
''The people who need to stick together for economic reasons don't,'' said Christopher Jencks, a Harvard sociologist. ''And the people who least need to stick together do.''
Changes in family structure do not explain the gains of the very rich -- the much-discussed ''1 percent'' and the richest among them. That story largely spills from Wall Street trading floors and corporate boardrooms.
But for inequality more broadly, Mr. Western found that the growth in single parenthood in recent decades accounted for 15 percent to 25 percent of the widening income gaps. (Estimates depend on the time period, the income tiers and the definition of inequality.) Gary Burtless of the Brookings Institution found it to account for 21 percent. Robert Lerman of the Urban Institute, comparing lower-middle- and upper-middle-income families, found that single parenthood explained about 40 percent of inequality's growth. ''That's not peanuts,'' he said.
Across Middle America, single motherhood has moved from an anomaly to a norm with head-turning speed. (That change received a burst of attention this year with the publication of Charles Murray's new book, ''Coming Apart: The State of White America, 1960-2010,'' which attributed the decline of marriage to the erosion of values, rather than the decline of economic opportunity.)
As recently as 1990, just 10 percent of the births to women like Ms. Schairer (white women with some postsecondary schooling but not a full college degree) occurred outside marriage, according to Child Trends. Now it has tripled to 30 percent, compared with just 8 percent for women of all races with college degrees.
Less-educated women are also more likely to have children with more than one man. Analyzing nearly 2,000 mothers in their mid- to late 20s, Child Trends found that a third of those with high school degrees or less already had children with multiple men. So did 12 percent of mothers with some post-high-school training. But none of the women in the study who had finished college before giving birth had children with multiple men.
''That's a dramatic difference, and it varies by education more than by race,'' said Mindy Scott, a Child Trends demographer. ''It tells you these families are on different trajectories. Having men in the house for a short time with ambiguous parenting roles can be really disruptive for children.''
Ms. Schairer did not have a child with another man, but she did find a new boyfriend, who she thought would help with the children and the bills. They dated for a year before he moved in. Kirsten, 11, and Savannah liked him fine, but Steavon adored him.
''I'm not the only boy anymore; we're going to do boy stuff!'' Ms. Schairer recounts him saying.
''What's boy stuff?'' she asked.
''We're going to play video games and shoot Nerf guns and play Legos,'' he said.
''We do that now,'' she said.
''Yeah, but you're not a boy,'' he said.
The details of what followed are less important than the disappointment the boyfriend left behind. No Legos got built during his six-month stay, and it took a call to the police to get him to go. The children asked about him a few days later but have not mentioned him since.
Whether measured by Legos or marriage rates, the pattern is similar: the middle is shifting toward the bottom.
Forty years ago, the top and middle income thirds had virtually identical family patterns: more than 95 percent of households with children in either tier had two parents in the home. Since then the groups have diverged, according to Mr. Western and Ms. Shollenberger: 88 percent at the top have two parents, but just 71 percent do in the middle.
''Things remained extremely stable in the top third,'' Mr. Western said. ''The middle is increasingly suffering some of the same disadvantages as the bottom.''
That is the essence of the story of Ms. Faulkner and Ms. Schairer. What most separates them is not the impact of globalization on their wages but a 6-foot-8-inch man named Kevin.
School Trips and Scouting
Kevin Faulkner works the sunrise shift twice a week, leaving home at 5:30 a.m. for a computer programming job so he can leave work in time to take his sons to afternoon swim practice. Jeremy, 12, is serious and quiet. Justin, 10, is less driven but more openly affectionate. They arrived home recently to a note from Ms. Faulkner about the next day's Boy Scout trip.
Thursday night:

Kevin -- Pay Home Depot
Chris -- Sort clothes
The couple's life together has unfolded in to-do-list style. They did not inherit wealth or connections or rise on rare talent. They just did standard things in standard order: high school, college, job, marriage and children. ''I don't think I could have done it any more by the books,'' Ms. Faulkner said.
The result is a three-bedroom house, two busy boys and an annual Disney cruise.
The secret to their success resides in part in old-fashioned math: strength in numbers. Together, the Faulkners earn nearly three times as much as what Ms. Faulkner earns alone. Their high five-figure income ranks them near the 75th percentile -- hardly rich, but better off than nearly three of four families with children.
For Ms. Schairer, the logic works in reverse. Her individual income of $24,500 puts her at the 49th percentile among parents: smack in the middle. But with only one paycheck, her family income falls to the 19th percentile, lagging more than four out of five.
The Faulkners built a house in Livingston County because of the good schools. Ms. Schairer cares about education, too. But with Ann Arbor rents wreaking havoc on her budget, she is considering a move to a neighboring town where the school system lags. She shops at discount grocery stores and tells Savannah to keep away a friend who raids the cabinets.
''I feel bad, like maybe she's not getting enough to eat,'' Ms. Schairer said. ''But sometimes I don't know what I'm going to feed my own kids, never mind another.''
Jeremy Faulkner plays tennis and takes karate. Justin plays soccer and baseball. They both swim and participate in Boy Scouts, including a weeklong summer camp that brings the annual activities bill to about $3,500.
Boy Scouts has been especially important, offering the boys leadership opportunities and time with their father, who helps manage the troop and rarely misses a weekly meeting or monthly camping trip. Jeremy started as a shy boy terrified of public speaking. Now he leads the singalong and is racing to make Eagle Scout.
''He's just blossomed through Boy Scouts,'' Ms. Faulkner said. ''I could do the scouting with them, because we have single moms who play that role. But they have different experiences with their dad. Kevin makes good money, but he's an awesome dad.''
Ms. Schairer tells an opposite story: constraints in time and money limit her children to one sports season a year. That compounds Steavon's isolation, she said, and reduces her chances to network on his behalf. When she invited his classmates to a park on his birthday a few months ago, no one came.
''He cried and cried and cried,'' she said. ''I tried the parents I had numbers for, but they didn't respond.''
Researchers have found that extracurricular activities can enhance academic performance, and scholars cite a growing activities gap to help explain why affluent children tend to do so much better than others in school.
Four decades ago, families in the top income fifth spent about four times as much as those at the bottom fifth on things like sports, music and private schools, according to research by Greg J. Duncan of the University of California, Irvine, and Richard J. Murnane of Harvard. Now affluent families spend seven times as much.
Two parents also bring two parenting perspectives. Ms. Faulkner does bedtime talks. Mr. Faulkner does math. When Ms. Faulkner's coaxing failed to persuade Jeremy to try hamburgers, Mr. Faulkner offered to jump in a pool fully clothed if he took a bite -- an offer Jeremy found too tempting to refuse.
While many studies have found that children of single parents are more likely to grow up poor, less is known about their chances of advancement as adults. But there are suggestions that the absence of a father in the house makes it harder for children to climb the economic ladder.
Scott Winship of the Brookings Institution examined the class trajectories of 2,400 Americans now in their mid-20s. Among those raised in the poorest third as teenagers, 58 percent living with two parents moved up to a higher level as adults, compared with just 44 percent of those with an absent parent.
A parallel story played out at the top: just 15 percent of teenagers living with two parents fell to the bottom third, compared with 27 percent of teenagers without both parents.
''You're more likely to rise out of the bottom if you live with two parents, and you're less likely to fall out of the top,'' Mr. Winship said.
Mr. Winship interprets his own results cautiously, warning that other differences (like race, education or parenting styles) may also separate the two groups. And even if marriage helped the people who got married, he warns, it might hurt other families if it tied them to troubled men.
''You get back to the question of how many marriageable men there are,'' he said.
At the same time, scholars have found that marriage itself can have a motivating effect, pushing men to earn more than unmarried peers. Marriage, that is, can help make men marriageable.
As Mr. Faulkner tells it, something like that happened to him -- he returned to college after an aimless hiatus because he wanted to marry Ms. Faulkner. ''I knew I had to get serious about my life,'' he said.
His experiences as a father so far suggest just how much there is to be said for simply showing up.
''Thank you for coming, Dad,'' Justin wrote after a school trip. ''I like it when you're with me at every event and watching me do every activity.''
He added 16 exclamation points.
End of the Day
Left to do the showing up alone, Ms. Schairer makes big efforts. She rarely misses a weekend of church with the children, and she sacrificed a day's pay this spring to chaperon field day at Steavon and Savannah's school. ''They were both saying, 'This is my mom, my mom is here!' '' she said.
In February, she received $7,000 of refundable tax credits, the low-wage worker's annual bonus. She prepaid her rent for six months and bought plane tickets to Orlando, Fla. After years of seeing pictures of Ms. Faulkner's vacations, she wanted to give her children one of their own.
''Do you think we'll see Jesus?'' Savannah asked on the flight. ''I hope the plane doesn't run him over.''
They stayed with Ms. Schairer's brother, visited SeaWorld and Gatorland, and brought back happy memories. But the trip soon began to seem long ago, more a break from their life than an embodiment of it.
Ms. Schairer sank into the couch on a recent Friday night, looking weary, and half-watched a rerun of ''Friends.'' Steavon retreated to his room to watch ''Superman'' alone, and Savannah went out to play with the girl who always seems hungry. Kirsten was in her pajamas at 7 o'clock. They had few weekend plans.
Thirty miles away, Troop 395 was pitching tents beside a rural airstrip, where the next day the boys would take glider rides and earn aviation badges. The fields and barns looked as tidy as cartoons, and an extravagant sunset painted them pomegranate.
The clipboard in Justin Faulkner's hands called for an early reveille. ''I'm the patrol leader,'' he said, beaming.
Thirty minutes later, a rope appeared. Boys started to boast. Mr. Faulkner snapped on his tug of war gloves, only to discover that Justin had disappeared. He found him sitting in the grass nearby, fighting back tears. ''I want to go home,'' Justin said.
Mr. Faulkner did not say much. Jeremy used to get homesick, too. Now he is halfway to Eagle Scout. After a while Mr. Faulkner asked, ''Are you sure you don't want to do a tug of war against me?''
Justin watched the other boys tumble. ''When?'' he said.
''We can do it right now,'' Mr. Faulkner said.
It was not much of a contest for a man who outweighs his two sons combined by more than 100 pounds. Justin fell face first and bumped through the cool grass -- a laughing tenderfoot pulled along by his dad.

HEADLINE: Hyundai Sued Over Mileage

BYLINE: By AARON ROBINSON

 BODY:
MARK GORDON of Whitestone, Queens, figures that buying six Hyundais over the years classifies him as a loyal customer. ''I put 220,000 miles on my last one,'' said Mr. Gordon, 58, a manufacturer's representative for bridal gowns. ''They don't break down.''
Yet Mr. Gordon is so disappointed with the fuel economy of the 2012 Elantra he bought this year, and with the company's response to his complaints, that he created a protest Web site, my2012HyundaiElantragetslousygasmileage.com. 
''This will be the last Hyundai I buy,'' he said.
Some other owners have also complained, notably in online forums. A lawsuit filed this month in California Superior Court in Sacramento against Hyundai Motor America claims that multimedia advertising for the 2011-12 Elantra compact sedan trumpeted its 40 miles-per-gallon rating without sufficiently disclosing that this is just one of the car's economy ratings. The Environmental Protection Agency rates the Elantra at 29 m.p.g. city and 40 highway, with a combined average of 33 m.p.g.
''This advertising campaign was designed to deceive the public,'' said Laura Antonini, a lawyer for Consumer Watchdog. the advocacy group that filed the suit. ''It was centered around the 40 m.p.g. claim, but this number relates only to the substantially higher highway number.'' Ms. Antonini said Hyundai was hiding the fact that the car could not achieve 40 m.p.g. under most driving conditions.
In a statement, Hyundai Motor America said the lawsuit had no merit and that the company's advertising was ''accurate and in full compliance with applicable laws and regulations.''
The Hyundai suit and a recent class-action suit against Honda over the advertised mileage of its Civic Hybrid illustrate consumers' confusion over federally mandated fuel economy labels and the advertising claims they spawn.
The Hyundai case may hinge on an interpretation of the Federal Trade Commission rules on fuel economy advertising. The agency requires any advertising of mileage to include numbers generated by E.P.A.-approved testing procedures, but it no longer mandates disclosure of both the city and highway numbers, or the combined rating.
The F.T.C. has changed its rules, according to John German, a fuel economy expert who is a senior fellow with the International Council on Clean Transportation. The F.T.C. once required that both the city and highway numbers be given equal emphasis in advertising, but in recent years it has allowed automakers to promote one or the other -- usually the highway number, because it is typically higher.
''If someone is just driving around town, they don't have a prayer of matching the highway number,'' Mr. German said. Other driving factors, such as short trips and colder temperatures, will also increase fuel consumption, he said.
At fueleconomy.gov, an Energy Department Web site where drivers can log their mileage, owners of the 2012 Elantra with an automatic transmission reported averaging 29 m.p.g. That is 4 m.p.g. below the combined E.P.A. rating of 33 m.p.g., but within the typical deviation of plus-or-minus 7 m.p.g. for all vehicles tracked by owners on the site, said David L. Greene of the Oak Ridge National Laboratory, which administers the site.
While the Honda and Hyundai lawsuits are about advertising, the dispute underscores the disparity between window-label fuel economy tests and real-world driving. For example, in the federal highway test, cars are run no faster than 60 m.p.h. and with an average speed of 48 m.p.h., significantly slower than most people drive on the highway.
Mr. German said that although the tests themselves might not be realistic, a numerical fudge factor was applied to all cars to make the final label numbers more accurate. In 2008, the government rewrote its testing procedures in an attempt to make the window labels more reflective of real-world results.
Yet Mr. Gordon, who drives his Elantra 30,000 miles a year, says he struggles to get more than 20 m.p.g. ''I bought it for the gas mileage,'' he said, ''but it's the same mileage as the car I traded in.''

HEADLINE: Robin Ried, Christopher Staudt

BYLINE: By NINA REYES

 BODY:
Robin Charlotte Ried and Christopher Harold Staudt were married Saturday at the Siasconset Union Chapel in Siasconset, Mass., on the island of Nantucket. The Rev. Nancy Forsyth Nelson, a minister of the American Fellowship Church, performed the ceremony.
Ms. Ried, 29, will keep her name. She is the head of urban development and is a global leadership fellow at the World Economic Forum in New York. She graduated from Brown and received a master's degree in city planning from the University of California, Berkeley. From 2004 to 2005, she was a Fulbright scholar in Barcelona, Spain, focused on environmentally sustainable neighborhood design.
She is a daughter of Susan Ried and Robert H. Ried of Palm City, Fla. The bride's father retired this year as an economist and a founder of Ried, Thunberg & Company, a money-market forecasting firm in Westport, Conn. 
Mr. Staudt, 36, is a director in the private investment division of Emigrant Bank in New York and is responsible for identifying new investment opportunities. He graduated from Pomona College in Claremont, Calif., and received an M.B.A. from Harvard. From 2002 to 2004, he was a Peace Corps volunteer working on microfinance and soil-conservation projects in a rural area outside of Bainet, Haiti.
He is the son of Christina and William Staudt of Bronxville, N.Y. His father also works at Emigrant Bank in New York, where he is a vice chairman, overseeing commercial lending. The bridegroom's mother is the chairwoman of an interdisciplinary forum on death, dying and grief at Columbia University, and is also a patient-care volunteer and a member of the fund-raising board at Jansen Hospice and Palliative Care in Scarsdale, N.Y.
The couple had their first conversation in August 2008, at the wedding of Caroline Staudt, the bridegroom's youngest sister. Ms. Ried had gone to boarding school and college with Caroline Staudt, but somehow -- despite several family photographs showing Ms. Ried and Mr. Staudt in the same frame -- they had never taken notice of each other.
Ms. Ried had arrived at the wedding wearing a yellow dress and a flower in her hair, and Mr. Staudt was entranced.
''It's one of those indescribable moments,'' he said. ''I just felt compelled to talk to her.''
His mother took care of the proper introduction, which Ms. Ried viewed as a continuation of a campaign that had begun the previous winter with a Staudt family Christmas card that prominently featured Mr. Staudt alone amid his happily paired sisters and parents.
''Robin was convinced my mother was sending that only to single friends,'' Mr. Staudt remembered.
Ms. Ried said, ''It was like someone was trying to stuff my mailbox with an advertisement about him.'' She remembers laughing when she saw the picture, thinking that he looked awkward and alone -- ''but very cute! It seemed like his mom was sending out a subtle hint to the world that her son was a catch.''
He asked to visit her the next time his business took him out to California, where she was then living. That opportunity occurred just a few weeks later, and he then extended his trip so that he could see her again a few days later.
In the next few months, he made several more trips to California, but it was not until Ms. Ried moved back to New York that the couple began truly dating.
''It took 11 months for even the first peck on the lips,'' Ms. Ried said. ''Everything felt so right about being together that I fought it, but I finally gave in to the inevitable.'' NINA REYES

SPURRED BY THE INTERNET,
FLOCKING TO PROVIDE AID
Largely thanks to the power of the Internet, a motley stream of young volunteers have arrived, along with trucks full of private donations, to help with the catastrophic flooding in the Russian city of Krymsk. This activism heralds a jarring change in a country that, throughout the Soviet period, approached disaster response as a military matter and was able to insist on secrecy. Page 6
DETAILS EMERGE IN SYRIA
New details emerging about what local Syrian activists called a massacre of civilians near the central city of Hama indicated that it was more likely an uneven clash between the heavily armed Syrian military and local fighters bearing light weapons. Page 8 
CROSSING THE GREEK BORDER
The border between Turkey, which is not in the European Union, and Greece, which is, has become a kind of back door, making member countries resentful as a tide of immigrants from the Middle East, South Asia and Africa grows. Page 12

WITH GAMBLING IN DECLINE,
RENO CHARTS A PATH
The arrival of American Indian casinos and the spread of state-sanctioned gambling across the nation have cut deeply into the revenues of former monopolies on legalized gambling like Reno, which is left grasping at various possibilities that have little to do with the industry that defined it. Page 13
GOVERNORS HOLD THE KEY
How well the new health care law succeeds in covering millions of the poorest Americans will depend largely on undecided governors of both parties, who will have to negotiate with the federal government and successfully navigate through statehouse politics in advance of the 2014 election year.

THE SUMMER CAMP
A summer camp that follows in the spirit of the Occupy Wall Street movement, started by two of the movement's original members, has opened in a former schoolhouse in Brooklyn. Modeled after the civil-rights-era Freedom Schools, the camp is part summer school, part scout jamboree. Page 22

TOUGH CHOICES FOR N.C.A.A.
IN PENN STATE SCANDAL
In N.C.A.A. parlance, ''lack of institutional control'' is the organization's ultimate admonishment, the phrase it utters before handing down its stiffest penalties. In the wake of the findings onthe child sexual abuse scandal at Penn State, there is some question as to whether those words will be used by the N.C.A.A. to impose serious sanctions on the university's football program, perhaps even forcing the team to shut down for a time, the so-called death penalty. Page 1
REINVENTING THE ROTATION
On pace to lose 100 games, the Colorado Rockies decided to embrace the retro idea of going to a four-man starting rotation, but with a modern curveball -- limiting each starter to only about 75 pitches. Thus far, the results have been mixed. Page 2

A CREATIVE RENAISSANCE

In a comic-book industry dominated by Marvel and DC Comics, Image Comics is having a creative renaissance rivaling the one that gave birth to the California-based company 20 years ago. Though Image ended 2011 with only a little more than a 5 percent market share, it has something that is harder to measure: buzz. Page 1

The nature of home equity lines of credit, which require low payments in the early years followed by hefty payments later on, is unlikely to rescue many homeowners who are groaning under the weight of multiple mortgages, even in a strong recovery. Fair Game, Gretchen Morgenson. Page 1
COLD FACTS ABOUT RECOVERY
An economic recovery that had not been very rapid in the first place has lost some momentum. Whether this is just a temporary stumble or something deeper -- the sign, perhaps, of an incipient recession -- is an open question. Page 3
TUG OF WAR OVER MEDICAID
The new health care law calls for expansion of Medicaid, but American voters may well rebel against the program over time. If Republicans control the White House and both houses of Congress, they could turn Medicaid into a block grant program, where states can spend the money as they wish. Page 3

HEADLINE: So Much in Common, in Name Only

BYLINE: By MILLA GOLDENBERG. 
Milla Goldenberg, a writer and editor in Los Angeles, blogs at millatimes.blogspot.com.

 BODY:
''THIS man is going to be the father of my children,'' I announced to my friends before I had even met him in person. ''He has to be. It's not like I'm going to meet another one again in my lifetime.''
What I meant was another man who had my last name: Goldenberg. It's not a common surname. The more common variation is Goldberg, which dropped that central ''en'' into oblivion. Ours was the older, more dignified surname, which translates to ''gold mountain'' in German. Linguistically intact, Goldenberg conjures up sun-kissed hills that resemble health and bounty. This would be our future. I was sure of it.
Of course, we first had to establish that we were not, in fact, relatives. It was easy to assume we could be. He assumed as much, which is why he contacted me after reading my name in a Los Angeles Times news article. 
I had been quoted after the arrest of a former boyfriend's murderer. The high-profile case involved a four-year investigation and the embezzlement of a half-million dollars. I had written about learning of the murder on my blog, which my namesake also found and read, noting that we both lived in Los Angeles. Intrigued, he contacted me and inquired: Could we be related?
Not unless we came over from the former Soviet Union on the same ship, I assured him. My family had immigrated in the 1970s, his much earlier in the century. Having established no direct blood ties between us, we began to chat regularly on Facebook messenger.
Our most obvious common interest seemed to be dogs, so we talked about them incessantly -- my two girls and his one boy, all big dogs. We discussed their breeds, histories, temperaments, diets. We spoke more about them than ourselves, happy to have found some common ground so we had a reason to keep talking.
But after a few weeks, we had exhausted the subject and had moved on to the personal stuff: his divorce and my bad breakups, and the trajectories that had landed both of us in Los Angeles.
A red flag appeared when he revealed he had been jobless for two years, spending his time volunteering at the local animal shelter and living off his savings. I had dated unemployed men before and had sworn I never would again, but the shared surname seemed a valid reason to overthrow any and all objections, including the fact that he was 13 years my senior.
Helping matters was the discovery that he lived only a few blocks from my childhood home, an astonishing coincidence in a city that large. It seemed like another sign of our impending life together, a future I was becoming more certain of with each passing day of our Internet courtship.
I could see the path perfectly: First, cheek-to-cheek photos of us would begin peppering the news feed, our equally happy dogs at our feet, followed by a full photo album from a weekend getaway to someplace relaxed and romantic, probably wine tasting up the California coast; after that trip, a status change would link our profiles on Facebook, first to ''in a relationship,'' then ultimately to ''married,'' our matching names in perfect symmetry.
Sure, there would be a few jokers snickering that we were cousins, but that would die down eventually. People might even think that he took my surname upon our marriage, a thought that thrilled me secretly. And, of course, our wedding announcement write-ups in newspapers would center on the shared-surname angle, which would be hailed as the most romantic origin story of all time, one that sealed our fate at first contact.
Of all my friends, I have been the most vocal about how a woman shouldn't change her last name upon marriage, a practice I find anachronistic. I've sat in judgment of my girlfriends who have married and allowed themselves to be branded by their husbands like chattel on a farm. It reminded me of the boy who put his name all over my Pee-Chee folder in grade school and how much I despised his attempt to dominate me.
Of course, I realize that my last name came from my father, also a man, but it has become so inextricably linked to my identity that any potential change to it threatens my very core. I have been published under my name and bought my house under my name, and it never seemed right to me that a marriage license could dismantle 35 years of being my own person.
Slapping my husband's name on me would effectively make me his person, while his name and identity remained intact. It's an inequality that's still too readily accepted by men and women. Even hyphenating didn't seem like a better alternative unless the husband also agreed to hyphenate his name (though I've only known of three men who've done this). Otherwise, it's still the woman changing her name to suit her new status as a wife.
But I didn't have to worry about this anymore because I had done the undoable: I had found my perfect match whose Mrs. I was born to be. ''It's like he fell out of the sky and into my lap with a big red bow,'' I told my friends, who seemed to eye me nervously. The whole thing felt fated, as though my dead ex-boyfriend had orchestrated it from beyond.
I delighted at the thought that my mythical children would have only one surname instead of an awkward multihyphenate that sounds like the name of a law firm. I imagined us several decades into the future, surrounded by our loving children and grandchildren (all still named Goldenberg, naturally), telling them the story about how we got together. His eyes would overflow with tears and his wrinkly hand would reach for mine as he spoke of finding me online and then meeting me in person and just knowing we were two halves of the same soul -- reunited after a lengthy search.
He didn't even have to put his name on me (or my Pee-Chee folders) because I was already his and he was already mine. Our ending had been written for us at the start. His voice -- which I had never heard, since our correspondence was relegated to Facebook messenger -- would be deep, raspy and full of undying love for me. It had to be.
I had created an entire mythology about him, seeing his volunteer work at the animal shelter as a sign of sensitivity and a willingness to put others before himself; his former marriage, which I knew nothing about, became another symbol of his compassion and willingness to commit.
One thing I did know with certainty was that, like me, he preferred midcentury modern furniture, which would make our hypothetical household much easier to decorate.
And, of course, we had our three big dogs, who would love one another effortlessly without ever once vying for dominance. He was my perfect match, not only in name, but also in sensibility.
SO imagine my surprise when I showed up to our first date -- nervous and sweaty, my body tense and brain jumpy, bracing myself for the first meeting with my future husband -- and found a man unfamiliar to me in every way.
His voice sounded higher than I had imagined, and we liked different movies, different directors, different everything, it seemed. He also revealed that his dog hated going on hikes, an essential pleasure my own dogs and I enjoy each weekend. On the bright side, my namesake was fairly tall.
We went on exactly one date, a meal and drinks that lasted approximately three hours. The experience was pleasant enough. We lingered at the table for a long time, trying to build a chemistry neither of us felt. I could have tried again on a second date, but he sent me an e-mail a few days later saying he didn't feel a spark but would like to remain friends. I have not seen him since.
It crushed me like any breakup would. In the days that followed that e-mail, I moped around my house with the pang of loss in my stomach, aching to regain something I never actually had. It was not the man I missed (as I loved only his name) but the chance to share that name via a family, future and legacy that would exist long after we did.
And suddenly I understood why most of my girlfriends changed their names upon marriage: because they craved the same legacy, one that would extend itself under a unified family crest.
I craved it, too, and tried to seize an opportunity that made attaining this legacy easy for me by dressing it up as fate instead of accepting it as the coincidence it actually was, a funny anecdote I would one day tell my grandchildren, whatever their names.
I wonder if he sensed my eagerness and it repelled him. I wonder if, even in person, I ever saw who he really was.

HEADLINE: The $580 Million Black Hole

BYLINE: By LOREN FELDMAN

 BODY:
THE business deal from hell began to crumble even before the Champagne corks were popped.
The deal, the $580 million sale of a highflying technology company, Dragon Systems, had just been approved by its board and congratulations were being exchanged. But even then, at that moment of celebration, there was a sense that something was amiss.
The chief executive of Dragon had received a congratulatory bottle from the investment bankers representing the acquiring company, a Belgian competitor called Lernout & Hauspie. But he hadn't heard from Dragon's own bankers at Goldman Sachs.
''I still have not received anything from Goldman,'' the executive wrote in an e-mail to the other bank. ''Do they know something I should know?'' 
More than a decade later, that question is still reverberating in a brutal legal battle between Goldman and the founders of Dragon Systems -- along with a host of other questions that go to the heart of how financial giants like Goldman operate and what exactly they owe their clients.
James and Janet Baker spent nearly two decades building Dragon, a voice technology company, into a successful, multimillion-dollar enterprise. It was, they say, their ''third child.'' So in late 1999, when offers to buy Dragon began rolling in, the couple made what seemed a smart decision: they turned to Goldman Sachs for advice. And why not? Goldman, after all, was the leading dealmaker on Wall Street. The Bakers wanted the best.
This, of course, was before the scandals of the subprime mortgage era. It was before the bailouts, before Occupy Wall Street, before ordinary Americans began complaining about ''banksters'' and ''muppets'' and ''the vampire squid.'' In short, before Goldman Sachs became, for many, synonymous with Wall Street greed.
And yet, even today what happened next to the Bakers seems remarkable. With Goldman Sachs on the job, the corporate takeover of Dragon Systems in an all-stock deal went terribly wrong. Goldman collected millions of dollars in fees -- and the Bakers lost everything when Lernout & Hauspie was revealed to be a spectacular fraud. L.& H. had been founded by Jo Lernout and Pol Hauspie, who had once been hailed as stars of the 1990s tech boom. Only later did the Bakers learn that Goldman Sachs itself had at one point considered investing in L.& H. but had walked away after some digging into the company.
This being Wall Street, a lot of money is now at stake. In federal court in Boston, the Bakers are demanding damages, including interest and legal fees, that could top $1 billion. That figure is nearly twice what Goldman paid to settle claims that it misled investors about subprime mortgage investments before the financial crisis of 2008.
This account is based on a trove of legal filings -- e-mails, motions and roughly 30 depositions, more than 8,000 pages of sworn testimony in all -- that open a rare window on Goldman Sachs and the mystique that surrounds it.
JAMES AND JANET BAKER, now in their 60s, are computer speech revolutionaries. Both Ph.D.'s, they became interested in voice-recognition technology in the 1970s, back when a personal assistant like Apple's Siri would have seemed more science fiction than scientific fact.
They are widely credited with advancing speech technology far faster than anyone thought possible, primarily because of an epiphany Mr. Baker had while doing his doctorate research. He figured out that speech recognition could, in essence, be reduced to math. You didn't have to teach a computer to recognize accents or dialects, Mr. Baker realized -- you just had to calculate the mathematical probability of one sound following another. His algorithms proved remarkably accurate and eventually became the industry standard. (Want to know more? Ask Siri.)
The Bakers founded Dragon Systems in 1982 in an old Victorian house in West Newton, Mass. At that time, despite having two school-age children and a big mortgage, they were determined to take no venture capital and to finance the company's growth with its own revenue -- once they had a product. They figured they could last 18 months, maybe 24.
Their first product was a software program for a British-made PC called the Apricot that let users open files and run programs by voice command. Then came DragonDictate, a groundbreaking speech-to-text system for dictation that still required the speaker to pause. Between. Every. Word.
For years, the Bakers pressed on, convinced that they were on track to create a program that would recognize continuous speech.
To do that, however, they eventually decided that they needed more capital. While Mr. Baker worked on the technology, Ms. Baker brokered a deal with Seagate Technology, the disk drive manufacturer. Seagate bought 25 percent of Dragon for $20 million. Then, in 1997, Dragon introduced Dragon NaturallySpeaking, a program that recognized more words than could be found in a standard collegiate dictionary. It was available in six languages and could handle normal speech, even sentences with words that sound alike, such as, ''Please write a letter right now to Mrs. Wright. Tell her that two is too many to buy.''
By this time, I.B.M. and others had piled into the voice technology market, too. As the Nasdaq market raced toward record highs, the Bakers considered taking Dragon public. But in 1999, several companies -- including Sony and Intel -- expressed interest in buying into Dragon. Finally, unsolicited buyout offers began to arrive. One came from Visteon, a subsidiary of Ford Motor. Another arrived from Lernout & Hauspie.
TO the uninitiated, the mystique of Goldman Sachs may be hard to fathom. Known for what might politely be called ruthless professionalism, Goldman, the thinking goes, is smarter and more plugged in than just about any other investment bank. In the late 1990s, under Henry M. Paulson Jr., who later became the Treasury secretary and orchestrated the Wall Street bailouts, Goldman was the alpha dog in the lucrative game of mergers and acquisitions.
So it was that in December 1999, the Bakers, in over their heads when it came to M.& A., signed a five-page engagement letter drafted by Goldman. In it, Goldman pledged to provide ''financial advice and assistance in connection with this potential transaction, which may include performing valuation analyses, searching for a purchaser acceptable to you, coordinating visits of potential purchasers, and assisting you in negotiating the financial aspects of the transaction.''
To the Dragon deal, Goldman assigned four bankers, two in their 20s and one in his early 30s. That wasn't unusual. Although Dragon Systems was worth everything to the Bakers, the company -- with $70 million in revenue and 400 employees -- was small beer on Wall Street. Dragon agreed to pay Goldman a flat fee of $5 million, less than some Goldman bankers were pulling down.
But who, if anyone, supervised these bankers -- later called ''the Goldman Four'' in court documents -- remains something of a mystery. One of the four, the most senior, testified later that their supervisor was Gene T. Sykes, a Goldman partner who at the time specialized in technology and who this year was promoted to head of M.& A. at the firm, one of the most powerful jobs on Wall Street. In a deposition, Mr. Sykes disavowed any involvement.
Most of the Goldman Four didn't stay long at the bank. Richard Wayner, who was 32 when the Dragon deal was cut, struck out on his own in 2002 and eventually landed at the Keffi Group, an investment firm. T. Otey Smith, then 21, left Goldman in 2000 and now works for RLJ Equity Partners. Alexander Berzofsky, then 25, left Goldman at about the same time and is now a managing director at Warburg Pincus, the big private investment company. Chris Fine, then 42, was a Goldman information technology specialist who was enlisted on the deal and is still with Goldman. (None of the four agreed to be interviewed for this article.)
Before the engagement letter was signed in late 1999, Goldman sent Dragon a memo indicating that its first steps would include beginning to conduct due diligence -- Wall Street-speak for kicking the tires -- on L.& H. The memo included specific areas of concern, including L.& H.'s sources of revenue, its major customers, its license agreements and royalty agreements, its expected growth, its partnerships and its financial statements.
THAT December, Mr. Wayner of Goldman accompanied Ms. Baker and Dragon's chief financial officer, Ellen Chamberlain, on a trip to Belgium to meet L.& H. executives. For the trip, another of the Goldman Four, Mr. Berzofsky, prepared a list of due diligence questions. Goldman also prepared a ''merger analysis'' that predicted the companies' combined sales per share, earnings per share and total debt under three acquisition scenarios: all cash, all stock and half and half.
In its initial offer, L.& H. proposed paying $580 million, half in cash and half in stock. But the Bakers weren't sure. News reports had questioned L.& H.'s revenue, particularly in fast-growing Asian markets, as well as some of the company's licensing deals. Mr. Baker felt that L.& H. had inferior voice technology. But then, he reasoned, if L.& H. could generate so much revenue with lesser technology, imagine what it could do with Dragon.
By mid-February 2000, Ms. Chamberlain had sent an angry memo to Goldman. It urged the bank to move faster in its analysis of L.& H. Talks with the other companies had gone nowhere, and she expected Goldman to ''drive'' the due diligence process. Mr. Wayner testified later that the bank's reaction to that memo was ''to do as our client asked and to revisit all of our analyses.''
But on Feb. 29, Dragon received an odd memo from Goldman. It wasn't addressed to anyone in particular at Dragon, and it wasn't signed by anyone at Goldman. The Goldman Four testified later that they had no idea who had sent it. But the memo referred to many of the same due diligence issues that Ms. Chamberlain raised. The memo asserted, however, that Dragon's accounting firm, Arthur Andersen, should do the work, not Goldman.
The memo shocked Ms. Chamberlain. She had come to Dragon from Seagate, where she had participated in similar deals. She believed that this sort of thing was generally done by investment bankers, not by accountants. But the moment passed. No one at Dragon or Goldman brought up the mystery memo again -- at least not until the lawsuits began flying. (The Bakers also filed suit against other participants in the transaction.)
THE Dragon executives thought that Goldman was taking a hard look at L.& H. After all, Dragon was paying Goldman $5 million for its advice. If Goldman wasn't conducting due diligence, what was it doing?
''They put items on and off the due diligence list,'' Ms. Baker later testified. ''We discussed the issues at -- at basically every meeting that we were at, and we were meeting often in person or by phone, typically, several times a week in this time frame -- sometimes multiple times a day, as we've seen. And so they knew what everybody was doing. And they were, they were directing it.''
One of the tasks was a conference call that Mr. Wayner arranged, at Ms. Baker's request, between Dragon and Charles Elliott, a Goldman analyst in London. Dragon was wondering why L.& H.'s share price had been gyrating wildly. Mr. Wayner told Ms. Baker, he later testified, that Mr. Elliott was following L.& H.'s stock and was up to date on its fluctuations. And Mr. Elliott assured Ms. Baker that investors were worried about the market in general, rather than L.& H. in particular. He also said he expected the stock price of the combined companies to rise substantially once a merger was struck.
Years later, in his deposition, Mr. Elliott told a more complete story. He acknowledged that he actually had not been following L.& H.; that had been the responsibility of another Goldman analyst who had left the firm shortly after the Bakers retained Goldman. After the other analyst left, Mr. Elliott testified, Goldman terminated its coverage of L.& H. No one told the Bakers that Goldman was no longer covering the company they were about to bet their futures on.
Mr. Elliott also testified that he was unaware of press reports at the time that suggested L.& H. was claiming huge revenue gains in Asia. If he had been aware, he said, he would have been ''very skeptical'' of those gains, given the challenges that Asian languages present for speech recognition. He also acknowledged that it would not have been difficult for him to call up L.& H.'s customers and check the revenue claims.
As the Nasdaq composite index raced toward a record high that March, Dragon's executives made fateful decisions. On March 8, the Bakers met with L.& H. executives and that company's advisers from SG Cowen to try to reach a definitive agreement.
A few days before that meeting, Mr. Wayner of Goldman told Ms. Baker that he would be away on vacation and couldn't make the session. He also said that he would be unable to call in and that it was pointless to send anybody else from Goldman because there wasn't time to catch up on the deal. It was at this meeting that L.& H. proposed shifting the $580 million deal from half stock and half cash to all stock. The Bakers, with their high-priced investment bankers M.I.A., agreed.
Later, after L.& H. collapsed, Mr. Wayner testified that the bank ''did not form a point of view'' as to whether an all-stock deal would be risky or advisable for the Bakers. He said he could not remember if it had crossed his mind to warn the Bakers about potential issues with an all-stock deal.
Two weeks after the initial agreement was reached, Mr. Wayner told Ms. Baker that he would be leaving the next day for another vacation. He would not participate in a conference call with L.& H.'s accounting firm, KPMG, that was set up to discuss any open questions about accounting and due diligence. Mr. Berzofsky of Goldman did participate but later acknowledged that he did not raise any concerns. The Bakers say they believed that all issues had been addressed.
Mr. Wayner was still on vacation on March 27, when Dragon's board met to take a final vote on the proposed acquisition. This time, Mr. Fine and Mr. Smith of Goldman attended the meeting, and Mr. Wayner called in from Argentina. No one from Goldman gave a presentation, but minutes from the meeting, taken by Dragon's outside lawyers, indicate that the Goldman bankers expressed confidence that the combination of Dragon and L.& H. would produce a market leader. The board voted unanimously to accept the $580 million all-stock deal.
Years later, Mr. Wayner testified that lingering issues of due diligence had never been resolved to his satisfaction. He was asked if he had said as much that March day on the phone from his vacation.
''No, I don't recall saying that,'' he responded.
The deal closed on June 7. By Aug. 8, the merged companies were in crisis amid reports that L.& H. had cooked its books. Reporters for The Wall Street Journal did something the Goldman Four did not: they picked up the phone and called L.& H.'s supposed customers in Asia. They found that companies in South Korea and elsewhere that L.& H. had claimed were its customers weren't doing any business with it at all. L.& H. had pulled sales figures out of thin air.
Although the Goldman Four never tried to call those customers, it emerged during litigation that other bankers at Goldman had done precisely that -- about two years earlier, when Goldman itself considered investing in L.& H. in a plan known internally as Project Sermon. In it, Goldman's merchant banking division took a closer look at L.& H. -- but, apparently, never shared what it knew, and was never asked. Goldman was considering putting $30 million into L.& H., a step that, at the time, might have seemed conceivable, given the hype surrounding L.& H.
''Whenever we invest, we always want to talk to customers,'' Luca Velussi, a Goldman analyst who worked on Project Sermon, later testified. Based on what Project Sermon's team leader, Ramez Sousou, termed ''preliminary'' due diligence, Goldman declined to invest in L.& H.
By Nov. 29, L.& H. had plunged into bankruptcy. Indictments and convictions followed. L.& H.'s stock price sank to zero -- and the Bakers lost everything.
Dragon Systems, the Bakers' ''third child,'' was put up for sale at a bankruptcy auction. Visteon acquired some of Dragon's technology. ScanSoft bought the bulk of it and went on to become a $7 billion giant, with a licensing deal with Apple. (The Bakers believe that some of their technology made its way into Siri.) ScanSoft later acquired -- and assumed the name of -- Nuance, another voice technology company.
Indeed, Nuance had gone public about the same time L.& H. bought Dragon, and Goldman handled the initial offering -- a fact that still angers the Bakers. They say they had no idea Goldman was simultaneously representing their company and a rival.
It wasn't until after the bankruptcy auction, the Bakers now say, that the full force of what had happened hit them. The money was one thing. But what they really wanted was the opportunity to complete the work they had started decades earlier. As part of the deal with L.& H., they had expected to continue their research. Once L.& H. collapsed, they had held out hope that they might get their technology back -- either through litigation or through the bankruptcy auction. They now knew that it wasn't going to happen.
''The door is closed,'' Mr. Baker remembers thinking. ''Not only do we not have the technology any more, but we have no chance of getting it back.''
THE Bakers' case against Goldman is simple. Their lawyer, Alan K. Cotler of Philadelphia, captured it in a single sentence in a motion for summary judgment: ''The Goldman Four were unsupervised, inexperienced, incompetent and lazy investment bankers who were put on a transaction that in the scheme of things was small potatoes for Goldman.''
Summarizing Goldman's defense is more complicated. Based on the firm's response to the complaint, its motion for summary judgment and testimony of the people it employed, most of that defense falls under one of three rubrics: The Bakers do not have standing to sue. Goldman had no obligation to do a financial analysis of L.& H. And Goldman's bankers actually performed quite well. The firm released a statement that asserted, ''Goldman Sachs was retained as a financial adviser by Dragon Systems, not its shareholders, and performed its assignment satisfactorily in all respects.''
Goldman's lawyer, John D. Donovan of Ropes & Gray in Boston, has argued that under the terms of the engagement letter, only Dragon Systems had the right to sue, and Dragon no longer exists. Goldman has even filed a countersuit against Ms. Baker, contending that by suing Goldman she had breached the contract. Even though Ms. Baker lost everything in a deal Goldman orchestrated, the firm says Ms. Baker should now pay its legal fees.
To support the argument that Goldman was not obligated to perform due diligence, the firm points to that mystery memo of Feb. 29, 2000 -- the memo that no one at Goldman has acknowledged sending -- as establishing that Dragon Systems needed to push its accounting firm to explain any red flags or resolve outstanding worries.
Goldman's lawyers have argued in a motion that while Goldman ''strongly urged'' Dragon to engage an international accounting firm to do a ''forensic accounting analysis on L.& H.,'' Ms. Baker ''prevented'' Dragon from following Goldman's advice because she did not want to incur the expense of the due diligence and did not want to delay the transaction. The Bakers call this argument ''complete fiction,'' and even the Goldman Four seem dubious. They testified that Ms. Baker did nothing to block the performance of due diligence.
Goldman also hired an independent investment banker, Ian Fisher, who filed an expert report arguing that Goldman was not obligated to conduct due diligence because Dragon did not order what is known as a fairness opinion, an analysis of the acquisition price.
The Bakers have hired their own expert, Donna Hitscherich, a former investment banker with JPMorgan Chase who lectures at Columbia Business School. She wrote in her expert report that Goldman was obligated to perform due diligence with or without a fairness opinion.
If the case goes to trial in Boston, as scheduled, on Nov. 6, the final argument that Goldman can be expected to make is that the bankers, as Mr. Wayner testified, gave the Bakers ''great advice.''
Mr. Berzofsky, too, testified in his deposition that the Goldman Four did a ''great job.''
Even though Dragon lost everything?
''Yes,'' Mr. Berzofsky said. He was given several opportunities to clarify. And then he was asked one more time -- the fact that the Bakers and Dragon's shareholders lost everything doesn't affect your opinion?
''Correct,'' Mr. Berzofsky responded. ''We guided them to a completed transaction.''

HEADLINE: U.S. Is Building Criminal Cases In Rate-Fixing

BYLINE: By BEN PROTESS and MARK SCOTT

 BODY:
As regulators ramp up their global investigation into the manipulation of interest rates, the Justice Department has identified potential criminal wrongdoing by big banks and individuals at the center of the scandal.
The department's criminal division is building cases against several financial institutions and their employees, including traders at Barclays, the British bank, according to government officials close to the case who spoke on the condition of anonymity because the investigation is continuing. The authorities expect to file charges against at least one bank later this year, one of the officials said.
The prospect of criminal cases is expected to rattle the banking world and provide a new impetus for financial institutions to settle with the authorities. The Justice Department investigation comes on top of private investor lawsuits and a sweeping regulatory inquiry led by the Commodity Futures Trading Commission. Collectively, the civil and criminal actions could cost the banking industry tens of billions of dollars.
Authorities around the globe are examining whether financial firms manipulated interest rates before and after the financial crisis to improve their profits and deflect scrutiny about their health. Investigators in Washington and London sent a warning shot to the industry last month, striking a $450 million settlement with Barclays in a rate-rigging case. The deal does not shield Barclays employees from criminal prosecution. 
The multiyear investigation has ensnared more than 10 big banks in the United States and abroad. With the prospects of criminal action, several firms, including at least two European institutions, are scrambling to arrange deals, according to lawyers close to the case. In part, they are trying to avoid the public outcry that stemmed from the Barclays case, which prompted the resignation of top executives.
The criminal and civil investigations have focused on how banks set the London interbank offered rate, known as Libor. The benchmark, a measure of how much banks charge one another for loans, is used to determine the borrowing costs for trillions of dollars of financial products, including mortgages, credit cards and student loans. Cities, states and municipal agencies also are examining whether they suffered losses from the rate manipulation, and some have filed suits.
With civil actions, regulators can impose fines and force banks to overhaul their internal controls. But the Justice Department would wield an even more potent threat by bringing criminal fraud cases against traders and other employees. If found guilty, they could face jail time.
The criminal investigations come at a time when the public is still simmering over the dearth of prosecutions of prominent executives involved in the mortgage crisis. The continued trouble in the financial sector, including the multibillion-dollar trading losses at JPMorgan Chase, have only further fueled the anger of consumers and investors.
But the Libor case presents a potential opportunity for prosecutors. Given the scope of the problems and the number of institutions involved, the rate-rigging investigation could provide a signature moment to hold big banks accountable for their activities during the financial crisis.
''It's hard to imagine a bigger case than Libor,'' said one of the government officials involved in the case.
The Justice Department has jurisdiction over the London bank rate because the benchmark affects markets in the United States. It could not be learned which institutions the criminal division is chasing next.
According to people briefed on the matter, the Swiss bank UBS is among the next targets for regulatory action. The Commodity Futures Trading Commission is pursuing a potential civil case against the bank. Regulators at the agency have not yet decided to file an action against the bank, nor have settlement talks begun. UBS has already reached an immunity deal with one division of the Justice Department, which could protect the bank from criminal prosecution if certain conditions are met. The bank declined to comment.
The investigation into the global banks is unusually complex and it could continue for years, and ultimately end in settlements rather than indictments, said the officials close to the case. For now, regulators are building investigations piecemeal because the facts of the cases vary widely. That could make it difficult to compile a global settlement, although some banks would prefer an industrywide deal to avoid the harsh glare of the spotlight, said a lawyer involved in the case.
American authorities face another complication as they build cases. Investigators still lack access to certain documents from big banks.
Before gathering some e-mail and bank records from overseas firms, the Justice Department and American regulators need approval from British authorities, according to the people close to the case. But officials in London have been slow to act, the people said. At times, British authorities have hesitated to investigate.
By contrast, the Justice Department and the Commodity Futures Trading Commission have spent two years building cases together. Lanny Breuer, head of the Justice department's criminal division, has close ties with David Meister, the former federal prosecutor who runs the commission's enforcement team.
In the Barclays case, the British bank was accused of reporting false rates to squeeze out extra trading profits and fend off concerns about its health. During the crisis, banks feared that reporting high rates would suggest a weak financial position.
Lawmakers in London and Washington are examining whether regulators looked the other way as banks artificially depressed the rates. On Friday, it was disclosed that a Barclays employee notified the Federal Reserve Bank of New York in April 2008 that the firm was underestimating its borrowing costs. Despite the warning signs, the illegal actions continued for another year.
But in April 2008, a senior enforcement official at the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, Vincent McGonagle, opened an investigation. He directed the case along with another longtime official, Gretchen Lowe.
At first the case stalled as the agency waited months to receive millions of pages of documents when Barclays pushed back against the American regulators, according to the officials close to the case. By the fall of 2009, the trading commission received a trove of information, providing a broad view into the wrongdoing.
A series of incriminating e-mail and instant messages, regulators say, laid bare the multiyear scheme. In one document, a Barclays employee said the bank was ''being dishonest by definition.''
The case gained further traction in early 2010, when the agency's enforcement team engaged the Justice Department. The department's criminal division, led by Mr. Breuer, agreed that regulators had a strong case. The investigation continued until January 2012, when the trading commission notified Barclays lawyers that they were entering the final stages before deciding about an enforcement action.
As part of the deal, regulators pushed the bank to adopt new controls to prevent a repeat of the problems. Among other measures, the bank must now ''implement firewalls'' to prevent traders from improperly talking with employees who report rates.
The bank says that it provided extensive cooperation during the three inquiries, and has spent around $155 million on its own three-year investigation. Because it agreed to settle with British authorities, Barclays received a 30 percent fine reduction.
In the United States, Barclays offered to pay a fine of $200 million to the C.F.T.C., slightly below the initially proposed range, according to government officials close to the case. Mr. Meister's team soon accepted the offer, securing the biggest fine in the commission's history.
On June 27, British and American authorities announced the deal with Barclays, which agreed to pay more than $450 million total. ''For this illegal conduct, Barclays is paying a significant price,'' Mr. Breuer said then.
Susanne Craig contributed reporting.

HEADLINE: California County Considers a Rescue Plan for Struggling Homeowners

BYLINE: By JENNIFER MEDINA

 BODY:
FONTANA, Calif. -- Browning lawns surround the otherwise neat houses in these once-sparkling developments where foreclosures have become more common than neighborhood cookouts. Each patch of dead grass is a reminder of the inescapable truth: many homes here, as they are elsewhere around the country, are worth half what they were just five years ago.
Desperate for a way out of a housing collapse that has crippled the region, officials in San Bernardino County, where Fontana is one of the largest cities, are exploring a drastic option -- using eminent domain to buy up mortgages for homes that are underwater.
Then, the idea goes, the county could cut the mortgages to the current value of the homes and resell the mortgages to a private investment firm, which would allow homeowners to lower their monthly payments and hang onto their property. 
Although the county has a long way to go before it could put the policy in place, the mere idea has already rankled the banking community, whose leaders say it would set a dangerous precedent of allowing a government entity to act as a lender and would discourage banks from granting loans in the area.
A decade ago, Fontana and other cities here in the Inland Empire -- the vast suburban sprawl east of Los Angeles -- were just beginning to boom, with new subdivisions opening seemingly every weekend.
Now, San Bernardino County, the largest county in the country, has cities with some of the nation's highest foreclosure rates.
''Sooner or later,'' said Mayor Acquanetta Warren of Fontana, who has seen the value of her own home cut in half, ''all these people who are upside down on their homes are just going to leave the keys out on the door and say forget it. This was supposed to be the promised land, and now we have people waiting in some kind of hellish purgatory. The people who were so eager to give us money before now won't even talk to us.''
The idea to use eminent domain to seize mortgages first came from a group of venture capitalists in San Francisco, Mortgage Resolution Partners, who would collect a fee for each of the restructured loans. The firm is also trying to persuade officials in Nevada and Florida to try the idea. San Bernardino County officials were immediately intrigued, given that roughly half the homes in the area are underwater and the unemployment rate remains at nearly 12 percent. (Last week, the City of San Bernardino voted to file for bankruptcy, saying it would not be able to cover payroll costs through the summer.)
Officials in Suffolk County, N.Y., where about 10 percent of the homes are valued at less than their loans, are also considering the mortgage plan.
''Nobody else is addressing this adequately, and we're still stuck,'' said Regina Calcaterra, the chief deputy county executive in Suffolk County. ''If Washington or the private sector was able to address this, there wouldn't be a need and we wouldn't even have this conversation.''
Scott Larson, 42, moved to his current home in Upland, in the western part of San Bernardino County, in 2003. A couple years later, when his three-bedroom home was appraised at more than $500,000, he refinanced to renovate his backyard. Now, he says, banks will not even consider modifying his loan.
''I always look for other places to cut so I can do right and make the loan payment, but the odds are really against me doing that for a long time,'' he said. ''I'm willing to start over and take another 30-year loan to stay here, but I don't know who is looking out to let me do that.''
San Bernardino County once relied on residents like Mr. Larson buying small starter homes and moving into larger properties, a dream that now seems quaint. But many community leaders here say the overall economy will not improve without housing construction starting again.
''We have what we regard as a systemic problem, but it's felt most urgently at the local level,'' said Steven M. Gluckstern, the chairman of Mortgage Resolution Partners. ''We have all these people who want to be able to stay in their homes and keep that, but it is getting to be impossible. Until you fix this problem, you can't fix any other problems.''
As for the group's eminent domain idea, ''if it works, every mayor of every city is going to want to do this,'' Mr. Gluckstern said.
More than 20,000 homeowners in the county could ultimately be eligible for the program, which would first focus on Fontana and Ontario, two of the largest cities in the county. The county is just beginning to consider how it could move forward with the proposal and officials say they will consider alternatives, but many banking and mortgage groups have already voiced skepticism or hostility about the plan.
Ken Bentsen, the executive vice president of the Securities Industry and Financial Markets Association, said the idea would almost certainly be challenged in court and would have a major impact on the local market.
''If the government has the ability to abrogate the contract at will and at the expense of the bond holder, the investor is going to do one of two things: require a tremendous premium for the risk they are incurring, or just not invest at all,'' Mr. Bentsen said. ''It would be a risk factor that would be impossible to underwrite.''
Under the current proposal, only homeowners who are current on their payments would be eligible for the program, a policy some have criticized because it does little to help the neediest people.
While Greg Devereaux, San Bernardino's chief executive, has hardly been surprised that so many banking and mortgage lenders are against the plan, their level of opposition has angered him.
''There is no doubt that we have a major problem that we have to do something about, or it will probably be a decade, if not two, for our economy to recover,'' he said. ''It's as if this can't even be a discussion. If they want to come and talk and propose other solutions, great, but that's not what is happening. Instead they are just trying to kill it because they have nothing but their own interest in mind.''
Steve Manos, the president of Inland Valleys Association of Realtors, said the housing market was already showing signs of improvement, with fewer homes on the market and bidding wars breaking out among some buyers.
''We are seeing a recovery, but it's a fragile recovery,'' Mr. Manos said. ''This is the perfect example of something that could derail it quickly.''
Mr. Devereaux said he hoped to have a decision by December about whether the county will use eminent domain or some other strategy for helping homeowners. For now, he laughs and dismisses the notion that improvement is under way in the area.
''We're seven years into things supposedly getting better and we have thousands more foreclosures?'' he asked, answering with a quick bit of sarcasm. ''My gosh, what an improvement.''

HEADLINE: Man-Made Epidemics

BYLINE: By JIM ROBBINS. 
A frequent contributor to the Science section of The New York Times.

 BODY:
THERE'S a term biologists and economists use these days -- ecosystem services -- which refers to the many ways nature supports the human endeavor. Forests filter the water we drink, for example, and birds and bees pollinate crops, both of which have substantial economic as well as biological value.
If we fail to understand and take care of the natural world, it can cause a breakdown of these systems and come back to haunt us in ways we know little about. A critical example is a developing model of infectious disease that shows that most epidemics -- AIDS, Ebola, West Nile, SARS, Lyme disease and hundreds more that have occurred over the last several decades -- don't just happen. They are a result of things people do to nature.
Disease, it turns out, is largely an environmental issue. Sixty percent of emerging infectious diseases that affect humans are zoonotic -- they originate in animals. And more than two-thirds of those originate in wildlife. 
Teams of veterinarians and conservation biologists are in the midst of a global effort with medical doctors and epidemiologists to understand the ''ecology of disease.'' It is part of a project called Predict, which is financed by the United States Agency for International Development. Experts are trying to figure out, based on how people alter the landscape -- with a new farm or road, for example -- where the next diseases are likely to spill over into humans and how to spot them when they do emerge, before they can spread. They are gathering blood, saliva and other samples from high-risk wildlife species to create a library of viruses so that if one does infect humans, it can be more quickly identified. And they are studying ways of managing forests, wildlife and livestock to prevent diseases from leaving the woods and becoming the next pandemic.
It isn't only a public health issue, but an economic one. The World Bank has estimated that a severe influenza pandemic, for example, could cost the world economy $3 trillion.
The problem is exacerbated by how livestock are kept in poor countries, which can magnify diseases borne by wild animals. A study released earlier this month by the International Livestock Research Institute found that more than two million people a year are killed by diseases that spread to humans from wild and domestic animals.
The Nipah virus in South Asia, and the closely related Hendra virus in Australia, both in the genus of henipah viruses, are the most urgent examples of how disrupting an ecosystem can cause disease. The viruses originated with flying foxes, Pteropus vampyrus, also known as fruit bats. They are messy eaters, no small matter in this scenario. They often hang upside down, looking like Dracula wrapped tightly in their membranous wings, and eat fruit by masticating the pulp and then spitting out the juices and seeds.
The bats have evolved with henipah over millions of years, and because of this co-evolution, they experience little more from it than the fruit bat equivalent of a cold. But once the virus breaks out of the bats and into species that haven't evolved with it, a horror show can occur, as one did in 1999 in rural Malaysia. It is likely that a bat dropped a piece of chewed fruit into a piggery in a forest. The pigs became infected with the virus, and amplified it, and it jumped to humans. It was startling in its lethality. Out of 276 people infected in Malaysia, 106 died, and many others suffered permanent and crippling neurological disorders. There is no cure or vaccine. Since then there have been 12 smaller outbreaks in South Asia.
In Australia, where four people and dozens of horses have died of Hendra, the scenario was different: suburbanization lured infected bats that were once forest-dwellers into backyards and pastures. If a henipah virus evolves to be transmitted readily through casual contact, the concern is that it could leave the jungle and spread throughout Asia or the world. ''Nipah is spilling over, and we are observing these small clusters of cases -- and it's a matter of time that the right strain will come along and efficiently spread among people,'' says Jonathan Epstein, a veterinarian with EcoHealth Alliance, a New York-based organization that studies the ecological causes of disease.
That's why experts say it's critical to understand underlying causes. ''Any emerging disease in the last 30 or 40 years has come about as a result of encroachment into wild lands and changes in demography,'' says Peter Daszak, a disease ecologist and the president of EcoHealth.
Emerging infectious diseases are either new types of pathogens or old ones that have mutated to become novel, as the flu does every year. AIDS, for example, crossed into humans from chimpanzees in the 1920s when bush-meat hunters in Africa killed and butchered them.
Diseases have always come out of the woods and wildlife and found their way into human populations -- the plague and malaria are two examples. But emerging diseases have quadrupled in the last half-century, experts say, largely because of increasing human encroachment into habitat, especially in disease ''hot spots'' around the globe, mostly in tropical regions. And with modern air travel and a robust market in wildlife trafficking, the potential for a serious outbreak in large population centers is enormous.
The key to forecasting and preventing the next pandemic, experts say, is understanding what they call the ''protective effects'' of nature intact. In the Amazon, for example, one study showed an increase in deforestation by some 4 percent increased the incidence of malaria by nearly 50 percent, because mosquitoes, which transmit the disease, thrive in the right mix of sunlight and water in recently deforested areas. Developing the forest in the wrong way can be like opening Pandora's box. These are the kinds of connections the new teams are unraveling.
Public health experts have begun to factor ecology into their models. Australia, for example, has just announced a multimillion-dollar effort to understand the ecology of the Hendra virus and bats.
IT'S not just the invasion of intact tropical landscapes that can cause disease. The West Nile virus came to the United States from Africa but spread here because one of its favored hosts is the American robin, which thrives in a world of lawns and agricultural fields. And mosquitoes, which spread the disease, find robins especially appealing. ''The virus has had an important impact on human health in the United States because it took advantage of species that do well around people,'' says Marm Kilpatrick, a biologist at the University of California, Santa Cruz. The pivotal role of the robin in West Nile has earned it the title ''super spreader.''
And Lyme disease, the East Coast scourge, is very much a product of human changes to the environment: the reduction and fragmentation of large contiguous forests. Development chased off predators -- wolves, foxes, owls and hawks. That has resulted in a fivefold increase in white-footed mice, which are great ''reservoirs'' for the Lyme bacteria, probably because they have poor immune systems. And they are terrible groomers. When possums or gray squirrels groom, they remove 90 percent of the larval ticks that spread the disease, while mice kill just half. ''So mice are producing huge numbers of infected nymphs,'' says the Lyme disease researcher Richard Ostfeld.
''When we do things in an ecosystem that erode biodiversity -- we chop forests into bits or replace habitat with agricultural fields -- we tend to get rid of species that serve a protective role,'' Dr. Ostfeld told me. ''There are a few species that are reservoirs and a lot of species that are not. The ones we encourage are the ones that play reservoir roles.''
Dr. Ostfeld has seen two emerging diseases -- babesiosis and anaplasmosis -- that affect humans in the ticks he studies, and he has raised the alarm about the possibility of their spread.
The best way to prevent the next outbreak in humans, specialists say, is with what they call the One Health Initiative -- a worldwide program, involving more than 600 scientists and other professionals, that advances the idea that human, animal and ecological health are inextricably linked and need to be studied and managed holistically.
''It's not about keeping pristine forest pristine and free of people,'' says Simon Anthony, a molecular virologist at the Center for Infection and Immunity at Columbia University's Mailman School of Public Health. ''It's learning how to do things sustainably. If you can get a handle on what it is that drives the emergence of a disease, then you can learn to modify environments sustainably.''
The scope of the problem is huge and complex. Just an estimated 1 percent of wildlife viruses are known. Another major factor is the immunology of wildlife, a science in its infancy. Raina K. Plowright, a biologist at Pennsylvania State University who studies the ecology of disease, found that outbreaks of the Hendra virus in flying foxes in rural areas were rare but were much higher in urban and suburban animals. She hypothesizes that urbanized bats are sedentary and miss the frequent exposure to the virus they used to get in the wild, which kept the infection at low levels. That means more bats -- whether from poor nutrition, loss of habitat or other factors -- become infected and shed more of the virus into backyards.
THE fate of the next pandemic may be riding on the work of Predict. EcoHealth and its partners -- the University of California at Davis, the Wildlife Conservation Society, the Smithsonian Institution and Global Viral Forecasting -- are looking at wildlife-borne viruses across the tropics, building a virus library. Most of the work focuses on primates, rats and bats, which are most likely to carry diseases that affect people.
Most critically, Predict researchers are watching the interface where deadly viruses are known to exist and where people are breaking open the forest, as they are along the new highway from the Atlantic to the Pacific across the Andes in Brazil and Peru. ''By mapping encroachment into the forest you can predict where the next disease could emerge,'' Dr. Daszak, EcoHealth's president, says. ''So we're going to the edge of villages, we're going to places where mines have just opened up, areas where new roads are being built. We are going to talk to people who live within these zones and saying, 'what you are doing is potentially a risk.' ''
It might mean talking to people about how they butcher and eat bush meat or to those who are building a feed lot in bat habitat. In Bangladesh, where Nipah broke out several times, the disease was traced to bats that were raiding containers that collected date palm sap, which people drank. The disease source was eliminated by placing bamboo screens (which cost 8 cents each) over the collectors.
EcoHealth also scans luggage and packages at airports, looking for imported wildlife likely to be carrying deadly viruses. And they have a program called PetWatch to warn consumers about exotic pets that are pulled out of the forest in disease hot spots and shipped to market.
All in all, the knowledge gained in the last couple of years about emerging diseases should allow us to sleep a little easier, says Dr. Epstein, the EcoHealth veterinarian. ''For the first time,'' he said, ''there is a coordinated effort in 20 countries to develop an early warning system for emerging zoonotic outbreaks.''
Correction: July 22, 2012, Sunday
This article has been revised to reflect the following correction: An earlier version of this article described imprecisely the affiliation of Simon Anthony, a molecular virologist. While he works with EcoHealth, an organization of scientists devoted to wildlife conservation, his primary affiliation is as a postdoctoral research fellow at the Center for Infection and Immunity at Columbia University's Mailman School of Public Health.

HEADLINE: Our Town Could Be Yours

BYLINE: By MAGGIE JONES

 BODY:
Around 10 on a clear May morning in 2008, two black helicopters circled over Postville, Iowa, a town of two square miles and fewer than 3,000 residents. Then a line of S.U.V.'s drove past Postville's main street and its worn brick storefronts. More than 10 white buses with darkened windows and the words ''Homeland Security'' on their sides were on their way to the other side of town. Postville's four-man police force had no forewarning of what was about to happen. Neither did the mayor.
The procession of S.U.V.'s, buses and state-trooper cars were descending on Agriprocessors, the largest producer of kosher meat in the United States and Postville's biggest employer, which occupies 60 acres on the edge of town. Several silos clustered together like old, overgrown tin cans behind the plant's chain-link fence. Low-slung, rusted metal buildings -- one with a 10-foot menorah mounted on its top -- contained hundreds of workers, chickens and cattle. 
The early shift at Agri, as Postville residents call it, had been under way for several hours when dozens of agents from U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement, dressed in black flak vests, stormed the plant's buildings. Workers shouted, ''La migra, la migra'' (immigration police), dropped their butcher and boning knives and fled from their jobs at the cutting and grinding machines. A group of women ran to a bathroom and locked themselves in the stalls before I.C.E. agents forced them out. A couple of men scaled Agri's fence and hid in the cornfield across the street, where they remained until the next morning. Others climbed onto the roof near the smokestack of the chicken-processing building. From there, one man called a friend from his cellphone: ''Take care of my children,'' he pleaded.
Fermin Loyes Lopez, a 27-year-old father from Guatemala who had been living in Postville for five years, found his wife, Rosa Zamora Santos, who worked the same shift, cutting chicken meat off breast bones. One of their daughters, a toddler, was with a baby sitter; the other, a 5-year-old, was in kindergarten. After a quick call to the baby sitter, Lopez counseled his wife: ''Tell them the truth,'' he said, referring to the I.C.E. agents, just before he was arrested. ''Tell them your real name. Tell them we have children.''
Meanwhile, several blocks away, on Lawler, the town's main street, Elver Herrera, a former plant worker who ran the local bakery, hid Latinos in an apartment above his store. The head of the local Catholic Church's Hispanic ministry raced to a nearby apartment complex where many Latino families lived and handed out printed information about undocumented immigrants' rights, while a school counselor went door to door, telling families to stay away from the plant.
Within hours of the raid -- which I.C.E. had planned for months, based on evidence that large numbers of Agri's employees used suspect or false Social Security numbers and that plant managers hired minors and violated other labor laws -- I.C.E. agents detained 389 undocumented workers, most of them Guatemalan. (Agri employed more than 900 workers, over three shifts.) The agents handcuffed the wrists of the men and women and loaded them into the Homeland Security buses. With one state-trooper vehicle in front of each bus and another behind, they drove 75 miles to Waterloo, Iowa. There, I.C.E. had transformed an 80-acre fairgrounds, the National Cattle Congress, into a temporary processing center for the workers. Many of the detainees, including Lopez, were then sent to prisons throughout the country, where they would spend five months before being deported to Guatemala.
Back in Postville, about 400 residents poured into St. Bridget's Catholic Church, which would become the town's de facto relief center in the months to come. Women, men and children ate at the church and slept in the pews, afraid I.C.E. might be waiting for them at home.
On almost any other May evening, Guatemalan families, many of whom had lived in Postville for years and were a tight-knit group from two villages in Guatemala, would have been outside, pushing strollers down Lawler Street, stopping for tacos at the Mexican restaurant, Sabor Latino, and for ice cream at the Sweet Spot. Instead, downtown was empty. At the Tidy Wave laundromat, washers and dryers were filled with clothes. No one ever came to claim them.
Some families packed their cars in the middle of the night and drove to other meatpacking towns in Iowa or to another part of the United States altogether. Others turned to a van service, run by a local Guatemalan-American, that would eventually shuttle more than 100 people to O'Hare Airport in Chicago for one-way flights to Guatemala City. Children stopped going to school. Within weeks, roughly 1,000 Mexican and Guatemalan residents -- about a third of the town -- vanished. It was as if a natural disaster had swept through, leaving no physical evidence of destruction, just silence behind it.
Postville -- a town with no stoplights, no fast-food restaurants and a weekly newspaper that for years featured the ''Yard of the Week'' -- had been through one of biggest single-site immigration raids in U.S. history. For 20 years, this community of schoolteachers, town officials, farmers and others had lived diversity up close, through influxes of Orthodox Jews, Guatemalans and Mexicans, in ways many people in large cities never do. The raid might have pushed that diversity out of Postville. Instead, the post-raid, post-Latino years would create a more complex community and more big-city challenges for tiny Postville than anyone could have envisioned.
Like many Iowa towns, Postville was hit hard by the Midwest farm crisis in the 1980s. Small farms folded, businesses shuttered and people moved to bigger cities for better opportunities. Then, in 1987, Postville, it seemed, got lucky: the Rubashkin family, part of the Chabad-Lubavitch sect of Hasidic Jews, extended its meat business from a butcher shop in Brooklyn, N.Y., to a defunct factory in Postville. It was part of a trend of major meatpacking plants moving to the Midwest, closer to livestock and lower-paid, nonunion workers. Even among these new destinations, though, Postville stood out. While many rural meatpacking towns have populations of 30,000 to 60,000, Postville's population was just 1,400 when Agri arrived.
Initially, Russians and Ukrainians worked at the plant. But as they moved on to better jobs and other towns, Mexicans and later Guatemalans took their place. Tensions in Postville -- where intermarriage was a Swede marrying a Norwegian -- ran high at times. The newcomers were largely single men with ''too much time on their hands on the weekends,'' according to Michael Halse, the Postville police chief. Some longtime residents grumbled that Guatemalans took jobs from white Iowans; a rumor spread that Mexicans killed dogs for meat.
Not everyone was pleased with the presence of Orthodox Jews, either, many of whom were managers and rabbis at the plant. About 100 Jewish families ultimately moved to Postville, where they opened a synagogue and schools for their children. Dressed in black felt fedoras and black suits with tzitzit, or tassels, hanging from their shirts and sometimes shtreimels, large fur hats, the Orthodox men stuck out among others walking down Lawler Street. The Jews were remote, some complained; they drove as if they still lived in New York City; they let their grass grow too high.
But by the mid-2000s, time and experience had softened Postville's mood. Latinos, Jews and longtime Iowans were still largely segregated socially, but tolerance was the norm. It helped that many of the single Guatemalan and Mexican men had moved on or settled down, often bringing their families from back home. The public schools had a new fine-arts building, developed a K-12 bilingual program and hired additional staff members. New businesses sprouted: a Mexican restaurant and grocery store, a Guatemalan restaurant and the Guatemalan-owned Tonita's Express, where workers lined up on Saturday mornings to wire hundreds of dollars back to villages in Guatemala and bought phone cards, Spanish-language CDs and DVDs, tortillas and birthday cards.
By that time, Aaron Goldsmith, an Orthodox Jew, had won a seat on the Postville City Council. And volunteers organized an annual food festival downtown, where, along with cotton candy, funnel cakes and hot dogs, the booths featured falafel, tacos and Ukrainian blinchiki, while the entertainer Uncle Moishy -- flown in from Brooklyn -- performed Yiddish songs.
In 2005 Herrera, the former Agri worker, who had been a teacher in Guatemala, took over the Postville Bakery -- a town fixture since the late 1800s -- and transformed it into a spot where old-time farmers lingered over doughnuts and coffee and Latinos bought pan dulce, tostadas and conchas. A new welcome sign went up on the edge of town, declaring Postville ''Hometown to the World.''
Among the many who benefited economically from the immigrant population was Candy Seibert. She and her husband bought a handful of apartments to rent to workers; she opened the laundromat Tidy Wave and the Sweet Spot ice-cream store, while her husband worked in construction and ran a cabinetmaking business. When she wasn't managing cabinet orders, Seibert was scooping ice cream, picking up a few Spanish words, collecting rent and fielding phone calls about dripping faucets. She knew almost all of the town's newcomers. She liked watching Latino kids, some of whose parents had never finished elementary school and didn't speak English, graduate from high school. ''We didn't know how good we had it,'' she says.
During my first trip to Postville two years ago, Seibert and I sat in her real estate office one morning, in a converted garage two blocks from Agri to the east and two blocks from downtown to the west. Dozens of keys hung from the wall, and a dry-erase board listed needed repairs at her properties.
Seibert is 43, with long blond hair that she hastily pulls into a ponytail, a wardrobe of jeans and zip-up hoodies and a no-nonsense manner. ''It takes some mothering,'' she said of being a Postville landlord, which she likened to the decade she spent bartending in a biker bar. ''And I have to yell a lot.''
Her mini-empire of working-class housing includes apartment buildings and clapboard single-family homes divided into units. Following the raid, she also began managing dozens of properties for a bank when a major landlord went bankrupt.
But in the immediate aftermath of the raid, Seibert and many local business owners struggled to stay afloat. Mexican-owned grocery and clothing stores shut down, along with Restaurante Rinconcito Guatemalteco. Business at Seibert's laundromat and several other local shops dropped by at least 50 percent.
Down the street, Agri was collapsing, too. Most of the work force was in jail or had left town. In the best of circumstances, meatpacking is bloody, exhausting and dangerous work. It draws the desperate: undocumented immigrants, refugees with limited English skills and a smattering of U.S. citizens thin on luck. Agri's conditions were worse than most. About 75 percent of its workers -- some of them minors -- were undocumented, and many earned only $6 to $7 an hour, often without overtime. Female workers reported being sexually assaulted by managers, and workplace accidents were not uncommon, including broken bones, eye injuries, hearing loss and grisly mishaps that resulted in amputations.
The raid itself did nothing to improve conditions. In subsequent days, one Iowa job agency, Labor Ready, provided 150 replacement employees for Agri, then pulled them out about a week later, complaining that the plant was unsafe. A group of Native Americans from Nebraska and students from Kyrgyzstan also quit shortly after starting. Mysterious ads -- Agri officials denied placing them -- appeared in newspapers and on telephone poles in Guatemala City, pitching meatpacking jobs for $8.50 an hour in Postville, ''a technologically developed town with a friendly atmosphere, pretty green areas, public schools and family recreation areas.''
Then, in one of its most desperate moves, Agri recruited 170 people from the Micronesian island of Palau -- whose status as a former U.S. protectorate means its citizens can work legally in the United States. In September 2008, the Palauans traveled 72 hours and 8,000 miles on planes and buses before arriving in Postville with little more than flip-flops and brightly colored shorts and tops.
Meanwhile, Agri hired other job agencies that recruited Somali refugees from Minnesota and bused in homeless people from Texas, with promises of a hiring bonus and a month of free housing. The once-quiet town entered its ''inner-city, homeless phase,'' Seibert said. The Postville police chief added more officers -- the department was used to dealing with stray animals, locked cars and bar brawls -- to the Friday and Saturday night shifts. Arrests went up during the fall and winter of 2008. Drug problems spiked. There was a double stabbing downtown.
In the midst of this upheaval, Sholom Rubashkin, the chief executive of Agri, was charged with providing funds for fake ID cards for workers; later, he was also charged with defrauding banks of millions of dollars. (He is serving a 27-year prison sentence for 86 counts of financial fraud, including money laundering and bank, mail and wire fraud. Other managers received prison sentences for bank fraud and helping immigrants get false work papers.) The same month Rubashkin was arrested, a bank began foreclosing on the plant, and the company suspended hundreds of employees without pay. Work at Agri slowed to a crawl. With few workers to slaughter the animals, hundreds of turkeys, stuck in cages on tractor-trailers outside the plant, began dying. The smell of decay seeped into the neighborhood.
Agri stopped paying its property taxes to Postville, and the town's two biggest landlords -- Seibert was not yet among them -- folded shop, leaving behind thousands of dollars' worth of unpaid water and heat bills, as well as hundreds of angry, out-of-work tenants.
Many of the laid-off workers fled immediately, including several from a house that Seibert showed me one afternoon. On the outside, paint peeled, and the porch sagged from rot. Several windows were cracked, and one was completely shattered. Inside, beer cans, cups and plastic bags littered the kitchen counters and floors. Upstairs, a toilet tank was cracked down the middle. Seibert -- who ended up managing the building after the tenants left -- guessed that either someone smashed the toilet or it froze when the heat was shut off. In a bedroom, a pair of flip-flops lay next to a bare mattress, as if its occupant had been too rushed to pack.
Some workers had little choice but to stay put. One winter evening in 2008, Herrera, the manager of the bakery (which would be destroyed by fire the following year), arrived home and greeted his wife: ''Baby,'' he said, ''I have some company.'' He had several Palauans with him. Herrera had found them on the street with their suitcases, no money and nowhere to go. Four of them spent several months in Herrera's basement before moving on to other cities and better opportunities.
Of course, the raid was not directly responsible for the treatment of the Palauans and everything else that happened that year: for too long, Postville had been dependent on a corrupt plant and a largely illegal, exploited work force. Still, the raid upended a careful balance in Postville and left chaos in its place.
One Friday afternoon, Seibert took me to meet some of the workers who had come to town since the raid. They gathered at an apartment with wood floors and a small kitchen on Lawler Street. It was the social club for dozens of Somalis in town. Several men sat on metal chairs, watching CNN. Others talked in the kitchen where a stand-alone freezer held the meat of three goats and half a cow. The sign taped to the wall read: ''Private club. Members and their guests only. See Abdirahman Dagane for membership. $1 donation for refreshments appreciated.''
Drawn mostly by word of mouth, the men had come to Postville from Minneapolis, Kansas City, Buffalo and other cities. As Abdullahi Hassan offered me a cup of sweet Somali tea, others talked about the downsides of small-town life: the lack of English classes, job-placement agencies and translation services. One man said he heard that if you talked to the mayor about problems at the plant, you would lose your job. ''I don't even know where the mayor's office is,'' Jama Guhat said. (It was across the street and a few storefronts away.) Guhat, who moved to Postville several months earlier from Minnesota, was long and lanky and wore a dark brown suit, a Marlboro dangling from his fingers. On Saturdays -- the Jewish Sabbath, when the plant closes -- Guhat and many Somalis leave Postville for Minneapolis, a three-hour drive, to spend their paychecks on trunks full of halal meat, which meets Islamic standards, as well as seasonings and tea.
Though some Somalis showed up to fill jobs immediately after the raid, many more had come to town since late 2009, after a Canadian businessman named Hershey Friedman bought the Agri slaughterhouse out of bankruptcy court. He renamed it Agri Star and invested millions in revamping the plant. Offering starting wages of $8.50 an hour, Friedman has increased Agri Star's work force to its current level of about 600 workers from about 300 after bankruptcy.
Like the first Guatemalans, many Somalis in Postville are single: either unmarried or with spouses waiting in Minneapolis or other cities while the men decide if Postville will become home. Others have wives and children still in Kenyan refugee camps. There are about 150 Somalis in town today -- down from roughly 250 in 2010 -- and no other group in Postville has stood out quite so much: Somali women dressed in head coverings and flowing hijabs shopping in the IGA supermarket; tall, dark-skinned Somali men, smoking cigarettes and speaking Arabic outside a store that they rent for their mosque, two doors down from Club 51, the town's lone bar.
Mark Grey, an anthropology professor at the University of Northern Iowa and director of the Iowa Center for Immigrant Leadership and Integration, says the raid resulted in waves of new immigrants not only in Postville but in other meatpacking towns in the Midwest as well. Many meatpacking companies have increasingly steered away from hiring Latinos -- even though they may be in the United States legally -- because they fear government scrutiny, says Grey, who is an author, with Michele Devlin, a colleague at Northern Iowa, and Aaron Goldsmith, the former Postville councilman, of ''Postville, U.S.A.: Surviving Diversity in Small-Town America.'' Instead, they have recruited African and Burmese refugees and other non-Latino immigrants, who, while they may be legal, also challenge communities with new cultures and new languages. ''People can scream about the illegal work force, but a legal work force will also be more ethnically diverse,'' he says. ''In these towns, I have people whispering in my ear, 'I miss my illegal Mexicans.' ''
Seibert says she hopes that the Somalis will make Postville their home. As a landlord, she likes that they are family-oriented and that most don't drink alcohol, in keeping with their Muslim beliefs. Among her favorites is Abdirahman Dagane, who ran the Somali social club. Dagane is 26, exceedingly polite, with boyish looks and outfits of buttoned-up white shirts, khakis and sweater vests. He was 11 when fighting broke out in his Somali village. Playing with friends at the time and unable to find his family before they fled town, he spent the next couple of years living in the back of a village restaurant. Eventually he made his way to Kenya, where he found one of his brothers in a refugee camp. After moving to Minnesota as a refugee, he spent less than a year in 10th grade before dropping out to earn money for himself and his family.
Dagane has heard the talk around town that Somalis don't work as hard as the Guatemalans. ''With Somalis, if the supervisor yells, they aren't going to take it,'' Dagane said. ''The Guatemalans always kept working because they don't have papers.''
We were sitting in his kitchen on a rainy Saturday a year ago, while lamb boiled on the stove and a five-pound bag of basmati rice sat on a chair next to us. Upstairs, in the three-bedroom apartment that Dagane shared with four other Somali men, the furnishings included little more than a TV, a couple of tables and mattresses on the floor.
While many Somalis were in Minneapolis for the day, Dagane -- whose car bumper sticker reads ''One who prays but does no work is as one who shoots without a bowstring'' and who lists his activities on Facebook as ''work and making something better'' -- preferred to stick around in Postville, doing errands, enjoying the quiet of the town. He hoped to make more money, marry and raise a family there.
Dagane had orchestrated a meeting at the local mosque to identify people who could serve as liaisons between the Somali community and Postville leaders. He and his friends also had plans to open a tea shop. It would be the only Somali-run business in town and a step toward making Postville their own.
Not long after I last saw him, Dagane called me with some news. Dagane, his best friend and three others had left Postville, lured by manufacturing jobs with Whirlpool in Amana, Iowa, that paid $12 an hour, had better health insurance and offered more time off. Guhat, the Somali of the brown suit and the Marlboros, also left, along with several other Somalis, for a meatpacking plant in Kansas with higher starting wages. This is the story of meatpacking towns: if workers can move on, they usually do.
And while the opening of a Costco or another large retail business might create a more stable work force for Postville, local leaders don't count on that happening, given the economy and Postville's size and remote location. ''The town feels fortunate to have a meatpacking plant,'' Mark Grey says, ''even if it creates its own set of problems.''
Those problems were relatively minor, so it seemed, before the raid. Many residents refer to that time as Postville's ''golden years.'' Guatemalans had settled and invested in Postville, in part because they liked its safety and small-town atmosphere. Many, though, were undocumented -- and afraid. With no papers and scant education and English skills, few could walk away from even the lousiest jobs. Their limitations created Postville's sense of stability.
Some of those Guatemalans have now returned. Rosa Zamora Santos, whose husband was deported following the raid, was part of a group of Agri women who reported sexual harassment and other workplace violations to law-enforcement authorities. The women were allowed to stay as government witnesses, with GPS tracking devices strapped to their ankles for months. Then, two years ago, Santos became one of more than three dozen other women and children who were awarded U-visas, given to victims of crimes committed in the United States. That allowed her to finally bring her husband back to Postville last year. Other Latinos -- some legal, some not -- have moved in, too, along with a few African-American families escaping crime-ridden neighborhoods in Chicago and other cities. The work at Agri is still grueling; wages are low (Agri Star, like Agriprocessors before it, is not unionized), and some of the old managers from Agriprocessors are still in place. Yet over all, most people think Agri Star is an improvement.
New shops have also opened in Postville in the last two years, including a Mexican convenience store, a Dollar General store and, last year, a kosher store to replace one that folded after the raid. Tzvi Bass originally considered using a Hebrew name for his new grocery before settling on Glatt Market, which he hoped would attract more non-Jews. (The Jewish population has declined to about 50 families from 100 in 2008.) And though Somalis still head to Minneapolis to visit friends and buy Somali food in bulk, a Somali wanders occasionally into Glatt Market shopping for spices, canned beans and meat (kosher meat meets halal standards) among the aisles of eggs, milk, challah, gefilte fish and cold cuts. ''It was easy to destroy this town,'' Bass told me a few weeks ago. ''It's harder to rebuild. But I see it slowly, slowly coming back.''
Seibert sees it gradually growing, too, albeit in a different -- and still-to-be-defined -- form. Some Somalis have settled down with families, including Abdi Kassim, who has lived in Postville for three years and in June married a Somali woman, whom he met at Agri. ''I plan to grow old here,'' he told me last month.
As for Abdirahman Dagane, the Whirlpool job did not last. Not long after he started, the company began a round of layoffs: as the last hired, Dagane and his friends were the first let go. He returned to Postville a couple times in the last year to visit friends and toyed with the idea of moving back. But this spring he found a job driving a taxi in Des Moines. ''I love Postville,'' he told me. ''But in America, if you find a job, you gotta go. And I'm not starting over again at Agri for $8.50 an hour. Somalis go where the jobs are. We are pastoralists. We don't stay in one place too long.''

HEADLINE: TBR: Inside the List

BYLINE: By GREGORY COWLES

 BODY:
UNEQUAL EXCHANGE: For a few weeks now, two drastically different arguments about America's income gap have been bouncing around the hardcover nonfiction list. In ''The Price of Inequality'' (currently at No. 27 on the extended list), the Columbia professor and Nobel-winning economist Joseph E. Stiglitz makes the case that the growing gulf between haves and have-nots is a drag on the economy and a drain on society. Meanwhile, in ''Unintended Consequences'' (at No. 12), the former Bain Capital managing director Edward Conard says inequality is healthy and America could use more of it. This is a political dispute as much as an economic one, of course: Conard is close to his old Bain colleague Mitt Romney, and Stiglitz was chairman of President Clinton's Council of Economic Advisers from 1995 to 1997. But basic economic theories are also at play. Who's right? I'm not qualified to judge -- I was a French major -- but the books are in such perfect, symmetrical opposition that I've been a little surprised not to see their authors duking it out on every Sunday morning talk show. So I figured I'd give them the chance here. A condensed version of this exchange will be published in the July 15 Book Review. 
INEQUALITY IS BAD: ''I'm not arguing that there should be no inequality,'' Stiglitz said via e-mail. ''There is a need for incentives, and any system of incentives will lead to some differences -- perhaps large differences -- in incomes. But I am arguing that excessive inequality is bad for economic growth and stability; even the I.M.F. has recognized this. The weight of evidence, some of which I cite in my book, is really on my side: (excessive) inequality is bad for growth.
''There are a variety of reasons I lay out in my book. It leads, for instance, to underinvestment in the 'public good,' including infrastructure, education and technology. The level of inequality in the United States has clearly reached this 'excessive' level. It has more inequality than any of the other advanced industrial countries. Indeed, the growth of inequality in recent years has meant that while G.D.P. per capita has increased, income of the median household has essentially stagnated. Trickle-down economics has not worked.
''Even more disturbing is that the United States has become the country with the least equality of opportunity among the advanced countries for which there is data, and this includes many in 'old Europe.' This means that a child's life prospects are more dependent on the income and education of his parents than in these other countries; and it also means that we are not making use of one of our most valuable resources, our young people.
''I argue further that the way inequality is created in the United States -- much of it the result of market distortions like monopolies, the 'abuses' of the financial system, chief executives taking advantage of deficiencies in corporate governance to claim a larger share of corporate revenues, using campaign contributions to get preferential tax treatment, corporate welfare and other gifts from the public -- actually weakens the economy. The inequality is not the result of innovations that enhance growth. The richest are not the inventors of the laser and the transistor, the discoverers of DNA, the innovators who have transformed our lives and our economy. Rather, many have succeeded in garnering for themselves a larger share of the national pie -- not increasing the size of the pie.
''Conard's position is that inequality is good because it spurs innovation. But the incentive structures of the bankers spurred reckless risk-taking at the expense of the public and exploitation -- not innovations that led to sustained faster growth. The wealthy use their money to buy favors from the government, whether direct gifts or laws and regulations that give them scope to exploit others.
''As I wrote in response to a question posed to me by Vanity Fair:
''The real drivers of growth and innovation are young businesses, and small- and medium-sized businesses, and especially in high-tech areas, these are typically based on government-supported research. Part of America's problem today is that too many of those at the top don't want to make their fair share in contributing to these 'public goods,' with many paying taxes that are but a fraction of those who are much less well off.
''Just providing low tax rates to those at the top -- giving them more money that they could invest in the United States and innovate -- doesn't mean that they will or have. There is, sometimes, no sense of responsibility or obligation. Some of those at the top (like the infamous Facebook investor) would rather give up their citizenship than pay the low capital gains tax rate. But more generally, many have decided it is better to create jobs abroad, or to buy expensive villas abroad -- money that doesn't stimulate our economy or make it stronger.
''I can see the argument for encouraging real entrepreneurship, innovation and job creation through lower tax rates on those things. But it doesn't make sense to allow lower taxes for job-destroying private equity firms or country-destroying speculators/hedge funds than for the scientists who win Nobel Prizes.''
INEQUALITY IS GOOD: ''Joe argues the rich have garnered an increasing share of income by unproductively manipulating government policies, which slows overall G.D.P. growth,'' Conard wrote. ''His hypothesis doesn't explain why American productivity growth has accelerated from 1.2 percent per year in the 1970s and '80s to 2 percent per year since the commercialization of the Internet, while Europe's and Japan's productivity growth has slowed considerably relative to the United States despite similarly educated workforces and access to the same technology. Nor does it explain why United States employment and total middle-class income have grown more than twice as fast as Europe's and Japan's since the 1980s.
''I argue that the payoffs for successful risk-taking needed to produce innovation were higher in the United States for a variety of reasons, including government policies, at a time when the commercialization of the Internet opened a rich window of untapped investment opportunities. Higher payoffs motivated more risk-taking and investment (properly measured to include the wages of innovators). This had a powerful compounding effect over time. Success raised the bar for success. Talented American workers worked longer hours, took more risk and earned more income than their counterparts in Europe who diminished their work effort. Success produced new companies, like Google and Facebook, that provided valuable on-the-job training, which increased their workforces' chances of success. Success put equity into the hands of investors more willing to bear the risks needed to produce innovation. While some critics call this 'trickle down,' even liberal economists, like Dean Baker, agree the benefits from investment and innovation are at least five times more valuable to non-investors than investors.
''I believe Joe and I share the same objective: growing middle- and working-class employment and incomes as fast as possible. We should grow concerned about income inequality when it sets back this objective -- if and when the rich use their wealth to thwart innovation or to take rightfully earned income away from the middle class and the working poor, for example. Joe claims we have reached that point, but comparisons to Europe and Japan make that hard to believe. In addition to faster growth, the top 10 percent in the United States pays a substantially greater share of taxes relative to their share of income than their counterparts in Europe and Japan. And higher government expenditures in Europe are funded by higher taxes on the middle class, not the top 10 percent. This would not be the case if the rich controlled the American political process to their advantage.
''We should also grow concerned when a backlash to inequality threatens to dampen the incentives for the risk-taking needed to produce innovation and employment growth. In the aftermath of the financial crisis, slow growth and high unemployment have fomented this backlash. But the slow growth of Europe and Japan demonstrates that we should be far more concerned about the difficulty of generating employment growth in high-wage economies than reducing income inequality. So far, the United States has proven to be the superior real-world alternative by a wide margin. As I argue in my book, theoretical alternatives, like Joe's, are fraught with unintended consequences: in this case, slower employment growth.''

HEADLINE: With Book By Experts, Bush Joins Fiscal Fray

BYLINE: By PETER BAKER

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- His entire involvement in the presidential campaign has consisted of four words uttered to a reporter as elevator doors were closing: ''I'm for Mitt Romney.'' But former President George W. Bush gingerly enters the fray a little more this week with a new book outlining ways to rebuild the economy.
For the first time since leaving office three and a half years ago, Mr. Bush is advancing a variety of ideas about how to jump-start economic growth by restructuring taxes, expanding trade, encouraging innovation, fixing immigration and overhauling Social Security. He wrote the foreword for the book, a collection of essays from an array of economists, including five Nobel Prize winners, and he proposes a national goal of expanding the economy by 4 percent a year on a sustained basis. 
''The 4% Solution: Unleashing the Economic Growth America Needs,'' to be unveiled by the former president in Dallas on Tuesday and published by Crown Business, is neither campaign template nor partisan screed. It is a wonky paean to free enterprise.
It is also the next step in a gradual return to the public stage by a president who has largely remained out of the limelight since turning over the White House to President Obama. Mr. Bush has repeatedly said his successor deserves his silence and has largely avoided commenting on current affairs. He has not publicly appeared with Mr. Romney to endorse him, as his parents have done, or hosted a fund-raiser for Mr. Romney, as his vice president did last week.
To the extent that Mr. Bush has been part of the dialogue this year, it has been as a whipping boy for Mr. Obama and other Democrats. They have warned voters not to support Mr. Romney because he would revive Bush policies that they say led to the 2008 financial crisis and the problems that linger today.
The former president, who was confronted with a recession early in his first term and then presided over a long period of sustained though not particularly robust growth before 2008, does not use the book to defend his record, but instead tries to move forward.
''While the causes of the 2008 crisis will be debated by scholars for decades to come, we can all agree that excessive risk-taking by financial institutions, irresponsible decisions by lenders and borrowers, and market-distorting government policies all played a role,'' Mr. Bush wrote in the foreword. ''The question now is which policies we should adopt to fix the problems, speed the recovery, and lay the foundation for another long, steady expansion.''
James K. Glassman, executive director of the George W. Bush Institute, which assembled the book, said the former president did not want to rehash the past. ''This is not a backward-looking book,'' Mr. Glassman said. ''We hope that the book will be a centerpiece of conversation and debate about economic policy in the campaign and beyond.''
The book tries to reorient the economic debate away from how many jobs are created each month to a focus on stimulating growth that will generate worthwhile jobs. Government programs can create jobs that do not mean much to the country, the book argues, and it would be better to figure out how to expand the private sector.
At the same time, while warning of the consequences of spiraling federal debt, the book cautions against deficit reduction as an immediate goal, saying tax increases and spending cuts in the short term could strangle growth. ''Reducing the debt is critical,'' Mr. Glassman wrote in the book's introduction, ''but growth comes first.''
The ideas in the book include lowering corporate tax rates, shifting away from taxing income to taxing consumption and property, promoting innovation by letting professors keep gains from their research, expanding free-trade pacts with Japan and other countries, refocusing immigration policy to recruit more high-skill workers, and expanding the work force by lowering payroll taxes on employees with children.
A goal of 4 percent growth would be ambitious for a country whose annual growth has averaged 3.2 percent since 1948 and is currently below 2 percent. But the difference would have a huge impact; had the country's economy grown 4 percent a year since 1948, it would be 50 percent larger today. Higher growth would help reduce debt by producing more tax revenue.
''We're in an economy in transition,'' said Brendan Miniter, who edited the book. ''If we don't set the target higher, if we just continue to stumble along, ultimately we're going to pay a pretty stark price.''

HEADLINE: Back in Business

BYLINE: By C. J. HUGHES

 BODY:
IN the mid-2000s, when the iPhone was still a concept and Barack Obama a United States senator, New York was awash in new condos.
Gleaming new high-rises sprang from the ground from Brighton Beach to the Bronx, and especially in Manhattan, where in terms of sheer ubiquity they seemed to rival Starbucks. That is, until 2008, when Lehman Brothers collapsed and the bottom fell out of the housing market. Luxury condos quickly lost their luster.
Now, in a move that seems to parallel the national housing recovery, the condo sector appears to be clawing its way back, according to brokers, developers and industry analysts. Workers are pouring concrete. Lenders are negotiating loans. And projects once written off as dead are coming back to life, which is stoking hopes that this comeback, unlike previous false starts, has some momentum.
''I would call it a swell,'' said Stephen Kliegerman, president for new development marketing of Halstead Property. ''It's not a wave yet, but it's certainly not a drizzle either.'' 
Not that anyone's exactly expecting the go-go years to come roaring back. In 2007, at the height of the boom, there were 507 planned condo projects in Manhattan and Brooklyn, according to a tally from the state attorney general's office, whose approval is required before any condo plans can become a reality. In 2011, there were just 255 in those boroughs, with about the same number expected this year, according to state documents.
Even so, other data suggest that the next 18 months will see a rush of new projects.
In fact, in Manhattan below 96th Street over the next few years, about 1,500 new condo units are expected to hit the market each year, says Kelly Kennedy Mack, president of the Corcoran Sunshine Marketing Group.
In contrast, about 900 units a year were introduced during the downturn, Ms. Mack said
And while that extra supply might seem copious, far more would be needed to slake the newfound appetite for this type of housing; the scarcity is even putting upward pressure on prices, she said.
Indeed, the current average condo price of $1,400 a square foot is expected to shoot up to $2,000 per square foot once all the planned condos go up, said Ms. Mack, adding, ''We are truly entering a new development renaissance.''
The First Wave
BACCARAT HOTEL
Living in Midtown Manhattan may not be for everyone, but continued interest from foreign buyers and those looking for pieds-a-terre appears to be firing developers' enthusiasm.
An example is the Baccarat Hotel and Residences New York, a 46-story tower under construction at 20 West 53rd Street, across from the Museum of Modern Art.
Co-developed by Starwood Capital Group, the creator of the W hotel chain, and Tribeca Associates, the $400 million tower will have 114 hotel rooms and 64 condos over 45 stories. The condos will range from one- to three-bedrooms, and there will be a duplex penthouse. The units will have 12- to 16-foot ceilings, and some will have terraces, according to Starwood.
The building, designed by Skidmore Owings & Merrill, will meet feng shui standards, said Barry Sternlicht, Starwood's chairman.
56 LEONARD STREET
At the tail end of the boom, a 57-story tower from the Alexico Group was supposed to be built at this address, and developers got as far as the foundation. But the site, at Church Street in TriBeCa, has mostly been quiet since.
Behind the scenes, though, there's been a big push to line up financing for this long-stalled project, which will open a sales office by the end of the year, said Ms. Mack, whose firm is handling the marketing.
To make this happen, the circle of partners has broadened to include Hines, the national developer, which joined Dune Capital Management, Goldman Sachs and Alexico, she said. Spreading the risk across a syndicate like this is becoming more common in the post-recession period, analysts say.
With 145 one- to five-bedrooms, the tower was designed by Herzog & de Meuron, which also created 40 Bond.
Boutique buildings used to dominate Lower Manhattan, Ms. Mack said, but with 56 Leonard, ''we will soon see a new product type, on a grander scale, that will be very architecturally driven.''
530 PARK AVENUE
This conversion of the 20-story apartment building at East 61st Street is being undertaken by the developer RFR Holding. Sales began this month. Unlike the jazzy designs of RFR projects like One Jackson Square, with its wavy glass facade, No. 530 seems understated.
Its 119 units, studios to four-bedrooms, are priced around $3,200 a square foot, though there was a one-bedroom listed last week, on the ninth floor, at $2.32 million, or $2,800 a foot, according to its Web site. Buyers will begin moving in this fall, according to Aby Rosen, an RFR managing partner, although about 20 pre-conversion renters will stay on.
The building, dating to 1941, retains its cream-brick facade. The apartments will have wood floors, glass-fronted kitchen cabinets and crown moldings. Mr. Rosen, a noted collector of contemporary art, will also take a restrained approach in common areas. ''Prewar has its own charm,'' he said, ''so you don't have to overdo it.''
The building is to have a fitness center overlooking a garden with a reflecting pool, which will add a level of modernity not usually associated with the area, he said. ''We wanted to create a Second Avenue-type building, in terms of amenities, on Park,'' he said.
ONE MADISON PARK
This 65-unit condo has 50 stories overlooking the park; from afar it resembles stacks of glass cubes. It has had a troubled history: IStar Financial, its lender, foreclosed on the original developer, Slazer Enterprises, for missing millions in loan payments, though that process was derailed when other creditors filed for bankruptcy.
In April the Related Companies, along with HFZ Capital and Amalgamated Bank, took control of the site after striking a deal with those creditors.
Related is renovating the lobby of the building, whose official address is 23 East 22nd Street, and completing construction, even though 12 apartments are sold and some already occupied. The 53 remaining one- to five-bedroom units will most likely hit the market this fall, according to a source close to the project. Prices have not yet been set.
What won't be revived for now is a 22-story condo planned for an adjacent lot. Designed in 2008 by Rem Koolhaas, the cantilevered 21-unit tower has been permanently shelved, according to a source close to the project. No replacement plan for the empty lot has been announced.
18 GRAMERCY PARK
After years of delays, a former women's residence with a warren of 200 tiny rooms is being reborn as a spacious 16-unit condo called 18 Gramercy Park -- across from the park, natch.
Its developers, the brothers Arthur and Will Zeckendorf and Eyal Ofer of Global Holdings, teamed up to build the megasuccessful 15 Central Park West, whose prices soared even through the housing bust.
They have once again hired the architect Robert A. M. Stern to design the units, most of which have 4 bedrooms and 18 to 34 windows, many with 6-over-6 sashes. The developer will provide residents with keys to the gated park for Year One, after which they can renew at $350 a year. Four park keys for residents' use will also be kept by the doorman.
Prices, too, may recall the team's prior project. The average unit will cost $17.5 million, the developers say; that works out to about $4,000 a square foot. Factored into the number, though, is the pricey duplex penthouse, with outdoor pool and hot tub, at $42 million. (The building is costing developers $60 million.)
But there seems to be interest. A few contracts have already been signed, said Will Zeckendorf, even though the bulding's in-house sales office will not open till September.
That wait might seem minuscule compared with the delays that dogged the project, including a struggle to find financing when the market went south in 2008. The developers ended up essentially borrowing money from the seller, the Salvation Army, to get the deal done. That's all in the past now, they say. ''The market looks strong from my vantage point,'' Will Zeckendorf said. And ''there's only one Gramercy Park,'' Arthur Zeckendorf added, finishing the thought.
On the Horizon
388 BRIDGE STREET, BROOKLYN
If this project under construction near Fulton Street in Downtown Brooklyn is any indication, developers are thinking bigger this time around. At 594 feet, or 53 stories, the glassy skyscraper from the Stahl Organization will be Brooklyn's tallest residential building when it opens in 2014.
Not all of its 378 units will be condos; hedging its bets, Stahl will also offer 234 rentals, on Floors 7 through 31. The 144 condos will enjoy the best seats in the house, on Floors 32 through 53.
''This is a good way to handle the market,'' said Gregg Wolpert, a co-president of Stahl, the developer of the Laureate, the Upper West Side condo whose penthouse went for $3,000 a square foot.
Prices have not yet been determined for Bridge Street, Mr. Wolpert said, but he does not expect it to be nearly as expensive. ''We will not be selling $15 million apartments,'' he said.
Reflecting a new reality about how these kinds of projects get financed, Stahl is kicking in $120 million of its own equity for the $265 million project, or about 45 percent, which is a huge change from the boom years. ''The days of putting up 5 or 10 percent are gone,'' Mr. Wolpert said.
737 PARK AVENUE
One of Park Avenue's few rental buildings, a 21-story red-brick prewar with 103 units, is being converted to condos by Harry Macklowe, a developer who lost much of his Manhattan portfolio during the recession but seems to be in the midst of a comeback.
Work has begun on the low-ceilinged, marble-walled lobby, and is to move on to the market-rate apartments, of which there are about 60, or about two-thirds of the building. The other third, which are rent-regulated, will most likely keep their tenants, a source close to the project said. Other details, like whether any of the units will be combined, were not available, even though an offering plan was filed with the state last summer.
The project's lender, the CIM Group, a real estate investment group based in Los Angeles, declined to comment, as did Mr. Macklowe.
432 PARK AVENUE
Perhaps nothing embodies the renewed interest in large-scale condo projects in quite the same way as 432 Park Avenue, the home of the former Drake Hotel.
Mr. Macklowe bought the hotel for $418 million in 2006 and tore it down a year later, with the intention of building a condo. Then he lost the site (along with much else) in the recession.
Now, like a phoenix, a condo plan has resurfaced, and so has Mr. Macklowe, though he has partnered this go-around with the CIM Group, which took control of the site in 2010. The plan, according to a source close to the project, is to erect a condo tower 1,398 feet tall, which would easily make it the city's tallest apartment building. (One57, which will be the tallest until 432 Park opens, clocks in at 1,004 feet.)
Designed by Rafael Vinoly, 432 Park will probably have 128 units of one to three bedrooms, according to a source close to the project, though the submitted offering plan has not yet been approved. The L-shaped site, which touches East 56th and East 57th Streets, will also have space for 16 retail stores, according to public documents.
TOWER VERRE
It was one of the most eagerly anticipated high-rises of the last decade, even though the Department of City Planning effectively lopped off its top. Part of that excitement stemmed from the fact that the now-78-story condo was being designed by Jean Nouvel, who also created 100 11th Avenue.
The wedge-shaped skyscraper, which is to be at 53 West 53rd Street, is back on track, according to a spokeswoman for Hines, the developer. When built, it should provide bird's-eye views into the Baccarat across the street.
CARLTON HOUSE
In 2010, Extell joined Angelo, Gordon & Co. to buy this 16-story former residential hotel at 680 Madison, stretching along a full block between 61st and 62nd Streets.
It sits amid Madison Avenue's prime retail offerings -- among them Hermes and Barneys -- which might explain why so much marketing attention has been paid to its expanded retail space, which will include 34,000 square feet across two stories. But the upstairs is getting a makeover too; 156 units upstairs will become 68 condos and go on sale this fall, according to sources close to the project. When the building is completed in mid-2014, it will have two stories added to its roof, and will also incorporate a town house on 61st Street.

HEADLINE: No Apologies: Obama Campaign Continues Attacks on Romney

BYLINE: By MICHAEL D. SHEAR

 BODY:
CLIFTON, Va. -- President Obama barnstormed through this swing state on Saturday as his campaign relentlessly hammered at Mitt Romney's business record, releasing a mocking new ad that shows Mr. Romney singing ''America the Beautiful'' as it accuses his former firm of shipping American jobs overseas.
Mr. Obama, speaking first to a drenched crowd during a downpour in the Richmond suburb of Glen Allen, and then at Centreville High School in Fairfax County, accused Mr. Romney of investing in ''companies that have been called pioneers in outsourcing.'' He ignored Mr. Romney's demands for an apology about the campaign's tone, which the Republican candidate had called for in interviews on Friday. 
''My opponent and his allies in Congress, they believe in top-down economics,'' Mr. Obama said. ''If you cut through all the stuff, what they are really saying is tax cuts for the wealthy, roll back regulations. That is essentially their plan.''
The president's campaign has spent more than a week harping on Mr. Romney's personal wealth and calling on him to disclose information about his personal finances by releasing more years of his tax returns. It has also raised questions about Mr. Romney's offshore investments and accounts.
The new ad reminds viewers of those issues as it shows a clip of Mr. Romney singing at a campaign event in Florida this year.
It says Mr. Romney shipped jobs to Mexico, China and India -- accusations that Mr. Romney's campaign vehemently denies. And it says Mr. Romney had ''millions'' in a Swiss bank account and ''tax havens'' in Bermuda and the Cayman Islands.
''Mitt Romney's not the solution,'' the ad states. ''He's the problem.''
On Saturday, the Republican campaign repeated Mr. Romney's angry comments about what it said are untrue allegations surrounding Mr. Romney's personal finances.
''As the failures of his presidency become more evident, Barack Obama has resorted to the tactics of a typical politician: dishonest and totally unsubstantiated attacks meant to distract from his own record by smearing the reputation of his opponent,'' said Amanda Hennenberg, a Romney campaign spokeswoman.
Mr. Romney's campaign has repeatedly defended the offshore accounts, saying that he paid all the taxes legally required. On Friday, Mr. Romney again refused to release multiple years of his tax returns. He has released a return for 2010, and an estimate for 2011.
He characterized the Obama campaign's allegations as ''reckless'' and ''absurd.''
But if Mr. Romney's campaign hoped that his rival's campaign would back off its aggressive tone, they were disappointed. Traveling with the president on Air Force One, Mr. Obama's top aides went out of their way Saturday morning to highlight their continued attacks.
In addition to the television ad, Mr. Obama's campaign released a Web video compilation of attacks that Mr. Romney has made in the past. The point, aides said, is that Mr. Romney is equally responsible for the campaign's tone.
''Mitt Romney, I just want to remind you, is the same candidate who questioned whether the president understood America, questioned whether he understood freedom,'' said Jen Psaki, a spokeswoman for the Obama campaign. ''He spends a lot of time attacking.''
The video, titled ''Asking for Apologies While Launching Attacks,'' shows Mr. Romney raising the issue of Mr. Obama's ties to the Rev. Jeremiah A. Wright Jr. and shows him accusing the president of ''appeasement'' in his foreign policy.
''This president spends a lot of time apologizing for America,'' the video shows Mr. Romney saying. ''He should be apologizing to America.''
The video concludes by saying: ''Mitt Romney. He sure asks for a lot of apologies. When he's not busy launching attacks.''
.
Throughout most of his speech on Saturday, his second day in Virginia, Mr. Obama avoided the down-and-dirty political combat that has consumed much of the campaign coverage.
''Even though the crisis put us through some very tough times, the American people are tougher,'' Mr. Obama said. ''Folks may have gotten knocked down some, but they got back up.''
But the second half of Mr. Obama's stump speech is tougher. He accused Republicans of giving tax breaks to companies that send work overseas. And he quoted Mr. Romney as ''saying let Detroit go bankrupt,'' the headline on an article he wrote in The New York Times arguing for a managed bankruptcy for the auto industry.
He concluded with a fiery defense of his health care bill.
''The Supreme Court has spoken. It is the law of the land. We are going to implement it,'' he said. ''It was the right thing to do. We're not going backwards, we are going forward.''

CONFRONT AND CONCEAL
Obama's Secret Wars and Surprising Use of American Power
By David E. Sanger
Illustrated. 476 pp. Crown Publishers. $28.
Two months into his presidency, Barack Obama announced a plan for Afghanistan reminiscent of Lyndon Johnson's doomed vision for creating a kind of mini Great Society in Vietnam. He would defeat Al Qaeda by remaking the Afghan nation. He would advance not just security but also ''opportunity and justice'' -- and ''not just in Kabul, but from the bottom up in the provinces.'' He would send in ''agricultural specialists and educators, engineers and lawyers'' -- a virtual ''civilian surge'' to fashion a new Afghan economy, train policemen and assist farmers. His goal was a level of societal coherence and governmental functionality never before seen in that mountain redoubt of a country.
At the end of 2010, Obama convened a committee charged with narrowing his Afghan mission to its bare essence and finding a quick passageway to the exits. The committee called itself ''Afghan Good Enough.'' Nation-building was dead; reality had set in. 
This transformation is one element of Obama's global ''education'' captured by David E. Sanger in his penetrating history of the president's effort to grapple with a world in flux and an inherited overseas posture of military swagger. ''Confront and Conceal'' depicts a president whose early months in office revealed his inexperience in the international realm but whose adaptability produced what Sanger calls, perhaps a bit hyperbolically, an ''Obama doctrine.'' He explains: ''When confronted with a direct threat to American security, Obama has shown he is willing to act unilaterally -- in a targeted, get-in-and-get-out fashion, that avoids, at all costs, the kind of messy ground wars and lengthy occupations that have drained America's treasury and spirit for the past decades.''
Sanger cites the Obama-directed raid to kill Osama bin Laden, his expansion of drone strikes into an antiterrorism offensive and the Stuxnet cyberworm he sent into Iran to sabotage that country's nuclear program. (It was Sanger, the chief Washington correspondent for this newspaper, who first revealed that the United States built and unleashed that cyberweapon, in collaboration with Israel.)
But while Obama seems untroubled by the use of force to protect American interests, he remains leery of military action when no national threat exists -- unless, as in Libya, he can get others to do the heavy lifting. ''In an age of reckonings,'' Sanger writes, ''when so many bills have come due, Obama has made the case for an America that can no longer do it all. It must pick its fights.''
Sanger notes that Obama's aggressiveness in protecting American interests angers liberals suspicious of nationalist arrogance, while his implicit rejection of the United States as the world's ''indispensable nation'' angers those who cling to the neoconservative sensibility of the Bush years. But in truth he has positioned himself nicely within a political sweet spot, one where Americans are loath to see their country relinquish its premier global position but wary of unnecessary wars undertaken on wispy rationales.
Sanger traces the development of Obama's foreign policy architecture through a sprightly narrative of his decision making on a host of treacherous challenges -- Afghanistan, Pakistan, Iran, the Arab Awakening and a rising China. We see a man of considerable analytical skill, with a bent toward realism mixed with intermittent traces of Wilsonian sentimentalism (as when he said an American refusal to intervene in Libya would have represented ''a betrayal of who we are'').
But Obama abandoned the Afghan /nation-building mission without any discernible anguish when he saw that, while progress was possible in disputed areas like Kandahar and Marja, the pace of progress was languid, and prospects for holding reclaimed territory were limited. Three months after a Marja offensive, Gen. Stanley McChrystal called the area a ''bleeding ulcer.'' The Army sought to train Afghan officials so they could become a ''government in a box,'' to be transported to areas of need. But whenever the box arrived at its destination, an official explained, ''one guy walked out. And he didn't know how to govern.'' Obama could see that the nation-building endeavor, if stubbornly embraced, would destroy his presidency.
On Iran, Obama initially tried a three-pronged approach of engagement, sanctions and covert action. Engagement died, according to Sanger, when American intelligence, intercepting Ayatollah Khamenei's message traffic, realized he had no intention of giving up his option of building nuclear weaponry. Covert action included the Stuxnet worm but not, Sanger insists, participation in Israel's assassination campaign against Iran's nuclear scientists. The centerpiece remains sanctions, which Obama has ratcheted up into a potent squeeze.
But containment of a nuclear Iran -- the cold war prescription that worked against the Soviet Union for four decades -- is off the table. Sanger writes that even if Obama had entertained such an approach, Israel killed it by threatening a unilateral attack on Iran's nuclear facilities, which would thrust America into a major Mideast war. It was, Sanger says, a ''classic paradox: to stop a war from happening,'' Obama ''had to declare he was willing, as a last resort, to help the Israelis take out Iran's facilities.''
That is, either Iran retreats or there will be war. It is telling, though, that Obama was ''appalled,'' as one aide told Sanger, at Israel's lack of rigor in analyzing what kind of war it would be.
With regard to China, Sanger sees a possible ''Thucydides trap'' -- a reference to the Greek historian's narrative of the clash born of Sparta's fear of Athens's growing military might. ''We are seeing similar themes today,'' he writes, adding that what some perceive as mounting nationalistic fervor in China could lead Beijing to underestimate the American response to Chinese adventures in the South China Sea.
Sanger clearly admires Obama and embraces his fundamental foreign policy, which he sees as based on a carefully calibrated mixture of realism and humanitarianism. But Sanger's humanitarian impulse is stronger than Obama's, and he carps a bit when he feels the president doesn't sufficiently share it -- as in his cautious response to the 2009 street protests against the Iranian regime, or his initial reluctance to abandon Hosni Mubarak during the early days of the uprising in Egypt. But any Obama expressions of support for the Iranian protesters, as some administration officials argued, could have undercut their cause, and the president's eventual efforts to nudge Mubarak aside have devastated relations with Saudi Arabia and other Gulf allies, while not particularly enhancing American influence with the Egyptians.
Overshadowing such matters is the far more significant question of America's role in an unstable world. Can Obama or his successor respond to the country's challenges, external and domestic, without generating perceptions that it is in retreat? ''Obama's challenge,'' Sanger writes, ''is to convince American allies and adversaries that his strategic shift will bolster American power.''
But will it? That is the question that hovers over America as it continues its halting effort to define itself in the post-cold-war world.

HEADLINE: The New Tug of War Over Medicaid

BYLINE: By TYLER COWEN. 
Tyler Cowen is a professor of economics at George Mason University.

 BODY:
THE new health care law's individual mandate -- the provision pushing people to buy insurance, and upheld last month by the Supreme Court -- has garnered huge attention. But about half the planned expansion of insurance coverage under the new law comes from another source entirely: growth of the Medicaid program.
Yet Medicaid has never been especially popular, and when its expanded role becomes more widely understood, it is likely to become less popular still. 
Medicaid beneficiaries have limited means, and their low incomes usually translate into below-average political influence. The joint federal-state financing of Medicaid reflects its lack of broad support among the more affluent. Neither the federal government nor the states wish to pick up the entire tab, and many state governments -- and not just Republican administrations -- would prefer to spend more on education, roads and other programs. Yet the federal subsidy for Medicaid expenditures keeps many states locked in -- the Feds usually pick up at least half the cost -- at levels they would not have chosen on their own.
Those are signs of a program ripe for cuts, and yet the law is bringing a major Medicaid expansion. Will it stick? The additional federal subsidy is probably high enough to induce most states to expand Medicaid in the short run. (Under the Supreme Court decision, states can back out of the Medicaid expansion and lose only the new federal subsidy rather than all of their Medicaid funds.)
The greater likelihood is that, over time, American voters will rebel against Medicaid and dismantle the subsidies that keep the states locked in, and will prefer instead to spend the money on other programs.
Change might come soon. If Mitt Romney wins the presidential election, and if Republicans control both houses of Congress, they could turn Medicaid into a block grant program, where states can spend the money as they wish.
Even if President Obama is re-elected, some state governments will work hard to reduce the number of people covered by Medicaid. State officials know that limiting Medicaid will place more individuals in the new, subsidized health care exchanges, and that those bills will be paid by the federal government. The basic dynamic is that state and federal governments have opposite incentives as to how many people should be kept in Medicaid.
Of course, we don't know who will win this tug of war. Along the way, we can expect state governments to threaten and bluff their way toward a smaller Medicaid obligation. The current state-level threats not to accept federal dollars to expand Medicaid are arguably part of that game. In any case, as the Medicaid expansion receives more publicity, voters may realize that they want to spend less money on it.
There are several potential outcomes. Along one possible path, Medicaid survives this added scrutiny and grows anyway, perhaps because the federal government takes over more of its funding or federalizes it altogether.
Unfortunately, Medicaid has some of the worst features of single-payer systems. Typically, a single-payer system will bargain down medical prices, thus adding to affordability, but at the risk of having long lines of patients waiting for care. As it stands now, though, the low reimbursement rates of Medicaid already lead to long lines, or an inability to find a good doctor altogether, while the higher reimbursement rates of Medicare and private insurance keep health care costs high.
Along another possible path, the subsidized private insurance market -- a central feature of the new law -- will gradually displace Medicaid. And, eventually, another feature of the law will grow more important: the excise tax on employer-supplied health insurance, which will cover increasing numbers of employer-based plans over time. This could be accompanied by a gradual migration out of workplace-based coverage. Over time, the system might evolve toward means-tested private insurance vouchers, with the insurance sold on exchanges rather than tied to employment.
That would have the unfortunate effect of channeling people into what will be the most expensive segment of health care coverage. That's because the new law offers insurance subsidies to eligible incomes up to 400 percent of the current poverty line, a fiscal burden that would be unsustainable if it replaced Medicaid, which, with all its problems, is now the cheapest way to provide basic insurance coverage.
There is one way this might work: by limiting the subsidies for insurance. Note that the law itself mandates cuts if those subsidies exceed a certain percentage of gross domestic product by 2018. Most likely, the reform could not stop there, because the insurance cost burden for many Americans would feel intolerably high without the subsidies.
The next step, therefore, would lower costs by limiting the mandate to covering catastrophic conditions. Yet a further step would remove the mandate for noncatastrophic coverage, thus giving people more control over how much they want to spend on health care versus other priorities.
We would then have government-subsidized and mandated catastrophic insurance, and a freer market for other health care expenditures. We might even return to a health savings account approach on the noncatastrophic side.
That's far from a perfect outcome, but it's probably the most positive path that can be achieved. One problem is that mandates often don't stay modest. Insurance mandates at the state level, for instance, have grown consistently, as various groups push to have their medical priorities reflected in law. A second problem is that voters may ask Congress to remove the subsidy limits planned for 2018, thus allowing costs to escalate. Still, we can hope for the best.
Over all, the new law is a carefully calibrated compromise between Medicaid extensions and subsidies for private insurance. Looking ahead, however, the chosen balance will tip one way or the other. Most of the paths forward are likely to prove unworkable, but one tenable option does exist, albeit very different from what was voted into law.

HEADLINE: Tribes of the Swing States

BYLINE: By TIMOTHY EGAN. 
Thomas L. Friedman and Nicholas D. Kristof are off today.

 BODY:
WHAT'S little known, and certainly unmentioned on the campaign trail, is what Barack Obama and Mitt Romney have in common. Both have family histories with polygamy. Both had fathers born in foreign countries. Both went to Harvard. Both are wealthy.
Taken together, it's a narrow niche; there aren't enough rich Harvard grads with multiple-wife family albums and a bit of foreign otherness to fill the car elevators in Romney's beach manse. Which leaves both candidates working the margins of different demographic fields. Mormons and African-Americans are taken. Same with passionate liberals and fist-pumping conservatives. The rural vote is pretty much all Romney's, and urban hearts belong to Obama. 
Romney can count on the often inchoate grudge block, people who vote against somebody, rather than for -- a large part of the Republican base this year. Obama has certainly angered Wall Street, Southern whites and no small number of conservative Roman Catholics.
But Romney has a longer list of people who may be disinclined to vote for him. Latinos. Gays. Gay soldiers. People who were bullied as kids. Dog lovers. People who like sex. People who use contraception during sex. People who want ''free stuff,'' as Romney classified those without health care on Wednesday. People who believe in science.
In sum, Romney needs voters who aren't just ''a bunch of old, white guys,'' as the Republican strategist Ed Rollins said a few days ago, ''fat like me.''
Obama was casting for another tribe during his recent swing through the swing states. In the small town of Parma, Ohio, looking into a crowd of mostly white, middle-aged folks, he mentioned that he'd just had a beer on a hot day, and then said, ''When I see your kids, I see my kids,'' and, ''When I see your grandparents, I see my grandparents.''
He had said a strikingly similar thing months ago when talking about Trayvon Martin, the black teenager shot in Florida. ''If I had a son, he'd look like Trayvon.'' Then, he was talking about race. So, of course his kids don't look like the tweens of small-town Parma. But he's putting himself in another tribe, those disgusted by a man with Swiss bank accounts and four homes who still paid a lower tax rate than an Ohio firefighter.
Obama personalized this reach later in Pittsburgh, with a story about his humble family outings. ''I remember my favorite vacation when I was a kid, traveling with my mom and my grandma and my sister, and we traveled the country on Greyhound buses, railroads, and once in a while we'd rent a car, not that often, and stay at Howard Johnson's.''
Buses, trains, HoJos? It's a throwback image, but it conjures memories of finding joy in small pleasures just off the Interstate. ''Didn't matter how big the pool was; if there was a pool, I'd jump in. I was 11 years old, and I was excited just to go to the vending machine and get the ice bucket and get the ice.''
The calculation was obvious, at a time when the airwaves were saturated with pictures of Romney and his motorized water toys along the gilded shore of Lake Winnipesaukee.
The two images -- rich guy on a Jet Ski, skinny kid with Grandma at the Howard Johnson's pool -- tell you why Obama continues to hold a narrow lead in most of the swing states, despite the terrible economy. People don't mind rich politicians; 75 percent of voters in a Gallup poll last week said Romney's wealth would not be a factor.
But a significant number are bothered by people who fetishize their wealth or use tricks (like offshore tax havens) to avoid the burdens of normal citizens. In that Gallup poll, one in five independents, a crucial block, said Romney's wealth made them less likely to vote for him.
The pictures of Romney and his fellow suits at Bain Capital ravenously stuffing bills in their mouths and pockets is repulsive for the same reason that almost two-thirds of Americans have an unfavorable view of the Romney surrogate Donald Trump.
This is as much about crass warfare as class warfare. The Romney who made fun of Nascar fans in see-through plastic rain slickers or insulted the small-town cookie makers is the person Mike Huckabee was referring to when he said voters don't want their candidate ''to look like the guy who laid them off.'' A plutocrat should never preen.
In most of the swing states, two of Obama's core constituencies -- college grads and Latinos -- have increased as a share of the electorate. White, blue-collar men -- a group that gave only 40 percent of its vote nationwide to Obama in 2008 -- are shrinking as a percentage.
This is the tribe that Obama has to connect with if he expects to win a second term. They fill their beer coolers with motel ice, because it saves a couple of bucks, and are looking for a president who has their back.

HEADLINE: Leading Role in Obama '08, but Backstage in '12

BYLINE: By JODI KANTOR and NICHOLAS CONFESSORE; Kitty Bennett contributed research.

 BODY:
At first glance, the party that Penny Pritzker hosted last month in Chicago could have passed for an Obama reunion. Her modernist home and sculpture garden had been the site of Obama fund-raising events over the years, and the guests that night included presidential allies like Rahm Emanuel, chief of staff turned Chicago mayor, and Warren E. Buffett.
But the party was for a Goldman Sachs-sponsored small-business program, not the Obama campaign, and much of the political chatter focused on Mr. Emanuel. By night's end, some guests wondered: had Barack Obama's most important donor, the true believer whose support had helped power him to the United States Senate and the White House, moved on?
Ms. Pritzker's commitment has become a matter of mystery and consternation among some Obama supporters struggling to recreate the success of the 2008 finance team that she led as chairwoman. Though she is assisting with the re-election campaign in a number of ways, Ms. Pritzker -- whose family owns the Hyatt hotel chain and is active in charitable and Jewish causes -- is less visible, has cut back on fund-raising and has told friends that she is intentionally doing less. 
Some donors have taken that as a signal -- or used it as an excuse -- to scale back, according to those involved in fund-raising, even as the president's fund-raising pace lags behind that of his Republican rival, Mitt Romney.
''Donors have asked, 'Where's Penny?' '' said Andy Spahn, a Democratic consultant in Los Angeles who works with prominent Hollywood supporters. ''We have called her and not gotten callbacks.''
Ms. Pritzker is engaged in new business ventures, and fellow Obama donors say she could not be expected to repeat her tireless efforts from 2008. But interviews with dozens of donors, friends, and campaign and former White House officials show that virtually from the moment of Mr. Obama's election, the golden relationship between the two became more complicated.
For Ms. Pritzker, her high-profile backing of Mr. Obama came at an unexpectedly bitter cost. Their relationship made her a punching bag for the labor movement, which targeted her for what union officials call exploitative practices toward housekeepers by the Hyatt hotels.
She had drawn business and Jewish leaders to support Mr. Obama, but when many of them turned hostile toward the president because of his policies, some directed their ire toward her, even though she had her own criticisms, too.
The anger amounted to a ''triple assault'' on Ms. Pritzker, said William M. Daley, who succeeded Mr. Emanuel as chief of staff. ''She's borne the brunt of a lot of the attacks,'' he said.
''Often the big picture is not understood on where the president wants to go,'' Ms. Pritzker said in a telephone interview. ''That's frustrating.''
For Mr. Obama, Ms. Pritzker's wealth and business experience are huge assets but also potential liabilities. He considered nominating her for commerce secretary but did not, because her fortune risked making her radioactive. She does plan to join him on the campaign trail this month, but that could prove awkward, given that the president is pounding Mr. Romney for some of the same practices of which Ms. Pritzker or her family business is accused -- housing significant wealth in offshore trusts and treating workers poorly.
Ms. Pritzker is still loyal but weary, those close to her say, and she has learned a tough lesson: it is extremely difficult for the president of the United States to be a good friend.
''There is a huge unresolved set of issues in the Democratic Party between people of wealth and people who work,'' said Andy Stern, the former president of the Service Employees International Union. ''Penny is a living example of that issue.''
Crucial Help
Without Penny Pritzker, it is unlikely that Barack Obama ever would have been elected to the United States Senate or the presidency. When she first backed him during his 2004 Senate run, she was No. 152 on the Forbes list of the wealthiest Americans. He was a long-shot candidate who needed her support and imprimatur. Mr. Obama and Ms. Pritzker grew close, sometimes spending weekends with their families at her summer home.
Ms. Pritzker, 53, is an heiress who hates being called an heiress, friends say, a woman who wants to be known for more than her family's fortune. She has earned law and business degrees at Stanford, steered her family's hotel, real estate and financial businesses while starting new ones, participated in too many Chicago civic charities to name, and for fun, run triathlons (she sprained her ankle early in one Ironman race but still finished).
In 2008, she poured that energy and grit into putting Mr. Obama in the White House. Democrats often have rocky relationships with corporate interests, but Ms. Pritzker helped forge an unlikely bond between Mr. Obama, a former community organizer, and bankers, entrepreneurs and executives. For most of 2007, Mr. Obama trailed Hillary Rodham Clinton in polls, and yet his candidacy survived in large part because of the money collected by Ms. Pritzker and her team.
She wanted to be commerce secretary, friends say. But shortly after Election Day, while she was still raising money for Mr. Obama -- more than $53 million for his inauguration, on top of the $745 million for the campaign -- she withdrew from consideration. (She and campaign officials say it was her choice; others say the president-elect had no interest in a confirmation fight at a time of public anger over the advantages of wealth.)
A bank owned in part by her family had been so mired in toxic subprime loans that the Pritzkers and other owners eventually paid a $460 million settlement to the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation. And her nearly $2 billion fortune exploits a network of trusts, including some held offshore, to minimize tax liabilities.
''Penny is realistic'' and understood the political realities, said Laura D'Andrea Tyson, a former chief economist to President Bill Clinton.
Still eager to contribute, she traveled to Washington for even minor White House events and served on two economic advisory boards. Her most successful contribution was to foster partnerships between community colleges and businesses.
But some other projects she took on made her ''frustrated beyond belief,'' in the words of a friend.
''Penny experienced what most people experience when they come from the outside,'' Mr. Daley said. ''If it doesn't originate in the bowels of the White House or somewhere else in government, there's an aversion to it.''
To counter accusations that Mr. Obama was unfriendly to business, she quizzed White House officials for updates and statistics. ''Penny masters the facts,'' said Marty Nesbitt, a close Obama friend who started a business with Ms. Pritzker.
Even as she served as emissary, she expressed private frustration with what she called the White House's lack of responsiveness and harsh tone about wealth and corporate greed, according to friends.
A Target for Labor
Ms. Pritzker never complained publicly, but she delivered the message to White House officials. She tries to give ''the president or his advisers a perspective -- what I'm hearing, what I'm seeing, how people are reacting -- so that they can take that into consideration,'' she said. In an e-mail, David Plouffe, a senior White House adviser, emphasized how much the president valued her counsel and friendship.
To fellow Obama allies back in Chicago, she would sometimes roll her eyes, saying she was trying to break through. ''Well, I've tried,'' she told them.
Ms. Pritzker would also have liked a connection with the president beyond economic policy and fund-raising, several friends said. Mr. Obama has invited only a handful of friends to Camp David, the presidential retreat in Maryland; when asked if she was among them, she said she had all the attention she needs.
''Personal time with a president of the United States could be a five-minute sidebar conversation,'' Ms. Pritzker said. ''The idea that we're going to hang out -- it's certainly not my nature, nor is it his.''
As far back as 2007, Mr. Obama recognized that his relationship with Ms. Pritzker could be tricky; when he asked her to be his national finance chairwoman, he called labor leaders to alert them, they later said in interviews.
A standoff between labor and Hyatt hotels had been brewing for years over working conditions for housekeepers. By 2009, union officials decided to target Ms. Pritzker because of her ties to the president.
''We thought that a person who would spend so much time raising money for a person who cares about working people as much as Obama'' would treat low-level workers better, said John Wilhelm, president of Unite Here, the union that has led the fight.
Henry Tamarin, president of Unite Here Local 1 in Chicago, helped create a devastating campaign against Ms. Pritzker, even though she was just one member of the family and organization. He hired an impersonator who walked the picket line handing out plastic coins and shouting ''Get back to work! Penny needs her billions!'' according to The Chicago Tribune.
In September, after Hyatt fired 100 housekeepers at nonunion hotels near Boston and replaced them with low-wage subcontractors, labor organizers flew a fired worker to confront Ms. Pritzker at a public appearance in Chicago. As she served on White House councils alongside Richard L. Trumka, the A.F.L.-C.I.O. president, his organization released a video that cast her as a villainess who hurt rather than helped the economy.
Hyatt defends its labor practices, saying that the average tenure of its housekeepers is 12 years and that Unite Here has refused to settle.
''I feel a personal connection with the employees at the hotel company,'' Ms. Pritzker said in the interview. ''The union attacks -- it hurts. I don't like it. It should be an issue between Hyatt and the unions, not become something personal to me.''
The architects of Ms. Pritzker's troubles are not strangers to the president. Mr. Obama benefited from Mr. Tamarin's early endorsement in the Senate and presidential campaigns and walked a picket line with him at a non-Hyatt hotel in 2007. Mr. Tamarin's son Nate works at the White House as a liaison to labor. Even as the elder Mr. Tamarin was waging his campaign against Ms. Pritzker, he sat at the president's table at a White House state dinner.
Labor leaders say the White House never asked them to ease up on Ms. Pritzker. Some of her Chicago friends complain that he could have encouraged a quiet resolution, but others say that any such intervention would have been inappropriate.
New Pressures
Now that Mr. Obama is in danger of being outspent by Mr. Romney and his allies, the pressure on Ms. Pritzker to increase her efforts is mounting. Some potential donors want to speak only to her, other fund-raisers say. She and a handful of others recently began recruiting high-ranking business executives to serve as Obama surrogates, writing opinion articles and speaking to the news media about the president.
Like many of Mr. Obama's wealthiest donors, she has not given to the ''super PAC'' supporting him, saying she objects to the Supreme Court's Citizens United decision, which paved the way for unlimited fund-raising by outside groups.
Many in the party now believe that Mr. Obama's fate could turn on large checks from Ms. Pritzker and others like her to the outside groups. And even some of her friends believe she may yet find herself pulled into the money race at an entirely new level.
''Penny wants to win,'' Mr. Nesbitt said.
Correction: July 22, 2012, Sunday
This article has been revised to reflect the following correction: An article last Sunday about Penny Pritzker, who managed fund-raising for the 2008 Obama campaign, gave an incomplete name for a union that has criticized her over the labor practices of the Hyatt hotel chain, which her family owns. It is Unite Here, not simply Unite.

HEADLINE: U.S. Spends Too Much, Taxes Too Little. Neither Candidate Has Offered a Real Solution

BYLINE: ALBERT R. HUNT


HIGHLIGHT: The right says Washington spends too much. The left says it taxes too little. Historical and global comparisons suggest both are right, although to different degrees. 

 BODY:
WASHINGTON - American conservatives say the country's fiscal crisis is caused by too much government spending; liberals say it's caused by too little revenue.
Both are right.
Federal outlays this year are estimated to be about 24 percent of the gross domestic product; this is the highest since World War II levels. Federal tax receipts for the fiscal year are expected to be about 15 percent of G.D.P. This is about the same as the previous three years - the lowest level since 1950.
From 1980 to 2000, federal outlays averaged about 21.5 percent and receipts about 18.5 percent of G.D.P. The gap, or the budget shortfall, averaged around 3 percent of G.D.P., or one third the current level.
The clear, though oft-rejected explanation, is the American government is overspending and undertaxing.
 How about compared to the rest of the world? America again is under taxed. In 2010, according to the Organization for Economic Co-Operation and Development, tax revenues were a little less than a quarter of GDP.
 Some of those higher-tax countries - in Europe, for example - are doing worse than the U.S. economy. But one of the very highest-taxed countries, Sweden, where taxes equal about 45 percent of G.D.P., expects a 3 percent growth rate this year, a 7.5 percent average unemployment rate (lower than the United States), and a balanced budget.
In my latest Page Two column I explain that If Mr. Obama and Mr. Romney believe this is a big-stakes election, they should show it by presenting a specific budget/tax deficit-reduction plan so Americans can compare and contrast and discuss and debate before they vote.

HEADLINE: Romney Faces Mounting Attacks on Bain and Taxes

BYLINE: BRIAN KNOWLTON


HIGHLIGHT: Even Republicans are calling for Mitt Romney to be more upfront on his past tax returns. 

 BODY:
Top surrogates for President Obama on Sunday shrugged off Mitt Romney's demand for a presidential apology for campaign attacks and instead hammered at Mr. Romney's business record, accused his former firm of shipping American jobs overseas, suggested he might be hiding damaging information and renewed demands that he release more back tax returns.
The withering attacks appeared to knock the Romney campaign off stride, at least temporarily, as it seeks to shift the national discussion back from a debate about the former governor's business instincts, extensive wealth and complicated tax history to the tepid growth of jobs and the economy under Mr. Obama. And even some Republicans called for Mr. Romney to release more tax returns.
One Obama surrogate, Mayor Rahm Emanuel of Chicago, a former White House chief of staff, offered a blunt suggestion to Mr. Romney, who said on Friday that the attacks on him and the private equity firm he once headed, Bain Capital, were "beneath the dignity of the presidency."
 "I give him his own advice," Mr. Emanuel said on ABC's "This Week": "stop whining."
Ed Gillespie, a senior adviser to the Romney campaign, was equally scathing, however, in describing what he said were the "completely reckless and unfounded allegations" coming from the Obama side.
"We now know that this president will say or do anything to keep the highest office in the land," Mr. Gillespie said on CNN's "State of the Union," "even if it means demeaning the highest office in the land."
Thus the presidential campaign remained at an acrimonious pass, with a tight race in the polls -- a new survey in the biggest battleground state, Florida, found a dead heat there -- and each side clamoring to define the other in the most negative fashion. 
Mr. Romney had demanded an apology for what he called "absurd" allegations by the president over whether Mr. Romney's record included outsourcing jobs. Days of goading by the Obama campaign had suggested that Mr. Romney might even have broken the law by lying on a Securities and Exchange Commission filing about the years when he led Bain. 
On the Sunday television talk shows, Mr. Romney's surrogates fended off questions about why, if Bain's S.E.C. filings listed him as its chief executive from 1999 to 2003, he should not be held responsible for job outsourcing by companies that it controlled in that period, and why he has rejected increasing calls for him to release more tax returns.
Mr. Gillespie said that after Mr. Romney took a leave of absence from Bain in 1999 to head the troubled Salt Lake City Olympics organization, he had nothing to do with Bain management. The Olympics effort was a "16-hour-a-day job," Mr. Gillespie said, and Mr. Romney "retired retroactively to February of 1999 as a result."
Mr. Romney's insistence that he had no decision-making role at Bain after 1999 drew vocal support on Sunday from a former managing director there, Edward Conard.
Because Mr. Romney was so intimately involved in the company's founding and development, Mr. Conard said on MSNBC, "we had a very complicated set of negotiations that took us about two years to unwind" the Romney role.
"During that time, a management team ran the firm, and we could hardly even get Mitt to come back to negotiate the terms of his departure, because he was working so hard on the Olympics," he said.
While conceding that Mr. Romney "legally" remained the firm's chief executive, Mr. Conard said he did not remember Mr. Romney's taking part in any meetings.
As the Obama campaign continued to press Mr. Romney to release more years of his tax returns and be more transparent about his personal finances, his representatives said he had done everything to comply with the law by releasing his 2010 return and an estimate of his 2011 taxes.
Mr. Emanuel suggested that the undisclosed returns could hold only bad news about Mr. Romney's finances, and might even have played a role in Senator John McCain's decision to reject Mr. Romney as a running mate in 2008 and turn instead to Sarah Palin. Mr. Romney gave Mr. McCain's team 23 years of returns.
 "The Romney campaign isn't stupid," Mr. Emanuel said. "They have decided that it's better to get attacked on a lack of transparency, lack of accountability to the American people, versus telling you what's in those taxes."
Some Republicans have joined the call for a broader release of tax returns, including the former Mississippi governor Haley Barbour.
The conservative commentator Bill Kristol said on "Fox News Sunday," "He should release the tax returns tomorrow." He added: "You've got to release 6, 8, 10 years of back tax returns. Take the hit for a day or two."
Matthew Dowd, a Republican political strategist, suggested that Mr. Romney's refusal to release the returns could suggest there was something to hide.
"There's obviously something there, because if there was nothing there, he would say, 'Have at it,'" Mr. Dowd said on "This Week." "So there's obviously something there that compromises what he said in the past about something."
On that same program, the conservative commentator George Will was similarly critical, saying, "I do not know why, given that Mitt Romney knew the day that McCain lost in 2008 that he was going to run for president again, that he didn't get all of this out and tidy up some of his offshore accounts and all the rest."

HEADLINE: The 'Merit-Based Society'

BYLINE: THOMAS B. EDSALL


HIGHLIGHT: The idea of an 'opportunity society' may appear reasonable on the surface, but what Mitt Romney is really calling for is a society that rewards relentless competitors and disregards the losers. 

 BODY:
Mitt Romney is an evangelist for capitalism.
"Free enterprise is still the greatest force for upward mobility, economic security, and the expansion of the middle class," Romney declared last week at the N.A.A.C.P. convention in Houston. "As president, I will show the good things that can happen when we have more free enterprise - more business activity, more jobs, more opportunity, more paychecks, more savings accounts."
In a speech in Washington in December, Romney described his ideal society:
In a merit-based society, people achieve success and rewards through hard work, education, risk taking, and even a little luck. The founders considered this principle to be one endowed by our Creator, and called it the 'pursuit of happiness.' We call it opportunity, or we call it the freedom to choose our course in life. A merit-based, opportunity society gathers and creates a citizenry that pioneers, that invents, that builds and creates. And as these people exert the effort and take the risks inherent in invention and creation, they employ and lift the rest of us, creating prosperity for us all. The rewards they earn do not make the rest of us poorer, they make us better off.
Merit has been traditionally equated with intelligence, industriousness, educational attainment, creativity and competency. In a meritocracy, formal qualifications provide opportunity, position is no longer ascribed by birth, and rewards flow to those who excel.
The rise of meritocratic competition as the preeminent means of social stratification in America has been hailed as a welcome advance because it replaced a society dominated by an upper class dependent on inherited wealth and status. The transition to meritocracy has, however, had unintended consequences. In the business sector, particularly, other less benign qualities emerge as essential to meritocratic success: aggressiveness, ruthlessness, dominance-seeking, victimizing behavior, acquisitiveness and the disciplined pursuit of self-interest.
Over the past two decades, newly minted corporate titans have used political power to minimize taxation on their principal sources of income, winning preferential rates on capital gains and dividends - and have nearly eliminated taxation on the intergenerational transfer of wealth, brilliantly exploiting the term "death tax."
One industry in particular - the financial sector - has used its power to gain an enormous advantage at public expense persuading the government to dismantle much of the federal regulatory structure. The Financial Crisis Inquiry Commission, a 10-member bipartisan panel appointed in 2009 by congressional leaders of both parties, reported in January 2011 that "from 1997 to 2008, the financial sector expended $2.7 billion in reported federal lobbying expenses; individuals and political action committees in the sector made more that $1 billion in campaign contributions" to achieve what the commission described as "deregulation redux."
Richard Freeman, an economist at Harvard, argued in an email to the Times that a merit based system can quickly convert into an entrenched hierarchy as a result of the accumulation of excessive wealth and income:
The greatest danger is that high inequality creates a society in which wealthy 'crony capitalists' dominate corporate and government policies and use their wealth to subvert market competition and to corrupt democracy in order to maintain their position atop the income hierarchy.
Campaign contributions are among the most important weapons deployed by new corporate elites. The finance industry, for example, has given more money, $19 million, to the Romney campaign than any other sector, quadrupling its nearest competitor, real estate, which contributed 4.8 million.
At an extreme, the predatory aspect of "meritocratic" corporate competition is illustrated by the scandals of Enron and WorldCom, by the insider trading convictions of Raj Rajaratnam and Rajat Gupta, and by the fraudulent schemes of Allen Stanford and Bernie Madoff.
At a more mundane level, the use of campaign contributions by those who have become wealthy in an "opportunity society" to protect predatory practices can be seen in recent donations by payday loan and auto-title lending companies, which are often located near military bases. Bloomberg Businessweek reported a surge in contributions from these firms to Romney's super PAC, Restore Our Future, from mid-January through the end of February 2012. The contributions followed Romney's denunciation on January 4th of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau - which is preparing to regulate the payday loan industry and other "non-bank" lenders - as "perhaps the most powerful and unaccountable bureaucracy in the history of our nation." Businessweek wrote that from "January 13 to February 29, payday and auto-title lenders contributed $427,500 to Restore Our Future."
One payday loan company, Advance America, gave the super PAC $25,000. On its web site, Advance America outlines the terms of its loans in different states. In Alabama, a $500 loan carries an $87.50 fee, which must be paid off at the next payday. This translates into an annual interest rate of 456.25 percent, according to the firm's web site. In Texas, a $500 loan carries a $102.27 fee, or an annual interest rate of 533.30 percent.
In findings that parallel those of Harvard's Richard Freeman, Martin Gilens, a political scientist at Princeton, conducted a study of the relative influence of voters at the top, middle and bottom of the income distribution over policy decisions made by elected officials.
Policy outcomes are more strongly related to the preferences of the well off than those of the poor or the middle class. But the extent of this "representational inequality" is staggering: when preferences of low or middle income Americans diverge from those of the affluent, there is virtually no relationship between policy outcomes and the desires of these less advantaged groups. In contrast, affluent Americans' preferences exhibit a substantial relationship with policy outcomes whether their preferences are shared by lower income groups or not.
Campaign contributions, according to Gilens, are highly correlated with the leverage of the affluent over policy. "Most of the money donated to political candidates, parties, and interest organizations comes from Americans at the top of the economic ladder," he writes. "The top-heavy pattern of political donations conforms to the top-heavy nature of representational inequality."
Not only would Romney's tax, regulatory and spending proposals reinforce the leverage over public policy now exercised by the affluent, but he would leave untouched the post-Citizens United campaign finance regime that gives corporations, unions and billionaires unlimited opportunities to shape election outcomes.
Nor would Romney reform the Washington lobbying community that now amounts to a fourth branch of government, staffed by former Senators, Congressmen and executive branch officials, who work for clients equipped to pay fees of $200,000 or more a year.
The overwhelming majority of the $3.3 billion spent annually on lobbying goes to preserve and expand the market-distorting corporate "rents" granted by Congress and the executive branch, ranging from agribusiness subsidies to an array of special breaks that allow companies like G.E. to pay little or no federal tax.
Romney has no incentive to initiate reform - he is a major beneficiary of the system as it is.
The super PACs enabled by Citizens United and related lower-court decisions are overwhelmingly tilted in Romney's favor and supportive of the Republican Party in general: Conservative super PACs have so far spent $125 million, while liberal groups have spent less than a third of that, $35.2 million.
Romney's top ten lobbyist-bundlers, in turn, have raised a total of $2.6 million for his campaign so far. Their clients include Barclays, which is now in the middle of an interest rate fixing scandal, and Microsoft, which has been the defendant in anti-trust litigation in the United States and in Europe.
The other side of the coin? Take a look at Pennsylvania, where 130,000 people, including 89,000 children, were cut from the Medicaid rolls between August 2011 and January 2012, a development that exemplifies the weak influence the poor exercise over policy. These cuts in health care, which affected both the poor and the disabled, resulted from the efforts last year of Republican Governor Tom Corbett and his welfare secretary, Gary Alexander, to "crack down on waste, fraud, and abuse," according to the Philadelphia Inquirer. Many of the cuts followed a controversial letter from the Pennsylvania Department of Public Welfare to Medicaid recipients last summer requiring additional paperwork within 15 days. According to the Philadelphia Daily News, "It appeared that if the paperwork was not then received and processed in time, those enrolled were dropped - even if the delay was the fault of D.P.W."
As reasonable as Romney's endorsement of a "merit-based opportunity society" may appear on the surface, what he is really calling for is a society that rewards hard-hearted, relentless competitors and disregards the losers. It is precisely this aspect of his campaign that has made him vulnerable to Democratic attacks.
Romney remains viable (trailing Obama by only 2.4 percent) against a Democratic incumbent hobbled by a stagnant economy and 8.2 percent unemployment. A Republican candidate with a more nuanced understanding of the hardships of those left behind by the meritocratic elite would arguably win in a walk.
Romney, however, is the willing prisoner of a radically evolving Republican Party, a party perhaps best described by Thomas Mann and Norman Ornstein in their recent book, "It's Even Worse Than It Looks: How the American Constitutional System Collided With the New Politics of Extremism":
One of the two major parties, the Republican Party, has become an insurgent outlier -ideologically extreme; contemptuous of the inherited social and economic policy regime; scornful of compromise; unpersuaded by conventional understanding of facts, evidence, and science; and dismissive of the legitimacy of its political opposition. When one party moves this far from the center of American politics, it is extremely difficult to enact policies responsive to the country's most pressing challenges.

HEADLINE: Concessions Entangle Universal's Bid for EMI

BYLINE: By BEN SISARIO

 BODY:
The endgame in the music industry's most controversial deal will begin this week in Brussels.
There, executives of the Universal Music Group will meet with members of the European Commission to discuss concessions to Universal's $1.9 billion bid for EMI's record labels.
The deal, which would give Universal a global market share of about 40 percent, has been loudly criticized by rivals and consumer advocates, who worry that such concentration could hurt artists and fans. 
But for Universal and its parent company, the troubled French conglomerate Vivendi, a more immediate concern is that this week's discussions will effectively set the value of the deal itself.
When Universal bought EMI from Citigroup last November, the label assumed all regulatory risk in the deal, agreeing to pay more than 80 percent of the price by September, whether the deal was approved by regulators or not. (In the United States, the Federal Trade Commission is investigating the deal.)
The review in Europe has been tougher than expected, with regulators rejecting some of Universal's core arguments, including its assertion that online piracy would keep the enlarged company in check.
To win approval, Universal is expected to sell pieces of EMI or its own catalogs. Universal had been largely silent about this possibility until last week, when its chairman, Lucian Grainge, told The Financial Times, ''I'm extremely open-minded about working with the commission in the context of behavioral remedies as well as divestitures.''
For media analysts, the critical question now is not just whether Universal will divest assets, but whether it will have to sell so many that the deal will no longer be attractive.
''There's no question that we expect that these divestitures will erode some of the potential values and synergies,'' said Tuna N. Amobi of Standard & Poor's Equity Research. ''The only question is how much value will be eroded.''
Universal, formed through mergers in the 1990s, is the largest of the four major record companies; EMI, with roots in 19th-century Britain, is the smallest. But EMI's catalog includes jewels by the Beatles, the Beach Boys and Frank Sinatra, as well as more recent hits by Norah Jones and Lady Antebellum.
According to two people who had been briefed on the negotiations but were not authorized to speak publicly, two likely EMI divestments are Virgin Records and EMI Classics. To appease regulators, Universal could either offer European rights to music under those labels, or sell the labels outright. Another likely spinoff is EMI's distribution rights to the independent label Mute, the sources said.
EMI's music publishing holdings were sold for $2.2 billion to an investor group led by Sony; that deal, seen as less troubling to regulators, closed last month.
The music industry, which 15 years ago had six major labels, has consolidated in the last decade as it has been transformed by the shift to digital media. Today it is essential for labels to maintain vast song catalogs, as leverage in negotiating with digital services and to extend the traditional risk economics of the industry, in which the failures of the many are subsidized by the hits of the few.
Samina Karim, an assistant professor at the Boston University School of Management who specializes in mergers, likened it to the model of the pharmaceutical industry. ''Most drugs don't make it through efficacy trials, and most artists do not make hits,'' she said. ''In both industries, they want to have more to gamble with in order to cover their losses.''
For Universal, whose price for EMI was seven times earnings, the value of the deal could drop significantly if it is forced to sell assets at low prices, therefore losing expected efficiencies. According to rough calculations by commentators, a divestment of 10 to 15 percent of EMI's catalogs could cost Universal as much as $400 million. A Universal spokesman declined to comment for this article.
The success of the EMI deal is also critical to Vivendi. Stock in that company is near a nine-year low. Last month, its chief executive, Jean-Bernard Levy, stepped down in a boardroom struggle. Like Mr. Levy, Jean-Rene Fourtou, the chairman, is said to support the merger.
Universal's unusual deal to assume all regulatory risk is now seen as a liability, but many analysts said the company probably had no choice, given the music industry's past regulatory challenges.
The Warner Music Group, a Universal rival that has lobbied hard against the Universal-EMI merger, has tried to merge with EMI several times only to be rebuffed by regulators. When Sony Music made a deal to merge with BMG's record divisions in 2004, it went through two long rounds of regulatory review in Europe before gaining final approval.
''There was no way that Citi would agree to sell to the market leader, in a sector where in the past regulators have been extremely skeptical about consolidation, without Universal taking on the risk of the transaction,'' said Claudio Aspesi, an analyst at Sanford C. Bernstein & Company in London.
Universal must propose remedies for the European Commission's concerns by Wednesday. The proposal could include divestments and so-called behavioral remedies like changes to licensing contracts. The commission's deadline to rule is Sept. 6, although it could decide earlier. The F.T.C., whose investigation is not public, is also expected to rule in coming weeks.
For Universal, the least painful course would be to sell rights to its music only in Europe, where in some countries its combined market share would creep above 50 percent. That could satisfy regulators' concerns about cultural diversity. But Universal may be required to sell worldwide rights, as Sony did to win approval for its EMI publishing deal.
Either way, Universal is betting that the long-term value of EMI's songs will outweigh any short-term losses, even if they run high.
''It's clear that it's better for them to engage with the regulators and sell perhaps more than they had originally intended,'' said Omar Sheikh, a media analyst at Credit Suisse. ''They'd much rather the deal be approved than not.''

HEADLINE: Pressure Rises on Con Ed and Union to Resolve Dispute

BYLINE: By PATRICK McGEEHAN

 BODY:
With another heat wave bearing down on New York City, the pressure is rising on Con Edison and its biggest union to resolve a contract dispute that has left 8,000 utility workers locked out of their jobs for more than two weeks.
Representatives of the two sides met again on Saturday at a hotel near La Guardia Airport but failed to reach an agreement on the changes in pension and health care benefits that the company is demanding. Despite increasing pressure from elected officials to end the lockout before the summer heat causes a major power failure or one of the replacement workers is seriously injured, neither side has budged. 
Con Ed did accede to ''public pressure'' on Sunday by reinstating health insurance for the members of Local 1-2 of the Utility Workers Union of America, a company spokesman said. The workers have been collecting unemployment benefits for two weeks but had to pay for their own prescription medicine and doctor visits because the company cut off health coverage when the old contract expired, at midnight June 30.
The reinstatement suggested that Con Ed officials feared that public sentiment might be turning against the company. Last week, Christine C. Quinn, the City Council speaker, shifted her stance, saying the company should end the lockout without a pledge from the union to provide three days' notice before going on strike.
Since July 1, about 5,000 managers and some retired workers have been keeping the electrical grid operating and making repairs when equipment breaks, the utility has said. Yet the biggest test of that contingency plan is expected to come on Tuesday, Wednesday and Thursday, when temperatures are expected to rise into the 90s.
''We think the union leadership needs to stop watching the Weather Channel and stay focused on getting a contract for its members at the bargaining table, or at the very least getting their employees back to work,'' said Michael Clendenin, a spokesman for Con Ed.
Negotiations were scheduled to resume on Monday. So far, the union has balked at the company's proposal to offer a different pension plan to any new hires. Local 1-2's members have a plan that provides a defined benefit upon retirement. The company stopped offering a defined-benefit plan to new managers in 2001, putting in its place a cash-balance plan, which has more predictable costs. It wants to do the same for the union workers.
Con Ed also wants to increase the share of health insurance costs that the workers shoulder to 24 percent, from 17 percent, over four years. It has offered to raise wages by 10 percent over the course of the next four-year contract.
Union officials said that the replacement workers are not prepared for the sort of cascading power failures that midweek heat waves can set off. They have been staging protests outside the company's equipment yards in Astoria, Queens, and elsewhere, hoping that other unionized workers will refuse to help Con Ed's managers move big pieces of hardware.
But Con Ed spokesmen have given assurances to elected officials that they could avert a disastrous failure without the union members. ''We went through two heat waves already and we've had no major problems,'' Mr. Clendenin said.
Union officials have also called for an intervention by state utility regulators. The Public Service Commission has responded by giving Con Ed until Tuesday to respond to a petition from the union that asked regulators to investigate the quality of service Con Ed is providing during the lockout, and how much it is charging for it. The union argued that Con Ed would bill its customers for union labor when it was not being provided.
The union also called for Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo to press the regulators to demand that Con Ed end the lockout. But Josh Vlasto, a spokesman for Mr. Cuomo, said the governor did not have that authority.
Mr. Vlasto disputed the notion, mentioned by some union officials, that Mr. Cuomo, a Democrat, had not been more active in trying to resolve the dispute because Con Ed gave $250,000 to the Committee to Save New York, an organization that raised $17 million to support Mr. Cuomo's policy agenda in Albany. The union gave about $17,000 to Mr. Cuomo's election campaign.
''Both Con Ed and the union supported and directly donated to the governor,'' Mr. Vlasto said. ''The governor and his administration has urged both sides to resolve the lockout as soon as possible.''

HEADLINE: Who's Got the Lock on Happiness?

 BODY:
To the Editor:
In ''Why Conservatives Are Happier Than Liberals'' (Sunday Review, July 8), Arthur C. Brooks suggests that conservatism leads to happiness -- at least for most Americans. But there's more to this interesting story.
Much research implies that happiness depends on brain chemistry (the pharmaceutical industry thinks so) and might, to some extent, be hard-wired. So maybe happiness makes us conservative, not vice versa. 
It's logical that happy Americans would be suspicious of change: that they'd be conservative. And that unhappy Americans, wanting to feel happier, would prefer change: that they'd be liberal.
Or maybe some unhappy Americans are unhappy because America is relatively conservative: that conservatism by some breeds unhappiness in others. The happiest countries (according to the World Happiness Report, Denmark, Norway, Finland and the Netherlands) are more liberal than America.
Presumably, many people manage to be both happy and liberal, at least by our standards.
ROB ROWAN Dorado, P.R., July 8, 2012
The writer is a biologist.
To the Editor:
Arthur C. Brooks of the American Enterprise Institute didn't mention a critical element: economic class.
He suggests that different rates of marriage and faith are controlling factors, so it's no wonder that conservatives are happier. His implication: If liberals tried a little harder to be moral, they would be happier, and maybe then become conservatives. His alternate ''blissfully ignorant'' theory still assumes that suffering is done by others.
But try to see it from the point of view of the poor and lower middle class. They are less happy because they are less likely to have their basic needs met. They suffer diseases for lack of health insurance, live in violence-plagued neighborhoods, do backbreaking work, have poorer nutrition or can afford less entertainment, education, travel or psychological services.
Is it any wonder that, lacking the basics of life, they advocate liberal economic policies to relieve their own and others' suffering?
MICHAEL STOLL San Francisco, July 9, 2012
To the Editor:
I agree with Arthur C. Brooks that conservatives may be happier than liberals. A parallel may be found in the French society of the 18th century.
Versailles and its gardens may testify to the splendor of life for the French aristocrats; similarly, the palaces in St. Petersburg may testify to the sense of well-being among the Russian nobility. This contentment could not have existed without some of the clergy encouraging the aristocrats to enjoy their status and not be concerned with the misery of the lower classes.
We know how huge upheavals put an end to this obliviousness, but history is replete with lessons not learned.
FREDERICK G. SCHAB Remsenburg, N.Y., July 8, 2012
To the Editor:
Arthur C. Brooks argues that conservatives are happier than liberals in part because of their emphasis on faith. He also argues that their happiness is not explained by ignorance or by an unwillingness to recognize the injustice of economic inequality. He suggests that conservatives are not ignorant of economic inequality; they simply deny that the inequality is unjust.
But the emphasis on faith-based ''knowledge'' among some conservatives has led to an unwillingness to accept reality. Some deny evolution, or that global warming exists, or that bank misbehavior was a major cause of the Great Recession, and so on.
The denial or ignorance of these depressing facts might well explain some of the conservative bliss.
JULIE E. MAYBEE Newark, July 8, 2012
To the Editor:
''Don't Indulge. Be Happy,'' by Elizabeth Dunn and Michael Norton (Sunday Review, July 8), tells us that once you have reached $75,000 a year, earning more doesn't really make you happier.
It may be that ''conservatives are happier than liberals'' because they are more likely to have reached that $75,000 income level.

HEADLINE: A New Look for the Catskills: Don't Forget the Old

 BODY:
To the Editor:
Re ''Seeking to Lure the Crowds Again. But Hold the Borscht'' (news article, July 10):
Was it necessary for all those would-be Catskills entrepreneurs you quoted to denigrate the long-gone but legendary borscht belt? 
In addition to the myriad amenities and attractions of a posh year-round holiday mecca, think about all the future successful doctors, lawyers, accountants and businessmen who worked their way through college as busboys and waiters there.
Or the countless thousands of married couples who first met at a Catskill Mountains hotel, not to mention the glittering cast of celebrated performers who kicked off their careers in those colorful hills.
Rebranding is fine, but one should value tradition and what went before.
JOEL POMERANTZ New York, July 10, 2012
The writer, the public relations director at Grossinger's in the early 1970s, is the author of a book about Jennie Grossinger, who built up the resort.
To the Editor:
Your article was bittersweet. The Catskills were a destination when I was a child and a teenager going to sleepaway camp. It became a pit stop on the way to college.
The attempt to rebrand the area is commendable, but raising $5 million to achieve that seems excessive.
Gambling would help the area, but that process takes too long. It seems to me that the lure of the natural beauty, particularly in these austere times, should be a draw.
You can't bring back the past, but you can create a future. Perhaps the expense of the Hamptons will drive people to the Catskills. As the situation improves, you'll go from the borscht belt to the Porsche belt.
STEVEN A. LUDSIN New York, July 10, 2012
To the Editor:
In the accompanying graphic, ''Catskill Touchstones,'' you refer to The Forward, America's leading independent Jewish newspaper, as essential reading of the past. While we understand the effort at humor -- of course The Forward was a Catskills mainstay for a long time -- it's an unfair swipe.
In these very pages in recent months, you have credited The Forward for our hard-hitting investigative work on sexual abuse in the Orthodox community, cited our report on Israel's use of its gay community in tourism promotions to burnish its human rights image, and picked up our stories on the Pakistani saviors of Brooklyn's oldest bialy shop and the economics of matzo imports.
The Forward is essential reading now. You seem to think so, and our readers think so, too.

HEADLINE: Economics on the R Line

BYLINE: By JUDY NATKINS

 BODY:
Dear Diary: While I was on my way from Jackson Heights to Lower Manhattan a few weeks ago on the R subway line, one of those ubiquitous small-item vendors came through the car, loudly calling out: ''Yo-yos, Rubik's cubes! One dollar only!'' 
As he had some buyers - including me - he happily dispensed his wares from a large shopping bag he was carrying.
As we pulled into the 59th Street/Lexington Avenue station, he announced, ''Next stop, Lexington Avenue,'' which was then followed by his now modified call: ''Yo-yos, Rubik's cubes! Five dollars!''
Everyone around me giggled at his demonstrated mastery of the economic rules of the marketplace.

DEAR DIARY:
About 5:30 on a Wednesday afternoon, a young woman, naked from the waist up, walked north on Third Avenue as I was walking south. She appeared unconcerned.
The reaction seemed minimal. A young man in front of the running store near 72nd Street beckoned to his friend to come out. Near Gracious Home, another guy said, ''That's indecent exposure!'' Otherwise all was calm until the corner of 70th Street. A group of young women were in fits of laughter and shock. One said to me, ''We just saw ...''
''I saw her, too,'' I said. One of the women, a visiting Californian and the most outraged, said, ''In California, they walk around in little string bikini tops, but there's nothing like that!'' 
Embarrassed for our city and afraid that she'd go home and report on New Yorkers, I assured her that this was not an everyday thing and that, after a lifetime here, this was my first topless woman on the street. I'm not sure she believed me.

Dear Diary:
Dad had a thing for Bethesda Fountain. Mom loved any reason for getting out of our tiny apartment on East 83rd Street.
Fifty-one years ago, August 1961, Dad, Mom, my brother, Rory, 5, and I, 7, death-marched through Central Park on a miserable 100-degree day. Fed up with the heat, Rory and I tortured our parents into letting us swim in Bethesda Fountain. They gave in, sick of our whining. We stripped down to our briefs and vaulted over the stone into the water.
The swim lasted a long time. There was a patrolman watching us, and he left us alone. Then his sergeant came by, and the patrolman had to be a cop again. ''O.K., kids, get out of there, and stay out,'' he said with a grin, facing away from his boss.
As we swung our soaked bodies out of the fountain, Bobby Lewis was singing ''Tossin' & Turnin' '' on someone's transistor radio.

Dear Diary:
As I sat in the subway at rush hour with nothing to do, I playfully scrolled through the various ringtones on my iPhone. I suddenly realized I had reached my stop, Grand Central, and I hurried out to catch the Metro-North train home.
As usual, I chose the first car, known as the quiet car, so that I could read my Kindle in silence. I sat down opposite two men who proceeded to chat about mutual acquaintances.
After a minute or so, I leaned over and said: ''I'm sorry to bother you, but this is the quiet car. The first car on the train during rush hour is the quiet car.''
They looked at each other. One man took out some reading material, and his friend opened up his laptop.
As the three of us sat engrossed in our silent activities, a loud quacking sound seemed to come from one of their briefcases -- apparently, his phone was ringing. He didn't answer it, in deference to the ''no talking'' rule, but the quacking seemed even worse than conversation.
Finally, the ringing stopped. But then five minutes later -- the same quacking. ''Why doesn't he just switch the phone to silent?'' I thought irritably.
At my station, I gathered my belongings and stepped onto the platform. And then, as the train pulled away, I was mortified to hear the quacking once again -- coming straight out of my shoulder bag.

HEADLINE: In Congested Atlanta, Tax Referendum Is Seen as a Shortcut to Transit Relief

BYLINE: By KIM SEVERSON

 BODY:
ATLANTA -- Commuters battling traffic in the Bay Area or New York might protest, but Atlanta-area traffic seems to be uniquely awful.
For more than a decade, Atlanta has been among the fastest-growing regions in the country, but the road and rail system in a state that ranks 49th in per capita transportation spending just could not keep up.
Hourlong commutes are common, and more than 80 percent of commuters drive alone. Only 5 percent make use of the region's limited train and bus systems, according to research by the Brookings Institution.
This month, Atlanta-area voters are being asked to approve an ambitious fix that would raise $8.5 billion by adding a penny to the sales tax for 10 years. 
The proposal, which bundles 157 projects in 10 counties, is part of a July 31 referendum that will allow voters across the state to decide whether they want a new tax for transportation specific to their region. Voters in the Savannah area, for example, will decide on a $1.6 billion regional package of road and transit improvements, of which $229 million would be spent in Savannah.
The complex regional voting scheme could bring in more than $18.6 billion in new tax money, plus additional federal money, making it one of the largest packages of its kind in the country, transportation experts said.
The approach is also an attempt to thread the political needle in an era when the recession and smaller-government sentiment have made any effort at new public spending, especially one with the word ''tax'' attached, a Sisyphean task.
''It's not a good time to be asking people for money,'' said Sam Williams, president of the Metro Atlanta Chamber, which is at the forefront of the campaign to promote the tax.
Brent Buice, executive director of Georgia Bikes!, said, ''A lot of states are looking at it very carefully to see what happens because it's a politically safe way to get transportation funding.''
''Essentially, this is a way to make people tax themselves,'' added Mr. Buice, who will be voting for a package of projects in the Athens area. ''It's a way for the Georgia legislature to kick the can down the road and not have to raise the gas tax, which should have been raised a long time ago.''
But taxes to improve roads, telecommunications, sewers and other services are a tough sell these days, and President Obama's appeals to improve infrastructure are an example, said Ken Orski, editor of Innovation NewsBriefs, a transportation newsletter.
''People simply do not trust the administration's vague promises as to how their gas tax dollars will be spent,'' Mr. Orski said. But the Georgia package is different.
''They are being very specific, and by doing so, they are vastly improving the likelihood of a positive vote,'' he said.
In each of the 12 voting regions, 75 percent to 85 percent of the money would go to projects on an unchangeable master list. The remaining money would be given to cities and counties to spend on any transportation needs they might have in the future.
The legislature is pushing people to vote for the tax with a kind of carrot-and-stick incentive. Regions that do not support it will have to pay a bigger share to get state-supported road projects completed and may not get them done as quickly.
In Atlanta, which has by far the largest package, polls indicate the vote will be close despite a vigorous campaign. Nearly $6 million has been spent on educational efforts, including a series of billboards along congested interstates with the slogan ''Untie Atlanta.''
The campaign has pulled together a quirky and powerful mix of advocates, led by Mayor Kasim Reed, who has made it the centerpiece of his agenda.
Hundreds of companies -- including Coca-Cola, the Weather Channel and the Cook's Warehouse, a local kitchen shop -- have pledged support, saying the region's transportation hurts business and arguing that the new projects would create jobs. Public transit and bicycling advocates like the proposal because 52 percent of the money would be dedicated to public transit.
Although little would be done to improve the Metropolitan Atlanta Rapid Transit Authority's beleaguered train system and less than 1 percent would go to bike and pedestrian projects, the money would bring a light-rail train for people who work near Emory University and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. And it would be a big step for the city's BeltLine project, which aims to revitalize a 22-mile stretch of rail and green space that loops around Atlanta and could one day connect nearly every neighborhood in the city.
Even professional sports teams like the Atlanta Braves have come out in support, hoping that bad traffic -- often cited as a reason for low attendance at games -- would be eased.
But the vote also underscores the longstanding cultural and political rifts between the city and the region's vast suburbs, where critics contend the package is too heavy on public transportation and Atlanta-only projects.
Other opponents include some members of the N.A.A.C.P., who argue that too few of the projects would help poor, largely black parts of the region, and the Georgia chapter of the Sierra Club, which says the project list puts too much emphasis on roads.
The Georgia Tea Party Patriots have been battling the proposal, calling it ''the largest single tax increase in Georgia history'' and contending it is full of special-interest projects and based on faulty assumptions about how traffic can best be fixed.
John Sherman of the Fulton County Taxpayers Foundation said the state should create a traffic authority staffed with transportation experts to determine when and where such projects are done, and not leave the decisions to politicians, like Mayor Reed, who put together the bulk of the project lists.
''His pet project is the Atlanta BeltLine, so he's included the BeltLine,'' he said. ''The BeltLine goes nowhere, and it's not going to do anything to help the real gridlock of Atlanta. It's pure pork.''
For many Atlanta-area commuters who have long been frustrated by a history of major road improvement projects that ultimately did not deliver, the latest promise of a fix is suspect.
''Everybody's in agreement that we have to do something about it, but are they just going to put a Band-Aid over it again or will it really be a solution and a serious change in infrastructure?'' asked Ayla Crippen, 34, who works in sales for an online marketing company and relies on her car.
She has two young children and battles a daily 45-minute commute between her job in Sandy Springs and her home in Decatur. The few times she has tried to use public transportation to commute it was a scheduling nightmare and an uncomfortable experience, she said.
Still, she is willing to consider a penny increase in the sales tax if it might actually do some good.
''Everyone suffers from the traffic here,'' she said. ''Everyone. This can't go on.''

HEADLINE: Overflowing Latin Festival

BYLINE: By JON PARELES

 BODY:
''No Human Being Is Illegal,'' read the T-shirt worn by the rapper Residente, leading the Puerto Rican group Calle 13, as he started the band's concert at Celebrate Brooklyn! on Friday night. Calle 13, which swept the Latin Grammy Awards in 2011, revved up an exultant global party. Residente and the singer Ileana Cabra Joglar, his sister, jumped all over the stage to music that drew on idioms from across the Americas and beyond, from the Andes to the Middle East and from hip-hop scratching to a theremin solo by Calle 13's other leader, the composer and producer Visitante. Meanwhile Residente's lyrics delivered a socially conscious manifesto: sometimes wry, often hardheaded. ''Let's dance the way the poor people dance,'' one song urged. 
Calle 13's show, drawing a beyond-capacity crowd to the Prospect Park Bandshell, was the largest event at the 13th annual Latin Alternative Music Conference. From Wednesday through Saturday this gathering of musicians and their dedicated business infrastructure -- about 1,250 conference attendees -- brought performers from Spain and the Americas to clubs and outdoor stages in Manhattan, Brooklyn and Queens. Residente's T-shirt came off long before Calle 13's finale: ''Latinoamerica,'' a tribute to Latin American struggle, unity and tenacity. It was a fitting centerpiece to the conference's concerts, which often returned -- in this election year -- to thoughts of self-determination, immigration and political power.
Tenacity and self-determination are also themes for the annual conference. Latin alternative music is the open-ended term for non-mainstream rock, pop, hip-hop and dance music, both imported and made in the U.S.A. It's a music-business underdog because it largely defies current marketing niches and radio formats, particularly in the United States, where lyrics in Spanish face a language barrier.
At its best Latin alternative music is a hybrid and a harbinger, devising and flaunting multicultural possibilities as the Latino and bilingual population grows in the United States. At its worst it's American and British pop in translation, a reminder that economic power assists cultural dominance. But for many performers Anglo styles are just one more useful source. ''Our English is not so good,'' the Chilean rapper Ana Tijoux told the audience at Celebrate Brooklyn! on Friday night. ''But we know what is the most important: Spanglish.''
In the Spanish-speaking world hip-hop has retained its social fervor. Conference shows featured two spitfire Spanish-language rappers -- women who could teach American rappers a broader perspective, not to mention a sense of melody. Both Ms. Tijoux, who shared the bill with Calle 13, and the Spanish rapper Mala Rodriguez, who headlined a concert on Wednesday at Central Park Summerstage, switch easily between rapping and singing, and they performed with live musicians. More important, both had more to offer than boasts.
Ms. Rodriguez's songs merged tough-gal self-affirmation with tales of urban poverty and desperation in a set that was a crescendo from funk and reggae into incendiary hard rock. Ms. Tijoux had an even stronger voice, musically and polemically. She sang with a tart, jazzy tinge (reminiscent of Erykah Badu) and rapped with forthright insistence, often constructing her lyrics to change from double to triple time, underlining their urgency with the built-in acceleration. Her songs mingle autobiography with openly political exhortations: remembering Chile's dictatorship, warning against quiescence and corporate control, welcoming the activism of younger generations. At Celebrate Brooklyn! she infused it all with confidence and hope.
Kinky, the Mexican band that headlined a Central Park Summerstage concert on Saturday afternoon, was more ominous but no less propulsive. Its songs ride funk and rock riffs that hark back to the dance-rock of the early 1980s, with a rough edge on keyboards and guitar -- but punctuated, every so often, by accordion lines out of Mexican border music. Meanwhile its lyrics fling images of consumerism as brainwashing and distraction, and of partying toward self-destruction, none of which stopped fans from dancing. Kinky shared the bill with Los Autenticos Decadentes, an Argentine band formed in the 1980s, whose songs were far more cheerful about bad-boy behavior; they bounded ahead, mingling ska with cumbia, as a good part of the audience shouted along.
Saturday's bill also included 3BallMTY (pronounced ''Tribal Monterrey''), a Mexican group that had a major Latin hit with its debut album, ''Intentalo,'' released at the end of 2011. Its music pushes the clip-clopping rhythm of cumbia into electronic dance music, mechanizing and modernizing it into a beat the group calls ''tribal guarachero.'' The album offers pop songs with guest vocalists, but onstage 3BallMTY was all electronic club fare: three producers at laptops and a mixer, layering beats and samples for a kinetic set that segued amid house, electro, hip-hop and Latin percussion before finally unleashing its pop vocal hooks.
The current epidemic of simplistic synth-pop has not spared Latin America. Smaller conference showcases at the Mercury Lounge and the Gramercy Theater had more than their share of forgettable programmed ditties.
But they also included performers forging Pan-American music with both roots and contemporary ideas. The Mexican songwriter Carla Morrison -- who won, rightly, the conference's Artist Discovery Award for this year -- used her sweet, clear soprano in pristinely romantic love songs, with hints of 1950s ballads and of Mexican tradition; she dedicated one of them to Mexico's student resistance movement. La Santa Cecilia, from Los Angeles, touched on folky Mexican styles, 1960s soul and a Mexicanized version of the Soft Cell hit ''Tainted Love'' -- a Los Angeles radio favorite -- all held together by the volatile dynamics of its lead singer, Marisol: delicate, richly tremulous or flat-out bluesy.
Martin Buscaglia, from Uruguay, made himself a one-man band with a looping machine, playfully syncopated guitar and slyly literate lyrics; one mentioned Stephen Hawking. And La Vida Boheme, a Venezuelan band making a return appearance after last year's conference, rocketed through songs with tumultuous post-punk momentum, some anthemic choruses and a proud vow, in English: ''Latin America is the future.''

HEADLINE: Five Obamacare Myths

BYLINE: By BILL KELLER

 BODY:
ON the subject of the Affordable Care Act -- Obamacare, to reclaim the name critics have made into a slur -- a number of fallacies seem to be congealing into accepted wisdom. Much of this is the result of unrelenting Republican propaganda and right-wing punditry, but it has gone largely unchallenged by gun-shy Democrats. The result is that voters are confronted with slogans and side issues -- ''It's a tax!'' ''No, it's a penalty!'' -- rather than a reality-based discussion. Let's unpack a few of the most persistent myths.
OBAMACARE IS A JOB-KILLER. The House Republican majority was at it again last week, staging the 33rd theatrical vote to roll back the Affordable Care Act. And once again the cliche of the day was ''job-killer.'' After years of trying out various alarmist falsehoods the Republicans have found one that seems, judging from the polls, to have connected with the fears of voters. 
Some of the job-killer scare stories are based on a deliberate misreading of a Congressional Budget Office report that estimated the law would ''reduce the amount of labor used in the economy'' by about 800,000 jobs. Sounds like a job-killer, right? Not if you read what the C.B.O. actually wrote. While some low-wage jobs might be lost, the C.B.O. number mainly refers to workers who -- being no longer so dependent on employers for their health-care safety net -- may choose to retire earlier or work part time. Those jobs would then be open for others who need them.
The impartial truth squad FactCheck.org has debunked the job-killer claim so many times that in its latest update you can hear a groan of weary frustration: words like ''whopper'' and ''bogus'' and ''hooey.'' The job-killer claim is also discredited by the experience under the Massachusetts law on which Obamacare was modeled.
Ultimately the Affordable Care Act could be a tonic for the economy. It aims to slow the raging growth of health care costs by, among other things, using the government's Medicare leverage to move doctors away from exorbitant fee-for-service medicine, with its incentive to pile on unnecessary procedures. Two veteran health economists, David Cutler of Harvard and Karen Davis, president of the Commonwealth Fund, have calculated that over the first decade of Obamacare total spending on health care, in part by employers, will be half a trillion dollars lower than under the status quo.
OBAMACARE IS A FEDERAL TAKEOVER OF HEALTH INSURANCE. Let's be blunt. The word for that is ''lie.'' The main thing the law does is deliver millions of new customers to the private insurance industry. Indeed, a significant portion of the unhappiness with Obamacare comes from liberals who believe it is not nearly federal enough: that the menu of insurance choices should have included a robust public option, or that Medicare should have been expanded into a form of universal coverage.
Under the law, to be sure, insurance will be governed by new regulations, and supported by new subsidies. This is not the law Ayn Rand would have written. But the share of health care spending that comes from the federal government is expected to rise only modestly, to nearly 50 percent in 2021, and much of that is due not to Obamacare but to baby boomers joining Medicare.
This is a ''federal takeover'' only in the crazy world where Barack Obama is a ''socialist.''
THE UNFETTERED MARKETPLACE IS A BETTER SOLUTION. To the extent there is a profound difference of principle anywhere in this debate, it lies here. Conservatives contend that if you give consumers a voucher or a tax credit and set them loose in the marketplace they will do a better job than government at finding the services -- schools, retirement portfolios, or in this case health insurance policies -- that fit their needs.
I'm a pretty devout capitalist, and I see that in some cases individual responsibility helps contain wasteful spending on health care. If you have to share the cost of that extra M.R.I. or elective surgery, you'll think hard about whether you really need it. But I'm deeply suspicious of the claim that a health care system dominated by powerful vested interests and mystifying in its complexity can be tamed by consumers who are strapped for time, often poor, sometimes uneducated, confused and afraid.
''Ten percent of the population accounts for 60 percent of the health outlays,'' said Davis. ''They are the very sick, and they are not really in a position to make cost-conscious choices.''
LEAVE IT TO THE STATES. THEY'LL FIX IT. The Republican alternative to Obamacare consists in large part of letting each state do its own thing. Presumably the best ideas will go viral.
States do have a long history of pioneering new ideas, sometimes enlightened (Oregon's vote-by-mail comes to mind) and sometimes less benign (see Florida's loopy gun laws). Obamacare actually underwrites pilot programs to reduce costs, and gives states freedom -- some would argue too much freedom -- in designing insurance-buying exchanges. But the best ideas don't spread spontaneously. Some states are too poor to adopt worthwhile reforms. Some are intransigent, or held captive by lobbies.
You've heard a lot about the Massachusetts law. You may not have heard about the seven other states that passed laws requiring insurers to offer coverage to all. They were dismal failures because they failed to mandate that everyone, including the young and healthy, buy in. Massachusetts -- fairly progressive, relatively affluent, with an abundance of health providers -- included a mandate and became the successful exception. To expand that program beyond Massachusetts required ... Barack Obama.
OBAMACARE IS A LOSER. RUN AGAINST IT, RUN FROM IT, BUT FOR HEAVEN'S SAKE DON'T RUN ON IT. When Mitt Romney signed that Massachusetts law in 2006, the coverage kicked in almost immediately. Robert Blendon, a Harvard expert on health and public opinion, recalls the profusion of heartwarming stories about people who had depended on emergency rooms and charity but now, at last, had a regular relationship with a doctor. Romneycare was instantly popular in the state, and remains so, though it seems to have been disowned by its creator.
Unfortunately, the benefits of Obamacare do not go wide until 2014, so there are not yet testimonials from enthusiastic, family-next-door beneficiaries. This helps explain why the bill has not won more popular affection. (It also explains why the Republicans are so desperate to kill it now, before Americans feel the abundant rewards.)
Blendon believes that because of the delayed benefits and the general economic anxiety, ''It will be very hard for the Democrats to move the needle'' on the issue this election year.
He may be right, but shame on the Democrats if they don't try. There's no reason except cowardice for failing to mount a full-throated defense of the law. It is not perfect, but it is humane, it is (thanks to the Supreme Court) fiscally viable, and it comes with some reasonable hopes of reforming the cockeyed way we pay health care providers.
Even before the law takes full effect, it has a natural constituency, starting with every cancer victim, every H.I.V. sufferer, everyone with a condition that now would keep them from getting affordable coverage. Any family that has passed through the purgatory of cancer -- as mine did this year, with decent insurance -- can imagine the hell of doing it without insurance.
Against this, Mitt Romney offers some vague free-market principles and one unambiguous promise: to dash the hopes of 30 million uninsured, and add a few million to their ranks by slashing Medicaid.
If the Obama campaign needs a snappy one-liner, it could borrow this one from David Cutler: ''Never before in history has a candidate run for president with the idea that too many people have insurance coverage.''

HEADLINE: Some Hospitals in New York Lack a Malpractice Safety Net

BYLINE: By ANEMONA HARTOCOLLIS

 BODY:
Every hospital makes mistakes. But some New York City hospitals may not have enough money to pay for them.
Several of the city's most troubled hospitals are partially or completely uninsured for malpractice, state records show, forgoing what is considered a standard safeguard across the country.
Some have saved money to cover their liabilities, but others have used up their malpractice reserves, meaning that any future awards or settlements could come at the expense of patients' care, and one hospital has closed its obstetric practice, in part out of fear of lawsuits.
Executives of these hospitals, most of which are in poor neighborhoods, say their dire financial circumstances and high premiums make it impractical to pay millions of dollars a year for insurance. 
But insurance experts say that though dropping coverage may make economic sense in the short term, it is hardly in the best interest of patients, and in the long term it may be costly to hospitals and their bondholders, including some bonds backed by the state, should large judgments force them into bankruptcy.
''From a kind of self-interest of the hospital, it seems if you're a marginally capitalized hospital barely making it, it would be perfectly rational not to buy insurance,'' said Tom Baker, a law professor at the University of Pennsylvania who has written about malpractice insurance.
''From a social perspective, it's very irresponsible. They're taking in these people knowing they're not able to make good on the harm they caused. Even a really good hospital is going to have a certain amount of medical malpractice. It's inevitable.''
Hospitals in New York do not need malpractice insurance to function, and they need not tell patients when going ''naked'' or ''bare,'' in industry parlance.
Many states do not require malpractice insurance, and New York is not the only city where hospitals go without coverage. Generally the uninsured hospitals are in areas where juries award big judgments, insurance executives say.
''In New York and in poor venues, difficult venues -- Philadelphia is one, New York City, Chicago Cook County, Florida Dade County -- it's not effective for the hospitals to buy the coverage because they charge so much,'' said Dominic A. Colaizzo, chairman of the national health care practice for Aon, an insurance brokerage.
The choice may be grim. ''If I have to pay for nurses versus fund for malpractice, what are the hospitals going to do?'' Mr. Colaizzo said.
There is no central record of which hospitals have insurance. But in 2009, the state Health Department took a survey of so-called self-insured hospitals. It found that three -- Interfaith Medical Center, Kingsbrook Jewish Medical Center and Wyckoff Heights Medical Center, all in Brooklyn -- were completely self-insured.
Twelve other hospitals across the city were partially self-insured, including St. Vincent's Hospital in Manhattan, which went bankrupt and closed in 2010; Lenox Hill in Manhattan; Jamaica Hospital Medical Center in Queens; and New York Hospital Queens.
Some of the 12 had bought insurance to cover lower-dollar or ''primary'' claims, but not ''excess'' judgments. The others had excess coverage but not primary.
The Health Department has not done a follow-up survey, but hospitals that responded to questions about their coverage said it had not changed.
In interviews, some hospital executives said their physicians had separate insurance which is subsidized or reimbursed by the hospital. Interfaith, for one, gives its emergency-room physicians a letter promising to assume liability, said Luis A. Hernandez, the hospital's chief executive.
Without insurance, many hospitals set aside money to pay for claims, but a review by The New York Times of state records and hospital financial records indicates that several of the hospitals have insufficient reserves to cover their malpractice liabilities.
Two of the hospitals without insurance have no money set aside, according to their financial documents and interviews with hospital officials. In the case of the third, Kingsbrook, it is unclear from financial statements if it has any money in reserve.
Dr. Linda Brady, the hospital's chief executive, was overseas and was unavailable for comment, said Enid Dillard, a hospital spokeswoman. But Ms. Dillard, when asked if the hospital was paying malpractice claims out of its day-to-day budget, said, ''This would be a fair statement to make.''
In 2009, Wyckoff Heights Medical Center, in Bushwick, had $50,000 in its malpractice fund; in 2010, the amount put aside to cover claims had dwindled to ''0,'' according to its financial statements. Yet the hospital listed professional liabilities of $37 million. Ramon Rodriguez, the chief executive, declined to comment.
Mr. Hernandez acknowledged that Interfaith had exhausted its malpractice reserves and that it had ''significant millions of dollars of liability which are not funded.''
''As things come up, we utilize day-to-day working capital,'' he said. ''If we ever get a large award, it could hurt us significantly.''
A jury awarded a $31.6 million judgment against the hospital in 2006, which was later reduced to $12.9 million and is being paid out in installments through 2018. As a result of that case, Mr. Hernandez said, the hospital closed its obstetric unit because it could not afford the liability. The hospital was also not delivering enough babies to justify the expense, he said.
Henry W. Fust of Fust Charles Chambers, a Syracuse firm that provides accounting services to hospitals across New York State, said that for hospitals to ''go totally naked'' was very unusual and ''would draw into question the viability of the entity.'' It would also be difficult for any patient to recover money from hospitals like Wyckoff and Interfaith, which are already deeply in debt. ''You can't get blood out of a stone,'' Mr. Fust said.
An absence of insurance is generally a sign of double trouble, signifying that rates have gone up because of high claims. Many commercial insurance companies pulled out of New York years ago because ''this is a very litigious state, high severity and high frequency,'' said Edward J. Amsler, vice president of Medical Liability Mutual Insurance Company, which is owned by its policyholders. Financially stable hospitals have responded by banding together in groups like Mr. Amsler's, setting premiums and reserves and sometimes sharing risks. (Lenox Hill has primary liability coverage through this company, setting aside reserves for larger claims.)
''If you were on the board of a public corporation, and you had director responsibility, and if it was a health care corporation, you would damn well demand that the management of that hospital was properly insured,'' said Stephen Berger, the head of a state task force on ailing Brooklyn hospitals, which recommended that Interfaith and Wyckoff Heights merge with a stronger hospital.
''You wouldn't let somebody pick up a Q-tip if you weren't comfortable with the level of malpractice, liability, fire, coverage, everything else that you had in that hospital, because you would have liability if you failed to perform your true duties.''
Some hospital executives say, however, it is better to be effectively uninsured, because lawyers follow the money.
''Malpractice insurance is a lawsuit magnet,'' said a former hospital administrator who did not want to be named to avoid upsetting potential employers. Malpractice lawyers said that underinsured hospitals put them in a tricky position.
''There is some arm-twisting,'' said Alan Fuchsberg, a personal injury lawyer in Manhattan, as plaintiffs are told that they will end up with nothing and push the hospitals into bankruptcy if they do not ''just take the little bit'' that is offered to them.
''You don't know if that's really true or not, and it's very difficult to advise your client,'' he said.
The lawyers said they were often forced to take payment on installment, or to try to pin more blame on physicians, who may have their own insurance. Martin Seinfeld, a malpractice lawyer, said he had had three cases this year involving Jamaica Hospital and New York Hospital Queens in which hospital lawyers had held out the specter of bankruptcy if he did not reduce his demands.
When a hospital is bankrupt, its creditors, including malpractice plaintiffs, are often forced to accept less than they are owed through litigation. ''They're forcing settlement terms for payouts over six or seven years,'' Mr. Seinfeld said, ''because they put you in the position of saying, 'Fine, close a community hospital.' ''
Camela Morrissey, a spokeswoman for New York Hospital Queens, declined to comment on Mr. Seinfeld's assertion or on the hospital's financial condition. Jamaica also declined to comment.
Mr. Hernandez, of Interfaith, said the hospital was not trying to duck responsibility. ''Eventually we recognize the liability,'' he said. But at this point, he added, with a mordant chuckle, ''We're just trying to buy another day.''

HEADLINE: After Meeting With Clinton, Egypt's Military Chief Steps Up Political Feud

BYLINE: By KAREEM FAHIM; Mai Ayyad contributed reporting.

 BODY:
CAIRO -- Egypt's top military official stepped up his feud with the Muslim Brotherhood on Sunday, saying the army would prevent Egypt from falling to a ''certain group,'' according to the state news agency.
The remarks by the official, Field Marshal Mohamed Hussein Tantawi, did not mention the Brotherhood by name but were widely seen as a reference to the group and to Mohamed Morsi, Egypt's newly elected president and a former Brotherhood leader. And they came just hours after Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton met with the field marshal in Cairo in an effort to prod Egypt's military to hand its power to civilians. 
The accelerating dispute between the military and the Brotherhood marked the latest unpredictable turn in Egypt's chaotic transition, and underscored the challenges Mrs. Clinton faced on her two-day visit to Egypt.
Constrained by an almost complete mistrust of the United States' motives, Mrs. Clinton was forced to avoid strong calls for a quick end to military rule, favoring language instead that called for Egyptian solutions along with respect for minority rights.
And with little leverage except a promise of economic assistance, she struggled to coax the military and Mr. Morsi to resolve their rift.
She also faced anger from Christian leaders, including some who boycotted a meeting with her on Sunday, objecting to what they said was interference by the United States in Egypt's politics in order to aid an Islamist rise to power.
Though there is little evidence that the Islamists needed American help in gaining power -- or indeed, received it -- the complaints reflected the country's anxious politics and growing concerns among many Christians and secular-minded Egyptians about Islamist rule.
After meeting Mr. Morsi on Saturday, Mrs. Clinton sat down on Sunday morning with Field Marshal Tantawi, whose military council took power after President Hosni Mubarak was deposed last year. The military still retains broad legislative and executive authority, having seized further powers before the presidential election in June.
After the meeting, which lasted a little over an hour, a senior State Department official said Field Marshal Tantawi and Mrs. Clinton had discussed the economy, regional security, ''the political transition'' and the military's ''ongoing dialogue with President Morsi.''
Field Marshal Tantawi emphasized that Egyptians needed ''help getting the economy back on track,'' the official said. ''The secretary stressed the importance of protecting the rights of all Egyptians, including women and minorities.''
But just hours after the meeting, Mrs. Clinton appeared to have achieved little reconciliation between the two sides. ''Egypt will not fall,'' Field Marshal Tantawi said at a military ceremony. ''It is for all Egyptians, not for a certain group -- the armed forces will not allow that.''
Mrs. Clinton's afternoon meeting with leaders of Egypt's Christian minority touched on one of the transition's rawest nerves: the fear that Mr. Morsi and his allies would move swiftly to lay the foundations of a pious, Muslim state.
Those anxieties have caused some liberals and Coptic leaders to support the military in its feud with the Brotherhood, and even to call on the generals to keep power until new elections for Parliament can be held.
In trying to ease the Islamists' grip on government, liberals have also been accused of being content to subvert the will of Egyptians, who voted a majority of Islamists into Parliament. And despite the Brotherhood's repeated successes at the ballot box, some have continued to implicate the United States.
Youssef Sidhom, who attended the round-table afternoon meeting with Mrs. Clinton at the American Embassy here, said some of the discomfort was rooted in the timing of American statements on Egypt, which seemed to ''bless democracy'' just as Islamists were winning.
''She kept repeating and assuring us that she has no intention to take sides,'' said Mr. Sidhom, who edits a newspaper that deals with Coptic concerns. He said that Mrs. Clinton, noting the Brotherhood's political skills, spoke to the Christian leaders about becoming a more organized political force.
A senior State Department official, speaking of meetings on Sunday with entrepreneurs, women's groups and Christian leaders, said Mrs. Clinton was trying ''to make absolutely clear where we stand on this political transition, which is that we support a full transition to civilian democratic rule and a constitution that protects the human rights and freedoms of all Egyptians.''
In Egypt's current muddled politics, though, those goals are hard to reconcile. Revolutionary groups and human rights activists have warned that continued involvement by the military, which many people here accuse of staging a de facto coup, would undermine the Constitution's legitimacy. But others, including Christian leaders Mrs. Clinton met with on Sunday, see the military as the only guarantor of a constitution that protects minority rights.
''She can say what she wants concerning the issue,'' said Emad Gad, a former member of Parliament who said he had refused to attend the meeting with Mrs. Clinton.
''We are living in an unstable period. If the SCAF goes back to its barracks,'' he said, referring to the military council by its initials, ''the Brotherhood will control everything.''
Mr. Gad added: ''It's an Egyptian issue. It's not for the secretary of state.''

HEADLINE: Norquist's Phantom Army

BYLINE: By TOM COBURN. 
Tom Coburn is a Republican senator from Oklahoma and the author of ''The Debt Bomb: A Bold Plan to Stop Washington from Bankrupting America.''

 BODY:
Washington
WHEN the antitax lobbyist Grover G. Norquist made a visit to Capitol Hill recently, leading Democrats welcomed the chance to build up their favorite boogeyman. Harry Reid, the Senate majority leader, said Mr. Norquist has ''the entire Republican party in the palm of his hand.'' A spokeswoman for Nancy Pelosi, the House minority leader, said Mr. Norquist -- who is famous for getting lawmakers to pledge not to support tax hikes or deficit reduction that is paired with revenue increases -- was coming to give the G.O.P. its ''marching orders.''
But this story is utterly false. Senate Republicans -- and many House Republicans -- have repeatedly rejected Mr. Norquist's strict interpretation of his own pledge, a reading that requires them to defend every loophole and spending program hidden in the tax code. While most Republicans do, of course, oppose tax increases, they are hardly the mindless robots Democrats say they are. 
What the narrative does, however, is let Democrats off the hook. If they can make out Republicans as uncompromising ideologues, they can continue refusing to offer detailed plans to reform entitlement programs. That is the real obstacle to a grand bargain on spending, not Mr. Norquist's pledge.
Consider the evidence: I recently proposed amendments to end tax earmarks for movie producers and the ethanol industry. Mr. Norquist charged that those measures would be tax hikes unless paired with dollar-for-dollar rate reductions. And yet all but six of the 41 Senate Republicans who had signed his pledge voted for my amendments.
Those 35 Republican pledge-violators are hardly soft on taxes. Rather, they understand that the tax code is riddled with special-interest provisions that are merely spending by another name. If asked to eliminate earmarks for things like Nascar, the tackle-box industry or Eskimo whaling captains -- all of which are actual tax ''breaks'' -- most of my colleagues would be embarrassed to demand dollar-for-dollar rate reductions, and rightly so.
As a result, rather than forcing Republicans to bow to him, Mr. Norquist is the one who is increasingly isolated politically. For instance, while his organization, Americans for Tax Reform, was calling my ethanol amendment a tax hike, the Club for Growth, which is far more influential among conservative lawmakers, endorsed my amendment outright.
What's more, my colleagues have repeatedly rejected Mr. Norquist's demand that Republicans walk away from any grand bargain on the deficit that includes even a penny of new revenue. Speaker of the House John A. Boehner, who calls Mr. Norquist ''some random person,'' offered to trade revenue increases for entitlement reform in talks with the White House last summer. Republicans on the National Commission on Fiscal Responsibility and Reform made a similar offer, as did Senator Pat Toomey, Republican of Pennsylvania, during last year's deficit supercommittee negotiations. My colleagues, by and large, know that doing nothing to confront our fiscal challenges would mean an automatic tax increase and a cut to entitlement programs.
The problem with the pledge is that it is powerless to prevent future automatic tax increases and has failed to restrain past spending. The ''starve the beast'' strategy to shrink the size of the federal government by cutting revenue but not spending was a disaster. Every dollar we borrow is a tax increase on the next generation.
And in a debt crisis, higher interest rates and the debasement of our currency would be additional tax hikes. In that sense, no one is doing more to violate the spirit of the pledge than Mr. Norquist himself, who is asking Republicans to reject the very type of agreement that could prevent future tax increases.
What unifies Republicans is not Mr. Norquist's tortured definition of tax purity but the idea of a Reagan- or Kennedy-style tax reform that lowers rates and broadens the tax base by getting rid of loopholes and deductions. It's true that Republicans would prefer to lower rates as much as possible, and it's true that Republicans believe smart tax reform will generate more, not less, revenue for the federal government. But Republicans would not walk away from a grand bargain on entitlements and tax reform that would devote a penny of revenue to deficit reduction instead of rate reduction.
Free-market conservatives have repeatedly given openings to Democrats that they have chosen to ignore. The president, for instance, knows that his calls to raise taxes on earnings over $250,000, which follows his gimmicky Buffett Rule, is a nonstarter unless paired with fundamental tax and entitlement reform.
The majority of Democrats and Republicans understand the severity of our economic challenges. They know they have to put everything on the table and make hard choices. Legislators who would rather foster political boogeymen only delay those critical reforms.

HEADLINE: Korea Experts Can See a Lot In a Hemline

BYLINE: By CHOE SANG-HUN

 BODY:
SEOUL, South Korea -- Keeping track of women's hemlines is, admittedly, an unusual way to judge the mind-set of a country's leader.
But that is just what veteran North Korea watchers have resorted to in trying to peer into one of the world's most isolated countries and divine what its new young leader, Kim Jong-un, is thinking. For weeks now, those analysts have puzzled over photos of women sporting miniskirts and heels in downtown Pyongyang, a stunning change from the years when Western wear was mostly shunned in favor of billowy traditional dresses or drab Mao-style work uniforms.
Then, Mr. Kim himself was shown on state TV giving a thumbs up to a girl band featuring leggy string players performing for him and his generals, and the debate over deeper meaning began in earnest.
In a political system that tightly choreographs its messages, could short skirts -- along with the appearance of Mickey Mouse and a film clip of Sylvester Stallone as Rocky Balboa at the same concert -- indicate some rethinking of the North's attitudes toward the West? Or was the fashion statement decidedly less weighty: perhaps another short-lived attempt to divert the attention of an unhappy populace? 
Koh Yu-hwan, a North Korea expert at Dongguk University in Seoul, counts himself in the hopeful camp. He calls recent changes in the North ''a glasnost,'' a shift he said was supported by a new generation of Communist Party members, mostly the old elite's children who, like Mr. Kim, have traveled abroad and may envision Chinese-style economic reforms.
On the other side are analysts like Lee Sung-yoon, a North Korea specialist at the Fletcher School of Tufts University in Boston, who says any belief in real change based on Mr. Kim's education in Switzerland as a teenager is wishful thinking.
''If exposure to European cosmopolitanism were a cure for totalitarianism, one wonders how Pol Pot, who spent four years in Paris in his mid-20s, missed out on the transformative experience,'' he said, referring to the murderous former dictator of Cambodia.
North Korea analysts can hardly be blamed for trying to cobble together whatever scraps of information they can find. The world knows precious little about Mr. Kim, including exactly how old he is (the best guess is in his 20s) and whether he is married (news reports helpfully point out that a mystery woman making increasingly frequent appearances with him might be his sister, wife or girlfriend). But figuring out what he might be thinking is critical to determining how much of a threat he, and the nuclear program he inherited, poses to his neighbors, and North Korea's enemies in the West.
So far, the puzzle pieces leave little doubt that Mr. Kim is trying to forge a very different leadership style than his father, Kim Jong-il, whose countenance was dour enough to merit ribbing by the creators of South Park. The son, by comparison, appears to be more approachable (photos show him hooking arms with factory workers and soldiers); less threatened by foreign cultures and apparently more willing to admit failure (he told the nation of a botched rocket launch in April).
But there is also ample evidence that Mr. Kim, who took over late last year after his father's death, does not plan to veer far from his father's and grandfather's governing policies on most issues, including maintaining a strong military and nuclear arms program and issuing frequent, florid threats against South Korea and the United States. Mr. Kim launched the rocket in April despite the likelihood that it would kill a new food aid agreement with the United States, which it did, and annoy the North's last true ally, China, which had urged restraint.
It became clear early on that Mr. Kim aimed to style himself after his grandfather, Kim Il-sung, the more popular founder of the country, rather than his father. The youngest Mr. Kim claps his hands the same way his grandfather did and sports a similar hairdo with high-trimmed sideburns. In recent weeks, he hosted a huge children's day celebration, ensuring he would be seen surrounded by happy and well-fed youngsters, just as his grandfather often was depicted in state propaganda.
But over time, Kim Jong-un has also begun to carve out his own leadership style, striving to come across as youthful and more pragmatic.
''He is much more willing to acknowledge challenges, problems and even failures,'' said John Delury, a North Korea expert at Yonsei University in Seoul, who saw Mr. Kim's strategy as aimed at ''turning his potential weakness -- youth and inexperience -- into a political strength: dynamism and energy.''
He has delivered at least two public speeches, something his reclusive father never did. He was even shown visiting restaurants that sell pizza, hamburgers and French fries -- Western foods that began appearing in Pyongyang several years ago but were not fully endorsed by his father.
Then came this month's concert, clips of which were later shown on state TV. The appearance of Mickey Mouse, a stand-in for Western culture, had a special resonance for those who have followed the Kim family dynasty.
In 2001, Kim Jong-il's eldest son, Jong-nam, was caught trying to enter Japan with a fake visa, reportedly to visit Tokyo Disneyland. Analysts say Kim Jong-il was so upset that he effectively counted Jong-nam out as his successor.
At the concert, Kim Jong-un was essentially bringing Disneyland home, showing to his people that he was ready to embrace elements of foreign culture, even from the ''sworn enemy'' of the United States, if they suited his country's needs, analysts said.
The changes are also meant to blunt the impact of more information and entertainment trickling into the North -- from defectors who smuggle cellphones to their loved ones and from traders allowed to cross back and forth into China to get much-needed goods to sell, as well as digital copies of South Korean movies and television shows.
Pragmatism may also be driving what could be Mr. Kim's most substantive change yet -- a reported agreement to send thousands of skilled workers to China. The program, which has not been confirmed by either government, has been widely reported in China, and is a bold and potentially risky shift. With larger numbers going abroad, analysts said, North Korea will have less of a chance to monitor the workers as closely, but Mr. Kim appears willing to take the chance to shore up badly depleted foreign currency reserves with the fees it will charge workers chosen for the jobs.
Still, for those ready to declare a true shift under Mr. Kim, it may be helpful to look back to another period of change that, as it turns out, also had a fashion angle.
When the North's economy was imploding in the 1990s, Kim Jong-il turned a blind eye to the decision by many women to break the North's rules on clothing and behavior, wearing pants and biking to trading bazaars, creating an ''eyesore.''
But in 2009, in an apparent fit of pique at the growing power of the merchants, Mr. Kim temporarily shut the black markets and the authorities resumed their crackdown on women wearing pants and riding bicycles. Then pants and markets made a comeback in 2010.
Such wild pendulum swings are likely to continue despite the change in leadership. ''Under Kim Jong-un,'' said Dong Yong-seung, a North Korea expert at the Samsung Economic Research Institute here, ''we will see a continual clash and compromise between emerging market forces and the regime's attempt to turn back the clock.''

HEADLINE: In Pawlenty, Romney Campaign May Find Down-to-Earth Appeal

BYLINE: By JEFF ZELENY; Kitty Bennett contributed research.

 BODY:
EAGAN, Minn. -- It was four years ago this summer, when Tim Pawlenty ranked high on the list of John McCain's potential running mates, and Mr. Pawlenty and his wife, Mary, were plowing through a voluminous questionnaire probing deep into their finances and almost every other aspect of their lives.
''I remember the two of us joking one night at some inhumane hour, 'No way is Mitt Romney doing this by himself!' '' Mr. Pawlenty later wrote in his book. ''We had a good laugh over that.''
After a short-lived presidential bid of his own last year, Mr. Pawlenty is again being considered for the Republican ticket. His fate is in the hands of Mr. Romney, a rival-turned-friend, who is on the cusp of announcing his vice-presidential selection. Mr. Romney has reached a decision, his friends believe, and he may disclose it as soon as this week. 
The country received only an abbreviated introduction to Mr. Pawlenty, 51, a former two-term governor of Minnesota, whose working-class roots, experience outside Washington and evangelical faith have formed the core of his appeal to a broad spectrum of Republicans.
While Mr. Romney has kept more distance from the rest of his primary challengers, he has embraced Mr. Pawlenty, seeking his advice about running against President Obama and sending him to Republican events on his behalf. They began forging a closer relationship last year on a visit to the Romney family's lakeside home in New Hampshire, aides said, and during debates this year when Mr. Pawlenty often traveled with the Romney campaign after dropping out of the race himself.
He has emerged as one of the most energetic cheerleaders and forceful defenders of Mr. Romney, firing back against Republican skeptics and Democratic critics alike. All but forgotten are the days when Mr. Pawlenty coined the troublemaking term ''Obamneycare,'' suggesting that few differences existed between the health care plans of Mr. Romney and Mr. Obama.
The conservative National Review now describes Mr. Pawlenty as ''Romney's traveling salesman.'' While other potential vice-presidential candidates like Senator Rob Portman of Ohio and Gov. Bobby Jindal of Louisiana have day jobs that limit their availability, Mr. Pawlenty, who has no other full-time position, is the political equivalent of an empty nester, available to do whatever Mr. Romney asks.
''I'm happy to help where I can,'' Mr. Pawlenty said in a brief interview from his home in Eagan, a suburb of Minneapolis. He deflects questions about being Mr. Romney's partner, saying, ''I think I can best serve him in other ways, but anybody would be honored to be asked.''
The vetting of possible vice-presidential candidates is approaching an end. It has been a deeply secretive process, but several Republicans close to the campaign believe Mr. Pawlenty and Mr. Portman stand out among those being considered.
In 2008, as Mr. McCain was narrowing in on a running mate, several aides recommended Mr. Pawlenty. Others pushed for a bolder choice, a candidate who would create more enthusiasm among Republican activists.
Four years later, being passed over for Sarah Palin may work in Mr. Pawlenty's favor. ''In a lot of ways, he's the anti-Palin,'' said Steve Schmidt, a strategist to Mr. McCain who expressed regret for her selection. ''Here's a guy who is prepared to be president on Day 1. In any normal year, he would have been the pick.''
But some of the same perceived shortcomings of Mr. Pawlenty still exist among his detractors, including the critique that he lacks a fiery presence and the ability to excite a crowd.
Associates of Mr. Romney say he believes Mr. Pawlenty has gotten a bad rap, and the comfort level between the men outweighs any concerns of a potential ticket being seen as dull.
A year ago, as the Republican presidential field was emerging, aides to Mr. Obama kept close tabs on Mr. Pawlenty and his plain-spoken message as a so-called Sam's Club Republican. They spoke privately about how his blue-collar upbringing in South Saint Paul, Minn., in the shadows of stockyards, could be compelling to voters with the economy on their minds.
Now, as the president and his re-election campaign are relentlessly hammering away at Mr. Romney's wealth and business background, some admirers of Mr. Pawlenty believe that he could help ease the criticism that the Republican ticket does not appeal to working-class voters.
''An appealing counterbalance to Romney being a son of a wealthy man and going to elite schools is Pawlenty being the son of a truck driver who went to the University of Minnesota,'' said Ray Washburne, a Dallas businessman who began helping Mr. Romney's campaign after Mr. Pawlenty left the race. ''He's not elite in any sense of the word.''
One thing Mr. Pawlenty may not bring to the ticket is the benefit of geography. (A key factor in Mr. Portman's favor, Republicans believe, is the assumption that he could help them take Ohio.) But while a Republican presidential candidate has not won Minnesota since 1972, party leaders say Mr. Pawlenty is a credible messenger on the economy in swing states across the industrial Midwest.
It remains a question whether Mr. Pawlenty's brief presidential run increased or lowered his stature as a figure in the Republican Party. His candidacy was too short to allow a thorough vetting, but there was time for him to explain some elements of his record as Minnesota governor.
He renounced his support for cap-and-tradeclimate change legislation, saying, ''It's fair to say I've had a change of position and change of view, and the reason is it's a dumb idea.'' He also received absolution from some fiscal conservatives even though he raised the cigarette tax, which he called a ''health impact fee.''
Grover G. Norquist, who leads the group Americans for Tax Reform, said the full scope of Mr. Pawlenty's record was strong, despite the tax increase. He pointed to his leadership on a 44-day transit strike in 2004, where he won a fight over compensation and retirement benefits.
''He was a little Scott Walker before Scott Walker,'' Mr. Norquist said, referring to the Wisconsin governor hailed among conservatives for surviving a recall election last month after cutting collective bargaining rights for most public workers.
While Mr. Pawlenty left the Republican primary long before voters weighed in, he won an early poll of evangelical Christian leaders, a constituency Mr. Romney has had difficulty winning over. His longtime pastor, Leith Anderson, who is also president of the National Association of Evangelicals, said Mr. Pawlenty's faith could help the Republican ticket.
''Tim Pawlenty is an evangelical, and evangelicals like other evangelicals,'' Mr. Anderson said.
Mr. Pawlenty, who joined several corporate boards and is looking for other private sector opportunities after nearly two decades as a legislator and governor, has gradually adjusted his posture on a vice-presidential candidacy. In April, he told Fox News, ''I've taken my name off the list.''
A month later, after he received a call, his friends believe, from Mr. Romney, he said he would be honored to be selected.

HEADLINE: Credits for Children

BYLINE: NANCY FOLBRE


HIGHLIGHT: Support for children and parents in the United States lags that of many developed countries and is scheduled to be reduced unless Congress acts, an economist writes. 

 BODY:
Unless Congress takes action before the end of the year, the child tax credit (currently $1,000 a child) will be cut in half when other Bush-era tax policies formally lapse. Like the earned-income tax credit, which offers considerably more assistance to parents than other earners, the child tax credit enjoys fairly strong bipartisan support, and some conservatives have proposed increases to it. 
Yet both tax credits show scars of partisan sparring over what kinds of behavior deserve public support and send mixed signals regarding the value of parental contributions. Debate over family tax reform should be part of a larger effort to reconsider family policy in the United States.
Currently, the federal tax code subsidizes home ownership about as much as parenting. According to the Joint Committee on Taxation, the total cost of lost revenues from the mortgage interest tax deduction and the exclusion of capital gains on principal residences is estimated at about $110 billion for 2011. The combined cost of the child tax credit and the earned-income tax credit comes to about $77 billion. Add in an estimate of the cost of the dependent exemption and the total comes to about $107 billion.
Many cross-national comparisons, including a recent report from the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, "Doing Better for Families," show that the United States provides far less support for child-rearing than other advanced industrial countries. Many factors, including racial and ethnic diversity, anti-immigrant sentiment and high income inequality probably help explain this lack of social solidarity. 
Differences in political priorities also weaken support for an expanded child tax credit. Conservatives favor increasing it partly in order to encourage a higher birth rate. Others, like me, favor increasing it largely because it would increase the economic well-being and the future productivity of children, especially those from low-income families.

Even more profound disagreements center on income eligibility and incentives for marriage and paid employment.
Like the earned-income tax credit, the refundable portion of the child tax credit (which offers a transfer to some families with tax liability below the amount of the credit) is based on complex phase-outs that reduce benefits along with family income. These phase-outs make it difficult for even experts to estimate what a specific family can expect to receive. 
Still, even a rough estimate reveals a disincentive to marry among low-income earners, because family income typically goes up as spouses pool their earnings. The rapid phase-outs also contribute to a very high marginal tax rate for low-income families, because increased earnings result in benefit loss. 
One way to reduce such problems is to raise the income at which phasing out of credits begins and lower the phase-out rate. The economist Robert Cherry proposes a specific remedy in a New Mothers Tax Relief policy that would modify details of the earned-income tax credit. 
While this thoughtful proposal should receive serious legislative consideration, a simpler solution would be to convert the child tax credit and the earned-income tax credit to a unified transfer unaffected by family earnings or by marriage, sometimes called a child allowance. Most conservatives dislike this idea because it would benefit single mothers who are not employed. 
But as the recent brouhaha over Ann Romney's career illustrates, many people now consider raising young children to be work. Many Republicans favor the child tax credit precisely because it - unlike subsidized child care - offers benefits to families in which a parent provides care at home. 
The spousal benefit provided through Social Security already subsidizes married spouses who haven't worked for pay. A married retiree receives 1.5 times more in retirement benefits than a single retiree with the same earnings record. 
A conservative proposal developed by Robert Stein for quadrupling the size of the child tax credit to $4,000 a child (along with other proposed modifications of the larger tax code) would prohibit any refund greater than the combined amount of the family's federal income and Social Security tax payments. Single mothers with limited employment during the year would benefit very little from such a proposal, though they and their children are more vulnerable to poverty than any other group. 
Instead of a double standard, in which married mothers are encouraged to work at home but single mothers are pressured to work for pay, why not give all parents more flexibility to combine paid work with family care? 
Cash expenditures on children are high, but the costs of parental time devoted to them are even higher. Most mothers work for pay during part of their lives, but face institutional constraints that unnecessarily reduce their economic opportunities. 
A child allowance combined with paid family leaves of up to three months could ease transitions for parents who plan to remain employed. Public early-childhood education programs focused on toddlers could both improve children's capabilities and make it easier for their parents to schedule paid employment. Such policies have been adopted in many other affluent countries to good effect. 
Tax reform, including elimination of the mortgage interest tax deduction for vacation homes, boats and second mortgages, could help finance supportive family policies. But tax reform alone can't give parents the credit they deserve.

HEADLINE: This Week in Small Business: Groupon's New Deal

BYLINE: GENE MARKS


HIGHLIGHT: Plus: Heading for a cliff, the fastest-growing retailers, social media cheat sheets, and the million-dollar tweet. 

 BODY:
What's affecting me, my clients and other small-business owners this week.
The Big Story: Heading for a Cliff
After a disappointing small-business optimism report from the National Federation of Independent Business, the president pledges to extend the Bush tax cuts for people making less than $250,000 a year and then signs off on a new small-business package. The chairman of the House Small Business Committee responds. Keith Koffler says the president's proposal would "slam 620,000 small businesses." Jared Bernstein says, "Boy, are Americans not overtaxed." Here's a fact check. The Senate moves forward with small-business tax breaks. This is why small businesses aren't hiring. Paul B. Farrell says America's "fiscal cliff" is actually four cliffs. Peter Schiff warns that "the debt burden that the United States will face when interest rates rise presents a much larger fiscal cliff." Why Paris Hilton's dogs are better off than you. Nancy Pelosi dances.
The Economy: Taking Credit
Lou Basenese offers five bullish charts for American stocks. Consumer credit jumps, and here's what it means. Manufacturing technology and conveyor orders are up, perhaps because of the used parts bought by this guy. A Pew study finds that 84 percent of Americans have higher family incomes than did their parents. Nine states have regained all jobs lost to the recession. The housing bust appears to be over. The price of oil drops. There were 3.6 million job openings on the last business day of May, little changed from 3.4 million in April. But May's job openings and labor turnover continue to look positive. Greg Mankiw says we have not recovered, and a research group says that a recession has already begun. Dwaine van Vuuren disagrees. Corn production in the Midwest is likely to suffer because of the recent heat wave and drought. Our trade deficit (pdf) increased over the past year. Although mortgage rates are at historic lows, mortgage activity increased only slightly. Even so, Otis Elevator keeps going up, and, sorry, but those ballplayers really aren't as tough as they seem.
Management: The Million-Dollar Tweet 
How a few young entrepreneurs turned a Twitter post from Richard Branson into a million bucks. Cara Luckiesh explains how small businesses can think big and grow fast. Ever wonder which big companies are the most - and least - open in their dealings? A new study predicts that physical stores will evolve into showrooms. Peter Cohan suggests six steps to make your product a success. Lisa Hephner asks, is your business really small? Danielle Rodabaugh helps female entrepreneurs better understand surety bonds. Marty Nemko gives hiring advice, including: "After the interview, walk viable candidates to their car. Adopt a more informal tone. Often that gets the candidate to feel, 'O.K., the interview's over. Now I can drop the veneer.'" For manufacturing jobs, workers brush up on math. Meredith Wood explains how to use a sample collection letter to make sure you are paid. Melanie Benson Strick offers suggestions for recovering from a dry spell, including: "Think back to why you wanted your business in the first place." Kira M. Newman proclaims the 10 commandments for entrepreneurs.
Marketing: Groupon's New Deal
Here are the 12 most misunderstood English words, according to Kristin Piombino. Taco Bell cooks up edible QR codes. Richard Saintvilus thinks Groupon is about to expire - but Andrew Mason tells Bloomberg Businessweek that Groupon wants to be the "operating system" for Main Street businesses. AJ Kumar shares his five-step guide to creating a successful "inbound marketing" plan, including: "Create your viral campaign pieces. To spread the word about your business, your inbound marketing campaigns may include text-based articles that can be shared via social networking profiles, infographic images or videos." Here's an awesome way to handle telemarketers. John Jantsch says small businesses should consider sponsoring tribes: "The notion of tribes has become a commonly accepted way to characterize groups of people that are passionate about an idea, product, company or initiative, and I think it applies broadly to the community building that most businesses realize is the key to success." Here are 16 great marketing ideas for reusing derelict space. Meryl Evans suggests five steps for reputation management, including "snatching up all domain names associated with your business." Susan Waldman offers a few small-business branding lessons learned from Zappos.
Social Media: Whose Tweet Is It, Anyway?
Global Internet advertising has double-digit growth and outpaces other media. Yet grocery retailers still rely on print circulars. Ann Smarty offers 12 essential social media cheat sheets. Alan Norton says there are 10 reasons he avoids social networking services, including the unclear ownership of the intellectual content that is posted.

Federal officials in Eugene, Ore., try to end a 10-week protest. New York is converting payphones into hotspots. In Sun Valley, media and technology heavyweights come out at night. And in case you missed it, here's a very close look at the Fourth of July, San Diego-style.
Around the World: China's Inflationary Vortex
As its economy cools, China, says Ambrose Evans-Pritchard, is on the cusp of a deflationary vortex. While digital payments are still too costly for most small businesses, Starbucks brings mobile payments to Canada and Britain. These countries think the rich deserve to be rich. The most profitable company in the world is in Russia.
Red Tape: A Fall in Spending?

The Week's Bests
Adam Fletcher says there are nine signs that you've become a Start-Up Hipster, including, "You are Scandinavian/ You dream of being Scandinavian": "Scandinavians appeal to Hipsters because they are beautiful, which makes them look great in striped V-necks and press photos; smart, as they speak five languages; and they regularly win those best country polls on quality of life and education, but crucially, they are also a little aloof and mysterious. They also regularly sport killer mustaches. Plus, weren't the founders of Skype Scandinavian? Somewhere around there anyway. Definitely a cold country, with elk."
Justin Nowak lists five reasons you shouldn't start a business alone: "Brainstorming with other people is the best way to figure out what your business needs to succeed. By bouncing around ideas, you and your partner can come up with brilliant strategies that can take your business to new heights. You can even use digital tools like collaboration apps to communicate new observations and ideas in between your face-to-face meetings."
Peter Bregman has a strategy for reducing stress: "Change your expectations. In other words, get used to not getting what you want. I know this isn't consistent with the kind of go-get-'em attitude most of us have been taught to embrace. But most of the time, fighting reality is not worth the effort. Either you can't change what's around you, or the fight is more stressful than the reward."

HEADLINE: Numberplay: Student Groups

BYLINE: GARY ANTONICK


HIGHLIGHT: How many times can you form 17 different groups of 17 students? 

 BODY:
Our puzzle this week was suggested by Numberplay contributor Marco Moriconi, who says he likes the puzzle because "it requires very little new math, but it is quite ingenious."
The puzzle is called Student Groups.
In a certain school there are 289 students. They have to go out in 17 groups of 17 students each day, with the condition that no two students can be in the same group more than once. For how many days can they do this?
That's it.
Recap: Denominations
Last week we flipped over Denominations.
The puzzle: If a currency system could have only two coins, what should the values of those coins be?
The solution: Sumanth Ravipati was the first to propose the standard solution:
Easy counting implied keeping it in base 10 as much as possible. Also, we would have to keep a coin with value 1 to account for any given value. Therefore, the two coins I would keep are 1 and 10.
Between the values 1 and 100, the most number of coins you would carry is 18, for the value of 99.
There were other proposals as well:
Rich in Atlanta: a 9- and 11- cent coin (in addition to a penny) would also work.
Aaron: twenty-five and fifty cents. Retailers would round up or down.
Old Mister: a quarter and a dime. Change how change is done.
Georgia: a quarter and a fifty cent piece, due to inevitable inflation
Simon closed out the week by showing total how a 9- and 10-cent piece were best if you could trade coins. You could pay for a 1-cent item, for example, by trading a 10-cent piece for the item and a 9-cent piece. Simon summarized the process in the following chart.
I thought it might be helpful to see a graphical comparison of the standard solution (the dime and penny) with Simon's trading solution of a dime and 9-cent piece. The following shows one way to compare the two methods. The y-axis on each chart indicated number of dimes. The x-axis on the left indicates pennies and on the right indicates 9-cent pieces. The zig-zag traces values from 1 to 100. The line on the left begins at [1 penny, 0 dimes] and ends up at [0 pennies, 10 dimes]. The line on the right begins at [-1 9-cent piece, 1 dime] and also ends up at [0, 10], but is much more efficient along the way.
Let's hear it for everyone who made the conversation happen last week. In order of appearance: Gary, Dr W, Rich in Atlanta, unest, Golden Dragon, polymath, Aaron, Vaal, Old Mister, L. Arnaud, Sumanth Ravipati, charlie, David Smith, David, Giovanni Ciriani, Seth, Maya, Steve Kass, Hans, frobozzz, Andrew, JGR, Conuly, deo, Georgia, Paddy D, Jocelyn, Theodore Norvell and Neil Lehto.
Notes

        
Student Groups was suggested by longtime Numberplay contributor and theoretical physicist Marco Moriconi, who currently lives in Rio de Janeiro. He first encountered the problem at the 6th Brazilian Mathematics Olympiad. Thank you, Dr. Moriconi.

HEADLINE: Regulators and HSBC Faulted in Report on Money Laundering

BYLINE: NATHANIEL POPPER


HIGHLIGHT: The global bank HSBC has been used by Mexican drug cartels, Saudi Arabian banks with terrorist ties, and Iranians who wanted to circumvent United States sanctions, a report from a Senate subcommittee says. 

 BODY:
8:55 p.m. | Updated 
The global bank HSBC has been used by Mexican drug cartels looking to get cash back into the United States, by Saudi Arabian banks that needed access to dollars despite their terrorist ties and by Iranians who wanted to circumvent United States sanctions, a Senate report says.
The 335-page report released Monday also says that executives at HSBC and regulators at the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency ignored warning signs and failed to stop the illegal behavior at many points between 2001 and 2010.
In one case, an HSBC executive successfully argued that the bank should resume business with a Saudi Arabian bank, Al Rajhi Bank, despite the fact that Al Rajhi's founder had been an early benefactor of Al Qaeda. HSBC's American branch ended up supplying a billion dollars to the bank.
The report is the product of a yearlong investigation by a Senate subcommittee, the Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations. It points to the problems at HSBC, Europe's largest financial institution, as indicators of a broader problem of illegal money flowing through international financial institutions into the United States.
"Banks that ignore money laundering rules are a big problem for our country," said Senator Carl Levin, a Michigan Democrat who leads the subcommittee. "Also troubling is a bank regulator that does not adequately do its job." He called HSBC's compliance culture "pervasively polluted for a long time." 
HSBC executives are expected to apologize for shortcomings in the bank's internal controls in a hearing of the subcommittee on Tuesday. The company said in a statement on Monday that "we will apologize, acknowledge these mistakes, answer for our actions and give our absolute commitment to fixing what went wrong."
Mr. Levin, however, said on Monday that HSBC had promised to fix similar problems in years past and failed. "While the bank is saying all the right things, and that is fine, it has said all the right things before," he said.
The hearing is unlikely to be the end of HSBC's problems. The bank has disclosed in regulatory filings that the issues with money laundering are also being investigated by the Department of Justice and could lead to criminal charges and "significant" fines, which analysts have said could reach $1 billion.
The report on HSBC is the latest of several scandals that have recently rocked global banks and highlighted the inability of regulators to catch what is claimed to be widespread wrongdoing in the financial industry. The British bank Barclays recently admitted that its traders tried to manipulate a crucial global interest rate, and multiple major banks are under investigation. JPMorgan Chase disclosed last week that its employees may have tried to hide trades that are likely to cost the bank billions of dollars.
Mr. Levin said that wrongdoing in the financial world has been exacerbated by the relatively light touch of government regulators. "As long as a bank just sees that it is going to be dealt with kid gloves, I think we are going to continue to see these shortfalls that have been so endemic," Mr. Levin said.
The Office of the Comptroller of the Currency has come under particularly harsh criticism for showing too much deference to the banks it regulates. The new leader of the agency, Thomas J. Curry, has promised a stricter approach since he took over in April.
Mr. Curry said in a statement on Monday that members of his staff "fully embrace" the subcommittee's report, and he is expected to testify Tuesday that the agency is already carrying out many of the report's recommendations.
Regulators have been paying close attention to the willingness of global banks to facilitate illegal flows of money from outside the United States. The Treasury Department announced last month that ING Bank had agreed to pay $619 million to settle charges that it moved money into the United States from Cuba and Iran, despite sanctions against those countries, for nearly two decades. Since 2009, there have been five similar settlements between American regulators and other banks, including Barclays and Credit Suisse, over illicit transactions.
In the Senate report, HSBC is facing accusations that it helped its clients circumvent rules intended to stop transactions from countries facing international sanctions, and in some cases flouted laws in pursuit of profits.
While HSBC is accused of moving money into the United States from North Korea and Cuba, the most extensive problems involved accounts in Iran. An independent audit, paid for by HSBC, found that the bank facilitated 25,000 questionable payments involving Iran between 2001 and 2007. In some cases, HSBC executives counseled Iranian financial institutions on how to evade the filters of American regulators, the report says.
When the bank developed a way to process transactions for Iran's largest retail bank, an HSBC executive wrote an e-mail to his colleagues that said, "I wish to be on the record as not comfortable with this piece of business." None of his colleagues responded and the deal went ahead, according to the report.
The subcommittee also found evidence of widespread wrongdoing in HSBC's failure to stop money laundering through accounts tied to drug trafficking in Mexico. The bank is accused of shipping $7 billion in cash from Mexico to the United States in 2007 and 2008 despite several warnings that the money was coming from cartels that needed a way to return their profits to the United States.
In many of the cases detailed in the report, the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency is said to have spotted the problematic behavior. But in nearly every case, the subcommittee found that the agency gave HSBC only a warning or mild punishment and did not push the bank to make large-scale changes.
The agency ultimately issued a cease-and-desist order against HSBC in 2010 after other law enforcement agencies began looking into the problems. Mr. Levin, though, said that his subcommittee found that some of the problems had not been fixed by the time the subcommittee began looking into them over the last year.
A new chief executive took over at HSBC early last year and he has committed to making sweeping changes at the company. In its statement, the bank laid out several steps it had recently taken to increase oversight of international flows of money.

HEADLINE: Olympic Uniforms: An XXL Issue in America is S in China

BYLINE: MARK MCDONALD


HIGHLIGHT: The news that Chinese factories made the ceremonial uniforms for the U.S. Olympic team has created something of a furor in the United States. But it's barely a blip in Asia. The Olympic chief in Hong Kong says it's "just part of globalization," noting that his team's uniforms are made by a South Korean company. 

 BODY:
HONG KONG - The news that Chinese factories have made the ceremonial uniforms for the 2012 U.S. Olympic team, while creating a furor in the United States, is being greeted with something of a shrug in Asia. 
"It's just part of globalization," Timothy Tsun Ting Fok, president of the Hong Kong Olympic Committee, told Rendezvous. "Clothes are made in China, Vietnam, all over Asia. The limelight should be on the athletes now. This shouldn't be hijacked by politicians." 
If you're all about American patriotism, why are the 2012 US Olympic uniforms made in China?
- ~rice cooker~ (@awkwardnoodles) July 16, 2012
A story in China Daily emphasized a tweeted comment from Nick Symmonds, the American 800-meter runner. 
"Our Ralph Lauren outfits for the Olympic opening ceremonies were made in China," he said. "So, um, thanks China."
With the "um," Mr. Symmonds was being a bit snarky or sarcastic, but China Daily, a government publication, took it as a genuine remark and said the athlete had "expressed his thanks to China." (Mr. Symmonds later tweeted his appreciation of Ralph Lauren's pledge to make the 2014 U.S. Olympic team uniforms in the United States.)
Glad to hear this Ralph Lauren. Incredible clothes, soon to be made in USA!!msn.foxsports.com/olympics/story
- NickSymmonds (@NickSymmonds) July 14, 2012
China's own Olympic uniforms, by the way, can be seen here and here. The Chinese team is outfitted by Li Ning, the eponymous apparel and footwear company founded by the former Olympic gymnast.
Hong Kong's Olympic athletes are being dressed by Fila, one of the committee's official sponsors, but Mr. Fok was unsure where the uniforms were being made. Fila, originally an Italian company, now has South Korean owners. 
Mr. Fok leaves soon for the Summer Olympics, which open July 27. He said he is looking forward to a fitting in London for his official International Olympic Committee apparel, which is also being supplied by Ralph Lauren. Mr. Fok called the sponsorship "a lovely marriage."
Ralph Lauren outfitted U.S. teams in the past two Olympics - Beijing in 2008 and Vancouver in 2010. All those uniforms were made abroad, but drew considerably less outcry than the recent made-in-China revelations. 
There is a U.S. election coming up, of course, which complicates things, and unemployment remains high. 
Senator Harry Reid, the Democratic majority leader, told reporters: "I think they should take all the uniforms, put them in a big pile and burn them and start all over again."
It's me again @ralphlauren about those US Olympic uniforms made in China.Sen Harry Reid says "Burn them & start all over." How bout it?
- mia farrow (@MiaFarrow) July 12, 2012
Xinhua, the official Chinese news agency, said Monday afternoon that Mr. Reid's comments smacked of "narrow nationalism and ignorance."
"The fury over the U.S. Olympic uniforms is just another example of the fierce, and sometimes ridiculous, political fighting going on the Capitol Hill in the year of election, which is dominated by economic growth and job creation," the agency said.
In an interview on CNN, the New York designer Nanette Lepore said American manufacturers could certainly have made the Olympic apparel, noting there are "factories just dying for this kind of an opportunity."
Ms. Lepore, who said she manufactures all her clothes in the United States, said producing clothes abroad is not much cheaper than making them at home. "Because we're representing America, this is an opportunity to show off our manufacturing skills," she said. "It doesn't always have to be because it's cheaper."
As my colleague Eric Wilson reported on the On the Runway blog, Ralph Lauren announced the 2014 uniforms will be made at home.
A company statement said, in part: "Ralph Lauren promises to lead the conversation within our industry and our government to address the issue to increase manufacturing in the United States. We have committed to producing the opening and closing ceremony Team USA uniforms in the United States that will be worn for the 2014 Olympic Games."
The Chicago Tribune Olympic reporter Philip Hersh offered this comment: "Until the U.S. government starts providing funds for Olympic athletes, as every other government in the world does, Congress has no truck telling the U.S. Olympic Committee where to get its uniforms or where they should be made."
Asked if Mr. Reid's combustible suggestion was practical, with just 10 days left before the opening ceremonies in London, Ms. Lepore said it would "actually be possible," but then added that it would be "absurd to try it."
Ed Gillespie, a senior adviser to Mitt Romney, said Sunday that the presumptive Republican candidate "believes we shouldn't politicize the Olympics." 
Mr. Romney, in 1999, stepped in to take over the troubled 2002 Winter Olympics in Salt Lake City.
Bloggers in recent days have been quick to note that torchbearers for the 2002 Games wore uniforms made in Myanmar, formerly known as Burma, which had long been a pariah state due to its brutal military junta. The torch-relay clothing sponsor was , a 60-year-old company based in California. A broad array of U.S. economic sanctions and a trading ban against Myanmar were established in 2008.
Susan Bonfield, 57, a 2002 torchbearer from Washington, told The Guardian that she was shocked and angry when she saw the Myanmar origins of her uniform.
"When I looked at the label for the uniform, I went nuts," Ms. Bonfield said. "When you are sending work representing the U.S. to a military dictatorship, I have an issue with that." 
Do you have an issue with country's Olympic uniforms being made abroad? If Team Great Britain was wearing outfits made in, say, France, would that be an issue for you? Were the U.S. Olympic Committee and the Ralph Lauren company simply being good stewards of the U.S.O.C. budget by offshoring the production of the uniforms? Or was it misguided penny-pinching that caused them to miss a patriotic opportunity?

HEADLINE: After Weekend of Attacks, Romney Campaign Shields Itself With Polls

BYLINE: ASHLEY PARKER


HIGHLIGHT: In a memo released on Monday, Mitt Romney's campaign argues that even after being outspent by the Obama campaign more than two to one, the race between the two men remains increasingly close. 

 BODY:
WOLFEBORO, N.H. - Mitt Romney spent the weekend with his family on Lake Winnipesaukee under assault by President Obama and his top surrogates, who hammered him with accusations that his old company shipped American jobs overseas and continued demanding that he release more back tax returns. But on Monday morning, Mr. Romney's campaign struck back with a message of its own: We're not particularly impressed with Team Obama just yet.
In "The State of The Race: Ballot Narrowing Despite Obama Attack Ads," a memo released on Monday morning by Mr. Romney's pollster, Neil Newhouse, Romney campaign officials argued that even after the Obama campaign outspent them more than two to one, the race between the two men is increasingly close.
Citing three recent polls - Rasmussen, Gallup and McClatchy/Marist - which either show Mr. Obama and Mr. Romney tied or have Mr. Obama up by a two-point margin, the memo mentions the Obama campaign's spate of negative advertising and asks: "What has that bought the Democrats? A closer race - Obama has slipped and support for Gov. Romney has increased." 
This memo, combined with a new, more aggressive posture on the stump that Mr. Romney plans to introduce on Tuesday in Pennsylvania, represents a concerted effort by the Romney campaign to reclaim the narrative of fixing the economy and to turn the heat back on the president. The initiative, dubbed "Obama's Political Payoffs Versus Middle Class Layoffs," will contrast the suffering of middle-class Americans with Obama donors who the Romney campaign claims have received special favors, and comes in response to a series of attacks by the Obama campaign.
On Saturday, the Obama campaign released a new television ad that features Mr. Romney singing a warbling, off-key version of "American the Beautiful" while accusing him of having shipped American jobs overseas. The attack was part of a recent onslaught by Mr. Obama's team intended to paint Mr. Romney as wealthy and out of touch, by turning the focus to the former governor's tax returns and time at the helm of Bain Capital, the private equity firm he helped found. Over the weekend, Mr. Obama crisscrossed Virginia, attacking Mr. Romney's business record, a point his aides hammered home on the Sunday television talk shows.
Mr. Obama's campaign, meanwhile, pointed to other polls showing that its ads are cutting away at Mr. Romney's credibility on the economy, a central theme of his campaign, and said Mr. Romney was "desperate to change the conversation and avoid very serious questions about his tenure as a corporate buyout specialist."
"But as public polls have shown, the more voters learn about [Mr. Romney's] record of leading investments in firms that were pioneers of outsourcing and investing in foreign tax havens and offshore accounts, the less they trust him," wrote Lis Smith, an Obama campaign spokeswoman, in an e-mailed statement. "It's time for him to come clean and follow decades of precedent by releasing multiple years of tax returns so that voters can learn about his motivations on critical policy initiatives and whether he used his offshore accounts to hedge against the dollar or avoid U.S. taxes. Until then, we're left wondering just what he is hiding."
Despite calls from conservatives, including many donors and supporters, to respond more aggressively, the Romney campaign has chosen largely not to play defense and hit back, saying it would not respond until any damage could be seen in its internal polling. The campaign's outward attitude, at least for now, seems to take a page from the Mad magazine-Alfred E. Neuman school of thought: What, me worry?
"President Obama's campaign will never have a more substantial advertising advantage than it has had over the past few weeks, yet there is no evidence to suggest that the ballot has moved," Mr. Newhouse wrote in his memo, in a section titled "Bottom Line." "If throwing the kitchen sink at Gov. Romney while leveraging a two-to-one ad-spending advantage doesn't move numbers for the President, that's got to tell you something about the state of the electorate: Voters are frustrated with President Obama's failure to keep his promises from the 2008 campaign and don't truly believe the next four years will be any different from the last three and a half."
But the actions of Mr. Romney's campaign belie the unconcerned tone of the memo. On Friday, in a hastily scheduled round of television interviews, Mr. Romney pushed back on the charges that he had remained the figurehead at Bain for several years after 1999 - the year he says he left the firm - and demanded an apology from the president. And this week's sharper tone, accusing Mr. Obama of "systematic favoritism" and steering taxpayer dollars into the pockets of his campaign donors, represents an escalation of Mr. Romney's usual stump speech.
"With long-term unemployment at record levels, incomes and net worth down, and the middle class struggling, we don't need four more years of political payoffs, taxpayer giveaways, and cronyism," a Romney aide wrote in an e-mail, in a preview of what the campaign plans to focus on this week. "We need a plan to fix our economy."

HEADLINE: New Romney Video Features Singing Obama

BYLINE: MICHAEL D. SHEAR and TRIP GABRIEL


HIGHLIGHT: Mitt Romney sought to change the topic in the presidential campaign on Monday with a Web video accusing President Obama of caring more about his donors and friends than the middle class. 

 BODY:
Mitt Romney sought to change the topic in the presidential campaign on Monday with a Web video accusing President Obama of caring more about his donors and friends than the middle class.
Even as he complains about what he calls "disgusting" personal attacks by the president's team, Mr. Romney says in the new video that Mr. Obama has spent his years in the White House steering money and payoffs to his political supporters.
The video shows headlines from news organizations as the viewer hears Mr. Obama singing the opening verse from "Let's Stay to Together" in the background.
"Report: Obama's big-money raisers get key posts, access, stimulus dollars," says one headline from National Public Radio.

Another headline read: "Democratic donors rewarded with W.H. perks."
In a news release accompanying the release of the video, Mr. Romney's campaign attacked Mr. Obama's actions in the White House.
"Middle class families are struggling in the Obama economy," the campaign wrote. "Instead of working to restore their economic security, President Obama is too busy rewarding his biggest donors. The Obama record is one of political payoffs and middle class layoffs."
The new video released is similar to an ad the Obama campaign released on Saturday featuring Mr. Romney singing "America the Beautiful."
The new video comes after more than a week of stinging attacks from Mr. Obama's campaign on the issue of whether Mr. Romney is responsible for Bain Capital's investments in companies that have been accused of outsourcing American jobs. 
Those attacks prompted the Republican candidate to complain vigorously that the president is making unwarranted personal attacks. In a series of five interviews on the cable and television networks on Friday, Mr. Romney called for an apology from the president.
On Monday morning, Kevin Madden, a senior adviser for Mr. Romney, complained about the direction of the discussion from the president's campaign.
"What you are seeing right now is an American public who wants to talk about the issues," he said on the MSNBC program, "Morning Joe."
Another senior adviser to Mr. Romney, Ed Gillespie, pointing to the recent string of poor job reports, accused Mr. Obama of trying to distract voters with "shiny objects'' -- meaning the attacks on Mr. Romney's record at Bain. 
The campaign's response in the next few days will be to call out Mr. Obama's "Chicago-style politics and Chicago-style economics,'' Mr. Gillespie told reporters on a conference call Monday morning.
"We're going to be highlighting some of these examples of how the Obama economy works,'' Mr. Gillespie said. For any voters tuned in during the political doldrum days of mid-July, they can expect to hear more about Solyndra, "crony capitalism" and other examples of how the Romney campaign says "political appointees in Washington, D.C., are making decisions about where investments go and where taxpayer dollars go based on donor connections.''
Mr. Romney, who spent the weekend at his vacation home in New Hampshire, has a relatively light schedule of campaigning this week, with appearances scheduled near Pittsburgh on Tuesday and in Ohio on Wednesday. It remains to be seen whether he can successfully turn the tables on Mr. Obama over whose business practices raise more eyebrows. 
Mr. Gillespie said the Romney campaign had no plans to disclose its own big-donor "bundlers," or to release Mr. Romney's tax returns beyond the 2010 return already disclosed and the candidate's 2011 return, sometime "before the election.''

HEADLINE: Citigroup's Profit Down 12%, but Beats Estimates

BYLINE: NELSON D. SCHWARTZ


HIGHLIGHT: The bank reported profit of $2.9 billion, or 95 cents a share, although its revenue fell to $18.6 billion. 

 BODY:
7:50 p.m. | Updated 
Citigroup on Monday reported that both its revenue and profit fell in the second quarter, underscoring the anemic economic environment financial institutions face in the United States and abroad.
While the results came in ahead of analysts' forecast, net income dropped 12 percent while revenue was down 10 percent from the same quarter a year ago. Citigroup is the country's third-largest bank by assets, behind JPMorgan Chase and Bank of America.
The bottom line, however, was helped by lower credit losses and tight controls on expenses - a major goal of Citigroup's chief executive, Vikram S. Pandit.
The bank's expenses were down 6 percent from the second quarter of 2012 and credit losses fell 31 percent.
"In short, we are on top of the things we can control," Mr. Pandit said during a call with analysts on Monday. "We are managing our expenses closely and making sure we are right-sized for the environment we anticipate."
Citigroup, along with Bank of America, was among the institutions hardest hit by the financial crisis of 2008, and Mr. Pandit has spent the last four years slowly restoring the company to profitability while disposing of weaker assets.
Citi Holdings, the division of the company with the problem assets, recorded a loss of $920 million in the quarter. But that division's assets continue to shrink, falling 28 percent from the same period a year ago.
The increased flow of red ink at Citi Holdings is largely caused by losses on consumer home mortgages as the bank winds down a $100 billion portfolio of soured mortgages, said John Gerspach, Citigroup's chief financial officer.
"It's hard for this portfolio to turn a profit," Mr. Gerspach said. "We're constantly looking to sell those delinquent loans and work our way through it."
Citigroup shares remain far below where they were before the financial crisis, but rallied slightly with Monday's earnings report. Its stock rose 16 cents, or 0.6 percent, to close at $26.81.
In its release, the bank reported earnings of $2.9 billion, or 95 cents a share, with revenue falling to $18.6 billion. Those earnings include a $219 million gain based on how certain company debt is valued, as well as a one-time loss of $424 million on the sale of a stake in Akbank T.A.S., a Turkish bank.
Excluding one-time charges, Citi reported earnings of $1 a share on revenue of $18.8 billion. Analysts had been expecting adjusted earnings of 89 cents a share on revenue of $18.9 billion.
"It's not stellar, but if you look at the broad strokes, revenues were reasonably resilient and they're controlling expenses," said Glenn Schorr, an analyst with Nomura. "It's hard to get too excited about any bank in this environment, but when you factor in that Citigroup is trading at half of tangible book value, the stock is appealing."
"Asia is slowing and Europe is a mess, but Citi was still able to deliver loan and deposit growth in their core businesses," he added.
Supporting the idea that businesses remain more bullish than consumers, Citigroup said that lending to mid-to-large companies jumped 22 percent, while borrowing by consumers increased by 2 percent.
Mr. Gerspach said much of the growth in corporate loans was coming from trade finance, a sector European banks had pulled away from amid economic problems on the Continent. "It opens a window for a bank like us to capture market share and we're doing just that," he said.
As for individual borrowing, Mr. Gerspach noted that "there isn't a lot of consumer loan growth in the U.S. The U.S. consumer is still deleveraging."
Within the more volatile capital markets businesses, results varied sharply by segment. Investment banking fees slumped 21 percent to $854 million, while equity trading revenue fell 29 percent, to $550 million.
As a result of lower expenses and credit losses, income at the securities and banking unit rose 18 percent, to $1.4 billion.
While Wall Street remains a key business for Citigroup, more and more of the company's earnings are coming from its consumer bank as well as its giant transaction services business, which helps businesses process payments and manage internal capital.
The two divisions - global consumer banking and transaction services - contributed 73 percent of the bank's revenue in the second quarter of 2012, up from 46 percent two years ago. The remaining 27 percent came from its securities and banking unit.
Asked about the Libor scandal now rattling the broader banking industry, Mr. Pandit and Mr. Gerspach both said Citigroup was cooperating with requests for information from several jurisdictions.
But Mr. Pandit suggested that Citigroup might fare better than institutions like Barclays, which are facing large penalties in settling Libor-related claims. Last month, Barclays agreed to pay $450 million to British and American regulators to settle claims that it had manipulated how Libor is set.
"The only thing I can say is, Do not infer from the situation of one Libor-submitting bank that every bank is the same," said Mr. Pandit.
In a sign that the bank's balance sheet is gradually strengthening, Citigroup said its Tier 1 common ratio under the Basel III accords increased to 7.9 percent in the second quarter, up from 7.2 percent in the first quarter. Under Basel I, which is currently in effect, Tier 1 common equals 12.7 percent. The ratio, a measure of the bank's ability to absorb losses, is closely watched by investors, especially since the Federal Reserve turned down a proposal by the bank to raise its dividend earlier this year because of capital concerns.
Citigroup's dividend, now at just one cent per quarter, is expected to eventually be raised, but not before 2013.
Like other large banks, Citigroup is trimming its ranks, with total employees worldwide falling by 2,000 - to 261,000 from 263,000 - in the last three months, but Mr. Gerspach said he did not foresee "massive" job cuts.

TOP STORIES
U.S. Is Building Criminal Cases in Rate-Fixing | As regulators ramp up their global investigation into the manipulation of interest rates, the Justice Department has identified potential criminal wrongdoing by big banks and individuals at the center of the scandal.
The department's criminal division is building cases against several financial institutions and their employees, including traders at Barclays, the British bank, according to government officials close to the case who spoke on the condition of anonymity because the investigation was continuing. The authorities expect to file charges against at least one bank later this year, one of the officials said.
The prospect of criminal cases is expected to rattle the banking world and provide a new impetus for financial institutions to settle with the authorities. The Justice Department investigation comes on top of private investor lawsuits and a sweeping regulatory inquiry led by the Commodity Futures Trading Commission. Collectively, the civil and criminal actions could cost the banking industry tens of billions of dollars. DealBook »

HEADLINE: Capital Can't Be the Only Line of Defense

BYLINE: NEAL S. WOLIN


HIGHLIGHT: Opponents of the Wall Street Reform Act have discovered newfound enthusiasm for strong capital requirements in recent weeks, while attacking other crucial elements of reform, writes Neal S. Wolin, deputy secretary of the Treasury Department. 

 BODY:
The recent trading losses at JPMorgan Chase have highlighted a bright spot of bipartisan consensus on financial reform: strong capital requirements are essential for preventing future financial crises.
This was one of the central - and simplest - lessons of the 2008 financial crisis, one the Obama administration took to heart from the beginning. In June 2009, President Obama called for financial firms to hold more capital to increase their ability to withstand potential losses. In the three years since, the administration has worked with Congress, the Federal Reserve and other financial regulators to put stronger capital requirements at the core of our efforts to strengthen the financial system.
 Those efforts began by requiring the largest, most complex banking institutions to substantially improve their capital cushions. They continue as we implement heightened capital, leverage and liquidity standards under the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act and through the Basel and G-20 new global standards.
As a result of these efforts, our financial system is more stable, and our nation's banks are in a far stronger position.
The quality of capital is substantially improved, with firms holding higher amounts of the types of capital best able to absorb losses. Today, industrywide Tier 1 common capital levels are more than $1 trillion - up 70 percent, or $420 billion, from three years ago. Banks have also curtailed their reliance on short-term funding, reducing their vulnerability to losses of liquidity in the financial markets.
In recent weeks, opponents of the Wall Street Reform Act have discovered newfound enthusiasm for strong capital requirements, while attacking other crucial elements of reform, which they continue to attempt to delay, weaken or roll back.
While improving capital standards at banks is necessary for building a stronger, more stable financial system, it is not sufficient. Addressing the flaws in our financial system that the crisis brought to light entails substantially more than bolstering banks' reserves.
First, other financial institutions - not just traditional banks - must hold capital, too. Without the Wall Street Reform Act, banks would still be the only financial institutions subject to federal capital and prudential standards. Large financial companies that could become tomorrow's versions of Lehman Brothers or Bear Stearns would continue to operate without them. Nor would many of the largest firms trading in the $700 trillion derivatives market, as the American International Group did in the years before the crisis, be required to hold capital to protect themselves against potential losses.
Second, in a free-market economy, mistakes are part of risk-taking, and even a well-capitalized firm is not immune to failure. Without the additional protections in the Wall Street Reform Act, however, taxpayers rather than managers and investors would remain at risk of bearing the cost of the failure of a major financial firm. Even in good times, banks could continue to risk taxpayer dollars by making high-risk investments with federally insured consumer deposits.
Third, strengthening bank balance sheets against unexpected losses will not protect American families from unfair, deceptive or abusive business practices. Without the Wall Street Reform Act, consumers would continue to lack an effective advocate to help ensure financial institutions treat them fairly and transparently.
The Wall Street Reform Act improves capital standards, while also addressing these additional flaws in our financial system, each of which played a role in worsening the crisis.
The law subjects large, interconnected financial firms to the same comprehensive oversight and capital standards as traditional banks. It brings oversight and transparency into derivatives markets and sets new standards for the firms that trade in them. It allows regulators to safely unwind a large firm if it faces failure, so that investors and management, not taxpayers, will be responsible for bearing the costs. It prevent banks, through the Volcker Rule, from undertaking high-risk proprietary trading while simultaneously managing consumer deposits. And it establishes the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, which is helping consumers gain access to honest, straightforward information about financial products, while also making sure consumer laws are implemented and enforced.
Although opponents suggest that increased capital can do the bulk of the work necessary to protect our financial system from the next crisis, capital alone is not enough to achieve lasting change.
Recent events, from JPMorgan's trading losses to continued uncertainty in Europe, only increase our determination to finish the job of translating the lessons of the financial crisis into comprehensive protections for American taxpayers and consumers.

HEADLINE: Occupy Hong Kong's Fate Now in a Court's Hands

BYLINE: NEIL GOUGH


HIGHLIGHT: The Occupy movement, whose members have been encamped outside HSBC's headquarters in Hong Kong for nine months, on Monday fended off a first legal bid by HSBC seeking to evict the protesters. 

 BODY:
HONG KONG - As global movements against capitalism go, the members of Occupy Hong Kong have demonstrated surprising staying power.
If ever there was a city where pure or considerably unfettered capitalism has approached its logical end, surely Hong Kong is it. The city is home to more billionaires than popularly elected legislators. It has more Cartier, Gucci, Hermès and Louis Vuitton boutiques than Hong Kong Island has hospitals or post offices. Buddhism and Taoism are the main religions here, but bank branches outnumber temples by more than two to one.
"In Hong Kong, if you don't follow the rules set by big corporations and big capitalism, you just cannot survive," said Tiv Wong, a young publishing industry freelancer who has been active in the Occupy movement.
Even against this backdrop, Occupy Hong Kong has stayed on for nine months. But the protest in Hong Kong - where demonstrators have staked their claims to an open-air plaza beneath the Asian headquarters of HSBC in Central, Hong Kong's financial district - may be in its last days.
On Monday, a legal bid by HSBC to obtain a court order to evict the protesters came before a judge for the first time.
Many in the city are surprised that the bank waited so long to take action. But the first hearing ended in a draw, as the court allowed time for the three named defendants, who have no lawyers and are representing themselves, to submit reasons that they should be allowed to stay.
Two defendants, Ho Yiu-shing and Wong Chung-hang, are promoting the Occupy movement's goals. The third, Mui Kai-ming, is protesting against HSBC over the execution of his sister's will.
A follow-up hearing was scheduled for Aug. 13, effectively giving the occupiers an extra month at their camp. Still, the case could result in a clash that might become ugly.
"If there's an order for us to move out at last, we will try our best to stay," Mr. Wong said. "Of course, some of us don't believe in law and may not follow the court order."
It may seem surprising that the protesters in Hong Kong have managed to lay their claim to their site even as their counterparts at Zuccotti Park in Manhattan and at St. Paul's Cathedral and Finsbury Park in London have long since been evicted by the authorities or decamped of their own accord.
But a look at the wealth gap in Hong Kong indicates how the idea of the Occupy movement has captured a degree of support.
Hong Kong's boom throughout much of the previous century was driven by waves of immigration from mainland China. Behind nearly every tycoon's fortune in the former British colony is a version of a rags-to-riches tale that had woven itself into the city's ethos by the time it was handed back to Chinese sovereignty in 1997.
But disenchantment with this dream has grown in recent years as the wealth gap has widened, property prices have soared and average citizens have become increasingly priced out, in many cases by well-heeled investors and visitors from the Chinese mainland. The average home price is around 13 times the median annual household income.
Hong Kong's Gini coefficient, a measure of income inequality in which zero represents perfect equality and 1 means one person holds all the income, rose to 0.537 last year, according to government figures released last month. That is the highest reading for any developed economy in Asia.
At the same time, a growing reaction against perceived collusion between big business and an undemocratically elected government has sent demonstrators into the streets. Hundreds of thousands marched in an annual pro-democracy rally on July 1 and, in smaller numbers, the Occupy protesters have gathered supporters.
"It was once thought that people like Li Ka-shing were cultural heroes and everybody could become rich if you worked hard enough and a few breaks came your way," said Gordon Mathews, a professor of anthropology at the Chinese University of Hong Kong, referring to the Hong Kong tycoon who is considered the wealthiest man in Asia.
"Today, increasingly, people don't think that, and they have become much more cynical about the gap between rich and poor," Professor Mathews said. "This is having a fairly remarkable effect on Hong Kong."
The Occupy encampment is a case in point. Though it has dwindled from a peak of 100 to 200 protesters last autumn, 10 to 20 people still gather at the site for twice-a-week meetings, and a handful of stalwarts remain in residence around the clock.
On Saturday afternoon at the plaza beneath the HSBC building, only three middle-age occupiers were visible. One was napping on a sofa. A dozen or so tents were mostly empty except for simple bedding, household items and protest signs.
Alan Chiu, 48, a technology specialist who is unemployed, has been living at the camp full time for the last two months. He says things have gone smoothly, except when one member of the proudly leaderless group tried to proclaim himself the one in charge. That member has since moved nearby, where he camps alone in front of a row of automated teller machines.
HSBC's patience with the occupiers, however, has run its course. The bank's Hong Kong unit filed deeds and leases dating to 1857 as part of its lawsuit, which names three individual protesters and "defendants whose names are not known," who are identified as "the occupiers."
According to the filings, the plaza beneath the skyscraper was deeded during construction in 1983 as a "dedicated area for the purposes of public pedestrian passage." But the title documents also require the bank to keep the property "in a clean and tidy construction and free from any obstruction," according to an affidavit from HSBC's chief operating officer in Hong Kong, Mark Ivan Boyne.
Mr. Boyne says the camp has resulted in stained granite tiles, required the bank to cancel activities and charity events planned for the space and created safety concerns over debris and cooking over open and gas fires.
"As the occupation continues, the hygiene situation is deteriorating and will likely continue to deteriorate," his affidavit said.
Camp or no camp, some see the movement as indicative of problems in contemporary Hong Kong, as younger protesters become increasingly vocal in their complaints against a deeply unpopular government.
First- and second-generation immigrants from the communist mainland may be wary because many of them "did have a better life during the heyday of capitalism under British rule," said Chris Chan King-chi, an assistant professor in the department of applied social sciences at the City University of Hong Kong, who supports the Occupy movement.
"Especially because full democracy has not been achieved in Hong Kong," he continued, "the general public will be of the view that the origin of our current problems is the government, rather than capitalism."

HEADLINE: Republican 'Super PACs' Donate Millions for General Election

BYLINE: NICHOLAS CONFESSORE


HIGHLIGHT: Restore Our Future, the "super PAC" affiliated with Mitt Romney's presidential campaign, raised more than $20 million in June, an official said on Monday, at least half from the casino billionaire Sheldon Adelson and his wife, Miriam. 

 BODY:
The megadonors who bankrolled "super PACs" during the Republican presidential primary are now turning their attention to the general election, with some top donors pouring millions of dollars into Republican efforts.
Restore Our Future, the super PAC affiliated with Mitt Romney's presidential campaign, raised more than $20 million in June, an official said on Monday, at least half from the casino billionaire Sheldon Adelson and his wife, Miriam. The couple also poured $5 million into the YG Action Fund, a super PAC started by former aides to the Republican House majority leader, Eric Cantor of Virginia, according to filings with the Federal Election Commission. The financier Bruce Kovner and his wife, Suzanne, gave $250,000 to the group.
The Congressional Leadership Fund, a group devoted to Republicans running for the House, raised $1.3 million in June, with $1 million from the Texas homebuilder Bob J. Perry, who contributed heavily to Republican super PACs during the primary.
Those totals do not include the millions of dollars being funneled into tax-exempt groups that are politically active but are not required to register with the Federal Election Commission or disclose their donors.
Democratic-leaning groups trailed their Republican counterparts but saw significant upticks in fund-raising. Priorities USA Action, the pro-Obama super PAC, raised $6.1 million in June, an official there said on Monday, its best month yet.
Overall, Priorities USA and three other pro-Democratic super PACs raised more than $25 million during the second quarter of 2012. 
Haim Saban, an entertainment executive, donated $1 million to a joint account set up by three of the Democratic super PACs, according to Federal Election Commission filings last week, following a lengthy courtship by party officials.

HEADLINE: Senator Murray Says Democrats Will Let Tax Cuts Expire

BYLINE: JONATHAN WEISMAN


HIGHLIGHT: Republicans quickly counterattack after Senator Patty Murray of Washington says the wealthy must pay their fair share. 

 BODY:
Senator Patty Murray of Washington, a member of the Democratic leadership, said on Monday that her party is prepared to allow all of the Bush-era tax cuts to expire and for automatic spending cuts to kick in unless Republicans give up their opposition to tax increases on the wealthy.
Ms. Murray's tough line, in a speech at the Brookings Institution, signaled a stiffening of Democratic resolve a week after President Obama reiterated his demand for a one-year extension in the Bush-era tax cuts only for people earning less than $250,000. The Murray speech kicked off intense counterattacks from Republicans who charged that Democrats are steering the nation back into economic recession.
"In their near-fanatical crusade to inflict even more pain on American businesses, Democrats are now openly admitting that they plan to wait until this debate reaches full throttle and Americans are panicked about the outcome to do anything, because they think it will make it likelier they'll get their way," said Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, the Republican leader. "And if they don't, then so be it. They're ready to accept the economic and fiscal consequences."
The rising volume on the debate may put to rest expectations that Democrats are preparing to quickly fold, as they did in 2010 when Mr. Obama agreed to extend all the expiring tax cuts for two years in exchange for his own payroll tax cuts and an extension of unemployment benefits. That two-year extension expires Jan. 1, which is also when more than $1 trillion in across-the-board spending cuts to defense and domestic programs over 10 years begin. The nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office said if the nation hurtles over that "fiscal cliff," the economy will likely lapse back into recession.
But Democrats are hanging tough, at least for now.
"If we can't get a good deal, a balanced deal that calls on the wealthy to pay their fair share, then I will absolutely continue this debate into 2013 rather than lock in a long-term deal this year that throws middle-class families under the bus," Ms. Murray said.
Liberal-leaning interest groups have said for months that a resolution on the tax rates and spending cuts need not be reached before Jan. 1. Tax cuts can be adjusted retroactively, as they have been done in the past. And the automatic cuts will go into force gradually, not all at once. The bigger issue is the uncertainty created by the looming deadlines, but Democrats said uncertainty is not enough to force a surrender.
Ms. Murray gave voice to another point that some Republicans are whispering off the record. Once the Bush tax cuts lapse, any renewal of the tax cuts - even if the rich are left out - would be scored by budget analysts as a tax cut. That would free Republicans from the "no new taxes" pledge they make to Grover Norquist's Americans for Tax Reform.
"If the Bush tax cuts expire, every proposal will be a tax cut proposal and the pledge will no longer keep Republicans boxed in and unable to compromise," she said.
Bipartisan negotiations have begun informally in the Senate over ways to at least avoid the half-trillion dollars in automatic defense cuts - or sequestration - that will begin next year unless Congress intervenes. But again, Ms. Murray said no deal is possible without Republicans relenting on taxes.
"Anyone who tells you sequestration is going to simply disappear because both sides want to avoid it is either fooling themselves, or trying to fool you. It is going to have to be replaced, and that replacement is going to have to be balanced," she warned.
For now, Republicans are showing little public sign of relenting in what Mr. McConnell called "a high-stakes game of chicken with the single-minded goal of taking more money from the people who earn it for the government to waste."
Senator Orrin Hatch, Republican of Utah, said: "They are playing games not only with the economy, but they are playing games with people's livelihoods. This is a disgrace."

HEADLINE: Behind Jeers for Clinton in Egypt, a Conspiracy Theory With U.S. Roots

BYLINE: ROBERT MACKEY


HIGHLIGHT: Many Egyptians who vented their rage during Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton's visit appear to have been inspired by fears that the Obama administration harbors a secret, pro-Islamist agenda. 

 BODY:
Updated | Tuesday, 10:03 a.m. The news that Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton's motorcade was pelted with shoes and tomatoes by Egyptian protesters, who also taunted her by chanting "Monica! Monica!" as she left the U.S. consulate in Alexandria on Sunday, delighted conservative bloggers in the United States.
What has attracted less attention, however, is the extent to which the Egyptians who vented their rage during Mrs. Clinton's visit appear to have been inspired by fears that the Obama administration harbors a secret, pro-Islamist agenda which originated with American conservatives.
As my colleague Kareem Fahim reported on Sunday, some political opponents of the Muslim Brotherhood in Egypt claim that the United States even plotted to install the Islamist party's presidential candidate in office. "Although wildly counterintuitive," my colleagues David Kirkpatrick and Mayy El Sheikh observed on Saturday, "that conspiracy theory has tapped into the deep popular distrust here of the United States." 
The strength of that belief was on full display on Saturday in Cairo, as hundreds rallied outside Mrs. Clinton's hotel, waving placards that read: "Stop U.S. funding of the Muslim Brotherhood," "Clinton is the supreme guide of the Muslim Brotherhood" and "To Hillary: Hamas will never rule Egypt," suggesting an even-wider conspiracy, including the Islamists in neighboring Gaza.

The Egyptian writer Bassem Sabry reported on Twitter that the protesters at Saturday's rally roared their approval when they were addressed by Tawfik Okasha, the host of a popular television program who has been called "Egypt's Glenn Beck," because of his embrace of conspiratorial thinking and hatred of political Islam. Last month, Mr. Okasha insisted that the presidential election had been rigged at the behest of the U.S. to deny Ahmed Shafik, a former general who was Hosni Mubarak's last prime minister, the victory he earned at the ballot box.
Mr. Sabry also noted evidence of a desire among some in the crowd to remind Mrs. Clinton of her husband's infidelity with a White House intern.
I really don't understand what this anti-Hillary protest sign says. But the picture sort of hints towards the meaning http://t.co/h2bQ7xyR

Pressed by American reporters to explain where they got the idea that their new Islamist president, Mohamed Morsi, had been foisted on them through a U.S. plot, rather than the will of the majority, several Egyptians cited information gathered from American blogs or news sites.
An Egyptian-American Christian who met Mrs. Clinton on Sunday cited recent claims by Representative Michele Bachmann, a Republican, "that the Obama Administration is pursuing a closeted pro-Muslim agenda," in a conversation with Time magazine's correspondent, Abigail Hauslohner.
Rumors that the Obama administration has provided the Muslim Brotherhood with billions of dollars in aid remain an article of faith with many Egyptians who are convinced that Mr. Morsi's victory was a sham, despite repeated efforts by the U.S. Embassy in Cairo to correct the record on Twitter.
.@matchbox20 Fact: US has given NO money to MB. Funds you refer to are $1.3bil in military aid and 250 mil in econ aid
- US Embassy Cairo (@USEmbassyCairo)9 Jul 12
In an online conversation on Monday, when Matt Bradley of The Wall Street Journal asked an Egyptian blogger named Sara Ahmed for proof that the Obama administration was "financing" the Muslim Brotherhood, she directed him to a blog post about American aid to Egypt by an ultra-conservative Canadian blogger, Judi McLeod. Ms. McLeod's post was based on a news story posted on Lucianne.com, a site run by Lucianne Goldberg, an American conservative who played a central role in the Monica Lewinsky scandal. 
As Mr. Bradley pointed out to Ms. Ahmed, though, Ms. McLeod had badly garbled the original news report, which simply said that the U.S. had decided to release $1.3 billion in aid to Egypt's military in April. Ms. McLeod falsely reported that the money had been given instead to a delegation of Muslim Brotherhood leaders who visited Washington around the same time.
Very ironic that the source of the US$1.5 billion to the Brotherhood rumor is actually money the US gives the Egyptian military.
- Matt Bradley (@MattMcBradley)16 Jul 12
Ms. Ahmed then directed Mr. Bradley to a transcript of a recent conversation between two American conservatives who claimed that Mrs. Clinton's deputy chief of staff, Huma Abedin, was participating in a Muslim Brotherhood plot "to penetrate our government."
@MattMcBradley http://t.co/EAOZEaop
you can ask him for more details if you like
- Sara Ahmed (@EgyPrincess1)16 Jul 12
The conversation was an episode of a Web radio program hosted by Frank Gaffney, who served in the Reagan administration and now leads the effort to block what he calls the Brotherhood's secret plot to impose Islamic Shariah law on Americans.
This year, Mr. Gaffney's organization, the Center for Security Policy, released a 10-part lecture series, "The Muslim Brotherhood in America: The Enemy Within," in which he lays out what he sees as the entire conspiracy in great detail.
In a letter to the State Department's deputy inspector general last month, Ms. Bachmann, the Republican congresswoman, cited Mr. Gaffney's video series to explain her concerns about American diplomatic "policies and activities that appear to be the result of influence operations conducted by individuals and organizations associated with the Muslim Brotherhood." A copy of the letter posted online by the St. Cloud Times in Ms. Bachmann's home state of Minnesota shows that she also cited Mr. Gaffney to accuse Mrs. Clinton's aide, Ms. Abedin, of being at the nexus of an Islamist plot which explained why the State Department had been "assisting the realization of the Brotherhood's goals."
The episode of Mr. Gaffney's Web radio show that Ms. Ahmed cited was a conversation, on the Fourth of July, with a retired American general, William G. Boykin.
As my colleague Erik Eckholm reported in January, "General Boykin, a longtime commander of Special Operations forces, first caused controversy after the Sept. 11 attacks when, as a senior Pentagon official, he described the fight against terrorism as a Christian battle against Satan." 
In 2003, after General Boykin was appointed deputy undersecretary of defense for intelligence, The Los Angeles Times reported that he had made a speech at a church in Florida in which he recalled being certain that he would capture a Muslim warlord in Somalia because, "I knew that my God was bigger than his. I knew that my God was a real God and his was an idol."
Despite Mr. Bradley's effort to convince her that General Boykin did not possess any inside information, Ms. Ahmed remained resolute in her belief that a former official who served in such a high position in the Pentagon would not make such accusations without proof.
@MattMcBradley he is not! he said it's fact and reality - such former senior wouldn't say such thing without proof!

HEADLINE: R.B.S. Fighting Bid for Data in Rate Case

BYLINE: BEN PROTESS, AZAM AHMED and IAN AUSTEN


HIGHLIGHT: Even as lawmakers in London hammered a top Barclays executive over the bank's role in a rate-rigging scandal, the Royal Bank of Scotland, which is largely owned by the British government, is fighting an investigation into the vast scheme. 

 BODY:
Even as lawmakers in London hammered a top Barclays executive over the bank's role in a rate-rigging scandal, another financial firm that is largely owned by the British government is fighting an investigation into the vast scheme.
The Royal Bank of Scotland, one of more than 10 banks under scrutiny from authorities around the globe, is refusing to turn over crucial information to Canadian regulators, court documents from Ottawa show.
The bank, in which the British government holds an 82 percent stake, is an unlikely foe.
 British lawmakers have taken the lead in publicly shaming executives and regulators who failed to curb interest rate manipulation before and after the 2008 financial crisis. And the pushback comes in contrast to the more conciliatory approach of several institutions ensnared by the global investigation.
Barclays, which last month agreed to pay $450 million to British and American authorities for improperly influencing interest rates, cooperated with the multiyear case, although it too dragged its heels on producing documents at first. Some European banks are now scrambling to strike deals with authorities, according to lawyers close to the case.
The Canadian court documents, collected over the last year, hinted that two other big banks were aiding authorities. Those banks are UBS and Citigroup, according to people close to the matter.
Many banks are trying to avoid the fallout that has hit Barclays, which has prompted the resignation of two top executives. On Monday, British politicians took aim at one of the Barclays executives, Jerry del Missier, the bank's former chief operating officer. Barclays was "up to its armpits in dishonest activity," said Pat McFadden, a British politician who sits on the committee overseeing the testimony.
The Royal Bank of Scotland said on Monday that it was "cooperating with regulators in their investigations." But in the court documents, the bank said it was unable to share certain information with Canada's Competition Bureau because of British law. Further, the bank said that sharing the documents would amount to an "unreasonable search and seizure" and violate its "privilege against self-incrimination."
"We want to cooperate with the C.C.B. and have proposed ways to do that which allow us to comply with our English legal obligations," the bank said in the statement.
The Canadian investigation spans from 2007 to mid-2010, and encompasses traders at JPMorgan Chase, UBS, Citibank, HSBC, Deutsche Bank and the Royal Bank of Scotland. UBS, the big Swiss bank, is a central target in the broader investigation.
The Commodity Futures Trading Commission, the American regulator that started the interest rate investigation in 2008, is pursuing a potential civil case against the bank, according to people briefed on the matter. UBS has also already reached an immunity deal with an arm of the Justice Department, which could protect the bank from criminal prosecution under certain conditions.
While whispers of the wide-ranging investigation emerged in the early days of the 2008 financial crisis, the scandal came into focus last month when Barclays settled with the trading commission and the Justice Department and the British Financial Services Authority. Authorities had accused the bank of trying to manipulate an interest rate to protect profits and to project a stronger image of its health to skittish markets.
The inquiry centers on the London interbank offered rate, or Libor. The benchmark underpins the pricing on trillions of dollars in financial products, including mortgages and credit cards.
At least nine government agencies - including authorities in the United States, Canada, Britain, Switzerland and Japan - are examining wrongdoing. The Justice Department is also building potential criminal cases against big banks and their employees, including traders at Barclays, according to government officials close to the case.
The Canadian Competition Bureau, like other regulators, is investigating whether several banks colluded to manipulate interest rates. The Canadian regulator is focused on the Libor rates in Japan's currency, the yen.
The Royal Bank of Scotland has been pushing back against the Canadian regulator.
The Ontario Superior Court of Justice in Ottawa has ordered the bank to turn over a variety of documents and records to the government. But the British institution is trying to quash the effort.
In that proceeding, lawyers for the bank argue that their unit in Canada does not have access to the material in question. Transferring it from the parent company to the Canadian unit, the bank argues, would violate British banking and data privacy laws.
But the argument is at odds with the aggressive approach British lawmakers have taken toward the Libor scandal. That the British government has a controlling stake in the Royal Bank of Scotland - and has not shied away from imposing its will on the bank - only adds to the curious standoff. In recent months, the government has moved to rein in executive compensation and curtail the bank's risky businesses.
British politicians have been unflinching in their pursuit of Barclays.
At a parliamentary hearing on Monday, British lawmakers repeatedly asked Mr. del Missier why he was not aware of the manipulation of Libor at Barclays dating back to 2005. He indicated that he told employees to submit lower rates at the behest of regulators, but he said he was not aware of manipulation until 2010.
The political ire was not reserved for the bank alone. Politicians also harshly criticized one of the bank's top regulators.
"This was unregulated, and you were warned about it," George Mudie, a British politician who sits on the committee overseeing the testimony, said to Financial Services Authority officials.
"It should have been settled before this whole thing blew up."

HEADLINE: Tokyo Rally Is Biggest Yet To Oppose Nuclear Plan

BYLINE: By HIROKO TABUCHI

 BODY:
TOKYO -- In Japan's largest antinuclear rally since the disaster at Fukushima, tens of thousands of protesters gathered at a park in central Tokyo on Monday to urge the government to halt its restarting of the nation's reactors.
Organizers said 170,000 people filled a Tokyo square to sing songs, beat drums and cheer on a series of high-profile speakers who called for more Japanese to make their voices heard. The police put the number at 75,000, still making it the biggest gathering of antinuclear protesters since the Fukushima accident last year. 
''To stay silent in the wake of Fukushima is inhuman,'' the Oscar-winning musician Ryuichi Sakamoto told the crowd, which braved soaring temperatures to gather at Yoyogi Park.
Polls suggest that public opinion is still divided over the future of nuclear power in Japan. But a unilateral decision last month by Prime Minister Yoshihiko Noda to start putting the country's reactors back into use has angered many Japanese and galvanized the antinuclear camp.
Antinuclear protests have gained momentum especially here in the capital, where tens of thousands of protesters now gather every week to shout slogans in front of Mr. Noda's official residence.
After the rally, protesters marched through some of the city's busiest shopping districts, prompting curious looks from passers-by but largely maintaining a strict discipline that has come to characterize the antinuclear rallies in recent weeks.
''It doesn't matter, for now, if people hear us or not,'' said Ayuko Higashi, an illustrator from Kamakura, southwest of Tokyo, who said this was her third antinuclear rally. ''It's just a big step forward to start raising our voices.''
Rally organizers have gone to great lengths to project a friendly image in a generally conformist country where protesters of any kind are seen by many as fringe agitators at best and terrorists at worst. This perception is left over from mass protests in the 1960s and '70s against a security treaty with the United States, during which rioters armed with pipes and makeshift gasoline bombs clashed with the police.
At the weekly protests in front of the prime minister's office, organizers cordon off family-only zones to urge parents with children to participate. They also ask protesters to cooperate with the local police and to go home at 8 p.m. on the dot.
Organizers have also started issuing pamphlets with advice on what to bring (drinks and hand wipes on sticky days), advice for shy or first-time participants (no need to say anything) and guidance on what to do if fellow demonstrators start getting out of hand (politely ask them to calm down).
An unlikely leader of the antinuclear movement is a fuzzy fictional character called Monju-kun, who has amassed a following on social networking sites like Twitter for his child-friendly jabs against the government's energy policy.
Monju-kun made a brief appearance at the protest Monday with a colorful stuffed costume. ''The government is restarting our nuclear reactors, and that makes me sad,'' he said to squeals from fans -- many of them families with small children -- waving Monju-kun posters.
''If we're not careful, we could have another nuclear accident, like a fire,'' said Rion Nakajima, 5, who was clutching a balloon emblazoned with a smiling Monju-kun.
''We decided to participate because we want the Japanese government to realize that any mistake it makes now will have serious repercussions for future generations,'' said Rion's mother, Kazuki.
Nuclear power supplied nearly a third of Japan's electricity before the Fukushima accident, but almost all reactors are now offline for checks or maintenance. Japanese leaders pledged last year not to restart any nuclear plant without local approval. But they apparently did not foresee the level of resistance that has since developed, and they have begun to push for plant reopenings, citing economic and security reasons. Last month, Mr. Noda approved the restarting of a reactor in western Japan. Others are expected to be put back into use in the coming months.
Recent polls have shown that public opinion remains divided between those who argue that Japan should abandon nuclear power and those who warn of a crippling energy shortage. A majority favor more stringent checks of reactors.
It is unclear whether the antinuclear protests can become a political force. There is still no significant Green Party in Japan, and the two largest parties say the country, for now, needs its reactors.
Mr. Noda, who initially raised the ire of protesters by calling their rallies ''loud noise,'' said last week that he was fully aware of public opinion both for and against nuclear power.

HEADLINE: Universities Reshaping Education On the Web

BYLINE: By TAMAR LEWIN

 BODY:
As part of a seismic shift in online learning that is reshaping higher education, Coursera, a year-old company founded by two Stanford University computer scientists, will announce on Tuesday that a dozen major research universities are joining the venture. In the fall, Coursera will offer 100 or more free massive open online courses, or MOOCs, that are expected to draw millions of students and adult learners globally.
Even before the expansion, Daphne Koller and Andrew Ng, the founders of Coursera, said it had registered 680,000 students in 43 courses with its original partners, Michigan, Princeton, Stanford and the University of Pennsylvania.
Now, the partners will include the California Institute of Technology; Duke University; the Georgia Institute of Technology; Johns Hopkins University; Rice University; the University of California, San Francisco; the University of Illinois, Urbana-Champaign; the University of Washington; and the University of Virginia, where the debate over online education was cited in last's month's ousting -- quickly overturned -- of its president, Teresa A. Sullivan. Foreign partners include the University of Edinburgh in Scotland, the University of Toronto and EPF Lausanne, a technical university in Switzerland. 
And some of them will offer credit.
''This is the tsunami,'' said Richard A. DeMillo, the director of the Center for 21st Century Universities at Georgia Tech. ''It's all so new that everyone's feeling their way around, but the potential upside for this experiment is so big that it's hard for me to imagine any large research university that wouldn't want to be involved.''
Because of technological advances -- among them, the greatly improved quality of online delivery platforms, the ability to personalize material and the capacity to analyze huge numbers of student experiences to see which approach works best -- MOOCs are likely to be a game-changer, opening higher education to hundreds of millions of people.
To date, most MOOCs have covered computer science, math and engineering, but Coursera is expanding into areas like medicine, poetry and history. MOOCs were largely unknown until a wave of publicity last year about Stanford University's free online artificial intelligence course attracted 160,000 students from 190 countries. Only a small percentage of the students completed the course, but even so, the numbers were staggering.
''The fact that so many people are so curious about these courses shows the yearning for education,'' said Molly Corbett Broad, president of the American Council on Education. ''There are going to be lots of bumps in the road, but this is a very important experiment at a very substantial scale.''
So far, MOOCs have offered no credit, just a ''statement of accomplishment'' and a grade. But the University of Washington said it planned to offer credit for its Coursera offerings this fall, and other online ventures are also moving in that direction. David P. Szatmary, the university's vice provost, said that to earn credit, students would probably have to pay a fee, do extra assignments and work with an instructor.
Experts say it is too soon to predict how MOOCs will play out, or which venture will emerge as the leader. Coursera, with about $22 million in financing, including $3.7 million in equity investment from Caltech and Penn, may currently have the edge. But no one is counting out edX, a joint venture of Harvard and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, or Udacity, the company founded by Sebastian Thrun of Stanford, who taught the artificial intelligence course last year.
Each company offers online materials broken into manageable chunks, with short video segments, interactive quizzes and other activities -- as well as online forums where students answer one another's questions.
But even Mr. Thrun, a master of MOOCs, cautioned that for all their promise, the courses are still experimental. ''I think we are rushing this a little bit,'' he said. ''I haven't seen a single study showing that online learning is as good as other learning.''
Worldwide access is Coursera's goal. ''EPF Lausanne, which offers courses in French, opens up access for students in half of Africa,'' Ms. Koller said. Each university designs and produces its own courses and decides whether to offer credit.
Coursera does not pay the universities, and the universities do not pay Coursera, but both incur substantial costs. Contracts provide that if a revenue stream emerges, the company and the universities will share it.
Although MOOCs will have to be self-sustaining some day -- whether by charging students for credentials or premium services or by charging corporate recruiters for access to the best students -- Ms. Koller and university officials said that was not a pressing concern.
About two-thirds of Coursera's students are from overseas, and most courses attract tens of thousands of students, an irresistible draw for many professors. ''Every academic has a little soapbox, and most of the time we have five people listening to us,'' said Scott E. Page, a University of Michigan professor who taught Coursera's model thinking course and was thrilled when 40,000 students downloaded his videos. ''By most calculations, I had about 200 years' worth of students in my class.''
Professors say their in-class students benefit from the online materials. Some have rearranged their courses so that students do the online lesson first, then come to class for interactive projects and help with problem areas.
''The fact that students learn so much from the videos gives me more time to cover the topics I consider more difficult, and to go deeper,'' said Dan Boneh, a Stanford professor who taught Coursera's cryptography course.
The Coursera contracts are not exclusive, so many of its partner universities are also negotiating with several online educational entities.
''I have talked to the provost at M.I.T. and to Udacity and 2Tor,'' which provides online graduate programs for several universities, said Peter Lange, the provost of Duke University. ''In a field changing this fast, we need flexibility, so it's very possible that we might have two or three different relationships.''
One looming hurdle is overcoming online cheating.
''I would not want to give credit until somebody figures out how to solve the cheating problem and make sure that the right person, using the right materials, is taking the tests,'' said Antonio Rangel, a Caltech professor who will teach Principles of Economics for Scientists in the fall. Udacity recently announced plans to have students pay $80 to take exams at testing centers operated around the world by Pearson, a global education company.
Grading presents some questions, too. Coursera's humanities courses use peer-to-peer grading, with students first having to show that they can match a professor's grading of an assignment, and then grade the work of five classmates, in return for which their work is graded by five fellow students. But, Ms. Koller said, what would happen to a student who cannot match the professor's grading has not been determined.
It will be some time before it is clear how the new MOOCs affect enrollment at profit-making online institutions, and whether they will ultimately cannibalize enrollment at the very universities that produce them. Still, many professors dismiss that threat.
''There's talk about how online education's going to wipe out universities, but a lot of what we do on campus is help people transition from 18 to 22, and that is a complicated thing,'' said Mr. Page, the Michigan professor, adding that MOOCs would be most helpful to ''people 22 to 102, international students and smart retired people.''
Eventually, Ms. Koller said, students may be able to enroll in a set of MOOCs and emerge with something that would serve almost the same function as a traditional diploma.
''We're not planning to become a higher-education institution that offers degrees,'' she said, ''but we are interested in what can be done with these informal types of certification.''
