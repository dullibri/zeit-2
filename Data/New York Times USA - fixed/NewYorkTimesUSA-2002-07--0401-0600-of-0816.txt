HEADLINE: BASEBALL; 
Indians' Owner Faults Yankees

BYLINE:  AP 

DATELINE: MAYFIELD HEIGHTS, Ohio, July 16 

 BODY:
Larry Dolan, the owner of the Cleveland Indians, said yesterday that George Steinbrenner, the Yankees' principal owner, was to blame for some of baseball's economic problems. Dolan criticized Steinbrenner for increasing his payroll through trades for Raul Mondesi and Jeff Weaver. 
"George is a large part of our problem," he said.
 Dolan, whose brother, Charles, is the chairman of Cablevision, said the Yankees were forcing other teams to overspend so they could compete. He used the World Series champion Diamondbacks as an example, saying they "bought themselves a World Series last year." 
 The Yankees, whose cable television games are on the YES Network this year, believe the Dolans are upset because of losing Yankee telecasts from their MSG network, a baseball official said.

HEADLINE: Technology Briefing Internet: Hispanics' Use Of Web Surges 

BYLINE:  By Allison Fass (NYT) (Compiled by Gary Bradford) 

 BODY:
 Hispanics' use of the World Wide Web at home is growing faster than that of any other ethnic group in the United States, according to Nielsen/NetRatings. The online Hispanic population grew 13 percent, to nearly 7.6 million, Nielsen/NetRatings found, compared with an overall Web population growth of 3 percent, to almost 105 million. The percentage of Web users who identified themselves as Asian or Pacific Islander grew 6 percent, to nearly 2.4 million; the Caucasian group grew 4 percent, to more than 94 million; and African-American users increased 3 percent, to nearly 7.8 million. The online growth of the Hispanic population is "a great opportunity for marketers and businesses," said Carolyn Clark, a media analyst at Nielsen/NetRatings, based in New York.

HEADLINE: Technology Briefing Internet: Online Job Hunting Rises 

BYLINE:  By Bob Tedeschi (NYT) (Compiled by Gary Bradford) 

 BODY:
 Fifty-two million Americans have looked online for information about jobs, and more than four million do so on a typical day, according to a report to be released this week by the Pew Internet and American Life Project. Up to one-third of those who surf for new jobs do so from their current workplace. 
The figures represent an increase of more than 60 percent in the number of online job hunters from March 2000, the report said, reflecting an increase in Internet use and "turmoil and tightening of the job market." In the survey, which was conducted in January among 2,259 Internet users, eight million Americans who had changed jobs in the last two years said that the Internet was "a vital resource" for finding new work.

HEADLINE: CORPORATE CONDUCT: THE IMPACT -- A HavenNo More; 
America Is Losing Aura of Invincibility

BYLINE:  By SUZANNE KAPNER and KEITH BRADSHER 

 BODY:
The one place that always seemed safe for the world's investors -- America -- is slowly losing its aura of invincibility. 
 "People have realized that the United States is subject to the same kind of pressures and imbalances as other countries," said Tim Reese of Insight Investment, a London-based money management firm that stopped increasing its American stock holdings a few months ago. "Although there remain some clear advantages to investing in the United States, when you add in the accounting scandals, the picture becomes much more muddled." 
 Investors "want assurance that these things won't happen again," said Angel Knight, the chief executive of the Association of Private Client Investment Managers and Stockbrokers, which represents 260 firms in Britain, Germany, Belgium and the Netherlands.
Foreign investment in American stocks and bonds totaled $100 billion in the first quarter of 2002, slightly less than a year earlier, according to the Treasury Department. That decline follows several years in which annual foreign investment soared, rising from $278 billion in 1998 to $522 billion in 2001.
But investing in America gets riskier for foreign investors as the dollar weakens, and it suffered the minor humiliation of falling lower than the euro this week.
The National Association of Pension Funds, a British group that oversees more than $1 trillion in assets, is reducing its American holdings and investing more in Europe, where valuations are lower, said its investment director, David Gould.
While the United States stock market looks feeble, many other markets around the world have performed even worse. Major European indexes are down more than the 21 percent decline in the Standard & Poor's 500 composite this year. 
Though temporarily disillusioned with the American system of financial oversight, many foreign investors suggest that the government will react quickly, through legal changes and a stimulative monetary policy by the Fed.
Many analysts also say that if there is going to be a global economic recovery, it will be led by the United States.
East Asia suffered its own string of accounting scandals in its financial crisis in 1997 and 1998, when American leaders urged the region to adopt more open business practices, and business leaders in East Asia have been surprised by the recent problems. But they have been even more surprised by the swiftness of the legislative response in Washington, which stands in contrast to the years of wrangling that followed the Asian financial crisis.
"It looks like in a couple of days the new rules are passed, it's really impressive," said James Lin, the general manager of the Taiwan operations of the Union Bank of California.
C. G. Lai, the managing director of fixed- income and treasury trading at BNP Paribas in Taipei, Taiwan, echoed this point, saying, "If anyone can look at this kind of situation and correct it, it's the Americans."

HEADLINE: BULLETIN BOARD; 
Honoring a Father of Labor Economics

BYLINE:  By Louis Uchitelle

 BODY:
More than 100 of JACOB MINCER'S students and colleagues gathered at Columbia University on Monday to honor the professor, who is considered a father of labor economics. The occasion was his 80th birthday -- and a surprise award of a new annual prize ($50,000) in labor economics, from the Institute for the Study of Labor, based in Bonn, Germany. 
KLAUS F. ZIMMERMANN, the institute's director, billed it as a belated Nobel for a giant in the field. 
 Professor Mincer helped shape techniques to explain phenomena like wage inequality and the growing earnings gap between well-educated workers and those with little schooling. Many of his graduate students have become prominent labor economists. One of them, JAMES J. HECKMAN of the University of Chicago, won a Nobel memorial prize in economics in 2000. Dr. Heckman, one of the conference organizers, said on Monday that the research that earned him the Nobel was a direct descendant of his mentor's pioneering formulations about human capital.

HEADLINE: Poland's Solidarity With America 

BYLINE:  By Aleksander Kwasniewski; Aleksander Kwasniewski is the president of Poland.

DATELINE: WARSAW 

 BODY:
When President Bush spoke at Warsaw University last year, he said that the question was no longer what others can do for Poland, but what America and Poland and all of Europe can do for the rest of the world. His words are more true now than ever. The tragedy of Sept. 11 emphasized the importance of trans-Atlantic solidarity and the need to accomplish the "European project" that was started with the first round of NATO enlargement only three years ago and will continue this fall with further expansion of NATO and then the enlargement of the European Union.
 Sept. 11 reminded all of us again that the values of the democratic world cannot be taken for granted. That is why President Bush's words in Warsaw were so important. We in Poland believe our relations with the United States can help democracy's spread in a world that resists old definitions, but whose threats have to be identified and challenged. We cherish our new role because history has left us with little room for mistakes. 
 Poland enjoys a unique geopolitical perspective. Soon after having initiated the process of democratic transformation, which in early 1989 paved the way for changes that brought down the Berlin Wall and gave freedom to the nations of Central and Eastern Europe, Poland found itself surrounded by seven new neighbors -- Lithuania, Russia, Belarus, Ukraine, Slovakia, the Czech Republic and Germany. And with all of them, we have had good relations. Today, we believe we help export political stability and economic progress to our region of the world.
We still need to strengthen our regional identity and develop a common approach to the issues of our region. A good example is the antiterrorism campaign. Soon after the Sept. 11 attack, Poland was host to an international antiterrorism conference at which 17 nations in the region agreed on a plan for sharing information about potential terrorist activities and about procedures to combat money laundering.
This month in Riga, Latvia, in preparation for the NATO conference in Prague in November, I proposed a new dialogue among the nations of Central, Eastern and southern Europe to strengthen our security cooperation against terrorism. The point is not to create a new formal body, but to seek a regional consensus and partnership. This new partnership would be open to all the nations in the region, with participation from Poland, Hungary and the Czech Republic, three nations that are already members of NATO. For countries in our region that are outside the Euro-Atlantic structures of NATO and the European Union, this dialogue can encourage democratic reforms already begun.
On the economic front, Poland can set an example. Just 12 years ago, more than 70 percent of Poland's gross domestic product came from the state sector. Today, more than 70 percent comes from the private sector. Poland has stabilized its finances. We have been successful in reducing inflation. In 1990, the vast majority of Polish exports went to Eastern European markets, whereas today more than 70 percent of Polish trade is with the European Union. In the course of a decade, we went from a highly centralized, state-controlled economy to an economy with about two million small and medium-sized businesses, which have become the foundation for Poland's economic modernization. Foreign direct investments of more than $50 billion in the past decade have helped to alter the face of Poland and energized a crucial development impulse. American investment is more central to our progress now than ever.
President Bush and I will be discussing these matters in our meetings over the next two days. We will need America as our partner to build on Poland's successes and show the nations of our region that political and economic transformation is possible.

HEADLINE: Mayor Indicates Budget Fixes Could Be Sooner Than Usual 

BYLINE:  By MICHAEL COOPER

 BODY:
As the skittish stock market threatens to further deplete New York City's finances, Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg signaled yesterday that his administration might move to modify the city's month-old $42.3 billion budget sooner rather than later.
 Mayor Bloomberg noted at a news conference that the city had already forecast large deficits for next year and the following year, and said that the volatile stock market could throw those projections off by a billion dollars in either direction. Of the next two years, he said, "nobody should think for a second that we aren't going to have a difficult problem that we have to start facing, and we're going to start facing it very soon." 
 Asked if the mayor was talking about quickly modifying the budget that went into effect on July 1, a mayoral spokesman, Jordan Barowitz, said, "We are aware of the problems in the out years and we will begin to address them presently." 
The city, which just closed a $5 billion budget gap in its new budget, is projecting deficits of $3.7 billion in 2004 and $4.2 billion in 2005. 
Midyear budget modifications are not at all unusual in New York City, which is required by law to end each year with a balanced budget, but significant changes to the budget are not usually made until at least midfall. It is unclear when the Bloomberg administration is thinking about changing this year's budget. 
Mr. Bloomberg made his remarks as City Comptroller William C. Thompson Jr. issued a report cautioning that the city's newly adopted budget still contained a little more than a billion dollars in risks, and a few days before he is scheduled to make a budget presentation to the New York State Financial Control Board. (The board was created during the fiscal crisis of the 1970's and it still monitors the city's budgets.) 
The risks identified in the comptroller's report include federal aid that may not materialize, overtime costs that could turn out to be higher than projected, and new contracts with the city's unions that may prove more expensive than expected. 
The report included a note of warning about the recent corporate scandals that have pummeled the stock market, saying that "the downturn in the stock market doubly affects the city's budget." The loss of earnings will drive down tax collections, the report noted, even as it adds to the city's expenses by forcing the city to contribute more money to its pension funds in order to offset investment losses by the funds.
Mayor Bloomberg said that it was hard to predict what would happen to the economy in the long term, and where it would leave the city's finances. But, he said, "We're going to have to find ways to do more with less, no question about it."

HEADLINE: U.P.S. and Teamsters Reach Deal for a 25% Raise 

BYLINE:  By STEVEN GREENHOUSE 

 BODY:
Facing the threat of another crippling strike, the United Parcel Service announced yesterday that it had reached a tentative six-year pact that will give 210,000 Teamsters a 25 percent increase in wages and benefits.
 The agreement, covering more workers than any other private-sector union contract in the nation, was a victory for the union in other ways, too. U.P.S. promised to convert 10,000 part-time jobs to full-time and to give raises of more than 50 percent to many part-timers. 
 The accord was the biggest test for the Teamsters' president, James P. Hoffa, and gives solid gains to the union at a time when organized labor and millions of workers face difficulties.
With a strike threatened for Aug. 1, the International Brotherhood of Teamsters capitalized on the company's eagerness to avoid a replay of the walkout in 1997 that stopped business for three weeks and caused United Parcel to lose $750 million and many longtime customers. 
"This appears to be a very strong contract, particularly with what else has been happening in labor," Harley Shaiken, a labor expert at the University of California, said. "U.P.S. did not want a strike, and that gave the Teamsters a lot of leverage. In many negotiations, the issue has been the survival of the union or the extent of the cuts. But here a big company that's very competitive was willing to pay rather than have its future damaged."
Mr. Hoffa and other union leaders said the accord would be a model for millions of other union members. Teamster officials said the pact would cost U.P.S. an additional $9 billion over six years and would not reduce health benefits at a time many corporations were reducing their medical plans.
"These negotiations have taken place in an economic climate in which millions of American workers are seeing their health benefits cut and their retirement savings wiped out," Mr. Hoffa said. "We have shown the nation that job and benefit cuts are not inevitable."
The chairman of United Parcel, Michael L. Eskew, acknowledged that the contract might be generous, but said it was affordable and would help the company grow by assuring customers that there would be no work stoppage for at least six years. 
Last week, executives announced that the company was losing business as customers diverted shipments to other companies because they feared a walkout.
The deal was unusual in that it was reached 16 days before the five-year contract expired.
"It was important for us to settle early," Mr. Eskew said in a telephone interview. "We wanted to give our customers the comfort of knowing that we will be there all the way through for them. Nobody wanted a return of the bad situation of 1997."
On Monday, officials from 200 locals that represent United Parcel workers will meet in Washington to vote on accord. Mr. Hoffa predicted that the delegates would ratify the contract and that the rank and file would vote on it over the next month.
The agreement gives a $5-an-hour raise over six years to full-time drivers and warehouse workers who earn $23.05 an hour. That is an increase of 3.3 percent a year and almost 22 percent over six years.
For part-timers, the deal offers raises of $6 an hour over six years. Part-timers earn $8.50 to $20 an hour. Company executives said many part-timers would not receive the full raise because they were college students who quit after a year or two.
The vice president for investor relations, Kurt Kuehn, said that including increases in pension and health payments overall compensation would increase 4 percent a year.
James J. Valentine, a transportation analyst with Morgan Stanley, said the contract was good for U.P.S.
"When you factor in all the elements of the contract," Mr. Valentine said, "it will be only slightly more inflationary than their contract that's to expire. U.P.S. clearly was seeing a reasonable amount of diversion of business in late June and early July. Getting closure on this contract was critical to stem those volume losses."
United Parcel, whose headquarters are in Atlanta, had net income of $2.4 billion last year on revenues of $30.6 billion.
The contract achieves a goal similar to one that Mr. Hoffa's archrival, Ron Carey, the former union president, sought in the 1997 contract, converting part-time jobs to full-time. The company has now promised to convert 2,500 of its 110,000 part-time jobs to full-time each year in the last four years of the contract.
Mr. Hoffa boasted that he did better than Mr. Carey by persuading the company to let nearly 10,000 nonunion workers become Teamsters. Many of those employees work for subcontractors, mostly performing clerical work, and the company agreed to move those jobs in-house, automatically making many of the workers Teamsters. 
Ken Hall, co-chairman of Mr. Hoffa's negotiating team and five years ago head of Mr. Carey's negotiating team, said the talks nearly fell apart on Friday because the company was refusing to convert any part-time jobs to full-time. Mr. Hoffa joined the negotiations on Friday in Washington, and until the agreement was reached late Monday, the talks continued nearly around the clock.
The union tried to bolster its stand by increasing dues payments and arranging a $100 million credit line. The moves were intended in part to finance strike benefits in a walkout.
Clearly viewing the accord as one of his biggest achievements, Mr. Hoffa said, "It is the richest contract in U.P.S. history and will set the tone for all collective bargaining for years to come."

HEADLINE: Dr. Greenspan's Prescription 

 BODY:
The Federal Reserve chairman, Alan Greenspan, memorably defined an economic moment when he declared in late 1996 that the fast-rising stock market was caught up in "irrational exuberance." He did so again yesterday when he warned Congress that the business world had been gripped by an "infectious greed" and that government must take strong steps to clean up corporate leadership. With Congress divided on how to proceed -- the Senate passed a tough corporate fraud bill this week, while the House adopted a weaker one -- Mr. Greenspan's words give powerful ammunition to those arguing for a hard line. 
 Mr. Greenspan's appearances on Capitol Hill are widely seen as a barometer of the strength of the economy. He was cautiously optimistic on that score yesterday, but he had a larger point to make: If our economic system is to function as it should, corporate America and government must get serious about keeping the system honest. The American economy "depends critically on trust," Mr. Greenspan declared. Investors who lack confidence in the system will be reluctant to buy stocks. 
 The White House has tried to fix blame for Enron, WorldCom and other scandals on a few "bad apples" in the nation's boardrooms, but Mr. Greenspan made a strong case that the problem is systemic. It is not that people are greedier, he argued, but rather that "the avenues to express greed" have "grown so enormously." At the same time, institutions that should be protecting shareholders from corporate ripoffs are failing them. To Mr. Greenspan the best form of corporate governing remains control by a strong C.E.O. But he recommended that in exchange for that power C.E.O.'s bear a heavy burden of accurately reporting on the condition of their companies to shareholders and potential investors. 
In the sharply partisan world of Washington, Mr. Greenspan is widely respected on both sides of the aisle. With the markets continuing to tumble -- the Dow fell 166 points more yesterday -- Congress should follow his prescription: Get tough on corporate malfeasance. As the Senate and House work to reconcile their corporate fraud bills, they should favor the Senate's tougher version. President Bush should, too -- and he should take pointers from Mr. Greenspan on how to craft a speech that explains why all Americans have a vital stake in seeing the system fixed.

HEADLINE: Washington Talk; 
Pay Erodes, Judges Flee, And Relief Is Not at Hand

BYLINE:  By LINDA GREENHOUSE 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, July 16 

 BODY:
The men and women in the hearing room were accustomed to exercising power in Washington.
 There were two members of the Supreme Court, Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist and Justice Stephen G. Breyer. There was Paul A. Volcker, former chairman of the Federal Reserve. Among others, there were Constance Horner, who once oversaw the federal work force as director of the Office of Personnel Management, and Donna E. Shalala, once again a college president after eight years in the cabinet. 
 They had come together to discuss the erosion in judicial pay, and all agreed that the failure to keep up both with inflation and with salaries available on other legal-profession career tracks had brought the federal judiciary to a crisis point. "It's reached the place where the institution is threatened with irreparable injury," Justice Breyer said as the others nodded sympathetically.
Resignations from the federal bench, where salaries now range from $150,000 in the district courts to $192,600 for the chief justice, were once nearly unheard of. They have become commonplace, with 70 life-tenured federal judges having resigned or retired (as opposed to continuing to carry a caseload as senior judges) since 1990.
"Our system cannot long tolerate the regular loss of experienced, seasoned judges that is now occurring," Chief Justice Rehnquist said, to more nods of agreement.
Yet by the end of the justices' testimony on Monday, at the start of a week of hearings before the National Commission on the Public Service, it was evident that despite the good will and unanimity of opinion, despite Justice Breyer's colorful charts that showed judges falling behind not only law professors but also judges in Canada and England, these powerful people were powerless.
How could members of Congress, politically afraid to raise their own $150,000 salaries yet unwilling to see federal judges' pay outstrip their own, ever be persuaded to help? Ms. Horner called the linkage to Congressional pay and the daunting obstacle it poses "the elephant in the room." Turning to the chief justice, she asked, "What institutions are capable of making the case?"
"You answer that," Chief Justice Rehnquist said to Justice Breyer. "You have more feel for institutions than I have." 
Whether the handoff was gracious -- Justice Breyer spent his pre-judicial years as counsel to the Senate Judiciary Committee -- or ironic, coming from the court's senior member to its most junior, was impossible to tell. In any event, there was a subtext to the two justices' appearance. It was barely alluded to during the hearing but well known to the audience, composed mostly of judicial branch insiders although the hearing, at the Brookings Institution, was open to the general public.
Four months ago, the two were on opposite sides of an appeal that might have placed the court in the middle of a constitutional as well as political debate over judicial pay. Twenty federal judges had brought a lawsuit charging that Congress violated the Constitution when it reneged on a bargain it made with the judiciary in a 1989 law, the Ethics Reform Act. 
Under that law, the judges received a 25 percent raise and the promise of regular cost-of-living increases in return for giving up the right to earn most types of outside income. But in four of five years from 1995 to 1999, Congress blocked the automatic increases, which also applied to Congressional pay and were politically unpalatable to the new Republican majority. The judges' unsuccessful lawsuit argued that this breaking of the promise amounted to a diminution of judicial pay, forbidden by the "compensation clause" of Article III.
The judges appealed to the Supreme Court, where, for all of Justice Breyer's best efforts, they fell one vote short of the four needed for the court to take their case. Chief Justice Rehnquist, despite his many speeches urging attention to judicial pay, would not provide the fourth vote, for reasons he never explained.
But the two were clearly back on the same page at Monday's hearing before the privately financed commission, a replay of a similar inquiry into the problems of federal government service that Mr. Volcker headed in 1988. Among the commission's concerns is a recent survey showing that federal workers are disillusioned, with 41 percent saying they come to work only for their paycheck and revealing a range of intractable quality-of-life problems.
Judges, by contrast, come to work despite their paychecks, to a job they love, as long as they overlook the fact that their law clerks outstrip them in earnings within a year or two. "I think we have a fabulous job," Justice Breyer said.

PERSON: William F. Gorog 

HEADLINE: William Gorog, 76, Businessman With a Bent for High Technology 

BYLINE:  By ARI L. GOLDMAN 

 BODY:
William F. Gorog, a technology entrepreneur who was one of the first to develop the public's ability to pay over the phone with credit cards and later via the Internet, died Sunday at a hospital in Falls Church, Va. He was 76 and lived in nearby McLean.
 The cause was lung cancer, family members said. 
 Over a 40-year career in business, Mr. Gorog founded and developed numerous technologies that were sold or spun off as separate ventures. In the 1960's, he was a founder and chief executive of the Data Corporation, which originated the computerized information retrieval system that is known today as LexisNexis and used by thousands of businesses, law firms and federal agencies. The company later merged with the Mead Corporation.
At his death, Mr. Gorog was the chairman of the InteliData Corporation, which pioneered the development of electronic banking and bill paying. Early telephone bill-paying systems involved delays of sometimes days while banks were notified, checks were cut and bills were paid. 
InteliData was one of the companies that developed computer systems that could almost instantly make deductions from a customer's account to issue payments. Mr. Gorog founded the company in 1990 as US Order and sold some of the company's technologies to Visa International in 1994.
Mr. Gorog also took a break from business to work as an economic adviser in the Ford administration. He served as the deputy director of the President's Economic Policy Board and later as executive director of the Council on International Economic Policy.
After leaving government, Mr. Gorog established a trading company that exported computer products to the Far East. From 1983 to 1987, he served as the president of the Magazine Publishers of America, a trade group.
In 1987, he became chairman of Arbor International, an investment management company involved in financing energy, technology and real estate ventures. The banking and bill-paying business grew out of his work at Arbor.
Mr. Gorog was born in Warren, Ohio, on Sept. 2, 1925. He learned about business from his father, Frank, who turned the family grocery store into a chain of successful supermarkets. He was a graduate of West Point and Ohio State University and served in both World War II and the Korean War.
Mr. Gorog's community activities include serving as chairman of the board of visitors of the Georgetown University School of Business. He was also a member of the Knights of Malta, a lay order of the Roman Catholic Church.
Mr. Gorog is survived by his wife of 53 years, Gretchen, and six children, Robin, of Aspen, Colo.; Jonathan, of Virginia Beach; Christopher, of Toluca Lake, Calif.; Lesley Gorog Harris, of McLean; Jennifer Gorog Nichols, of McLean; and Peter, of Oakton, Va.; and 21 grandchildren.

HEADLINE: THE MARKETS: STOCKS & BONDS; 
Shares Fall as Investors Ignore Greenspan's Assurances on the Economy

BYLINE:  By KENNETH N. GILPIN 

 BODY:
Prices of blue-chip stocks fell for the seventh consecutive session yesterday, as investors and traders ignored generally reassuring comments from the Federal Reserve chairman, Alan Greenspan, and data that strongly suggested that manufacturing activity was recovering. 
 "Sentiment and psychology have taken over, and they just don't change that fast," said Philip S. Dow, a managing director at RBC Dain Rauscher in Minneapolis. "This thing will wear itself out, but I don't know when." 
 Although ebbing investor confidence is cited as the major hurdle confronting the market, trading recently has been dominated by computer-generated program trades. 
"We haven't seen program trading levels this high, ever," said Paul Hickey, an analyst at Birinyi & Associates, a stock market research firm in Westport, Conn. 
"If people can get 50 cents on a trade, they will do it," Mr. Hickey said. "They are taking bite-sized pieces, and there is no stability."
With the in-and-out nature of such trades, he added, "there is too much volatility to get a decent picture." 
The Dow Jones industrial average opened lower yesterday, after Monday's startling turnaround, when it fell more than 400 points but retraced nearly all of the decline in the final 90 minutes of trading. A Fed report showing industrial production rose 0.8 percent in June failed to produce buyers.
The Dow fell further shortly after Mr. Greenspan began his semiannual testimony to the Senate Banking Committee at 10 a.m. yesterday. 
The slide moderated at midday, but a big sell program sent the average down again with about an hour left in the session.
By the close, the Dow was down 166.08 points, or 1.9 percent, to 8,473.11. 3M, Exxon Mobil, General Electric and Wal-Mart Stores led the index lower. 
Wal-Mart had its biggest one-day loss in 19 months, falling $3.56, to $49.88.
According to Birinyi & Associates, this decline for seven consecutive sessions is only the third in the last 20 years. The most recent occurred last September.
The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index dropped 16.99 points, or 1.9 percent, to 900.94. Consumer stocks contributed almost half the loss. 
The Nasdaq composite index, down 75 percent from its peak in March of 2000, was up early in the day, but the gains were subsequently erased and the index closed at 1,375.26, down 7.36 points, or 0.5 percent. 
Since the start of the year, the Dow is down 15.45 percent, the S.& P. 500 is off 21.53 percent, and the Nasdaq has dropped 29.5 percent. 
"If I stand on my head, everything looks wonderful," said Al Goldman, chief market strategist at A. G. Edwards in St. Louis. 
"The only good news is that Nasdaq is down 75 percent from the peak. The blue chips that have been holding up well are getting smashed."
In his Senate testimony, Mr. Greenspan said the Fed had raised its forecast for economic growth for this year and for 2003. 
Fed analysts now project the economy will grow 3.5 percent to 3.75 percent this year, up from the 3 percent to 3.25 percent they had forecast in February.
Nextel Communications was one of the few bright spots yesterday. 
The mobile phone company reported second-quarter profit on a 25 percent jump in sales and a gain from retiring preferred stock. 
Nextel shares jumped $1.53, or 31 percent, to $6.53. --------------------

Treasury Prices Fall
(By Bloomberg News) -- Treasuries fell for a third trading day in four yesterday as the Federal Reserve chairman, Alan Greenspan, said that the economy's recovery from recession was gaining strength.
By late in the day, the price of the 10-year note declined 15/32, to 101 14/32. The note's yield, which moves in the opposite direction from the price, rose to 4.68 percent from 4.63 percent on Monday. The 30-year bond dropped 27/32, to 99. Its yield increased to 5.45 percent from 5.39 percent.
Following are the results of yesterday's Treasury auction of four-week bills:

HEADLINE: State Officials Ask Bush To Act on Global Warming 

BYLINE:  By JAMES STERNGOLD 

DATELINE: LOS ANGELES, July 16 

 BODY:
In a letter that attacks what it says is the Bush administration's failure to address the looming crisis of global warming, the attorneys general of 11 states have written to the president pressing for strong federal measures to limit emissions of so-called greenhouse gases.
 The state officials argue in the letter, to be sent on Wednesday to President Bush, that his administration's "regulatory void" has left it to the states to piece together a patchwork of inconsistent regulations on the environment and that a strong federal policy would be far more effective. 
 The letter was written as Gov. Gray Davis of California was scheduled to sign a bill on Monday intended to reduce emissions of heat-trapping gases like carbon dioxide. Mr. Davis's approval of the bill, which would require automakers to sell more fuel-efficient cars, had been widely expected since the Legislature passed it. The passage, despite strong opposition from the automobile industry, could prod additional states to take similar measures, because California has by far the largest automobile market in the nation. 
The officials sending the letter to Mr. Bush, all Democrats, indirectly criticized him for saying that the science on global warming had not conclusively proved its existence. The officials cited a report that the administration issued in May, saying it justified strong action to avoid potentially devastating consequences to the environment and public health.
"For these reasons," the officials said, "we write today to urge you to reconsider your position on the regulation of greenhouse gases and to adopt a comprehensive policy that will protect both our citizens and our economy." 
The letter was spearheaded by the attorney general of Massachusetts, Thomas F. Reilly. It was also signed by the attorneys general of New York, Connecticut, New Jersey, California, Alaska, Maine, Maryland, New Hampshire, Rhode Island and Vermont.
The letter also contended that the administration's environmental policies had made problems worse.
"Far from proposing solutions to the climate change problem, the administration has been adopting energy policies that would actually increase greenhouse gas emissions," it read.
A spokeswoman for the White House, Claire Buchan, noted that the National Governors' Association last year and the state environmental commissioners in 2000 rejected calls for mandatory reductions in carbon dioxide emissions.
"The president is working on a bipartisan common-sense approach," Ms. Buchan said.
Mr. Bush's Clear Skies initiative, she said, "would lead to the largest reduction in power plant emissions ever."
The principal greenhouse gas is carbon dioxide, which automobiles, as well as power plants and numerous industries, release into the air. The carbon dioxide retains heat from the sun in the atmosphere, rather than letting it dissipate, contributing to a slow rising of temperatures.
Scientists have shown that the warming, although measured in just a degree or two on average in some places, has already had effects like allowing a proliferation of insects to destroy spruce forests in Alaska and raising the average levels of the oceans. The scientists warn that the warming, if unchecked, could flood coastal areas, disrupt water supplies, cause heat waves and destroy some wetlands and coral reefs while increasing problems from insect-borne diseases.
The amount of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere was relatively constant for 400,000 years, experts say. But with the industrial revolution 150 years ago, it has soared. Carbon dioxide has an unusually long life in the atmosphere, so even with drastic action, experts say, it could take years for Earth to begin cooling again. 
In an interview, Mr. Reilly, the Massachusetts attorney general, criticized Mr. Bush's dismissal of the science on global warming and said there was a new sense of urgency.
"You can't ignore this any longer," he said. "This is not something you can fool around with. The kind of brushoffs we've gotten from the administration are kind of offensive."
David Samson, the attorney general of New Jersey, added that global warming "poses real and immediate dangers to New Jersey's environment and the health of our citizens."
The authors do not specify what they want, but Mr. Reilly said they were seeking at the least caps on the carbon dioxide that power plants emit, as well as increases in average mileage standards for automobiles.
The authors suggest so-called market-based policies. Under such programs, which are used in a number of industries that produce large volumes of gas emissions, companies can profit from lowered emissions by selling their emission "rights" to other companies that produce more gases. The extra costs and the potential profits give companies an incentive to cut back. Conservatives have embraced such market-driven policies in many instances.
"The letter is one that ought to receive a lot of sympathy in the Bush administration," Richard Blumenthal, the attorney general of Connecticut, said, "because it calls for a market-based approach to capping the total greenhouse gases and allocating credits to industries and companies to buy and sell. It's a very Republican approach."
In addition to the action by the California Legislature, a few other states, including New York, are moving in the direction of limiting carbon emissions. 
According to the Natural Resources Defense Council, an environmental group, automobiles produce 25 percent of the carbon dioxide emissions in the country and power plants produce 40 percent.

HEADLINE: His Global Empire in Disarray, DeutscheTelekom Chief Resigns 

BYLINE:  By MARK LANDLER 

DATELINE: FRANKFURT, July 16 

 BODY:
Yielding to intense political pressure and a stubbornly depressed stock price, the chief executive of Deutsche Telekom, Ron Sommer, resigned today as the head of a company he had sought to transform from a state monopoly into a global communications colossus.
 Deutsche Telekom named a former chairman of its supervisory board, Helmut Sihler, 72, as caretaker chief executive for six months. The decision may calm the company's unions, who fear that an outsider would bring drastic change, but it is unlikely to soothe anxious shareholders. 
 "When a chief executive cannot rely on the full confidence of the supervisory board, resignation is the only responsible step left open," Mr. Sommer said at a news conference at company headquarters in Bonn. "I want to play my part in avoiding further damage to the company." 
Mr. Sommer's ouster came after a relentless campaign by the German chancellor, Gerhard Schroder, who fears that Deutsche Telekom's anemic share price could hurt him in elections this fall. Mr. Schroder's conservative opponent, Edmund Stoiber, has called for the government to intervene in solving the company's problems. 
Deutsche Telekom, Europe's largest communications company with $73 billion in annual sales and nearly 200,000 employees, is still 43 percent owned by the German government. It was carved out of the state postal and telecommunications ministry in 1995 and first issued shares in 1996. For millions of Germans, buying the company's shares was their first foray into the stock market.
Mr. Sommer's departure added a prominent new name to the list of European corporate chiefs who have been pushed from their perches in recent months by a lethal combination of ambitious global expansion, plummeting stock prices and increasingly impatient shareholders.
Experts said it also raised hard questions about Germany's effort to modernize its economy. Toppling Mr. Sommer in the heat of a political campaign, and for only a stopgap successor, is a reminder that politics still plays a disruptive role in this country's largest public companies.
"Shareholders were already expressing their anger toward Deutsche Telekom," said Rudiger von Rosen, managing director of the Deutsche Aktieninstitut, a shareholder research group. "But the whole focus in recent days has been political. That hurts our equity culture."
The finance ministry welcomed Mr. Sommer's resignation, which it said would open the door to a new strategy for the debt-ridden company. But on Monday, as the search for a successor became a messy public exercise -- with a who's who of German executives turning down the job -- Mr. Schroder's advisers distanced him from the whole affair.
The reaction today to Mr. Sihler, a former chairman of the consumer products giant Henkel, was cool. Though respected in German industry, he has not been an active manager for a decade. "An interim solution is no solution," said Ulrich Hocker, managing director of one of Germany's largest shareholder associations. "They should have kept Mr. Sommer until they found a permanent chief executive."
Moreover, Deutsche Telekom's board named Gerd Tenzer, a former civil servant and longtime senior manager, as deputy chief executive. When Mr. Tenzer's name emerged on Monday as the government's preferred candidate to succeed Mr. Sommer, the company's already battered share price fell further.
Despite Mr. Tenzer's chilly reception by investors, Mr. Sihler did not rule him out as a potential future leader. Given Mr. Sihler's age and background, analysts said Mr. Tenzer was likely to take a central role in running the company.
Trading here today in Deutsche Telekom stock was volatile. It jumped 8 percent after Mr. Sommer resigned, then gave back some gains after his successor was announced. Late in the day, the shares rose again, closing at 10.93 euros, up more than 6 percent for the day but still down about 90 percent from their peak in early 2000. In New York, the American depository receipts edged up 15 cents, to $11.06.
At a news conference, Mr. Sihler said his primary task would be to find a new chief executive. He reaffirmed that Deutsche Telekom was receptive to finding a merger partner for VoiceStream, the American wireless provider. Mr. Sommer acquired the company last year in a $35 billion deal that crowned his expansionist strategy but was criticized as being too expensive.
Mr. Sihler said Deutsche Telekom was heartened by recent signs of subscriber growth at VoiceStream. And he said the company would not abandon its ambitions to be a global player. "We want to be an international company," he said. "We cannot and will not be a company only in Germany."
Mr. Sommer, a charismatic, Israeli-born executive who charted Deutsche Telekom's growth, remained defiant even as he took his leave. He said the company was on the right course and he criticized the political interference, which he said had harmed the company.
Mr. Sommer had waged a spirited battle to hold on to his job, taking out newspaper ads in his defense and rallying employees to march in front of corporate headquarters in Bonn before today's meeting.
About 200 employees, who had been bused in from the company's regional offices, blew whistles and carried signs that said, "Without Sommer, things look dim."
Even some Deutsche Telekom investors advocated that Mr. Sommer stay -- which was remarkable, given that they had been calling for his head for months. At the annual meeting in May, a line of angry shareholders castigated Mr. Sommer for the stock price. "We invested in a high-risk junk stock," said Jella Benner-Heinacher, speaking for an association of small investors.
By this week, though, groups like Ms. Benner-Heinacher's had had a change of heart. They argued that retaining Mr. Sommer made more sense than replacing him with a former member of the supervisory board, who did not seem any more qualified to turn things around.
Rolf Drees, an analyst at Union Investment in Frankfurt, said the government wanted to score political points, but was not willing to address the deep-rooted problems at Deutsche Telekom.
"The chancellor said, 'I've got to do something' but he had no solution," remarked Mr. Drees, whose firm owns 45 million shares in the company.

 BODY:
"Infectious greed."
 The man who gave us "irrational exuberance" is back, with a phrase that sums up the late 1990's even better than that one did. 
 "An infectious greed seemed to grip much of our business community," the Federal Reserve chairman, Alan Greenspan, told the Senate Banking Committee yesterday. The way he sees it, the incentives created by poorly designed stock options "overcame the good judgment of too many corporate managers."
"It is not," he added, "that humans have become any more greedy than in generations past. It is that the avenues to express greed had grown so enormously." Stock options meant that executives could get rich if they faked profits, and fake them they did. 
Investors followed Mr. Greenspan's words intently yesterday, as always. But it may not have been his views on the speculative excesses of old that affected share prices. Instead his upbeat assessment of the current economy paradoxically may have hurt prices. There was no hint that the current stock market decline would lead the Fed to ease credit again next month, as some had hoped. Instead, Mr. Greenspan seemed to indicate that the next move in rates would be up, although he did not appear to be warning that such a move was imminent.
The Dow Jones industrial average, down 109 points when Mr. Greenspan's prepared text was released, fell a bit more but then rallied as he spoke, a fact several senators noted. But it settled back later in the day, ending down 166 points at 8,473. That is the lowest close since Sept. 21, but it is 228 points above Monday's low.
In 1996, Mr. Greenspan briefly terrified investors after he used the "irrational exuberance" phrase in a rhetorical question. But he soon backed off from it. Any idea that he might try to slow the market's rise, either by raising interest rates or by tightening margin requirements on share purchases, was soon forgotten.
Just for the record, all the major averages are still higher than they were when the phrase "irrational exuberance" entered the lexicon.
By 1999, Mr. Greenspan was giving speeches that reassured the bulls even as stock valuations moved into territory never before seen in this country. A cautious man, he never failed to utter a qualifier when praising the new economy, but there was little doubt which side he was on.
On April 5, 2000 -- less than a month after the Nasdaq peaked and the bubble began to leak -- Mr. Greenspan spoke to the White House Conference on the New Economy, citing Wall Street analysts' forecasts as a reason to think that profits would only continue to rise:
"While growth in companies' projected earnings has been revised up almost continuously across many sectors of the economy in recent years, the gap in expected profit growth between technology firms and others has persistently widened. As a result, security analysts' projected five-year growth of earnings for technology companies now stands nearly double that for the remaining S.& P. 500 firms.
"To the extent that there is an element of prescience in these expectations," he added, "it would reinforce the notion that technology synergies are still expanding and that expectations of productivity growth are still rising."
Then came the qualifier. "There are many who argue, of course, that it is not prescience but wishful thinking," he said. "History will judge."
History now has judged, and Mr. Greenspan was happy to pronounce the verdict yesterday. There was, he said, "a once-in-a-generation frenzy of speculation that is now over."
Mr. Greenspan maintains a unique position among public officials, with a stature so high that few are willing to criticize him and many treat his views as all but unquestionable. So it is regrettable that he was not sounding some of yesterday's warnings when they might have done some good, while the bubble was still inflating. Some of the "significant overcapacity" that still haunts the telecommunications industry might not have been built, and billions of dollars not wasted.
In 1996, Mr. Greenspan's exact words were: "But how do we know when irrational exuberance has unduly escalated asset values, which then become subject to unexpected and prolonged contractions as they have in Japan over the past decade? And how do we factor that assessment into monetary policy?"
On those questions, if Mr. Greenspan does not deserve a high grade for spotting the "escalated asset values" before they deflated, he deserves an A for his monetary policy after the bubble burst. By lowering rates quickly and deeply, he helped to spur housing investment and to keep the recession short and mild.
There are those who think there could be a bubble now in at least some housing markets and who warn of problems to come. But just as Mr. Greenspan once pointed to burgeoning capital investment as a sign of optimism and did not discuss what would happen if there was too much such investment, now he focuses on the benefits of the housing boom, which he said had been critical in supporting consumer spending as homeowners refinanced their mortgages.
One senator tried to get a comment on the level of home prices. "Housing price escalation has exceeded personal income growth for some time," pointed out Senator Evan Bayh, Democrat of Indiana. "Is it your view that this can go on indefinitely?"
Instead of answering, Mr. Greenspan launched into a discussion of productivity in the construction industry, which he said could help to explain why home-price inflation would outpace general inflation. He did not address the affordability question raised by Mr. Bayh.
The economy would be hurt far more now by a slide in home prices than it has been by the stock market slump, for as Mr. Greenspan noted, the vast majority of Americans have more invested in their homes than in their other investments. But while Mr. Greenspan was eager to denounce the excesses of the last decade, he did not choose to address either the likelihood of or the possible damage from an end to the current boom in housing.

HEADLINE: CORPORATE CONDUCT: THE OVERVIEW; 
FED CHIEF BLAMES CORPORATE GREED; HOUSE REVISES BILL

BYLINE:  By RICHARD W. STEVENSON and RICHARD A. OPPEL Jr. 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, July 16 

 BODY:
Alan Greenspan, the Federal Reserve chairman, pointed today to a corporate culture blighted by "infectious greed" as the cause of the breakdown in confidence among investors. With political pressure growing and the stock market falling, the House hurriedly passed a measure that would toughen criminal fraud penalties to curb corporate wrongdoing.
 Mr. Greenspan's blunt testimony to Congress about avarice in the executive suite and the rushed effort by Republican leaders in the House not to be outdone by the Democratic-controlled Senate in legislating stiff sentences for corporate wrongdoers were the latest indications of how deeply questions about business integrity are reshaping both politics and economic policy. 
 The rapid-fire legislative maneuvering was noteworthy because the Republican-controlled House, which passed its own accounting and corporate governance measure in April, had previously urged a more limited scope to new laws and regulations than had the Senate and had not initially addressed criminal penalties. But with new accusations of accounting impropriety and corporate misconduct, as well as a continued tumble in stock prices, Republican leaders quickly came up with their own legislation. 
After falling more than 200 points this morning, the Dow Jones industrial average pared its loss to about 20 points during Mr. Greenspan's appearance on Capitol Hill, in which he reassured investors that the economy was fundamentally sound and poised for improvement. Excerpts, Page C8. 
But stock prices headed down again in the afternoon, defying any hope on the part of Mr. Greenspan -- as the market had defied President Bush's two attempts in the last week to instill confidence among investors with speeches emphasizing the positive -- that he might break the negative psychology on Wall Street.
For the day, the Dow dropped 166.08 points, to 8,473.11, bringing its loss over the last seven sessions to more than 900 points.
With both parties watching closely for outcries from individual investors, House Republicans, some of whom had previously warned against overreacting to accusations of falsified earnings and other misconduct, moved quickly today to insulate themselves politically from appearing to be too close to business.
They rushed to the floor a measure that they said would create criminal penalties for corporate fraud as harsh as, and in some case harsher than, those included in the legislation that was passed 97 to 0 by the Senate on Monday evening. President Bush has strongly hinted that he will sign any bill that emerges from Congress.
Among other provisions, the House bill would create a maximum prison sentence of up to 20 years for corporate fraud, or in one case 25 years, twice the maximum sentence called for in the Senate bill.
The House bill passed 391 to 28. Even as most of them voted for it, Democrats said the legislation would actually weaken some provisions of the Senate bill. They pointed in particular to a provision in the Senate bill but left out of the House bill that would extend the amount of time investors have to sue corporations for securities fraud. Democrats said the provision was important because it sometimes takes years before problems with corporate accounting are discovered.
The House bill addresses criminal corporate wrongdoing in "a responsible and measured way," said Representative Michael G. Oxley, the Ohio Republican and chairman of the House Financial Services Committee. Moreover, he said, it does not create "loopholes for voracious trial lawyers." 
But Senator Patrick J. Leahy, the Vermont Democrat and chairman of the Judiciary Committee, who sponsored most of the Senate's criminal-penalties provisions, called the House bill a "weak echo" of his legislation's language. 
"Now is not the time for half-measures and watered-down reforms," Mr. Leahy said.
The House and the Senate are expected to begin negotiations in coming days to reconcile the bills they passed this week as well as a broader bill on accounting standards and corporate governance passed by the House in April. President Bush has said he would like them to deliver a final bill to him before Congress goes into recess next month. Analysts and officials from both parties agreed that it would be extremely politically risky for Mr. Bush to veto the legislation that emerges from Congress, even if some provisions are unpalatable to the White House. 
The politics of the issue are playing out against the backdrop of a muddled economic outlook, in which signs of recovery from last year's recession are offset by the stock market's decline and eroding consumer confidence.
Testifying before the Senate Banking Committee, Mr. Greenspan signaled that the central bank was not in any hurry to raise the interest rates it controls from their current low levels. 
But he gave no indication that the Fed was considering cutting rates to give the faltering economic recovery a boost and put a floor under tumbling stock prices. And while he suggested that Wall Street could take some comfort in evidence that corporate earnings were improving, he said the evaporation of so much stock market wealth would weigh on the economy by holding down consumer spending.
While Mr. Greenspan was nominally on Capitol Hill to discuss the economy, he took the opportunity to make his first extensive remarks on the roots of the problems afflicting corporations and the stock market, and he did not pull any punches.
Mr. Greenspan, who noted that he had served on 15 corporate boards before becoming Fed chairman in 1987, pointed a finger straight at chief executives who put opportunities to cash in on stock options ahead of responsibilities to shareholders.
"The incentives they created overcame the good judgment of too many corporate managers," said Mr. Greenspan, who three years ago began calling for companies to list stock options as an expense on their financial statements. "It is not that humans have become any more greedy than in generations past. It is that the avenues to express greed had grown so enormously."
In his testimony today, the Fed chairman backed the various proposals to stiffen criminal penalties for executives who are found to have defrauded shareholders. He supported the idea of holding chief executives responsible for the accuracy of the financial information their companies disclose. 
In a sign of how much the climate surrounding issues of corporate governance had changed in Washington, Mr. Greenspan, long an advocate of deregulation and reliance on market forces to police good business practices, bluntly acknowledged that he had been mistaken in initially opposing government involvement in oversight of auditing. The creation of a new body to oversee the accounting industry is at the heart of the bills passed by both the House and the Senate in response to the corporate scandals.
"My view was always that accountants knew or had to know that the market value of their companies rested on the integrity of their operations" and that government regulation of accounting was therefore "unnecessary and indeed most inappropriate," Mr. Greenspan said. "I was wrong."
But Mr. Greenspan, who in late 1996 raised questions about "irrational exuberance," did not address whether the Fed's subsequent willingness to keep interest rates low as stocks rose and the economy boomed had contributed to the anything-goes climate he decried today.
In April, House Democrats publicly urged Republicans to allow a vote on legislation by Representative John Conyers, a Michigan Democrat, that included some of the tough new criminal penalties that the Senate approved on Monday. Efforts to bring that bill up were blocked by Republicans, however.
The criminal penalties bill passed today by the House, sponsored by Representative James F. Sensenbrenner, the Wisconsin Republican who is chairman of the House Judiciary Committee, keeps central provisions of the Senate bill. They include the creation of a securities-fraud statute calling for prison time for anyone using a "scheme or artifice" to defraud investors and prison terms for senior executives who "recklessly and knowingly" publish misleading financial statements.
In both cases, the House bill calls for longer maximum prison terms: sentences of up to 20 years or 25 years, versus sentences for up to 10 years for similar infractions in the Senate bill. On another point, however, the House version of the new securities-fraud statute calls for penalties only for those who "execute" a scheme to defraud investors. The Senate, by contrast, also criminalizes "attempts" to defraud. 
The next test of the political potency of the issue is likely to come in how quickly the House and Senate can work out their differences in approach. While there are important differences in their bills, the two chambers have come closer to a common view than anyone predicted even a few weeks ago.
Some Republicans even signaled that they would like the House simply to pass the bill sponsored by Paul S. Sarbanes, chairman of the Senate Banking Committee. Representatives Mark Foley of Florida and Mike Rogers of Michigan gathered 16 signatures this evening from fellow Republicans for a letter urging the House speaker, J. Dennis Hastert, to accept the Senate bill instead of convening a conference committee to reconcile the differences.
Mr. Hastert, an Illinois Republican, has no plan to forgo conference committee and pass the Senate bill, his spokesman, John Feehery, said tonight. 
Representative Billy Tauzin, a Louisiana Republican and chairman of the House Energy and Commerce Committee, predicted that the House, given the chance, would vote to approve the Senate bill. 
"We'd find a lot of support for that in the House," he said. Mr. Tauzin also said that there were "not a lot of big differences" in the Senate and House bills.
But other House leaders reiterated that they believed that the two chambers were still far apart on some crucial aspects of the legislation -- a split underscored today by the House's rejection of some of the Senate's provisions.
The differences include how much investigative and enforcement power to give to a new regulatory panel overseeing the accounting industry, how much to limit the consulting work that accounting firms can do for publicly traded companies they audit, and whether to keep other provisions that Democrats say are crucial protections but that some Republicans say would be a gravy train for trial lawyers.
Mr. Oxley, who as the sponsor of a bill passed by the House in April to reform accounting laws will play a crucial role in the House-Senate negotiations, said that it would be "rather unprecedented" for Congress to produce a bill out of conference committee by the time Congress goes home next month.
Mr. Oxley said a number of senators had privately told him that there are a "lot of things" they do not like about the Senate bill, but that they voted for it anyway because "nobody wanted to get in front of that train."
If the House-Senate negotiations extend into the fall, the bill's ultimate shape could be heavily influenced by the course of the economy and the financial markets. 
In his public comments, Mr. Greenspan said nothing today to alter the assumption that the Fed would leave its main interest rate, the federal funds target rate on overnight loans among banks, at 1.75 percent at least until the fall and possibly into next year.
"Considerable uncertainties -- about the progress of the adjustment of capital spending and the rebound in profitability, about the potential for additional revelations of corporate malfeasance, and about possible risks from global political events and terrorism -- still confront us," Mr. Greenspan said. "Nevertheless, the fundamentals are in place for a return to sustained healthy growth."

HEADLINE: CORPORATE CONDUCT: NEWS ANALYSIS; 
Who Should Mete Out Punishment?

BYLINE:  By DAVID E. SANGER 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, July 16 

 BODY:
Washington and Wall Street are rarely on the same wavelength: markets judge change in seconds, while politicians take days -- or months -- to sniff the direction of the country and fashion a response.
 But even that traditional disconnect between the country's financial capital and its political one does not fully explain why President Bush and the Federal Reserve chairman, Alan Greenspan, are encountering such trouble calming investors. Yesterday and today they worked in tandem -- both talking about the economy's solid fundamentals that should relieve what Mr. Bush called the national "hangover" from the "binge" of the 1990's. 
 But investors are in no mood to listen. And if the two cities are talking past each other, one reason may be the contradictory incentives that define the worlds of New York and Washington. 
As always, Wall Street wants minimal government interference, figuring that the markets can mete out harsher, swifter penalties to offenders than Washington ever could. And as always, legislators and the president want to placate voters, which means they have to show that a culture of see-no-evil among government regulators is being changed -- for good.
Both have a point. Wall Street fears that the overhaul frenzy now gripping Washington could go too far -- and that Congress could pass draconian changes before thinking through the consequences. It is a view shared by many in the White House, chiefly Vice President Dick Cheney, who has grumbled to many in recent days that even if Congress cannot figure out a way to make it impossible to lose money in the stock market, it will probably try.
But on Capitol Hill, the view is that all the risk is in doing too little. Average investors, the Republicans and Democrats alike say, are looking for justice. "Why else," one Democratic senator asked the other day, "would we be obsessing about the length of jail sentences for C.E.O.'s rather than really thinking hard about the federal government's role in setting accounting standards?"
"Just think," he continued. "Just a month ago the biggest threat to this nation was Al Qaeda. Now its uncontrolled stock options."
The infection has even reached the White House.
Mr. Bush thought he had solved this problem in March, went he ordered the Securities and Exchange Commission to work out 10 new standards for corporate behavior. But in the last few weeks he has found some of his party stalwarts -- including those who raised bushel baskets of campaign contributions from chief executives in election season -- are racing to the microphones to demand stronger reforms than their president insisted upon. 
Mr. Bush's race to catch up with them helps explain why Wall Street has seemed unimpressed by his talk. Some investors worried that the president's heart wasn't really in the effort to clean up the system -- that it would be enough, in the president's mind, to root out what he called "a few bad apples." Conservatives, in contrast, worried that Mr. Bush's political advisers would push him too far, forcing him to sign whatever Congress serves up.
"Clearly the administration's view of this has changed pretty rapidly," said Gary Gensler, a senior official in the Treasury Department during the Clinton administration, who has been helping Senator Paul S. Sarbanes, the Maryland Democrat, in drafting the legislation that passed the Senate 97 to 0 on Monday night.
"But remember that Wall Street initially saw this differently as well. They used words like 'self-correcting,' and took pride in the fact that they were able to kill off some of the bigger reforms in early legislation. What they wanted was the Good Housekeeping seal, but without tasting any of the real ingredients."
Now, Mr. Gensler said, the big investment houses and Congress "can't even agree on who to be mad at." Wall Street executives are likely to focus on the accounting firms; Washington is likely to focus on chief executives.
The White House vigorously denies that Mr. Bush's intention in the last week has been to calm the markets. Ari Fleischer, Mr. Bush's press secretary, argued today that it would be ridiculous for any president to try to move the markets; he argued that Mr. Bush's best strategy was to focus on long-term policy, like tax cuts, and let the markets sort out the impact. Mr. Fleischer suggested that market players "themselves will recognize that they don't know very much what makes markets go up or down," and that market players in Washington are even worse.
Mr. Fleischer is clearly straining to explain why Mr. Bush's comments in recent days have been followed by some nasty sell-offs. But he may well be right: history suggests that when panic selling starts, almost no amount of political rhetoric leaves a lasting impression.
That was the lesson of the Asian economic crisis of 1997 and the Russian crisis that followed the next year. Once Thailand's and Indonesia's troubles were exposed, and South Korea admitted to some dubious accounting of its reserves, a selling panic swept the emerging markets. Well-run countries suffered alongside incompetently run countries. The word "contagion" took on a new meaning. Whatever reassurances national leaders offered fell on deaf ears.
It is a tempting comparison. But Roger Altman, the former deputy Treasury secretary who is now one of New York's most influential investors, observed today that this sell-off is different -- at once more discriminating and more punishing. "Back then, fund managers just said 'Get me out of any less-developed country' -- they didn't know the difference, and many didn't care. Here they know the companies and focus on them microscopically."
A result, he says, is a pummeling of the stock prices of any company even suspected of playing games with its books. "It's an incredible punishment, far worse than anything the executive or legislative branch could exact," Mr. Altman said. "And that's why the ultimate solution to this -- the restoration of confidence -- can't really come from Washington. It never has, and never will. Sure, there are things governments can do at the margins. But the real force for change has to come from the capital markets themselves, and it will be a long time, I think, before the lessons of the past few months are forgotten."

Excerpts From Report By Greenspan at Senate

 BODY:
Alan Greenspan, the chairman of the Federal Reserve, gave his semiannual report on the economy to the Senate Banking Committee yesterday. Following are excerpts from his testimony and from an exchange between Mr. Greenspan and Senator Thomas R. Carper, Democrat of Delaware, in a question-and-answer session after the testimony, as recorded by the Federal News Service Inc. A full transcript of Mr. Greenspan's testimony can be found online at nytimes.com.
 While the economy has held up remarkably well, not surprisingly the depressing effects of recent events linger. Spending will continue to adjust for some time to the declines that have occurred in equity prices. In recent weeks, those prices have fallen further on net, in part under the influence of growing concerns about corporate governance and business transparency problems that evidently accumulated during the earlier rapid run-up in these markets. Considerable uncertainties -- about the progress of the adjustment of capital spending and the rebound in profitability, about the potential for additional revelations of corporate malfeasance and about possible risks from global political events and terrorism -- still confront us. 
 Nevertheless, the fundamentals are in place for a return to sustained healthy growth. Imbalances in inventories and capital goods appear largely to have been worked off, inflation is quite low and is expected to remain so, and productivity growth has been remarkably strong, implying considerable underlying support to household and business spending as well as potential relief from cost and price pressures. . . .
Why did corporate governance checks and balances that served us reasonably well in the past break down? At root was the rapid enlargement of stock market capitalizations in the latter part of the 1990's that arguably engendered an outsized increase in opportunities for avarice. An infectious greed seemed to grip much of our business community. Our historical guardians of financial information were overwhelmed. Too many corporate executives sought ways to harvest some of those stock market gains. As a result, the highly desirable spread of shareholding and options among business managers perversely created incentives to artificially inflate reported earnings in order to keep stock prices high and rising. This outcome suggests that the options were poorly structured, and, consequently, they failed to properly align the long-term interests of shareholders and managers, the paradigm so essential for effective corporate governance. The incentives they created overcame the good judgment of too many corporate managers. It is not that humans have become any more greedy than in generations past. It is that the avenues to express greed had grown so enormously. 
Perhaps the recent breakdown of protective barriers resulted from a once-in-a-generation frenzy of speculation that is now over. With profitable opportunities for malfeasance markedly diminished, far fewer questionable practices are likely to be initiated in the immediate future. To be sure, previously undiscovered misdeeds will no doubt continue to surface in the weeks ahead as chastened C.E.O.'s restate earnings. But even if the worst is over, history cautions us that memories fade. Thus it is incumbent upon us to apply the lessons of this recent period to inhibit any recurrence in the future. 
A major focus of reform of corporate governance, of course, should be an improved functioning of our economy. A related, but separate, issue is that shareholders must perceive that corporate governance is properly structured so that financial gains are fairly negotiated between existing shareholders and corporate officeholders. Shareholding is now predominantly for investment, not corporate control. Our vast and highly liquid financial markets enable large institutional shareholders to sell their shares when they perceive inadequacies of corporate governance, rather than fix them. This has placed de facto control in the hands of the chief executive officer. Shareholders routinely authorize slates of directors recommended by the C.E.O. Generally, problems need to become quite large before C.E.O.'s are dislodged by dissenting shareholders or hostile takeovers. 
Manifestations of lax corporate governance, in my judgment, are largely a symptom of a failed C.E.O. . . .

SENATOR THOMAS R. CARPER -- I want to revisit an issue that revolves around the legislation that the Senate passed yesterday. . . .
Somewhere along the line, we're going to be asking you publicly or privately for your own counsel as to which provisions are most important that we retained from the Senate bill or maybe in which instances you think the House language is preferable. Do you have today any particular thoughts that you might share with me and with us as to what provisions of the Senate bill that you feel are most worth preserving as we go forward? 

MR. GREENSPAN -- Well, Senator, I thought that the initiative that was Senate-produced was very important and very effective. And indeed, as I said to the chairman before the hearing, my original view was that taking accounting standards and moving them out of the private sector was really utterly unnecessary because my view was always that accountants basically knew or had to know that the market value of their companies rested on the integrity of their operations and that, indeed, that signature that they put on an audit reform is where the net worth of the company comes from and that, therefore, their self-interest is so strongly directed at making certain that their reputation was unimpeachable that regulation by government was utterly unnecessary and, indeed, most inappropriate. I was wrong. I was really deeply distressed to find that actions were being taken which very clearly indicated a lack of awareness of where the market value of accounting is.

HEADLINE: CORPORATE CONDUCT: THE IMPACT; 
Is Uncertainty The Only Thing That Is Certain?

BYLINE:  By DAVID LEONHARDT 

 BODY:
For investors, uncertainty has become the new norm.
 From small brokerage offices to sprawling trading floors, people who buy and sell stocks and were heartened by the economy's surprising resilience after Sept. 11 are asking what else can go wrong in corporate America. Along with millions of mutual fund investors, they want to know whether anybody -- in Washington, on Wall Street or in executive suites -- has a solution that will help them trust business again. 
 "The worst thing now," said R. L. Butler, a retired clergyman in Denver, "is you can't even trust the earnings reports. When you find the auditors in bed with the managers, there is nobody to believe." 
The latest evidence came yesterday, when Alan Greenspan, once the nation's most reliable mover of markets, pronounced the economy healthier than expected in testimony on Capitol Hill. By the end of the day the Dow Jones industrial average had fallen by almost 2 percent, its seventh consecutive daily loss.
Concerns about corporate earnings and stock prices have begun to threaten the unyielding optimism that built up during the long boom of the 1990's, according to surveys and interviews across the country. The optimism has not disappeared, but many people say they no longer assume that every piece of bad news about the economy or the markets will soon be followed by many pieces of good news.
"The question is whether the love affair that Americans had with stocks is dead or whether they're just adjusting their expectations," said Jeremy J. Siegel, a finance professor at the University of Pennsylvania and the author of a popular book on the long-term benefits of stock market investing. "There's a lot of confusion. A lot of people just don't know what to do."
For much of the last decade, the dominant investment strategy for ordinary investors was simple: buy, buy more and hold. The decision was almost always rewarded, as the United States economy expanded for the longest period on record and the nation's chief economic rivals faltered. Stock prices marched ever higher.
But a barrage of corporate scandals, combined with a 37 percent drop in the broad stock market since the beginning of 2000, has caused a questioning of the country's economic and financial future.
More Americans now expect the next five years to include periods of widespread unemployment than say there will be continuous good times, according to the University of Michigan's monthly survey of consumers. In the last month, the drop in confidence has been most pronounced among households making more than $50,000 a year, the same families that tend to own stocks.
"Sept. 11, the recession, the bear market, the renewed bear market and the concern about the profit numbers really have changed people's attitudes," said Robert C. Doll, president of Merrill Lynch's asset management group. "It's been brutal."
Financial advisers say some of the new skepticism is a painful but necessary adjustment to the late 1990's, when many investors came to expect 20 percent annual returns from Wall Street. And long-term confidence in both the economy and the stock market remains far higher than it was at the end of other recent recessions.
Many investors are simply uncertain about when the short term ends and the long term begins.
"I have no confidence in the stock market right now," said Tracey Gialde, a clerk at a mutual funds company in Kansas City, Mo., who moved some of her savings into a money market account last weekend. "There's just too much uncertainty."
Like many other people, however, Ms. Gialde said she refused to succumb to her worries by moving all her savings out of the stock market.
"I've lost money," she said, "but I've got 10 to 15 years before I retire, so I expect it to come back."

(Ting-Li Wang/The New York Times)(pg. C9) Chart: "First Enron . . . Then the Deluge"When Enron filed for bankruptcy last December, the reaction among many investors was initially ho-hum, partly because it appeared that the economy was beginning to recover. But even as growth resumed, other companies revealed similar problems, shaking confidence in businesses and sending the market down. DEC. 2, '01 -- Enron files for bankruptcy, and in the weeks and months that follow, reports emerge about allegations of self-dealing among some of the top executives, particularly its former chief financial officer, Andrew S. Fastow. JAN. 22, '02 -- President Bush assails the executives of Enron, who contributed heavily to his campaign, for their handling of the company. JAN. 28 -- Global Crossing files for bankruptcy, becoming the largest telecommunications company to do so. The Securities and Exchange Commission and Congress begin investigations after questions arise about the company's accounting and insider selling by top executives before the company collapsed. MARCH 14 -- Arthur Andersen, Enron's auditor, is indicted on a charge of obstruction of justice after the collapse of Enron. It is the first major accounting firm to be indicted on a criminal charge. Three months later, on June 15, a federal jury convicts the firm, effectively putting it out of business. MARCH 27 -- Adelphia Communications discloses that it guaranteed billions of dollars in loans to the company's founders, the Rigas family. The company, the nation's sixth- largest cable operator, subsequently delays its annual report and later seeks bankruptcy protection. APRIL 1 -- Xerox says it overstated revenues for several years by almost $2 billion and agrees to pay a $10 million fine, the largest in history. MAY 21 -- Merrill Lynch agrees to pay $100 million in penalties and change the way it pays stock analysts to end an investigation by Eliot L. Spitzer, the attorney general of New York, into whether Merrill promoted stocks of companies whose investment banking business it wanted. JUNE 3 -- L. Dennis Kozlowski, chairman and chief executive of Tyco, is forced to resign just before he is indicted on a charge of evading more than $1 million in sales taxes. JUNE 25 -- WorldCom says it improperly accounted for $3.8 billion in expenses in 2001 and the first quarter of 2002. It fires its chief financial officer only weeks after forcing out its founder and chief executive, Bernard J. Ebbers. Congress and the S.E.C. begin investigations into the company's accounting. JULY 9 -- President Bush makes proposals to toughen penalties for people convicted of financial crimes and calls on companies and executives to be more accountable. Some critics say the proposals do not go far enough, and the Senate promptly passes a bill that is more far-reaching. JULY 10 -- Qwest Communications discloses that it is under criminal investigation by the Justice Department. The company had extensive dealings with Global Crossing.

HEADLINE: Still Thinking Outside the Box 

BYLINE:  By ERIC A. TAUB 

 BODY:
BECAUSE the world is three-dimensional, there are those who believe that every representation of it should be in 3-D as well. Entrepreneurs and enthusiasts have long tried to convince the public that 3-D photographs, films and television shows are the next best thing to being there.
 Since 1838, when Sir Charles Wheatstone's stereoscope first enabled viewers to see a photograph in three dimensions, the 3-D fad has regularly surfaced. The 3-D film arrived in theaters in the 1920's, and the craze reached its peak in the 50's with B-movies like "Bwana Devil" and "House of Wax." Television picked up the cause later, with the first commercial 3-D shows broadcast in 1980. 
 Now a new set of entrepreneurs has taken up the banner, creating the latest iterations of 3-D systems for television and computers in a belief that the public's embrace of DVD's and wide-screen plasma displays will assure the programming's success. A company has even developed a technology that uses software and modified flat-panel screens to eliminate the need for the special eyeglasses that became synonymous with 3-D. 
But the question, now as then, is whether 3-D has staying power or will remain a gimmicky fad.
"Three-dimensional television is like the circus: it comes and it goes, and people line up to see it every time it appears," said Daniel Symmes, president of Dimension 3, a 3-D-television production company in Woodland Hills, Calif. Mr. Symmes was responsible for the first 3-D production on commercial television, a 1980 broadcast of the 1953 film "Miss Sadie Thompson" and a Three Stooges short on the SelecTV pay service.
Some 3-D advocates believe that this time, 3-D is here to stay. One reason it has not caught on before is that "no one wants to wear those crazy glasses," said Bruce Ettinger, a vice president of Dynamic Digital Depth, a company in Santa Monica, Calif., that is developing the 3-D system that requires no glasses. "Our market studies show that a good 3-D effect helps create the best viewer recall."
Others are not so sure. "The press always asks if 3-D is the next big thing, but then it never goes anywhere," said Mark Schubin, a television industry technological consultant. "No matter how well it's done, one always experiences eyestrain after a while. It would be hard to watch an entire football game in 3-D."
Technological issues aside, some argue that reality and the small screen are fundamentally different environments and should be treated as such.
"Is the logical progression of filmed entertainment from black-and-white to sound to color to 3-D?" asked Gerald Marks, a New York artist who creates 3-D video. "No, no, no.
"If people craved 3-D, it would have taken off, like color TV and stereo. But it hasn't. Movies, TV and still images are just fine without 3-D."
Even Mr. Symmes, who is as entranced with 3-D television as anyone, said he preferred it in small doses. 
"I like 3-D TV because it's magic," he said. "It's not real, it's realer than real. When you see a ball coming at you, you duck, even though you know it's only on television. But I don't want to watch 'Wheel of Fortune' in 3-D."
Most 3-D systems rely on the principle of binocular vision to achieve their effect: each eye receives a slightly different image corresponding to what it would see in reality. The brain then fuses the two images to create a sense of depth.
In his work, Mr. Symmes mostly uses the anaglyph 3-D method common to many films and comic books. The left and right images are superimposed and colored either cyan or red. When looking through glasses with cyan and red filters, each eye sees only the corresponding left or right image.
The anaglyph method allows for the "out of box" imagery that 3-D fans love: the sword emerging from the screen, the bats flying into one's face.
But the illusion works better in a theater than on television. Once an object seems to appear in front of the television screen, its perceived size shrinks rapidly because the viewer now compares it with the surrounding objects in the room. Suddenly, what looked like an imposing monster appears to be no bigger than a doll.
Watching an anaglyph-encoded program without special glasses is virtually impossible because trying to concentrate on only one of the superimposed images creates eyestrain. Although the Federal Communications Commission has allowed anaglyph-encoded programs to be broadcast, it is a poor economic proposition for a network if most of the audience has not bothered to pick up the free pair of glasses.
That is one reason some television executives have warmed up to the Pulfrich method, a system that also uses special glasses but presents a completely normal picture to those viewers who are not wearing them. (Another popular 3-D film technique, which uses polarized light, is not applicable to a TV or computer screen.) 
Based on the findings in 1922 of Carl Pulfrich, a German astronomer, the Pulfrich principle recognizes that the rods of the eye -- the receptors that work in dim light -- take longer to perceive light than do the eye's cones, which work in brighter light.
Using special glasses that have one clear lens and one lens dark enough that only rod-sensitive light will pass through, the two eyes will see the same object a split-second apart. The brain will perceive that object to be closer than a stationary one. For that effect to be apparent, however, the image must move.
The technique has been used on some television shows, including the 1989 broadcast of the Tournament of Roses parade in Pasadena, Calif., segments of the sitcom "Third Rock From the Sun" and a Rolling Stones music video.
In the Rolling Stones production, Mick Jagger pops off the screen as the cameras circle around him in a continuous dance. It is an effective if dizzying technique, one that no one would want to experience while watching the local news or "The Charlie Rose Show."
"The Pulfrich Effect is exceedingly limiting," said Mr. Marks, who created the Rolling Stones video and consulted on the 3-D presentation of the Tournament of Roses parade. "It's only good for short pieces. Still, it's the best technology from an artistic point of view."
Art aside, other companies are hoping to market 3-D by using techniques that avoid the limitations of the anaglyph and Pulfrich methods. The X3D Technologies Corporation, for example will begin shipping a $99 system that uses "flicker" technology to create a 3-D effect. For TV viewing, specially encoded DVD's alternately display left- and right-eye images on the screen; lightweight plastic glasses equipped with liquid crystal shutters open and close each lens in sync with the displayed image.
The technique, which is similar to that used in some Imax 3-D theaters and some 3-D computer game systems, works on PC monitors and TV's, but it has its own limitations, including flicker, reduced screen brightness and lower resolution.
But the big problem with glasses-based techniques, some argue, is that they create an isolated rather than a shared viewing experience. Dynamic Digital Depth, the company creating the glassless 3-D technology, says its system more accurately mimics the way people watch television: collectively and from different viewing angles.
The company uses several techniques to display 3-D. One involves placing a special lens over a flat-panel display, a sophisticated version of the lenticular lens on the plastic cards found in cereal boxes and on greeting cards that causes the image to change as the card or the viewer moves. Another involves placing a special barrier screen over the display that allows only the pixels that should be seen by the right and left eyes to pass through the screen at any time. The program's depth information is stored in a small separate data channel that can be transmitted along with a broadcast or DVD signal and decoded using a special set-top box. 
The company's technologies work from multiple viewing angles, so several people can sit together and experience 3-D. In a demonstration of the system, the effect ranged from strong to barely noticeable. And both brightness and effective resolution appeared lower than those on a regular flat-image plasma display. The company expects to improve both later this year with new techniques created for television and PC applications.
But regardless of what system is used to create a three-dimensional effect, the perceived quality always depends on how well the original material was processed. Unless the program was shot using two cameras mounted side by side to simulate the views received by each eye, the material must have depth information added to it. All too often, that means simply assigning different depths to various objects; the objects themselves then look flat but appear to be in different planes. It is as if a viewer were looking at cardboard cutouts of actors scattered throughout a scene.
Dynamic Digital Depth has created software to solve the depth problem. Working with a still frame from the moving image, an operator assigns any number of depth values to it by clicking on various points of an object in the frame. Those assigned values stay with the image as it moves throughout the frame and on to successive frames.
Still, the effect depends on the engineer's skill and how much time is available. "When you post-produce 3-D, you really need an infinite number of planes to create a good effect," Mr. Marks said. "I can spend up to two days working on just one still image to create the proper look."
But even the latest techniques do not erase the fundamental question about whether most people want to be entertained in 3-D.
The companies involved, not surprisingly, answer yes. "Three-dimensional TV is a bigger change to television than the switch from standard definition to HDTV," said Chris Yewdall, president of Dynamic Digital Depth. Others seem to agree; the company recently raised $10 million in public money.
Despite his own involvement in 3-D, Mr. Marks remains unconvinced.
"The only people who want 3-D television all the time are the people trying to sell it," he said. "3-D television is like caviar. You buy a little. But if you had to live on the stuff all the time, it would be awful."

GRAPHIC: Photos: ADDING DEPTH -- One 3-D television technique uses glasses with liquid-crystal shutters, like those worn by patrons at an Imax film. "Miss Sadie Thompson," a movie with Rita Hayworth, was the first 3-D TV broadcast. (Sony); (Columbia Pictures)(pg. G4) Drawings: A new technique eliminates glasses, instead using software and a flat-panel screen with a lenticular lens to produce multiple offset images. The depth for each element in an image is added as gray-scale data.; In the Pulfrich method, first used in television in 1989, a dark lens causes light to reach one eye slightly later, giving a moving object the appearance of depth. For viewers without glasses, the image is unaffected.; The flicker technique involves using glasses with a liquid-crystal shutter system that allows alternating left and right images on the screen to reach the eyes in turn.; The anaglyph technique, in which offset red and cyan images on the screen are filtered by glasses, was used for the earliest 3-D TV broadcast, in 1980. The method was made popular in movies and comic books. (Illustration by Matt Collins; diagrams by Frank O'Connell/The New York Times)(pg.

HEADLINE: Not Just Closing a Divide, but Leaping It 

BYLINE:  By MICHEL MARRIOTT 

DATELINE: BOSTON 

 BODY:
DENNIS PAIZ-RAMIREZ listened intently as professional video game designers spoke of the challenges of guiding a creation from imagination to store shelf. As they described the intricacies of what goes into a game cartridge, he nodded knowingly. 
 For five weeks, he had toiled over a game of his own, Buzz, pitting a wasp against swarms of increasingly troublesome foes. The development laboratory was not a company cubicle or a computer geek's bedroom. For Dennis, 16, it was a clubhouse in Albuquerque created to help young people in low-income areas apply digital skills to creative use. 
 With suggestions from the clubhouse coordinator and its collection of expensive software, Dennis had decided to do more than just make a game. He wrote, illustrated and printed an instruction booklet, designed packaging and produced an animated commercial for it, including an electronically produced soundtrack. Now he put his creation to a professional test. 
"That's cool," declared John Beauchemin, an animator for Helixe, a game development studio in Lexington, Mass., paying the game world's ultimate compliment. 
Dennis was among more than 100 young people from the United States and abroad who spent four July days here to share and further their accomplishments in the Intel Computer Clubhouse Network, a program designed to foster not only computer skills but collaboration and leadership as well. 
The program's goal echoes a rallying cry in the debate over what has come to be known as the digital divide. New studies show that the gap in computer access based on differences in race, income or educational level is narrowing -- although whether that progress justifies curtailing federal efforts to close the gap, as the Bush administration contends, remains in dispute. 
In any case, some educators, technology experts and community organizers say the challenge is more complex than providing equipment, Internet connections and basic training. What young people need, they say, is help in developing fluency with advanced computer hardware and software. 
"Access is not enough," said Mitchel Resnick, associate professor of learning research at the Massachusetts Institute for Technology's Media Laboratory. "Access is just a starting point." 
In 1993, with money from the Intel Corporation, Professor Resnick helped establish the first site of what is today an international network of 50 Computer Clubhouses, including the New Mexico center that Dennis visits at least three times a week. The clubhouses are places where boys and girls, 8 to 18, can "really feel in charge of the technology," Professor Resnick said.
"It's not about playing games, but about making your own games," he said. "It's not about surfing the Web, but it's about making your own Web pages. It's not just about downloading MP3 music files, but doing your own music composition." 
Roma Arellano, worldwide community education manager for Intel, said the goal was to cultivate technologically confident thinkers, collaborators and problem-solvers, regardless of their economic origins. "We want to see young people literally taking their own ideas and creating," she said. 
For Dennis, the issue is not access to a computer: he shares a reasonably powerful, though crash-prone, home PC with his mother and his 14-year-old brother. But at home he does not have the microprocessing power, expensive programs and occasional help required to work on his games and related projects. For that he goes a few blocks from his high school to the Albuquerque clubhouse, which operators say about 25 young people visit on a typical weekday. 
"The clubhouse gives you a lot of freedom to see what you really want to do and gives you the tools to create it," Dennis said. "I always wanted to make a video game, but never had the software to make it. I didn't know where to start." 
The clubhouse network, which extends to such countries as Ireland, Israel, India, Germany, the Netherlands and the Philippines, has a $32 million commitment from Intel through 2005, in addition to hardware, software and services donated by technology companies including Adobe Systems, Macromedia, Hewlett-Packard and Autodesk. 
Such private-sector efforts may be all the more important if federal initiatives aimed at closing the digital divide are indeed cut back. But even those who agree that a divide exists do not necessarily agree on how to go about eliminating it. 
For example, at Playing2Win, a 22-year-old community center in Harlem supported by foundation grants and other contributions, the emphasis is on teaching work and life skills, said the center's director, Ka Ogunka. That can encompass computer repair as a way to teach problem solving, and employment-oriented goals like mastering word processing programs and other basic office software. 
"It's hard to keep the interest of our students if we don't show how this can immediately benefit them," Ms. Ogunka said. "We have to show them that the skills we're teaching them are worth learning and that they are applicable in the real world." 
Otherwise, she added, "they might take a job at Domino's before coming to us." 
At the Computer Clubhouse, in contrast, there are no formal instructors, only mentors, a clubhouse manager and small staff. Learning is gently guided, and areas of interest are usually identified by the young people. 
At the flagship clubhouse here in Boston, tucked away in the training wing of the Museum of Science along the Charles River, the most popular activities include creating custom animations, music videos, digital comic books and games, and mechanized robotics, said Marlon Orozco, the center's soft-spoken manager. 
One of the biggest draws is the digital studio, a glass-enclosed back room equipped with a synthesizer, microphones and a CD-burning computer loaded with software to create and edit music. During recording sessions, the glass trembles with booming bass notes and synthesized percussion. 
At first, anyone could drop in and use the studio, "but so many people were going back there that it got to the point where we had to put in some limits," said Mr. Orozco, 27, who began working with the clubhouse when he was 18. "Some people were dominating the room." Now a sign-up sheet hangs outside the studio's glass door.
Stephen Ruggs, 18, of Boston is a regular. For more than a year he has been working almost five days a week on a collection of rap music he has largely created, recorded and mixed at the clubhouse.
Adept on a computer keyboard, he manipulates software to serve the needs of his hip-hop alter ego, named Square-Route. But he prefers to write and edit his lyrics in longhand because, he explained, he has little access to a computer before he arrives at the clubhouse after school. 
Introduced to basic computing in high school, Stephen said he practically taught himself how to use music software at the clubhouse, which has become an informal hangout for him and friends lured there by the cutting-edge technology. 
"Everything is generated by computers," he said during a break after starting what he hopes will be his demo CD for a lucrative recording contract, titled "One Route 2 Da Game." "We couldn't do what we do without these computers." 
Most of the youths who regularly flock to the clubhouse are black, like Stephen, or Hispanic, like Dennis Paiz-Ramirez.
From the beginning, Professor Resnick said, the Computer Clubhouse took an approach that differs from those of other technology centers. "There were other places kids could go and get access to computers, places they could go and play games or take a course and learn some application," he said. "There's nothing wrong with that. But it wasn't satisfying the need that we saw that was out there for kids to express themselves, to create something, to have a sense that they could bring about change with the technology." 
Dennis is convinced that his command of game technology may well change his future. Despite the care he has taken in the presentation of his game, he says he has no intention of selling it. He is rather hoping to use it as a digital portfolio to give prospective employers and college admission officers a glimpse of what he can do with keyboard, mouse, imagination and determination. 
"I'm psyched about it," he said as the three-member team from the Helixe studio gathered over his game for a second time. "All of this is so cool."

To the Editor:
Re "In Ecuador's Banana Fields, Child Labor Is Key to Profits" (front page, July 13) and "Bangladeshis Sipping Arsenic as Plan for Safe Water Stalls" (front page, July 14):
 In reporting on the intersection of the environment, poverty and justice with respect to both banana plantations and arsenic-tainted water, you highlight the importance of environmentalism in an international context. 
 As both human and ecological problems become ever more pressing, the new millennium is witnessing an emerging environmentalism that moves beyond merely preserving pristine wilderness and also calls for clean air and water as human rights as well as environmental necessities. 
Some politicians and business leaders tout an environmentalism that makes economic sense. As these articles demonstrate, environmentalism can also make sense for people, preserving the places they live and working toward social justice.

HEADLINE: An Industrial City's Architectural Rebirth; 
New Museums Brighten Manchester

BYLINE:  By ALAN RIDING 

DATELINE: MANCHESTER, England 

 BODY:
For the better part of a century, this city was the industrial and commercial engine of Britain's imperial might, a place as proud as it was powerful. Then came the bombing of World War II, the loss of colonial markets, the closing of the cotton mills and a prolonged slide into economic depression. The final blow was struck on June 15, 1996, when an I.R.A. bomb flattened a large area of downtown Manchester.
 That bomb proved to be an awakening. Like many rundown cities, Manchester decided to use cultural buildings by well-known architects as motors of urban regeneration. Frank Gehry's Guggenheim Museum in Bilbao, for instance, had just such an impact on that northern Spanish city. With the opening this month of Daniel Libeskind's Imperial War Museum North, a sculptural composition as dramatic as his Jewish Museum in Berlin, Manchester, too, can boast a head-turning symbol of rebirth. 
 The aluminum-clad museum, with its sweeping roof and curved tower representing shards of a war-shattered globe, stands on the edge of the Manchester Ship Canal, the 19th-century waterway that turned this city into a major port. During World War II, the Luftwaffe attacked it not only for its docking facilities, but also for a nearby industrial park where engines were manufactured for Spitfire fighters and Lancaster bombers. 
Although the area is still largely undeveloped, the new museum is not alone. Across the canal, where Salford Quays once stood, the steel-and-glass Lowry Center, designed by Michael Wilford & Partners, has been drawing crowds since its opening in 2000. A pedestrian bridge links it to the Imperial War Museum North.
In the heart of the city, near the site of the 1996 bomb, another new museum, Urbis, designed by Ian Simpson Architects, opened late last month in a striking glass-faced building that has been nicknamed "the Ski Slope." Nearby, Tadao Ando has built a curving white pavilion in the new Piccadilly Gardens, themselves landscaped by the design firm EDAW. Barely a mile away, an extension designed by Michael Hopkins & Partners has been added to the Manchester Art Gallery, the work of Charles Barry, the early-19th-century architect of the Palace of Westminster in London.
One reason for the rush to open the new buildings is that starting July 25, Manchester will be host to the Commonwealth Games, which will attract athletes from 72 countries to an elegant new $115 million stadium, designed for the occasion by Arup Associates. So the city is back in the limelight. Mancunians, as the locals are known, have always liked to vaunt the glories of their faded past; now, at least in architectural terms, they can say they have vaulted from the 19th century to the 21st.
The truth may be a bit more nuanced, because central Manchester still carries the scars of the ugly, utilitarian, boxlike architecture that was a quick and cheap way of rebuilding after World War II. Similarly, there is a dismal postmodern sameness to the shopping malls and office blocs that have sprung up on the outskirts of the city since the early 1990's. But yes, amid the architectural potpourri, 19th- and 21st-century buildings seem to fare best.
Of the new designs, the Imperial War Museum North is the most daring. It is Mr. Libeskind's third completed museum, after the small Felix Nussbaum Haus in Osnabruck, Germany, and the Jewish Museum in Berlin. A Polish-born, American-trained architect who is an Israeli citizen and lives and practices in Berlin, Mr. Libeskind is also designing the Copenhagen Jewish museum and extensions to the Denver Art Museum and the Royal Ontario Museum in Toronto.
The warm reception by British architecture critics and museum directors to the Imperial War Museum North, though, has special significance. In 1996, the Victoria and Albert Museum in London chose Mr. Libeskind's ultra-modern design for a $100 million extension, but the project was refused a grant from the profits from Britain's national lottery and is still short of funds. The Victoria and Albert now hopes that acclaim for Mr. Libeskind's museum here will help win new financial support for its own project.
Inexplicably, the Imperial War Museum North was also denied lottery funds, prompting speculation that Britain's cultural purse-holders were simply terrified by Mr. Libeskind's architecture. As a result, the museum's construction budget was slashed to $45 million from $60 million, forcing the architect to use steel and aluminum instead of concrete and to abandon plans for adjacent landscaping. The museum's original form, however, survived.
"The challenge of architecture is to produce the maximum of architecture with the minimum of resources," Mr. Libeskind noted stoically.
As he often does, he began this museum with a concept, that of a globe shattered and reshaped by war. He then tested his idea practically at his office in Berlin.
"I wrapped a ceramic teapot in a plastic bag and dropped it from my window," he said in an interview. "I had the idea of the world as fragile, but I also wanted to see how it breaks. I saw a structural breakage of perfect geometry, and I saw that I could select three pieces that would be enough to represent the entire curvature of the universe. I was also aware of the light here. It often rains. The curves give life to the building."
In turn, the three pieces became symbols of three fields of conflict: the 95-foot tower, which resembles a sturdy sail, denotes air; the vast sweeping roof, which covers the entire exhibition space, stands for the earth; and a smaller shard, which contains a restaurant with a view of the canal, represents water.
As he did with the zigzag shape of the Jewish Museum in Berlin, Mr. Libeskind likes to disorient visitors: here he has done so by repeating the curvature of the roof on the floor of the exhibition space. At the entrance, it is six feet higher than its far edge.
"Actually, as you move around, I think the curvature helps orient you where you are," he said. "Most people don't know it's curved, yet they feel the difference."
The entire design is Mr. Libeskind's response to the challenge posed by what he jokingly calls "the three worst words" in the English language: imperial, war and museum. The museum is so named because it is a satellite of the Imperial War Museum in London, but Mr. Libeskind does not shy from the word war. "The museum records the struggle for peace," he said, "but it recognizes that war is a reality, not just in the past, but in the world we live in. It also addresses the question: is all conflict bad?"
The main exhibition area has some artifacts of war, like a Harrier jet used by the United States Marines, a Soviet tank and a World War I artillery piece. The space is also broken up into different rooms, referred to as silos, that explore themes like women and war; science, technology and war; and Empire, Commonwealth and war. Hourly, using the walls and silos as screens, the museum shows one of three 15-minute slide shows: "Why War?," "Children and War" and "Weapons of War."
The war museum has one major advantage over Urbis: the planners knew what to put in the building. Much like the ill-fated Millennium Dome in London, Urbis appears to have begun as a $45 million urban and architectural project, with events organizers rather than curators left to define its contents. The result, a so-called urban experience built around audio-visual snippets of major cities, is an interactive show that fails to engage the visitor.
The Manchester Art Gallery, which has doubled its exhibition space, has made much better use of its $52.5 million transformation. The collection is largely from the 19th century, when cotton barons decided that art could add refinement to their image. The excellent Pre-Raphaelite collection is now splendidly displayed, but the museum also has room for its 20th-century works and contemporary shows.
The Lowry Center takes its name from Manchester's best-known artist, L. S. Lowry, who recorded the city's early-20th-century industrial life. A show of his works is on through Sept. 22. The building's two theaters have proved enormously popular, and in its first year, the center had over a million visitors.
On their own, these projects may not suffice to transform this city. But they are powerful symbols of a more confident future, offering fresh proof of architecture's ability to have both real and psychological impact on an urban environment.

HEADLINE: Politics Hastens the Corporate Goodbye in Europe 

BYLINE:  By MARK LANDLER

DATELINE: FRANKFURT, July 17 

 BODY:
The European corporate chief long protected by cozy politicians, boardroom cronies and compliant shareholders -- is suddenly an endangered species.
 The ouster this week of Ron Sommer as the chief executive of Deutsche Telekom is the strongest evidence yet that the web of ties that once shielded European bosses from the wrath of the market is fraying. 
 From Percy N. Barnevik, the patrician former chairman of ABB Ltd., to Jean-Marie Messier, the flashy would-be mogul at Vivendi Universal, the heads of European companies are being ushered out of their jobs at a rate, and for reasons, that would have been unthinkable a few years ago.
Now, whispers are circulating about the fate of other beleaguered bosses, notably Michel Bon, chief executive of France Telecom, which is suffering even more acutely than Deutsche Telekom from soaring debt and a swooning stock price. 
"The Europeans are, for good or ill, moving faster to remove people," said Jeffrey Sonnenfeld, an associate dean of the Yale School of Management and an expert on the role of the chief executive.
"When a major political force gets involved, it's not even a debatable point," he added. "The guy is gone."
That was the case with Mr. Sommer, the charismatic, Israeli-born salesman appointed by the former German chancellor, Helmut Kohl, in 1996 to transform Deutsche Telekom from a sheltered state monopoly into a publicly traded company with shareholders around the world.
Mr. Sommer enjoyed the support of Mr. Kohl's successor, Gerhard Schroder, even while piling up $67 billion in debt and presiding over the decimation of the company's stock, the most widely held in Germany.
Then, two weeks ago, Deutsche Telekom's shrinking share price became a political issue in Germany's coming federal elections, when Mr. Schroder's conservative opponent, Edmund Stoiber, seized on it to illustrate what he sees as the chancellor's shaky economic policies.
With a swiftness that Jacques A. Nasser, late of Ford Motor, or Richard A. McGinn, former chief of Lucent Technologies, could appreciate, Mr. Sommer's support withered, and he was forced to step down.
"People said, 'Mr. Chancellor, you must do something because the decline in Telekom's share price is hurting the small investor in Germany,' " said Boris Boehm, a fund manager at Nordinvest, an asset management firm in Hamburg that owns 1.3 million shares in the company.
Nearly 13 million Germans, or about 20 percent of population, now own stocks. That compares with 13 percent in 1999 and only 9 percent in 1997. Though Germany trails the United States, where about half of all adults own stock, shareholders have become a powerful constituency.
With the rise of shareholders has come the rise of shareholder activists, big and small, who think nothing of filing motions against chief executives or publicly scolding them for laggard results.
At Deutsche Telekom's annual meeting in May, Mr. Sommer and his colleagues fidgeted on the stage as a shareholder representative, Jella Benner-Heinacher, took them to task for a lucrative share-option plan.
"People who buy caviar in a time of cholera shouldn't expect the understanding of small shareholders," she said.
In Switzerland, the billionaire shareholder Martin Ebner agitated successfully against Mr. Barnevik, the Swedish executive who orchestrated the merger that created the Swiss-Swedish giant ABB in 1987.
Though Mr. Barnevik was seen as a champion of shareholder rights -- Europe's answer to John F. Welch Jr. of General Electric -- his credibility was steadily eroded by Mr. Ebner's protests. In late 2001, he resigned as chairman of ABB to shoulder blame for the 60 percent drop in the company's share price.
Mr. Ebner was not deterred by the Wallenbergs, the powerful Swedish family that owns a major stake in ABB through its publicly traded investment company, Investor. Indeed, Mr. Barnevik soon also stepped down as the chairman of Investor. Mr. Ebner even clamored for him to give back $90 million in ABB pension fund payments, and Mr. Barnevik agreed to pay back part of that sum.
"For a long time, shareholders deferred to the Wallenbergs as though it was noblesse oblige," Mr. Sonnenfeld of Yale said.
Shareholders also played an important, if more behind-the-scenes, role in ousting Mr. Messier at Vivendi, the trans-Atlantic entertainment company. The Bronfman family, the largest single shareholder in Vivendi, tried to mobilize opposition to Mr. Messier on the board, which is dominated by French executives.
Initially, the French directors seemed determined to protect their countryman. But then a respected French industrialist, Claude Bebear, chairman of the giant insurer AXA, publicly criticized Mr. Messier and lobbied against him with French directors. Within days of surviving a no-confidence vote by the board, Mr. Messier was negotiating the details of his severance package.
Some experts said the Messier case showed less how much had changed than how much had stayed the same.
"What took so long?" asked Sophie L'Helias, an adviser to investor groups in Washington. "Messier had to goof up so badly, so egregiously, that they had no choice but to oust him."
Ms. L'Helias said there was a political dimension to Vivendi that made it hard for the board to move against Mr. Messier. He was building France's first truly global media conglomerate -- an ambitious plan that had been blessed by the government and carried no small measure of national pride.
Similar considerations, Ms. L'Helias predicted, will make it tricky to unseat Mr. Bon as chairman of France Telecom. Although the company is by some measures worse off than Deutsche Telekom -- its debt situation is more parlous -- Mr. Bon has extremely close relations with the French government.
The state still owns 55.5 percent of France Telecom, and as long as President Jacques Chirac supports Mr. Bon, it is difficult to imagine a shareholder revolt strong enough to oust him.
Still, these are turbulent times in Europe. As some experts point out, national pride can cut two ways.
"Obscenely overpaid C.E.O.'s with global ambitions and bad strategies are hurting national pride across Europe," Mr. Sonnenfeld said. "There is grass-roots pressure for the governments to respond."

HEADLINE: Corus to Buy Steel Maker In Brazil for $2.1 Billion 

BYLINE:  By TONY SMITH 

DATELINE: SAO PAULO, Brazil, July 17 

 BODY:
The Corus Group, the British-Dutch steel-making giant, said today that it had agreed to acquire Companhia Siderurgica Nacional of Brazil, one of Latin America's leading steel producers, for $2.1 billion in stock. Corus will also assume $2.1 billion in C.S.N.'s debts.
 The deal is subject to approval by shareholders of both companies and by Brazilian and British regulators. 
 Adding C.S.N. to Corus would yield a company, yet to be named, that would rank fifth among world steel producers with 24.4 million tons of output a year. Corus alone is now eighth. 
More important for Corus, itself the product of the 1999 combination of British Steel and Royal Hoogovens of the Netherlands, acquiring C.S.N. would give it a guaranteed supply of iron ore from C.S.N.'s Casa de Pedra mine, at a time when control of world ore supplies is concentrating in the hands of a few suppliers. Production at the mine is set to triple, from 10 million tons a year to 30 million, after $300 million in planned improvements to the mine and a nearby port, C.S.N. executives said.
"What this deal is about is growth, growth, growth," said Benjamin Steinbruch, chairman of C.S.N. "This step will lead to the enlarged group's becoming a truly international company, and the transaction should benefit investors, customers and employees."
Investors will get 26 new shares in Corus for each C.S.N. share they hold, giving them a 37.6 percent stake in the combined company. The deal values C.S.N. at a premium of about 80 percent over its market value Tuesday. 
One possible obstacle to the deal is a guarantee made to Brazil's development bank, which pledged a controlling stake in C.S.N. as security. Mr. Steinbruch said today that he expected the price premium in the Corus offer and the greater liquidity that the combined company's shares will enjoy to persuade the bank to bless the merger.
Mr. Steinbruch is to become vice chairman of the combined company, and will succeed Corus's current chairman, Sir Brian Moffat, who is due to retire by April 2004. Tony Pedder, chief executive of Corus, will continue in that role after the merger, the companies said.
As part of Corus, C.S.N. would gain economies of scale, better access to world markets and cheaper credit than it can manage alone, according to Tom Meyer of UBS Warburg in New York. For its part, analysts said, Corus stands to lower its global production costs, in part by relying more on C.S.N.'s raw slab steel, produced at about half the cost of American slabs, and concentrating its efforts on turning them into higher-value finished products.
The down side for Corus is the exposure to C.S.N.'s debts it acquires and the risks of the Brazilian economy. Moody's Investors Service said the deal might lead it to downgrade Corus's credit rating to below investment grade. 
Still, Corus and C.S.N. executives said they expected the deal to enhance earnings next year, and that it might reduce annual costs by as much as $250 million once the companies are fully integrated. "The fundamentals of the proposed merger are robust, despite recent market volatility," the company said in a statement. 
As a glut of steel pushed prices to 20-year lows in the last few years, Corus has aggressively closed plants and eliminated thousands of jobs. It put its aluminum operation up for sale to focus on carbon steel.
Brazil's steel industry is one of the world's most competitive, because of cheap labor costs and easy access to huge iron ore reserves, and it has been attracting investment. Arcelor, the world's biggest steel maker, and California Steel Industries together own 46 percent of California Steel Industries, C.S.N.'s main Brazilian rival, and Dongkuk of South Korea has joined with Companhia Vale do Rio Doce, a big mining company, and other investors to build a new steel slab plant in the northeast.
Gerdau, another major Brazilian producer, said today that its profits for the first half rose 29 percent from a year earlier -- but much of the gain came from improved results in the United States, where Gerdau owns seven plants and where prices have risen because of the protective tariffs announced by the Bush administration in March.
Analysts said lowered costs would make a C.S.N.-Corus combination a much tougher competitor for the four largest steel makers -- Arcelor, NKK-Kawasaki and Nippon Steel of Japan, and Posco of South Korea. But some analysts said Corus had less scope to cut costs than Arcelor had when it was formed last year in a three-way merger of Aceralia of Spain, Usinor of France and Arbed of Luxembourg.
C.S.N.'s American depository receipts rose $2.25, or about 14 percent, to $18.50. Corus shares fell 2.5 pence, or 3.5 percent, to 69 pence in London. --------------------

Retaliation Considered
By The New York Times
BRUSSELS, July 17 -- The European Union said today that the United States had offered its steel industry only "manifestly inadequate" relief from the effects of the protective tariffs the Bush administration announced in March, giving a strong signal that the union will decide on Friday to retaliate.
The so-called safeguard tariffs affect about $2.3 billion in European steel shipments to the United States, the European Commission said, but the exemptions offered by Washington so far would spare only $230 million worth from the tariffs' effects.
Under World Trade Organization rules, the commission has until Friday to decide whether to impose retaliatory sanctions it is considering that would affect $300 million worth of American products.
The European Union, China, Japan, Brazil and other nations have complained that the American tariffs are unjustified and in violation of trade treaties, and that they were imposed for political rather than economic reasons. Administration officials have defended the tariffs as necessary to allow American steel makers breathing room to reorganize and cut costs.

HEADLINE: Profit Drops 6% at Bank of New York 

BYLINE:  By Reuters 

 BODY:
The Bank of New York Company said yesterday that its quarterly profit fell 6 percent, held down by severance costs, lower securities gains and a decline in profits from foreign exchange and trading. 
 The bank, based in New York City, earned $361 million, or 50 cents a share, in the second quarter, including a severance expense of $16 million, or 1 cent a share, for cutting 400 jobs. 
That contrasted with $385 million, or 52 cents a share, in the 2001 quarter. 
 Wall Street analysts expected profit of 51 cents a share, according to Thomson First Call. 
Lower volatility and narrow spreads caused foreign exchange and trading revenues to drop to $72 million from $98 million a year earlier. Stable interest rates also hurt results in the hedging and risk management operations.
The provision for credit losses remained stable at $35 million.
Fees from securities servicing increased 9 percent from a year earlier, to $473 million, helped by new business and acquisitions.

HEADLINE: THE MARKETS: STOCKS & BONDS; 
Shares Have First Winning Session in Nearly 2 Weeks

BYLINE:  By The Associated Press 

 BODY:
Wall Street scratched out its first winning session in nearly two weeks yesterday in volatile trading that had investors vacillating between bargain hunting and profit taking.
 Analysts were skeptical the gain would last, characterizing the advance as a brief rebound in the market's eight-week sell-off. Although some second-quarter earnings reports this week have been encouraging, significant doubts remain about whether stocks still have further to fall. As a result, many investors are reluctant to make big or lasting commitments. 
 The Dow Jones industrials rose 69.37 points, or 0.8 percent, to close at 8,542.48, after advancing as much as 250 points earlier in the day and then falling into negative territory. Still, the gains were enough to interrupt a seven-session, 900-point plunge.
Broader indicators were also higher, despite losing ground from earlier in the session. The Nasdaq composite index jumped 21.99 points, or 1.6 percent, to 1,397.25, and the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index rose 4.99 points, or 0.6 percent, to 906.04.
The last time all three indexes closed higher was July 5.
The gains yesterday, although modest, were a respite from the spate of volatility the market has been suffering for weeks.
"You're witnessing a pitched battle between two camps," said Kevin Caron, market strategist at Ryan, Beck & Company in Livingston, N.J. "You've got the bearish contingent concerned about accounting scandals, and you've got value investors who are looking for bargains."
In trading yesterday, Boeing rose $2.07, to $42.94, after beating expectations by 12 cents a share.
Ford Motor advanced 2 cents, to $12.52, on a sharp jump in second-quarter profits that beat analysts' expectations by 5 cents a share. This broke a string of four consecutive losing quarters.
But Coca-Cola fell 37 cents, to $50, despite reporting a 15 percent jump in second-quarter profits.
Financial stocks were mixed. Citigroup, the parent company of Salomon Smith Barney and Citibank, rose 73 cents, to $36.93, after reporting results slightly ahead of expectations. But J. P. Morgan Chase fell 36 cents, to $28.14, on results that missed Wall Street forecasts.
Technology stocks fared better. Intel soared $1.08, to $19.44, even with disappointing second-quarter results and news of 4,000 job cuts. Juniper Networks rose 90 cents, to $9.21.
The fluctuations came on another day of testimony from the Federal Reserve chairman, Alan Greenspan, who told a House committee he did not think the chief executives of all publicly held companies should be required to verify the accuracy of company finances with federal regulators.
Analysts said investors were focused on preserving their portfolios and whether the market would continue to fall. The market's volatility, which was attributed to everything from low investor confidence to computer program selling and buying that kicks in at certain stock prices, is giving many investors few reasons to expect improvement soon. Until that changes, a sustainable rally is unlikely.
Also yesterday, the Commerce Department reported housing construction fell 3.6 percent in June, but analysts said the figures were still healthy and suggested that demand remains strong.
Treasury bond prices rebounded from earlier losses to end the day mixed. 
The 10-year Treasury note was unchanged at 101 14/32 . The note's yield remained at 4.68 percent.
The price of the 30-year Treasury bond fell 4/32 , to 98 28/32 . Its yield rose to 5.46 percent from 5.45 percent on Tuesday.

HEADLINE: Pataki Critics Are Kicked Out Of a Parade 

BYLINE:  By LESLIE EATON 

 BODY:
A group of unemployed workers who distributed fliers critical of Gov. George E. Pataki were ejected from the Dominican Day Parade in the Bronx on Sunday, after the governor's re-election campaign questioned the workers' presence.
 The jobless workers, members of a group called the New York Unemployment Project, said police officers surrounded them and herded them off the Grand Concourse, where they had been marching with members of a union that represents janitors and security guards. 
 The unemployed workers, some of whom lost their jobs because of the World Trade Center attack, were carrying signs calling for extended unemployment insurance benefits. But they were also distributing fliers in English and Spanish that accused the governor of "keeping our families poor" and "ignoring the unemployed."
Supporters of the governor had the group removed from the parade after they saw the fliers, said Jonathan Rosen, an organizer of the Unemployment Project. "People involved in Governor Pataki's campaign were visibly irked by our presence," he said. "There was a lot of buzzing on cellphones, and an hour later we were kicked out."
Mollie Fullington, a spokeswoman for the governor's re-election campaign, said, "We did make a simple inquiry with organizers and with the police" about the group, "to see if it had a permit" to march. But she said any decision to remove the group was made by others.
Lt. Brian Burke, a police spokesman, said the parade's organizers "informed us this group was not permitted to march" and asked community affairs officers to remove it.
But Rosa Ayala, director of the parade organization, said the police made the decision to eject the group. Though the unemployed workers had been brought by 32BJ, the building service union, she said, the workers' group was not on an official list of participants.
The incident seems to reflect the Republican governor's acute political sensitivities involving Latino voters in heavily Democratic New York City. Earlier this month, two Spanish-language television stations stopped running advertisements critical of Mr. Pataki after his aides objected to them. This prompted one of his Democratic challengers, State Comptroller H. Carl McCall, to accuse Mr. Pataki of trying to muzzle those who opposed him. The governor's office said the ads, which criticized Mr. Pataki's plan to change the Rockefeller drug laws, were "blatantly untruthful."
The governor has been endorsed by the hospital workers' union, 1199/SEIU, and he was marching in the parade with its leader, Dennis Rivera, a Democrat. They were directly behind the 32BJ members, who are also affiliated with the SEIU but have not endorsed a gubernatorial candidate. The unemployed workers had already begun marching in the parade when "an officer from the N.Y.P.D. is saying 'Hold it, hold it!' and all the cops surrounded us," said Mitchell Price, who lost his job as a car-service dispatcher in December. But the tactic backfired, Mr. Price said, because members of his group then heckled the governor all along the parade route.

HEADLINE: Coke Says Profit Rose 15% Despite Weak Markets Abroad 

BYLINE:  By SHERRI DAY 

 BODY:
The Coca-Cola Company said yesterday that its second-quarter earnings increased 15 percent despite weak economic conditions in several of its international markets. It attributed the increase primarily to product innovation and strong sales in North America and Asia.
 The company also said that it was comfortable with analysts' estimates for 2002 earnings and that it would stand by its projections for volume growth, or the amount of beverage shipped. Analysts expect the company to earn $1.75 to $1.80 a share for the full year, according to Thomson First Call. 
 "They're starting to deliver consistent, as-promised growth both in volume and profit," said Caroline S. Levy, a beverage analyst at UBS Warburg. "I think this is a market where that's much appreciated. There really were no surprises."
But the company's stock, which surged more than 3 percent after Coke announced its results, finished down 37 cents, at $50 a share, as investors began to question whether too much of Coke's volume growth had come from its lower-margin juice brands, analysts said.
"It's going to be a tight dance over the next several years to try and balance that growth if it's coming in lower-margin areas and still deliver the kind of 9 to 10 percent operating profit that investors are looking for," said John A. Faucher, an analyst at J. P. Morgan.
In the second quarter, net income rose to $1.29 billion, or 52 cents a share, compared with $1.12 billion, or 45 cents a share, in the period a year earlier. Those results, which included a deduction of 2 cents a share because of foreign currency adjustments, were in line with Wall Street's expectations. Revenue increased 15 percent, to $5.37 billion from $4.65 billion.
Seventy-six percent of Coke's profit comes from sales outside the United States. Lackluster performances in Latin America, where volume grew by only 1 percent in the second quarter, and in Europe, where growth was hampered by cool weather, were offset by returns in Asia and Mexico that were better than expected, the company said. 
"We're still facing difficult economic environments in many regions; however, our business operations are adjusting well in these situations," Gary P. Fayard, the chief financial officer, said in a conference call yesterday. Mr. Fayard also said he expected weakness in foreign currency to pull down profits by 8 to 10 cents a share for the year. 
Still, analysts say that after several quarters of sluggish sales, Coke is finally on the path to improvement.
In North America, volume climbed 4 percent for the second quarter, with sales of the trademark Coca-Cola brand rising 2 percent. The bottled water brand, Dasani, jumped 40 percent in the quarter, and Minute Maid, its primary juice brand, posted double-digit growth, the company said. 
"The company is stable in a very difficult global economic environment," said Bill Pecoriello, a beverage analyst at Morgan Stanley. "Just being stable in this environment is an achievement." 
Earlier this week, Coke announced that it would begin counting the stock options it grants its executives and employees as an expense. The accounting change will be reflected in fourth-quarter earnings and is expected to cost the company a penny a share this year.
Coca-Cola Enterprises, Coke's leading bottler, said yesterday that it had no immediate plans to follow Coke's lead. Coke owns about 40 percent of the bottler. In reporting its second-quarter earnings, the bottler said its net income rose to $214 million, or 47 cents a share, compared with $104 million, or 24 cents a share, in the quarter a year earlier.

HEADLINE: Parent of American Airlines Reports Loss of $495 Million 

BYLINE:  By EDWARD WONG 

 BODY:
AMR, the parent of American Airlines, reported a net loss of $495 million for the second quarter yesterday, reflecting three months of lagging recovery for the airline industry as business travelers continued to stay away from high-priced tickets.
 The loss was $3.19 a diluted share. Last year, AMR lost $507 million, or $3.29 a diluted share for the corresponding period. It reported $4.48 billion in revenue, down 20 percent from the 2001 quarter. 
 The second-quarter loss included a $30 million after-tax charge from an expected loss of foreign tax credits.
Excluding that charge, AMR lost $465 million, or $3 a diluted share. Analysts had expected a loss of $3.04.
Shares of AMR hit a 52-week low of $12.87 yesterday, down 40 cents.
"We continued to see a very weak revenue environment in the second quarter," Donald J. Carty, the chief executive, said in a statement yesterday. "And although traffic has rebounded nicely since last fall, average fares are at 15-year lows, sharply depressing yields."
Jamie Baker, an analyst at J. P. Morgan, said, "It's losing money because corporations are spending little on air travel, and that's the real problem here."
AMR's unit revenue, which accounts for flying one seat one mile, was 9.83 cents, down 10.6 percent from last year.
That shows that people are staying away from the astronomical walk-up fares that airlines began charging in the late 1990's.
Now, anecdotal evidence and surveys show that many corporate travelers have taken to other modes of transportation, are buying cheaper restricted tickets or are buying tickets on no-frills carriers like Southwest Airlines and JetBlue. American's chief financial officer, Jeff Campbell, acknowledged in a conference call yesterday that the low-fare carriers had essentially become the leaders in the industry for now.
"Our view is it's really Southwest and JetBlue who are going to drive a lot of the pricing environment," he said. "We really do need to make some fundamental changes."
Southwest, which reports it earnings today, is expected to be the only major airline to post a profit for the second quarter. Analysts are expecting the entire industry to declare losses of up to $1.4 billion for the second quarter.
American said that if spending patterns did not change, it would "post a sizable operating loss in the third quarter."
The carrier has cut capacity in markets that used to be inundated with business travelers, like Silicon Valley, as well as taking flights out of Latin America, where economic and political turmoil have slowed travel, Mr. Campbell said. American is also trying to cut costs by making its operations efficient, an effort that includes tinkering with its flight schedule in Chicago and eliminating paper tickets. But analysts say more radical solutions are needed.
For example, American has yet to address high labor costs and worker dissatisfaction.
"If you're talking about a revolutionary change where you can get to a period of sustained profits, that has to entail cooperation with labor on a revolutionary scale," said Kevin C. Murphy, an analyst at Morgan Stanley. "There just wasn't any suggestion that that was going to occur."

HEADLINE: CORPORATE CONDUCT: INVESTING; 
2 Brokers Offer Warm Comfort in a Cold Market

BYLINE:  By N. R. KLEINFIELD 

 BODY:
Down. The market was down. Of course it was. Always down. 
 Ernest Raab and Emilio Valdes, comrades against the degradation of the stock market, were doing what they do all day, extending succor last week to the bereaved. They're stockbrokers who work as a synchronized team at A. G. Edwards, and as such are the persona of the dark heart of this market to their clients. 
 They have no idea when the wretched market, with its hourly drip of heartbreak, will turn up. And despite the first move upward in the Dow yesterday after seven consecutive days of losses, people want to know more than ever: How much longer will they be whipsawed? 
A few years ago, in those lustrous 90's, stockbroking seemed like the most pleasant occupation, outside of being a dot-com founder. Every client was earning big money. Every stock you mentioned rose, by the minute. Everyone wanted to talk to you, and buy, buy, buy.
Nowadays, too many stocks seem to keep going down, by the minute. Corporate America is awash in accounting scandals, its chief executives being threatened with prison stripes. Regulators and legislators have scolded brokerage houses for allowing the analysts that recommend stocks to become too cozy with the investment bankers. Even the president is mad.
Three days sitting with Mr. Raab, 57, and Mr. Valdes, 34, at the front lines of a market in tumult, gave a glimpse of what it is like in what has become one of the more nerve-racking jobs in America.
Over those three days last week, the Dow eliminated nearly 600 points. The Nasdaq plunged by 100. Mr. Raab and Mr. Valdes didn't do much buying or selling -- some bonds here, some mutual funds there -- but delivered an abundance of therapy. They have a conservative bent -- be diversified, buy quality for the long term. They're not tip-of-the-day brokers. "If you want to gamble, go to Atlantic City," Mr. Raab tells clients. "At least you'll smell the salt air and see a good show."
During the 90's, they talked clients down from getting too gutsy and buying nonsense stocks. Now they talk them down from surrender.
An addled client called, after spotting some disturbing accounting news about Merck on CNBC. The brokers had a screen on their computers that listed stocks mentioned on TV. During the rah-rah 90's, clients would call 5 to 10 times a day wanting to buy something recommended on the air, having no idea what it was. That doesn't happen anymore. 
The addled man tended to meditate on every blip. Now he needed to know: Should he dump Merck? Mr. Valdes talked him through it. He played a tape of the opinion of an Edwards analyst -- that he could see no effect on Merck's income, any selling was an overreaction, "an effect of Enronitis." 
The man stood pat. Merck went down that day. And the next day. And the next day.
Here was an e-mail message. A client, another of their "nervous Nellies", wanted to sell all his stocks and funnel everything into bonds. Whoa! They set up an appointment to help him get his bearings.
When he goes out socializing, Mr. Valdes says he hears a lot of sympathy. People say, "I wouldn't want to be in your shoes." Or "I'd hate to do what you do." 
They work in adjoining offices, with a sliding glass window between them, in the airy Edwards office on Park Avenue and 48th Street. Their "book," as it's known in the trade, consists of about 400 households, some with investments in the millions and a nurse who started the other day with $100. Some retired clients are mainly in income-producing investments like bonds that have chugged merrily along during the market's precipitous fall. Others have very much felt Wall Street's wicked sting. 
"That's not pleasant," Mr. Raab said. "But nobody is out on the street selling apples, nobody is threatening my firstborn and I'm still listed in the phone book under my name and not my wife's maiden name."
Outside the heat was rising, pushing into the 90's. The market was ice cold.
Mr. Raab took a call. Man going on vacation, wondering how much worse it will get.
"You know, the stock market doesn't go straight up," Mr. Raab said.
"I know, but I want it to," the man said. "I got used to it." 
Mr. Raab said: "I want you to have a peaceful vacation. Focus on your family and your kids and your tan."
The man said, "But I'm warning you, if I come back and have to eat dog food, I know where you live." The man laughed. He was kidding.
"Well, I'll be eating dog food with you," Mr. Raab said. "You think I don't have a 401(k)?"
Again and again, the brokers offered pet phrases like "it's mean, nasty and ugly" or "if it's any comfort, I haven't sold anything either."
Actually, not all of their clients are frazzled. They have a couple who, when they tell them they lost money, chuckle.
The Dow off 130. A man showed up for a quarterly review. His name was Anthony Rotolo, a real estate broker in his 50's. 
"Let's talk about the mean, nasty and the ugly," Mr. Raab said. He ran through the somber market numbers, then examined Mr. Rotolo's bruised accounts.
"I don't think there's good choice and bad choice," Mr. Raab said. "It's just ugly choices. I'd say let's bite the bullet, turn the page and learn not to overweight certain sectors."
Mr. Rotolo said, "Traditional wisdom is you don't sell when it tanks unless it's beyond redemption."
"It's down over 50 percent," Mr. Valdes replied.
Mr. Rotolo agreed to replace it.
"O.K., hope it hasn't ruined your day totally," Mr. Raab said.
"No," Mr. Rotolo said with a tight smile. "It was already ruined." 
A broker in a nearby office could be heard saying, "They ought to burn Wall Street!"
Mr. Raab and Mr. Valdes are pleasant and unpretentious, but different. They have been a team for six and a half years, and came to Edwards in early 1998. Mr. Valdes prefers financial planning and the macro picture, while Mr. Raab likes to do the micro picture, stock by stock.
Mr. Raab is a city person, and lives with his wife in a loft in the Flatiron district of Manhattan. He is fond of model trains, and has a train room, with tracks that snake through the walls and a glass case. He likes classical music and opera. Mr. Valdes is a suburbanite, and lives with his wife and two young children in Middletown, N.J. He likes classic rock music and has no trains.
Neither has witnessed a market this sadistic. The stress gnaws at them, too. Mr. Raab has started getting a massage every Friday after the market closes. And, he said, "I listen to a lot more Mahler." 
Mr. Valdes surrounds himself with friends, because socializing calms him. And there is his Yankee index. When the market does poorly, he watches more Yankee games. He figures he has watched 25 to 30 percent more Yankee games this savage year.
Most of their income derives from fees on how much is invested with them rather than commissions on trades, and so while their income has fallen off, it has not been a sharp decline. Mr. Valdes knows a broker who had to get a second job delivering newspapers in the morning.
They have been fortunate in not having put clients in some of the biggest meltdowns -- Enron, Tyco, Worldcom. A number of clients, though, took a drubbing on Lucent Technologies.
Woe be the market. Dow down 200.
"How you doing big guy?" Mr. Valdes called a client he hadn't spoken to in a couple of weeks. A heavy-duty worrier, not unconvinced that the American economy couldn't dissolve entirely. 
The man complained his investments kept sinking. He constantly watched the market. As he spoke to Mr. Valdes, he quoted where the Dow was, down to the decimal point.
"The only thing I can do is offer you ideas on how to be conservative," Mr. Valdes said.
The man moaned about one of his holdings. Then he asked for Edwards's year-end targets for the market. Mr. Valdes didn't like to give them out. Projections in this market were too tenuous. But the man wanted them. Mr. Valdes mentioned many caveats and read them off: Dow, 10,600; S.& P. 500, 1,160; Nasdaq, 1,700 -- all well above today levels.
The man said lots of people were making money. He rattled off George Soros, Warren Buffett and short sellers, who profit from stock declines.
"Are these the same people who go to Atlantic City and don't lose money?" Mr. Valdes said.
The man said a friend of his girlfriend bragged that for the last two years her portfolio had done nothing but go up. He was sick of going to parties and hearing her crow.
"I tell you, that's all noise," Mr. Valdes said. "Ask her what she's investing in."
The man mentioned someone else.
"He's sucking wind now, too," Mr. Valdes said.
Some firms have been squeezing their brokers, reducing their compensation, pressing them to shed smaller accounts. A. G. Edwards has not. It has, however, told brokers to call their clients to talk about allocations. Mindful of how far the market has sunk, the firm has also advised brokers that clients may have too little in the market and, hard as it may be in this brutal climate, to talk to them about buying stocks.
Mr. Valdes and Mr. Raab, though, are too leery of the market. "Quite frankly, we're a little gun shy about adding to the market just now," Mr. Valdes said. 
Since Edwards derives just 11 percent of its revenue from investment banking, Mr. Rabb and Mr. Valdes said they didn't feel concerned that the firm's analysts were promoting stocks to attract investment banking business, one of the hot-button issues on Wall Street. In any event, they said they weren't beholden to Edwards analysts. In fact, they swap research notes with friends at other brokerage houses to absorb multiple views.
Mr. Valdes noticed that Merck had fallen for the third consecutive day. He called a woman who owned it. 
The woman pondered the sour news. "They're cooking the books, aren't they?" she said.
"I don't know," Mr. Valdes said.
"I hope they discover a cure for AIDS tonight,"' she said.
"Yes, if they discovered a cure for AIDS it would go through the roof," Mr. Valdes said. "And it would be good for society as well."
Down, down, down went the market.
In the next office, Mr. Raab checked some of the Dow components, McDonald's, Philip Morris and Johnson & Johnson among them. "Mickey D is up," he said. "Merck the Jerk is down 2.16. Big Mo is down a buck 52. Johnny Johnny is down 2.33." 
He shook his head. The Dow had shed 283 points, the Nasdaq 35. 
"It's mean, nasty and ugly," he said.

PERSON: Joseph Marie Antoine Hubert Luns 

HEADLINE: Joseph Luns, 90, NATO Chief In Crucial Cold War Decades 

BYLINE:  By CHRISTOPHER MARQUIS 

 BODY:
Joseph Marie Antoine Hubert Luns, a former Dutch foreign minister and NATO secretary general, died yesterday, Dutch government officials said.
 Dr. Luns was 90 and living in Brussels. He suffered a stroke five years ago and had required close medical attention ever since. 
 A hard-charging diplomat with a provocative wit, Dr. Luns parlayed his position as foreign minister of a small country to become an influential architect of the European Economic Community and NATO before he retired in 1983.
Tall, ebullient and outspoken, Dr. Luns was known for shaking up fusty meetings with candid observations, even as he set about the serious business of negotiating the future of Berlin and paving the way for self-rule in the former Dutch colony of New Guinea four decades ago.
As president of the NATO Council in 1959, Dr. Luns defended the West's decision to stand firm on shielding West Berlin from Soviet and East German pressure. Within two years, the East German government had erected the Berlin Wall.
"Appeasement is surrender in installments," Dr. Luns said. "These crises are provoked by the Soviet to seek out our weak spots."
Widely known as a friend to the United States, Dr. Luns was a frequent visitor to this country in a career that spanned three decades. Known as Joe to his American colleagues, he met with successive United States presidents, beginning with President Eisenhower, and served as a bridge to Western Europe in coordinating a cold war strategy.
But Dr. Luns, who became secretary general of NATO in 1971, after 19 years as foreign minister, did not shy away from confronting Washington. Despite his anti-Communist views, he was a strong advocate of a United States-Soviet rapprochement, and in his final years at NATO, he chided the Reagan administration for seeking military superiority over Moscow at the expense of arms control agreements.
Early in his career, Dr. Luns was an avid supporter of European political integration and his efforts paved the way for the formation and expansion of the six-nation European Economic Community in the aftermath of World War II. When Britain balked, Dr. Luns held the door open; when France threatened to withdraw over voting and sovereignty issues, he called its bluff.
Throughout his career, Dr. Luns wryly referred to his predicament as a public servant with strong personal views. Shortly after he took over as NATO secretary general, he observed: "Of course, I am as wax in the ministers' hands. But wax, when it is cold, is tough, yes."
He was attuned to the dictates of domestic politics. When Hubert H. Humphrey, then vice president, called on Dr. Luns during a European tour in 1967, Mr. Humphrey praised some Girl Scouts who had greeted him and said they were "getting prettier every year."
Dr. Luns teased the vice president. "You are going into politics over here?" he asked.
Born in Rotterdam on Aug. 28, 1911, Dr. Luns studied law at Leyden and Amsterdam Universities, then studied political economy at the London School of Economics. 
He joined the foreign service in 1938 and married Baroness E. C. van Heemstra the following year. They lived in Bern until World War II broke out, when he was told to move to the Dutch Legation in Lisbon. In 1943 he became second secretary of the Dutch government-in-exile in London. After the war, he spent three years as the Dutch representative to the United Nations and was appointed foreign minister.
Dr. Luns and his wife had two children, Hubert and Cornelia Sophie, but officials did not verify survivors.

HEADLINE: After Roll Call, Baguette Class; 
Baking School Offers Job Skills in an Old Specialty

BYLINE:  By SARAH KERSHAW 

 BODY:
Give a man a loaf of bread, and he'll eat for a day. Teach a man to bake bread, in, say, a converted pajama factory in Queens, and his prospects will brighten considerably. 
 That, at least, is the concept behind a school in Long Island City that is teaching the jobless the lost art of making bread by hand in an effort to revive a dying New York City industry. 
 Eighteen students, covered in flour and sweat, assembled recently on the first floor of the school, the Artisan Baking Center, and spent much of the day scurrying among huge barrels of flour, poppy seeds, brown sugar and oats. The students include New Yorkers moving from welfare to work, ex-convicts, high school dropouts, professional bakers taking refresher courses and the unemployed, all potentially part of a new generation of fancy-bread bakers. 
One of the students, Peggy Moore, 49, says she harbored a secret dream of baking bread for a living throughout the 17 years she worked in advertising. Now that she has been laid off from her job producing ads for an agency in Manhattan, Ms. Moore, who loved to bake prune bread and sweet rolls as a child, has joined others to learn dough twisting, baker's math and other basics of the trade at no cost to the students.
"I might as well try something I love," Ms. Moore said. "People respond to it. You come home with boxes of eclairs and cream puffs and bread and people flock to your door. I can't produce forever, but I think I could probably bake for as long I'm standing."
The baking industry, once a thriving piece of the New York City economy that employed thousands of bread, cake, bagel and bialy bakers, has been in sharp decline since the 1970's. Large bakeries have moved their operations elsewhere and automation has replaced bakers with machines. However, the demand for handmade bread has surged in the United States in the last decade, as more Americans choose focaccia or olive sourdough baguettes over factory-made loaves. 
With skilled bakers in short supply, the federal Department of Labor identified New York City as a place in need of a baking school and, in 2000, gave $1.7 million to help start the first formal baking training program in the city and one of the few such programs in the country. 
The organizers of the Queens school, on 37th Street in Long Island City, which opened as a pilot program last year and is expected to train from 400 to 500 prospective bakers a year, are working with New York State officials to grant the school official apprenticeship status. If they succeed, according to the center's director, Rebecca Lurie, the school would become the first bread-baking apprenticeship program in the United States. 
So far, the center has placed 27 people in jobs, and employers have begun recruiting directly from the center. To qualify for the program, students must be able to prove that they have been actively looking for work. 
Until now, anyone serious about learning the art of baking artisan, or handmade, bread typically went to Kansas, to the American Institute of Baking, a consultant for the Queens center, or enrolled in an expensive course or two at the Culinary Institute of America in Hyde Park, N.Y. 
But, as the students in Queens can already surmise, baking is not the easiest line of work. As one of the instructors, David Bernstein, a baker for more than 60 years who trained in Kansas, put it, "You can't have bad feet."
Mr. Bernstein said the decline of the artisan bread industry was driven in part by many bakers' reluctance to give away their recipes for breads and other goods. When their sons and daughters decided not to go into the baking industry, they often closed up shop without passing along their trade secrets, he said. 
"The true craftsmen were afraid to teach," Mr. Bernstein said. "But we're bringing back an old tradition."
In 1971, 12,402 people in the five boroughs -- the majority in Brooklyn and Queens -- were employed by bread and cake bakers, according to the Empire State Development Corporation. In 1997, the last year for which similar data was available, there were 4,555 people employed in the same industry. 
However, as more small retail bakeries in New York City have begun selling fancy baked goods, the number of jobs in that niche has increased. In 1986, there were 11,789 jobs in small bakeries, but by 2000, there were 12,414, according to a recent report by the New York Industrial Retention Network, a citywide economic development group based in Brooklyn.
Many of those workers surely needed on-the-job training. In 2000, the Department of Labor conducted a survey of 15 New York bakeries that reported 73 percent of their workers lacked basic skills.
Supplementing the federal grant with state and local financing, the Queens center was created in a joint effort between the Consortium for Worker Education, an employment training agency that is working with thousands of people left jobless after Sept. 11, and the New York City Central Labor Council. Several industry employers and the Bakery, Confectionery, Tobacco Workers and Grain Millers International Union, Local 3, are collaborating.
In class the other week, Mr. Bernstein led his students -- the 18 students were the largest group that has enrolled yet -- through a brownie session and then moved on to making rye, semolina and Italian baguettes. 
Mr. Bernstein, 74, said he had baked his way across the country, making bread and other goodies in 40 states, and that when he told his employers he was a baker from Brooklyn, they invariably asked, "Do you know how to make New York cheesecake?"
He does, and it's a specialty. But his students are not yet ready for cheesecake because they are still learning the basics. A basic baking course should make students proficient enough to find jobs in the industry and move from entry-level positions, which pay from $7 to $10 an hour, to higher-level jobs, which can pay up to $18 an hour. 
Ms. Moore and her classmates were enrolled in a six-week basic class. 
The center, which moves from a pilot program to a permanent school in the fall, also offers courses on pastry, wedding cakes, holiday baking, pastry and "Baking for Restricted Diets." 
The ingredients are measured in quarts, pounds and scoops, instead of cups and teaspoons, and the recipes are called formulas.
After the baking session, Ms. Moore stood with a classmate at the back of the room, comparing notes. She said she had always dreamed of opening a bakery in her neighborhood, the Inwood section of Manhattan, but acknowledged that she was worried that working with such large quantities of the ingredients might lead to disaster.
"I keep having his image of the bread rising and taking over the whole apartment, like a scene from 'I Love Lucy,' " she said. 
The baking session was followed by a class lecture in an air-conditioned conference room across the hall, where Mr. Bernstein, who refused to discuss his brownie recipe in front of a reporter, reviewed various bread formulas and tackled the pressing questions of the day. They included how to make sesame seeds stick to dough and how to make sure there is a blueberry in every bite of a blueberry muffin.
Mr. Bernstein looked for a show of hands and said, "Any other questions before we get to the rye bread?"

CORRECTION-DATE: July 26, 2002

 CORRECTION:
Because of an editing error, an article on July 18 about a federally supported school in Queens for artisan bread baking referred incorrectly to its uniqueness. It is New York City's first such baking school, not the city's first baking training program. Other cooking schools have long had baking training programs.

HEADLINE: BLOCKS; 
Limiting Possibilities Downtown

BYLINE:  By David W. Dunlap 

 BODY:
WITH the curtain up on six remarkably similar concepts for the World Trade Center superblock, it has become graphically evident that the planning of its future rests on one day in its past: April 26, 2001.
 That was when the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey entered into a 99-year, $3.2 billion lease on four of the trade center buildings, including the twin towers and the underground shopping concourse, with Silverstein Properties and the retail operator Westfield America. 
 "One of my first goals was privatization of this world famous symbol of the vitality and economic might of the New York region," Gov. George E. Pataki said that day. But in a way no one could have imagined, the arrangement may now be a cautionary tale about privatizing public resources. 
For it seems that the trade center lease, more than any other single thing, is shaping the rebuilding plans. The powerful Port Authority, which managed to clear the whole site in the 60's, is now legally bound to protect the right of two private companies to recover their lost commercial potential.
This obligation has momentarily trumped other questions, among them whether downtown needs 11 million square feet of new offices, 600,000 square feet of stores and a 600,000-square-foot hotel.
Almost every element of the plan is shown in a variety of ways: the size of the memorial, the layout of the transportation hall, the treatment of West Street and the division of the superblock into smaller parcels. Even the notion of hallowing the twin tower footprints is up for discussion.
But not the size of the leasehold. That is fixed. In fact, the architects and planners working for the Port Authority and the Lower Manhattan Development Corporation were instructed not only to restore every square inch of commercial space but to increase the retail area by 40 percent.
"New plans for the site should recognize and address the contractual right and obligation of Westfield America to an expansion of up to 600,000 square feet of retail space," the guidelines decreed. One plan calls for one million square feet.
Neil D. Levin, the executive director of the Port Authority, who was killed in the attack, explained in April 2001 why the lease was so important as a matter of public policy. "Privatizing the World Trade Center," he said, "means a dependable source of revenue to fund regional transportation improvements over the next 99 years."
And from the tenants' perspective, it is perfectly reasonable for Silverstein and Westfield to expect to get the space they bargained for.
Yet there are only so many ways to package that much space while preserving open land for the memorial. That is why it is hard at first to tell the difference among plans by Beyer Blinder Belle, Architects and Planners; Peterson/Littenberg Architects; Skidmore, Owings & Merrill; and Cooper, Robertson & Partners.
Four plans show buildings of 50 to 85 stories in an L shape around the memorial site. Two plans, both involving some construction on the tower footprints, show buildings of 32 to 72 stories in a U shape.
To be fair, these renderings capture a moment that may be 10 years distant, if it comes at all. They show the site as if it were fully built, when in fact each building will rise as the market dictates.
IMAGES of the plan, which can be seen online at www.renewnyc.org and beginning next week in Federal Hall National Memorial at Wall and Nassau Streets, depict a vast area in small scale. Differences that appear minuscule on paper or on screen would be enormous in reality. "Look more closely," said Louis R. Tomson, president of the Lower Manhattan Development Corporation, "and you'll see differences that are quite profound."
The views do not presume to show architectural details, and officials emphasized that the first six concepts are not blueprints but merely starting points for discussion. Given that, though, it would have been a public service to present at least one Plan X, a rendering that conveyed a sense of what the site would look like if designing started afresh.
The government's first choice is a solution that accommodates the lease, though John C. Whitehead, chairman of the development corporation, said on Wednesday that if it is "not possible to rebuild and still meet those requirements and have the kind of beautiful center that we want this to be, then we will change our plans."
He and others have insisted all along that the planning of Lower Manhattan would be transparently open to public scrutiny. What the public may really be learning is how limited planners' choices can be.

HEADLINE: More Cafes May Sprout on Sidewalks 

BYLINE:  By DIANE CARDWELL 

 BODY:
The sidewalk cafe -- that seasonal fixture suggesting summer in the city, leisurely lunches, Paris on the Hudson -- could become even more visible in New York's streetscape under a Bloomberg administration plan.
 Taking restaurant diners, literally, to the streets, cafes have been hugging sidewalks from Madison Avenue on the Upper East Side to DeKalb Avenue in Brooklyn, and now city officials are working on a way for more of them to become legitimate. 
 "We consider them an important amenity for the city," said Gretchen Dykstra, commissioner of the Department of Consumer Affairs, which regulates the temporary spots. "People like them. It's why we go to Paris, and why people like to stay in the city over the summer." 
Despite changes over the years, the permit application process for open-air cafes has remained a multiagency muddle for restaurateurs, who can wait as long as a year for approval of a permit that is good for, at most, two years. Unwittingly, the bureaucracy has encouraged many to break the law, Ms. Dykstra said.
As a result, while the Department of City Planning considers lifting some restrictions on where the cafes are allowed, Ms. Dykstra's agency is creating a plan to simplify and quicken the permit process for restaurant owners.
"We want to make it easier for legitimate businesses to open sidewalk cafes and operate them," Ms. Dykstra said.
The effort comes as restaurateurs, hurt by a flagging economy and decreased tourism, are seeking similar changes.
Still, one man's bastion of charm, or income, can be another's scourge. Neighborhood residents and community boards, contending that sidewalk cafes clog pedestrian arteries and cause unwanted noise, have complained bitterly about unenforced violations.
"Sometimes we'll have a licensed cafe and then there's another table all the way at the curb," said Kenneth M. Moltner, chairman of Community Board 8, which includes the Upper East Side and Roosevelt Island. "The practical effect is that you have a blocked street where people can't walk: people with baby carriages, people with packages, people who just want to walk along the street. And there is also an issue of noise with neighboring apartments."
The current approval process involves half a dozen separate agencies, while the proposal under consideration would centralize that system within consumer affairs, Ms. Dykstra said. Restaurants would "self-certify" that they were in compliance with zoning and other technical regulations, avoiding the need to circulate copy upon copy of an already complicated application, she said.
At the same time, the plan would give Ms. Dykstra's agency the authority to shut a restaurant for violating the regulations, power that currently rests with the Department of Health.
"We think that's the hammer we need," she said.
For now, the department is focused on getting through a glut of pending cafe applications the old way, a process Ms. Dykstra called "extraordinarily unwieldy and bureaucratic." With 539 sidewalk cafes licensed, according to officials, the department has 59 applications pending, down from a backlog of nearly 250 in April.
Under the new plan, which officials hope to have in place by next spring, applications would still have to go through a public review and approval process.
"We want to encourage them to be legal and, to be fair to them, put them through the process quickly," Ms. Dykstra said.
Many restaurants have just accepted fines, which can run $100 a day, as a cost of doing business, Ms. Dykstra said. In other situations, inspectors may go out and confiscate the outdoor furniture, but owners "just go out and replace the chairs at Costco for $200," keeping the cafes running after the inspectors move on.
Kevin B. McGrath, a lawyer representing restaurant owners seeking the kinds of zoning and permit changes the city is considering, said that sidewalk cafes should be allowed wherever the zoning automatically allows restaurants and bars. He said that he had just sent a letter suggesting as much to the Bloomberg administration.
But many communities have been relentless in pushing to deny cafes sidewalk spots, particularly in Manhattan. "The affluent of Manhattan have decided that there are 45 areas where they don't want them," Mr. McGrath said. "The entire length of Madison Avenue. Ridiculous."
Mr. Moltner said his community board generally supported anything that would help ease the way for legitimate businesses to get permits and for the city to crack down on violators. But not without reservations.
"The board understands that restaurants need to operate and make a living," he said. "But the other legitimate part of the community are the residents."

HEADLINE: Albany Chosen as Research Hub For the Next Generation of Chips 

BYLINE:  By RICHARD PEREZ-PENA 

DATELINE: ALBANY, July 17 

 BODY:
The world's largest computer chip makers plan to build a major center for research and development on the next generation of chips here, at the State University of New York, a plan that state officials hope will bring thousands of jobs to the Hudson Valley.
 State officials and a consortium of the chip manufacturers are to announce the $400 million project on Thursday, after almost a year of intensive, secret negotiations between the industry and Gov. George E. Pataki's office. 
 Despite the weak economy and a slumping technology sector, state and industry officials, as well as people who follow the industry, say the project could draw investments worth several times the cost of the project to the region.
The only other such center created by the computer chip consortium, International Sematech, was built in the late 1980's in another state capital and college town, Austin, Tex. Over the next decade, Austin became one of the best places to be in the high-tech world: It experienced explosive economic growth, drawing makers of chips, related materials, manufacturing tools and software to the region. 
"I would expect it to have the same transformational impact on the regional economy here," Mr. Pataki said. "I honestly think this could be the most important economic development for upstate New York since the Erie Canal."
While such talk may be hyperbole, the announcement could be a political boon to Mr. Pataki, a Republican. As he runs this year for a third term, he can cite the center to counter his Democratic opponents, who are blaming him for the weak state of the upstate economy.
Though the economy in Albany, with its government offices and college campuses, has remained strong, and the Hudson Valley has by far the healthiest economy in New York State, officials say the center could create a multitude of jobs within commuting distance of struggling cities like Schenectady and Troy.
Members of the industry consortium include seven United States firms: I.B.M., Intel, Motorola, Hewlett-Packard, Texas Instruments, Advanced Micro Devices and Agere Systems, until recently a part of Lucent Technologies. 
There are also five overseas companies: Royal Philips Electronics, the Dutch giant; Infineon Technologies of Germany; STMicroelectronics of France; Hynix of Korea; and TSMC of Taiwan. Officials of the consortium declined to say much about the deal before the announcement.
American chip makers, with the support of the federal government, created Sematech in the 1980's, when they feared that Japan would become the dominant force in chip manufacturing. Foreign makers were allowed into the consortium in the 1990's. Sematech plays the leading role in developing the basic architecture for computer chips. Individual manufacturers still compete to improve on that architecture, but the industry standards set by Sematech ensure that their products are compatible, even interchangeable.
Sematech also leads in developing the materials and tools needed to produce chips, and tests products. Officials say the Albany center's first task will be to develop improved methods of chip lithography, the etching of minute patterns into chips, particularly with ultraviolet light.
In describing the undertaking, New York officials repeatedly referred to the experience of the Austin area, which gained about 100,000 tech-related jobs and saw its population double in the decade after Sematech located there. Much of that growth, particularly in chip manufacturing, was directly related to Sematech's presence, according to economists and industry analysts.
"Sematech coming here will make Albany the lead R.&D. hub in the world for this industry," said Alain E. Kaloyeros, dean of the School of Nanosciences at SUNY Albany.
But several analysts cautioned that while the development was almost certain to boost the regional economy, Albany in 2002 is not Austin in 1988, and there is no guarantee that the effect will be the same.
For starters, the tech sector of the economy is slumping, as is Sematech itself; the consortium has been cutting its workforce. Any benefits to the industry or to New York from the new center could be delayed until a rebound, and analysts are split on whether to expect one soon.
Kenneth Flamm, a professor of economics at the University of Texas in Austin who studies the semiconductor industry, said, "Sematech being here drew a lot of companies here, because Austin became the logical place to do the materials manufacturing. But our growth was due to other factors, as well, though it's hard to attribute cause and effect for much of it." 
Austin's great advantage, he said, was a a large, first-rate engineering school at the University of Texas that supplied a steady stream of professors and graduates to high-tech industries. It remains to be seen whether SUNY and Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute, in nearby Troy, can be a similar source of talent.
The upper Hudson Valley's relatively low cost of living "is very much in its favor" in attracting new investment, said Richard A. Shaffer, principal of Technologic Partners, which advises venture capitalists on high-tech investments.
"To develop that kind of a regional economy like in Austin is a slow process that requires a gradual change in outlook among the people, the banks that do the lending, everybody," he said.
In its 1987 search for a home for its first center, Sematech considered offers from 36 states -- New York was one of the finalists -- trying to top each other in financial sweeteners. In the end, the chip makers contributed $125 million and the federal government $100 million. Texas put up $62 million to buy an existing factory for Sematech to convert and use, and made low-interest mortgages available to Sematech employees. But money alone did not carry the day -- New York had offered $80 million and Massachusetts more than $200 million.
This time, the consortium negotiated seriously with only New York and a few foreign governments. And while the state will put up $210 million over the next five years for the new center -- Sematech will supply $193 million -- it did not agree to give the consortium any tax breaks or loans, a frequent element of the state's deals with private industry.
The State Legislature will have to approve the $210 million allocation, but representatives of both the Assembly and the Senate said yesterday that there was widespread support. Sheldon Silver, the Democratic Assembly speaker from Manhattan, is scheduled to appear at the announcement of the agreement.
Talks began last summer, when the Semiconductor Industry Association held a meeting at Lake George, where the governor addressed the group and met many of the industry leaders for the first time. Industry officials and analysts said that I.B.M., based in Armonk, N.Y., heavily influenced the decision to focus on New York. They also said that the companies were impressed by the growing high-tech sector in the Hudson Valley.
As recently as 1995, I.B.M. was considering leaving New York State, but Mr. Pataki persuaded the company to stay, in part with a generous package of financial incentives. I.B.M. then decided to build a $2.5 billion computer chip plant, now nearing completion, in East Fishkill, in Dutchess County. It will be the only major chip factory in the state and one of only a handful in the world to carve chips from wafers 300 millimeters wide, soon to be the new industry standard; this is expected to allow cheaper production than the long-used 200-millimeter wafers.
Mr. Pataki and the Legislature have invested more than $100 million in making SUNY's Albany campus a center for computer chip research, including early work on 300-millimeter wafers, and last year the governor established a "center of excellence" in nanotechnology there. The effort has drawn a $100 million commitment from I.B.M., as well as a number of grants from the federal government and other chip makers.

 CORRECTION:
A front-page article yesterday about plans by a consortium of computer chip makers to build a research and development center in Albany misidentified the headquarters country of STMicroelectronics, one maker. Though the company was formerly based in France and keeps many operations there, its headquarters are in Switzerland.

HEADLINE: States Say Bill Would Open Bermuda-LikeTax Loophole 

BYLINE:  By DAVID CAY JOHNSTON 

 BODY:
As lawmakers debated in Washington yesterday how to close the loophole that allows companies to avoid United States taxes by acquiring a Bermuda mailbox, a bill advanced with a provision that state officials say would let companies avoid state and local taxes using some of the same techniques as the Bermuda loophole. 
 American Express, Walt Disney, Viacom, Cisco Systems, Eastman Kodak, Johnson & Johnson, the Limited, Lowe's and Microsoft are among the major corporations lobbying for the bill, which was approved by a House Judiciary subcommittee on Tuesday at a hearing held on such short notice that state officials said they could not attend. A full committee vote is expected soon. 
 The drive to restrict the authority of states and local governments to tax national companies comes as a study, to be released today by the Internal Revenue Service, shows that corporations gave themselves a huge tax cut beginning in 1996 by using tax shelters. 
The legislation to restrict state and local taxing authority would cost the states $9 billion in annual revenue in the first few years, a figure that could quickly grow as companies adjust operations to make full use of the proposed loophole, according to the Multistate Tax Commission, which represents states on tax matters. Cities and counties stand to lose billions more. 
The bill's promoters insist that if the bill becomes law, the obligation to pay state and local taxes will merely be shifted, benefiting only those places where the companies use state and local services because they have invested in offices, factories and computer servers. 
"There need be not one penny less of state tax revenue collected," said Arthur R. Rosen, the head of state and local taxes at the law firm of McDermott, Will & Emery, which represents the companies supporting the bill.
Mr. Rosen acknowledged that taxes would be reduced or eliminated under the bill if companies arranged their operations to owe taxes in jurisdictions that imposed little or no tax, but said he had no dollar estimates.
Representatives Robert W. Goodlatte and Richard Boucher, Virginia Republicans who are co-chairmen of the Congressional Internet caucus, asserted that the bill was needed to stop abusive state tax practices. 
"This bill targets states that have abused their authority to impose taxes," Mr. Goodlatte said yesterday. "It will curb the tax frenzy on the part of those states imposing unreasonable taxes" on companies that make sales, do nominal advertising or sell online in a state.
But Elizabeth Harchenko, chairwoman of the Multistate Tax Commission and director of the Oregon revenue department, wrote yesterday to the House Judiciary Committee that the bill "would legalize and expand abusive corporate tax sheltering that undermines state business activity taxes." 
"In recent years," Ms. Harchenko wrote, "several states have undertaken efforts to curtail aggressive tax shelter activity. This legislation would pre-empt those state efforts to ensure that those who do business within a state pay a fair share of state and local taxes."
She and others said that under the bill a company could use interest payments, royalties and management fees to transfer taxable income in one state to its headquarters in a state where corporate profits are not taxed. That is the same technique that companies use to avoid federal taxes when they acquire a Bermuda mailbox and hold an annual board meeting in Barbados.
Mr. Rosen said "the states have all the authority they need to stop profit shifting" and that if individual state legislatures fail to do so it is their problem, not that of his clients.
The bill to restrict the power of states and cities to tax companies is being driven in large part by the growth of electronic commerce and the sale of products and services that are called intangibles because they cannot be measured easily like a crate of oranges. Some corporations oppose state and local efforts to capture revenue from the digital economy.
The pressure for reduced state taxes on national companies is coming despite a sharp drop in their tax bill. State corporate business activity and related taxes equaled 5.2 percent of company profits in 2000, down from 9.6 percent in 1980, the Multistate Tax Commission said. 
This lower effective tax rate meant companies paid $32 billion in such taxes instead of about $60 billion. But tax breaks enacted by state legislatures explain only about $5.6 billion, or 20 percent, of this drop in corporate taxes. This suggests that the use of tax shelters is costing the states and also that companies have increased efforts to shift revenue and profits from states that tax to those that do not. 
The effect of tax shelters on federal revenue is examined in a study that the I.R.S. will publish today in the quarterly Statistics of Income Bulletin. 
Untaxed corporate profits rose to 24 percent of the profits reported to shareholders in 1998, up from 14 percent in 1996, an increase of two-thirds. This increase meant that the amount of corporate profit not taxed rose by $66.5 billion from 1996 to 1998. 
The I.R.S. analysis follows a March study by a Harvard economist, Mihir A. Desai, who sifted through reports to shareholders to determine whether the use of tax shelters was a significant issue and found evidence that the problem was much larger than the I.R.S. study. 
In 1988, less than 62 cents of each dollar of shareholder profit turned up on tax returns, down from 84 cents in 1996, Professor Desai said. Untaxed corporate profits totaled $247 billion in 1998, Professor Desai found, but deductions for stock options and other known legitimate deductions explained only about $88 billion of this amount. 
His study suggests that in 1998 $155 billion or so of corporate profits were hidden from the I.R.S. in tax shelters, costing the government as much as $54 billion in taxes. That figure is more than five times the $10 billion cost of abusive tax shelters cited by in 1999 by Lawrence H. Summers, who as Treasury secretary then started a campaign to crack down on tax avoidance and evasion by large companies. 
Professor Desai said his analysis of shareholder and taxable profits from 1998 to 2000 found that until 1995 the relative difference was stable and followed expected shifts caused by tax rules. But starting in 1996, he said, the gap between taxable profits and those reported to shareholders began to widen apparently because of tax shelters.

HEADLINE: BASEBALL: YANKEES NOTEBOOK; 
Yankees Tell Dolan Hard Work Is the Key

BYLINE:  By TYLER KEPNER 

 BODY:
George Steinbrenner fired back yesterday at Larry Dolan, the owner of the Cleveland Indians, with a nearly 300-word statement asserting that hard work, not inherent advantages under baseball's current economic climate, had made the Yankees so successful.
 Dolan criticized Steinbrenner, the Yankees' principal owner, on Tuesday, saying that he is "a large part of our problem" in baseball. 
 "I do not believe Mr. Dolan appreciates what it has taken to build the New York Yankees, to develop its brand and provide a winning team for New York and Yankee fans everywhere," the statement began. "In as much as Mr. Dolan is only in his third season in baseball, he may not know that when I acquired the team in the early 1970's, we actually had to pay WMCA just to carry Yankee games on the radio and that attendance was at an all-time low, averaging less than 1,200,000 fans per year from 1972-1975. 
"Since the day that Babe Ruth was acquired, the Yankees have been the envy of many in the game and subject to the jealousies that success brings. In reality, it is the Yankees' success and commitment to providing a consistent winner that is at the center of the criticism. No one complained when the Yankees did not have success on the field. Our revenues have not been developed and increased accidentally. They are directly attributable to hard work and continuing investment in the team. 
"I have run the Yankees the best way I know how and will continue to do so. In the wake of the most recent lawsuit, which has created even more turmoil for Commissioner Selig and his officers, I think it best for me not to comment any further at this time."
Steinbrenner did not mention the continuing dispute between the Dolan family's Cablevision empire and Steinbrenner's YES network, even though a baseball official said the Yankees believed that issue had motivated Dolan's comments.

Johnson Is Secure
The Yankees are happy to have starting pitcher Jeff Weaver, and the Detroit Tigers are happy to have Carlos Pena, the first baseman they acquired from Oakland in the three-way trade that sent Weaver to the Yankees two weeks ago.
But before the Tigers settled on Pena, they asked the Yankees for Nick Johnson. General Manager Brian Cashman turned them down and was willing to pass on Weaver if it meant giving up Johnson.
Johnson, who won Tuesday's game with a ninth-inning home run in Toronto, was not aware of that. But he said his goal through the minors had been not just to play in the majors, but to stick with the Yankees.
Even though Johnson's homer Tuesday was his first in 59 at-bats, he said he never expected to have 12 homers by mid-July. But he also never expected to have an average of about .240. Manager Joe Torre has stuck with Johnson, 23, as an everyday player.
"You make that commitment," Torre said. "You make that decision long before what you see in the games, and you know when you go out and play at the big-league level, there are experiences you have to go through."
Cashman said: "The bottom line is, there are players you really feel strongly about. We felt strongly about Soriano, Jeter, Pettitte, Rivera and Bernie. We've had temptations along the way with a lot of those guys, and Nick Johnson as well.
"But there's something about those players we feel strongly about, and we want to keep them. Nick's one of those guys we definitely want to keep and be a part of our future."

Mendoza Improving
Reliever Ramiro Mendoza, who was not available during the Yankees' two-game series in Toronto because of a sore right elbow, played catch for five minutes before last night's game and said he could pitch.
Mendoza said he had felt discomfort in his elbow when he threw his curveball, but there were no more problems yesterday. "I'm good," he said.

Jeter Is Honored
The Sporting News named shortstop Derek Jeter its No. 1 Good Guy in Pro Sports for 2002, recognizing Jeter's Turn 2 Foundation, which has awarded more than $1.5 million for children's programs since 1996. "If you can affect a child's life off the field, it means a whole lot more to me" than baseball, Jeter said. "I'm very proud of the number of children we've been able to help."

HEADLINE: Polymath Selects Polymath to Direct Bard Arts Center 

BYLINE:  By MEL GUSSOW 

 BODY:
Jonathan Levi, 46, an arts educator, editor and writer, today was named director of the new $62 million Bard Performing Arts Center, designed by Frank O. Gehry as a kind of Bilbao on the Hudson. The center is to be completed in January and open in April as a home for music, theater and dance. The building's two theaters will be used both for academic purposes and as a public space for international cultural events.
 In announcing the appointment of Mr. Levi, Leon Botstein, president of Bard College, stressed the multiplicity of his experience, especially his work as a founding editor of Granta magazine and his role as an assistant to Harold O. Levy, New York City schools chancellor. At the Board of Education he was in charge of arts and cultural affairs for New York City schools. With Mr. Levy, he was instrumental in creating the Bard Early College High School program, in which New York schoolchildren could begin to do college-level work. 
 Searching for a director for the Gehry showplace, Mr. Botstein said, he and his associates looked for someone who "could help invent an institution as opposed to someone walking in with a kind of formula." They chose Mr. Levi because they saw him as an initiator and curator rather than simply an arts presenter. He is, Mr. Botstein said, "a guy who makes things happen."
Crediting Mr. Levi with boldness, a quality that fits in with the nature of the Bard center, Mr. Botstein said, "Risk aversion is the most boring criterion of the success of people who reach the top of their organizations." He added that the center was a very risky undertaking, especially in the current economic environment: "We need someone who is confident and has no fear of failure."
Mr. Levi said he was drawn to the position by the Gehry building and Mr. Botstein's own polymath background. He is an orchestra conductor as well as college president, and he assured Mr. Levi that he could continue his own outside activities.
Besides his other accomplishments, Mr. Levi is a novelist and one of the artistic directors of the Nine Circles Chamber Theater, which presented an opera based on his short story "The Scrimshaw Violin" last December at the 92nd Street Y in Manhattan.
He said that one reason Mr. Levy put him on the Board of Education was his belief in the importance of arts education as "one of the strongest engines for learning."
In a joint interview in Bard's Manhattan office, Mr. Levi and Mr. Botstein overflowed with enthusiasm for their project. At one point, Mr. Botstein spoke out against the separation of managerial and creative roles in arts institutions and said that Goethe and Mahler were examples of artists who worked in both capacities. Then he switched signals to attack "the bureaucratization" of the arts in the late 20th century.
With a laugh, Mr. Levi interrupted him to say, "I thought you were going to suggest that I was an heir to Goethe and Mahler."
Like the Guggenheim Museum that Mr. Gehry designed in Bilbao, Spain, the Bard center is highly distinctive with a series of low-lying steel canopies that look like large, overlapping ribbons. "It's going to go down with the Colossus of Rhodes as one of the great wonders of the world," Mr. Levi said.
After a local protest about the site as an incursion into a historic landscape, the center was redesigned and was moved to the northern part of the campus. In the process it doubled in size.
The building will have two major performing spaces, a lyre-shaped 900-seat opera house and a black box theater for experimental dance and drama. During the academic year, the black box theater will be used by the college's dance and drama departments under the direction of Jean Churchill and JoAnne Akalaitis. Both Mr. Levi and Mr. Botstein emphasized the intimacy of the two houses.
"You don't want to look at a concert with a telescope," Mr. Botstein said, criticizing Tanglewood and Saratoga as "mad outdoor places that have to be amplified and are ideas from the past."
The acoustics were designed by Yasuhisa Toyota, a director of Nagata Acoustics, Japan's leading acoustical consulting firm, and the Bard opera house will also serve as a concert hall. The American Symphony Orchestra, with Mr. Botstein as conductor, will be the resident orchestra. The hall will also be converted for dance and theater pieces, but Mr. Levi said the conversion would take 80 man-hours.
The building is to open with two weekends of performances, to be followed next summer by a festival of the arts. The festival that first season will center on the work of Janacek. In a sense it will be an extension of the Bard Music Festival, which Mr. Botstein has helped run for more than a dozen years, weaving together concerts and operas with recitals and panel discussions. Next year, in the new location, there will be related theater and dance events.
Looking back on his days at Granta, Mr. Levi said that organizing the Bard festival would be something like editing that magazine, offering a prismatic view of a central subject. The idea is to overlook Janacek's most popular operas (like "The Cunning Little Vixen") and concentrate on his lesser-known works. As an adjunct, there will be consideration of related subjects such as Kafka, Czech national identity and the political history of Central Europe.
Contrasting his festival to those at the Brooklyn Academy of Music and Lincoln Center, Mr. Levi said that he hoped to have at least one international company in residence every year and to involve that company and other participants in the curriculum. He said he was drawn to Bard by the international outlook on campus and the presence of such artists as the novelist Chinua Achebe on the faculty.
One of the attractions of Bard, for the public and for students, is its rural location in Annandale-on-Hudson. It is 90 miles from New York City (a train to Rhinecliff, and a bus from there to the college). Across the river is the Storm King sculptural park.
Mr. Botstein said that "people are going to want to see this building and to experience the architecture." It will be the first major Gehry building in the New York area. Mr. Levi added that he could imagine the festival as a kind of Glyndebourne in the Catskills, including picnics on the grass during the intermission.
One thing that Mr. Levi and Mr. Botstein share, in addition to enthusiasm, is that both were trained as violinists, with Mr. Levi playing jazz and classical music. Each said he had no intention of appearing as an instrumentalist at the Bard center, not even for a benefit performance. As Mr. Levi said, "It would be a benefit if we didn't play."

HEADLINE: Turkey Says Debt Negotiations Aren't Linked to Stand on Iraq 

BYLINE:  By DANIEL SIMPSON 

DATELINE: ANKARA, Turkey, July 17 

 BODY:
Turkey wants the United States to write off more than $4 billion in debt, but government officials said today that they were not naming a price for their support of military action to topple President Saddam Hussein of Iraq.
 Turkish officials, who publicly oppose any operation against Iraq but privately concede they may be willing to compromise, said they had discussed cancellation of money owed for arms purchases with the deputy defense secretary, Paul D. Wolfowitz, during his talks here. 
 "The economic support we discussed was independent of any other issue," a senior government official said. Ankara also wants Washington to hasten Congressional approval for a $228 million aid package that the Bush administration has earmarked for Turkey, according to officials of both countries. 
But the Turkish government was at pains to emphasize that this did not amount to laying down conditions for an operation in which the support of Turkey, NATO's only Muslim member, would be vital.
Before leaving Ankara, Mr. Wolfowitz emphasized that Washington was not asking for Turkey's clear backing for an attack on Iraq.
"We did not come here asking for decisions -- we haven't made our own decisions ourselves," Mr. Wolfowitz told reporters in Ankara, the capital. He said that before making such decisions, it was important for Mr. Bush "to have the benefit of perspectives of key countries who are key partners, and Turkey is as important as any country in figuring out how to grapple with this issue."
Turkey, mired in its worst recession since 1945 and a political crisis that has brought about early elections, publicly repeated its reservations about a renewed offensive against Iraq after its request for economic assistance.
Mr. Wolfowitz assured the Turks, who say the 1991 Persian Gulf war and subsequent sanctions against Baghdad cost billions of dollars in lost trade, of American support to ease a crippling economic crisis that has made Turkey the International Monetary Fund's biggest debtor.
"Turkey's economic situation is something of great concern to the United States," he said.
He also sought to ease Turkish fears that an attack on Iraq could create problems with Kurds who are demanding independence. 
Since Kurdish fighters wrested control of northern Iraq from Baghdad after the gulf war, the United States has protected the breakaway region. But Mr. Wolfowitz ruled out the creation of a separate state, which Turkey has long opposed, fearing its own large Kurdish minority would be encouraged to renew a guerrilla struggle for independence.
"There is a lot of agreement with Turkey on what we would like to see after Saddam," Mr. Wolfowitz said. "We're both opposed to Kurdish states. We're both concerned about the rights of minorities."
He also reminded Turks that they stood to gain from a change of regime in Baghdad, where the Iraqi president was defiant today, insisting there was no way Washington could bring an end to his 23-year rule.
If Iraq were to become a democratic state, "it won't only be the people of Iraq who benefit from that, it will be the whole world and very much this region," Mr. Wolfowitz said. "Turkey stands to benefit enormously when Iraq becomes a normal country."

HEADLINE: Olympic Site Committee Denies New York Is Out of the Running 

BYLINE:  By CHARLES V. BAGLI 

 BODY:
Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg and the United States Olympic Committee denied reports yesterday that New York City was losing out in the bidding to serve as host of the 2012 Summer Olympics.
 New York is vying with San Francisco, Washington-Baltimore and Houston to win the nomination as United States candidate for host of the 2012 Olympics. The site-selection panel of the United States Olympic Committee, which visited each city in recent weeks for a final review, will announce its choice on Nov. 3. 
The Washington Post reported on Wednesday that Washington-Baltimore and San Francisco had vaulted into front-runners' positions in the competition, citing an unnamed official involved in the process. New York had lost ground, the paper reported, because of an inordinately high $4 billion in construction costs.
But the U.S.O.C. denied the report, saying that "the notion that we have already tabbed favorites is a complete work of fiction and imagination."
Mayor Bloomberg sounded relieved yesterday.
"I think we have a compelling case," Mr. Bloomberg said. "It is just inconceivable to me that there is another city that better represents everything the Olympic movement stands for, or any other city that can, in today's world, provide the facilities and the security and the transportation and the spirit and the venues to have the world's greatest sporting event."
Before joining the Bloomberg administration, Daniel Doctoroff, Mr. Bloomberg's deputy mayor for economic development, led the Olympic effort in New York almost single-handedly. Mr. Doctoroff has said that the Olympics could be a tremendous boost for New York that would leave a legacy of public sports venues and economic development. Meantime, the city and the state must decide whether to help build a $1 billion Olympic stadium on the west side of Manhattan and an extended subway line, both of which are critical components in New York's bid.
The site committee's tentative plan is to meet in Chicago on Aug. 26 to pare the list of potential host cities to two finalists. The U.S.O.C. will ultimately submit its nomination to the International Olympic Committee, which will choose the site in 2005 by secret ballot. London, Paris, Rome, Moscow and Berlin are also expected to be in the running.
One member of the American site-selection team dismissed the report in The Washington Post.
"We haven't even spent time discussing the data yet," he said. "The best you could have gotten out of anyone inside the room is their own preference."

HEADLINE: Housing Starts Fall, But Activity Stays Strong, Experts Say 

BYLINE:  Reuters 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, July 17 

 BODY:
Starts on new housing fell 3.6 percent in June after a surge the previous month, the government said today, but economists, including the Federal Reserve chairman, Alan Greenspan, said housing remained at strong levels.
 "There's no evidence that one can see that the fairly significant strength in the housing market is in any way impeded," Mr. 
Greenspan said at a House hearing on the economy, in response to a question about the report. 
 Groundbreaking for new homes eased to a seasonally adjusted 1.672 million units a year from an upwardly revised rate of 1.735 million units in May, the Commerce Department reported.
Starts were below the projections of analysts polled by Reuters, who had forecast a 1.677 million unit rate.
Despite the decline in June, analysts noted that building and sales activity remained at historically high levels.
"Over the past 20 years, the level of single-family activity posted in June was exceeded only three times. And two of those occasions occurred this year," said Joel Naroff of Naroff Economic Advisors.
Permits, an indication of future activity, rose 1.4 percent, to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 1.7 million.
Regionally, starts were mostly lower, falling 7.6 percent in the South -- the busiest home-building region -- 2.2 percent in the West and 0.9 percent in the Midwest. Groundbreaking for new homes climbed 6.1 percent in the Northeast.
Another survey released today by the mortgage bankers trade association showed that mortgage applications fell in the week ended July 12, while refinancings rose as the national average on the 30-year fixed-rate mortgage slid to almost 6.5 percent.
Although applications are also still at strong levels, the housing market may not show the same levels of growth over the second half of the year, said David Seiders of the National Association of Home Builders.

HEADLINE: Republicans Point Corporate-Abuse Finger at Democrats 

BYLINE:  By ADAM NAGOURNEY 

DATELINE: SAN FRANCISCO, July 17 

 BODY:
Republican state party leaders went on the offensive today against Democratic attacks on corporate wrongdoing. Some asserted that the problems had begun under President Bill Clinton, while others even promised to hold Democrats accountable for the difficulties on Wall Street.
 The party leaders spoke as they arrived here for a Republican National Committee summer meeting, in which they will discuss strategy for trying to retake control of the United States Senate in November. They are also facing potential losses in several governor's races. 
 While some Republican leaders said they hoped that the issue of corporate abuses would move off center stage before the campaign season becomes more intense, others said they feared the party's political prospects would suffer if the economy is on a downturn.
"If the market gets worse, if there's a sense that not much is being done, it could be a problem," said Al Cardenas, the chairman of the Florida Republican Party.
Many Republican leaders expressed frustration at what they said was the effort by Democrats to blame their candidates for wrongdoing by corporate leaders. They suggested that President Bush had at first been slow to respond to it. Some Republicans, hinting at an aggressiveness in the campaign ahead, said the party should set the problems at the feet of Democrats.
"Take a look at this realistically; when did this corporate abuse start?" said Ronald Eibensteiner, the Minnesota Republican chairman. "It didn't start when George Bush became president. If there ever was a decade of greed, it was the 1990's when Bill Clinton was president. There was this whole culture of, if you can get by, that was O.K. And if you got caught, just stonewall. When the president of the United States, Bill Clinton, did that, other people began to think, 'Hey, we can do that.' "
Marty Ryall, the chairman of the Arkansas Republican Party, said Democrats were just as reliant on support from errant corporations as Republicans.
"I don't think the public is going to buy into the idea that the Republicans brought this on," Mr. Ryall said. "These accounting problems with Enron and the other companies were going on for some time. It's not something that happened in the last year. I think Democrats will try that, to say that Republicans were more tied to corporate America than Democrats, but I think Republicans can make a counter issue."
The remarks came at a decidedly uneasy time for the Republican Party. Its leaders girded for what they said they expected to be a concerted attack by Democrats, first in the halls of Congress and then in dozens of Congressional and Senate races across the country. While many expressed confidence that they could deflect such attacks, they acknowledged that was a potentially significant concern in an election where their margin of error is small.
The Democrats currently control the Senate by one seat, and of the 36 governor's seats being contested this year, 23 are held by Republicans. As a matter of history, the party in power in the White House loses seats in mid-term Congressional elections.
Accordingly, some party leaders said they would be satisfied if the Republicans just held their own in November. "A break-even for us at the federal level would be historic, though I'm not sure the press would report it that way," said Marty Connors, the chairman of the Alabama Republican Party. Others, perhaps reflecting the exuberance that tends to be found at these kind of partisan gatherings, said they believed that the Republican Party would buck the trend, in no small part because of the nation's approval of Mr. Bush's efforts to counter terrorism.
"I know it's against the traditional tide to gain seats in the midyear of the presidency, but I think we're in a position do to that," Mr. Ryall said. "It depends on the confidence that the public has in the economy in the fall."
Other Republicans said the outcome in November depended as much as on how Mr. Bush and Republicans in Congress handled the economic questions in coming weeks, and how the Democrats played the subject.
"If the president can put his game plan on the table, as he's been doing, and if a game plan is communicated properly to the public, and if the public thinks it's the right game plan, and if the Congress does something about it, and the markets start rebounding, than I think the public will be fine," Mr. Cardenas said.
Mr. Connors added: "I don't think anybody who is walking around thinks this started the day George Bush was sworn into office. This is a cumulative affect that's happened over time."
John Dowd, the New Hampshire Republican chairman, said: "I don't think it's President Bush's fault, and people would be hard-pressed to blame it on him. The American people have already figured out that it has nothing to do, or very little to do, with politics."
Nonetheless, Republican leaders here said they had been closely watching Democratic attempts to portray the Republicans as close to business, and opposing Congressional efforts to regulate accounting and corporate practices.
"They think they can make hay with it, but I don't think people are going to buy that," Bob Kjellander, a national committee member from Illinois, said tonight. "This is a bipartisan problem."

HEADLINE: CORPORATE CONDUCT: LEGISLATION; 
Ina Shift, Republicans Pledge to Pass Accounting Bill

BYLINE:  By RICHARD A. OPPEL Jr. and DANIEL ALTMAN 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, July 17 

 BODY:
In an abrupt about-face, Republicans in the House pledged today to reach final agreement by next week with the Senate on a sweeping overhaul of laws concerning accounting and corporate behavior.
 The move today illustrated the political burden on House leaders not to be seen as obstructing or watering down legislation meant to prevent future corporate scandals, even as some rank-and-file Republican House members expressed worry that attempts to delay the legislation would hurt the party in the November elections. 
 Michael G. Oxley, the Ohio Republican who is chairman of the House Financial Services Committee, said this afternoon that he thought that competing proposals by the House and Senate were mostly "very, very similar." He also promised lawmakers that differences in the bills would be worked out before the House adjourns next week for the monthlong August recess. 
The comments were striking because Mr. Oxley, who sponsored the House legislation, had repeatedly said in the last week that the Senate bill had substantial flaws and that lawmakers needed a "cooling off" period so they could negotiate a more reasoned bill in a less politically charged atmosphere.
But skeptical Democrats said today that they thought that Republicans might still try to kill the bill -- or water it down substantially -- by delaying negotiations long enough so that outrage over the current wave of corporate scandals subsides. That would make it easier, they said, to soften the legislation when negotiators from the House and Senate meet in conference committee to reconcile differences between the approaches. Today, both chambers appointed the lawmakers who will handle the negotiations.
Also today, Alan Greenspan, the Federal Reserve chairman, warned that the wave of earnings restatements that have hurt stock prices lately was not over. But he also reiterated his faith in the economy's fundamental strength. Mr. Greenspan, testifying before Mr. Oxley's panel, also predicted that the "frenzy" of companies trying to drive up stock prices is mostly finished. "The shock of what has happened will keep malfeasance down for a while," he said.
The Senate bill, sponsored by Paul S. Sarbanes, the Maryland Democrat, calls for more far-reaching corporate changes and regulations than legislation passed by the House. Both chambers have also passed tough new criminal penalties for corporate wrongdoing, with the House approving on Tuesday even longer prison terms than what the Senate approved on Monday. The proposals are an outgrowth of the accounting scandals at Enron, WorldCom and other companies that have rocked Wall Street and undermined investor confidence. 
But Richard A. Gephardt, the House Democratic leader, said that Republicans were trying to "act like you're trying to get something done, but really slow it down and water it down."
"That's their goal," he added. "That's their game plan."
Mr. Gephardt and other Democrats had seized on a threat by Republican Bill Thomas, the House Ways and Means Committee chairman, to use a parliamentary tactic to block the Senate bill. But within hours, Republican officials said they did not plan to issue a so-called blue slip on the legislation that would have invoked a constitutional argument -- that portions of the bill that "raise revenue" did not originate in the House -- to block the bill. According to a Republican aide, House leaders told Mr. Thomas that while they thought his objections had merit, it was not feasible politically to use the maneuver to block the Senate bill.
Still, Mr. Oxley and other leading Republicans reiterated today that they had problems with the Senate bill. That includes the amount of investigative and enforcement power the bill grants to a new regulatory board to oversee the accounting industry and other provisions that Republicans say will spur needless lawsuits against business -- but which Democrats say are needed to protect whistle-blowers and investors. 
Mr. Oxley also cited the need to require companies to make real-time disclosure of material financial information and a Republican proposal for a mechanism to recoup money that investors have lost because of corporate wrongdoing. "We are seeking to strengthen the Sarbanes approach with a number of specific improvements," Mr. Oxley said.
But some rank-and-file Republicans remain worried that attempts to tinker too much with the legislation, or water it down, will hurt their party politically. Two Republican House members, Mark Foley of Florida and Mike Rogers of Michigan, have collected signatures from 16 other Republicans urging the House to simply accept the Senate bill.
Peter T. King, a New York Republican, said most Republicans want to pass something quickly, even if it closely resembles the Senate bill.
"I think they want something close to the Sarbanes bill," Mr. King said. "The last thing we want to be seen as is obstructionist. They would like to get this done sooner rather than later."
In his comments before Mr. Oxley's committee, Mr. Greenspan was critical of one crucial part of the House and Senate proposals: requiring senior executives of publicly traded companies to certify the accuracy of their financial statements.
That proposal, made initially in the Senate but later approved by the House, goes much farther than a plan by the Securities and Exchange Commission to require chief executives and chief financial officers at about 1,000 of the biggest companies to certify their financial reports.
"I'd hate to have to administer something of that dimension," Mr. Greenspan said, citing concerns about an overload of paperwork at the S.E.C. "I am fearful of the resources that inevitably would go in that direction would impede the much smaller group which you really need to oversee in that respect."
Mr. Greenspan confirmed his support for counting employee stock option grants as business expenses, but he said Congress should allow the Financial Accounting Standards Board to make the change. "If you leave it to F.A.S.B. and you don't interfere with what they're going to do, they'll get it right," he said.
The Fed chairman said Congress should avoid increasing investors' ability to sue companies that manipulate their books to inflate share prices. "I don't see that that has any particular economic advantage," he said, suggesting that legal actions ought to be left to the S.E.C.
He also showed little enthusiasm for an attempt by Congress to close off foreign tax havens where American businesses have sheltered hundreds of billions of dollars in revenue. "If you're going to have a free market system," he said, "you have to have freedom of movement."
Separately, President Bush said today that he was confident an inquiry by the S.E.C. into accounting at the Halliburton Company would exonerate Vice President Dick Cheney, its former chief executive. Until today, the White House had declined to comment on the inquiry to avoid being accused of trying to influence it. Mr. Cheney has not discussed the inquiry.

HEADLINE: House Conservatives Budge on Arts Spending 

BYLINE:  By CARL HULSE 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, July 17 

 BODY:
After a brief rebellion by conservative Republicans, the House today approved a $19.8 billion spending measure for public lands and cultural programs after increasing spending for a once-divisive arts programs. The final vote was 377 to 46. 
 That came after lawmakers agreed, on a 234-to-192 vote, to give $126 million to the National Endowment for the Arts, a $10 million increase, and $131 million to the National Endowment for the Humanities, an increase of $5 million. 
 The arts endowment in particular has been a past target of conservatives on the grounds that it financed obscene and inappropriate projects and drew the government into the subjective area of artistic merit. 
Republicans quickly took aim at the program when they gained control of the House in 1994 and sought to eliminate the agency a few years later. It was kept alive by the Clinton administration and sympathetic senators. But financing has remained stagnant and is now more than 40 percent below the years leading up to the Republican takeover.
"Shame on us," said Representative Lynn Woolsey, Democrat of California, who chided opponents of the program for leaving the country "culturally impoverished.'
Representative Louise M. Slaughter, Democrat of New York and chairwoman of the Congressional Arts Caucus, noted that President Bush had recognized the role of arts in schools. "Now it's time to show us the money," Ms. Slaughter said.
Even critics of the program said changes had made it more acceptable in recent years. Still, they said that the initial spending levels approved by the Appropriations Committee were sufficient. Forty-two Republicans and 191 Democrats backed the increase, while 177 Republicans and 14 Democrats opposed it; two independents split.
At the urging of California lawmakers, the House agreed to prohibit federal spending on the development of three dozen oil leases off that's state's coast. The authors of the amendment said California deserved the same consideration as Florida, where the Bush administration recently agreed to buy back oil leases opposed by Gov. Jeb Bush.
Representative Lois Capps, Democrat of California, who wrote the amendment, said she hoped the 252-to-172 vote would lead to a permanent prohibition on new drilling.
"Passage of this amendment is a major step toward terminating the leases that threaten the Central Coast's environment and economy," Mrs. Capps said. 
In a sign of tensions in Congress, consideration of the spending measure to finance the Interior Department and other agencies -- the third of 13 spending measures that will be considered in the House -- was slowed on Tuesday by resistance from conservative Republicans. They were seeking to cut up to $775 million from the measure, saying they did not want it to exceed the requests of President Bush.
The group sought to make its point procedurally by offering amendments to cut spending, beginning with a reduction of $162 million for the Bureau of Land Management.
Challenging their own party's leadership of the appropriations process, the conservatives said they were worried that passing "bloated" measures in the early stages would make it much more difficult when the House turned to the larger spending measures for health, justice, housing and veterans.
"If the Houses passes the first appropriations bills at levels significantly above the request, I think we will be forced at the end of the process to break the bank," said Representative Peter Hoekstra, Republican of Michigan.
Though the proposals to enact the cuts were overwhelmingly rejected, the debate kept the measure from being moved forward and frustrated House leaders who want to make progress on the spending bills.
Representative Patrick J. Toomey, Republican of Pennsylvania and one of the leaders of the rebels, said the spending foes agreed to drop their amendments today in exchange for a promise from Republican leaders that the first spending measure to be brought up after the August recess would be the labor and health measure, one of the largest.
Democrats described the feud as an intramural Republican fight caused, they said, by Mr. Bush's tax cuts, which reduced the money available.
"We are seeing a philosophical war within the Republican party," said Representative David R. Obey of Wisconsin, the ranking Democrat on the Appropriations Committee.
The bill contains almost $520 million more than last year for the Interior Department and appropriates $2.4 billion for the National Park Service, $39 million more than sought by the president. It also includes $700 million in emergency money for fighting wildfires.

HEADLINE: Poll Finds Concerns That Bush Is Overly Influenced by Business 

BYLINE:  By RICHARD W. STEVENSON and JANET ELDER 

 BODY:
Americans worry that President Bush and his administration are too heavily influenced by big business, fear that Mr. Bush is hiding something about his own corporate past and judge the economy to be in its worst shape since 1994, the latest New York Times/CBS News Poll shows.
 The survey suggests that the unfolding revelations about corporate misconduct and inflated earnings hold considerable peril for the White House and Mr. Bush's party in this Congressional election year. Not surprisingly, Democrats sounded particularly troubled about the administration's handling of the corporate issue, but even Republicans shared many of the concerns. 
 By more than two to one, the poll's respondents said the administration was more interested in protecting the interests of large companies than those of ordinary Americans. That concern was expressed by more than a third of Republicans and an overwhelming majority of Democrats. 
Two-thirds of all respondents, and slightly more than half of Republicans, said business interests had too much influence on the Republican Party. Slightly less than half of all those polled said business exerted too much influence over the Democrats. Many Americans also expressed concerns that Mr. Bush and Vice President Dick Cheney had not been sufficiently forthcoming about their own past business dealings.
With the stock market falling, concern about the economy intensifying and the United States facing the continued threat of terrorist attacks, the poll found a surge since the start of the year in the percentage of people who think the country is on the wrong track. It also found that Americans' trust in government, which climbed after Sept. 11, has slid significantly.
For all the reservations respondents expressed about the administration's commitment to looking out for them -- and about the business ethics of administration officials when they were in the private sector -- Mr. Bush remains personally popular. His approval rating stands at 70 percent, continuing a steady decline from its peak of 89 percent after Sept. 11, but still impressive by any standard.
Asked whether Mr. Bush "cares about the needs and problems of people like yourself," 68 percent responded yes.
The nationwide telephone poll of 1,000 adults was conducted Saturday through Tuesday. It has a sampling error of plus or minus three percentage points.
People who participated in the poll and agreed to follow-up interviews said that they often separated Mr. Bush's performance as commander in chief from his performance on domestic issues, and that they tended to give greater weight to the fight on terrorism in judging him.
"Bush is doing his job well in Afghanistan, but the economy is falling down around us," said Debbie Wilson, 40, an unemployed hairdresser from Elmira, N.Y.
"As far as big business's influence on the administration, it's hard to be sure of what is really going on," Ms. Wilson, a Democrat, said. "I watch the news about him and Cheney and the tycoons, and you don't know where you're at. The whole country seems to be too influenced by business, but there is not enough information given to the public."
Paula Pittman-Troisi, 40, of Birmingham, Ala., said she thought Mr. Bush had been a great leader in the fight against terrorism. But she had questions about the influence of campaign contributors and big business on government.
"Though the intertwining of raising campaign funds and big business worries me, it doesn't worry me enough to lose my faith in George Bush," said Ms. Pittman-Troisi, a part-time securities saleswoman who is an independent voter.
Still, among the survey's most striking findings were the responses concerning the past business practices of Mr. Bush and Mr. Cheney. Though most of those polled said that they did not know much about the business dealings of the two, the respondents expressed skepticism about whether the president and vice president were being candid and open.
Asked whether Mr. Bush was telling the truth about his dealings at Harken Energy, an oil company where he was a director and consultant from 1986 to 1993, 48 percent of those surveyed said that they believed Mr. Bush was hiding something; another 9 percent said they thought he was mostly lying. Seventeen percent said they believed that Mr. Bush was telling the entire truth.
Yet when asked whether they thought Mr. Bush had acted honestly and ethically in his business practices while in the corporate world, 43 percent of the survey's respondents said yes, more than double than the 21 percent who said no.
Mr. Bush has maintained that all his actions at Harken were proper, and at a White House news conference yesterday he reiterated that a Securities and Exchange Commission investigation into his sale of Harken stock in 1990 ended with no action taken against him.
Mr. Cheney's role as chief executive of the Halliburton Company, the oil services giant whose accounting practices during Mr. Cheney's tenure are being investigated by the S.E.C., drew similarly skeptical responses. Forty-three percent of those polled said they thought Mr. Cheney was hiding something, 10 percent said they thought he was mostly lying and 11 percent said they thought he was telling the entire truth.
Asked specifically whether they thought Mr. Cheney had done anything unethical while running Halliburton, 23 percent said yes and 32 percent said no.
Mr. Cheney has declined to comment on his involvement in Halliburton's accounting policies, citing the S.E.C. inquiry. Asked about Mr. Cheney yesterday, Mr. Bush defended him as a "fine business leader."
While questions about the corporate careers of Mr. Bush and Mr. Cheney were most pronounced among Democrats and independents, Republicans also expressed concern. Thirty-nine percent of the Republicans polled said that Mr. Bush was hiding something; 37 percent said Mr. Cheney was doing so.
Ari Fleischer, Mr. Bush's spokesman, said the poll results were evidence "of a nation that continues to strongly approve of the job the president is doing and a nation that knows the president is honest and ethical and shares the nation's moral values."
Mr. Bush registered positive approval ratings for his handling of foreign policy. Also, 80 percent of those polled said that Mr. Bush shared the moral values most Americans try to live by.
At the same time, people remained split about whether Mr. Bush is really in charge of what goes on in his administration.
The corporate scandals and the questions about the honesty of corporate earnings reports are clearly touching the public. Sixty-two percent of those surveyed called the issues very serious, and another 29 percent said they were somewhat serious.
The poll also found that 43 percent of respondents did not think Mr. Bush's proposals for addressing the problems went far enough, but 36 percent said they were about right.
The poll found that 58 percent of all respondents -- and 38 percent of the Republicans -- said that business has too much influence on Mr. Bush himself. Two-thirds of all those surveyed, and slightly more than half the Republicans, said business has too much influence on the administration generally. 
Few administrations have come to office with more corporate experience than Mr. Bush's. But with both politics and the economic outlook being recast by the volatility on Wall Street and the reports of malfeasance within corporations, business experience that had once been the highlight of the administration's resume has increasingly given Democrats an opportunity to portray Republicans as detached from the concerns of average people, the poll showed.
Those surveyed were divided over whether Mr. Bush was personally more interested in helping corporations than in helping ordinary people, but 58 percent said the Republican party was primarily interested in protecting big business. Slightly more than half the Republicans polled said that business interests had too much influence with their own party.
The poll found that big business is held in relatively low regard. More than a third said they have very little confidence in big business, and 71 percent said business does only a fair -- or poor -- job of making sure its executives adhere to ethical and legal standards.
The survey's findings about the business scandals were mirrored by general declines in trust in government and in views about the economic outlook. 
Asked to rate the state of the economy, 49 percent said very good or fairly good, while 49 percent said fairly bad or very bad. It was the most pessimistic assessment since early 1994, when the economic boom of the last decade was just getting under way.
Larry Shepler, 42, of Chesapeake, Va., a high school teacher, said in a follow-up interview that he thought Mr. Bush was doing a good job because the country was moving in the right direction, the economy had stabilized and the war on terrorism was going reasonably well.
Mr. Shepler, a Republican, said: "Though big business has always been too involved in the government because lobbyists for big business have always had too much influence and carry more weight than the average person, it is only coming out now because companies are in financial trouble and people are being made more aware of it."

How the Poll Was Conducted
The latest New York Times/CBS News Poll is based on telephone interviews conducted Saturday through Tuesday with 1,000 adults throughout the United States.
The sample of telephone exchanges called was randomly selected by a computer from a complete list of more than 42,000 active residential exchanges across the country.
Within each exchange, random digits were added to form a complete telephone number, thus permitting access to listed and unlisted numbers alike. Within each household, one adult was designated by a random procedure to be the respondent for the survey.
The results have been weighted to take account of household size and number of telephone lines into the residence and to adjust for variation in the sample relating to geographic region, sex, race, age and education.
In theory, in 19 cases out of 20, the results based on such samples will differ by no more than three percentage points in either direction from what would have been obtained by seeking out all American adults.
For smaller subgroups the margin of sampling error is larger.
In addition to sampling error, the practical difficulties of conducting any survey of public opinion may introduce other sources of error into the poll. Variation in the wording and order of questions, for example, may lead to somewhat different results.

Posada Foils Tigers, Making Pettitte a Winner

BYLINE:  By TYLER KEPNER 

 BODY:
As Mark Redman bounded for the mound before the bottom of the ninth inning last night, a new feature appeared on the Yankee Stadium scoreboard. Instead of the usual clip of John Belushi rallying the boys in "Animal House," a fan in the bleachers did his own Belushi routine.
 It was never over with DiMaggio and Mantle, the fan bellowed, and it's not over with Jeter and Giambi. 
 Redman never heard it. The 28-year-old Detroit Tigers left-hander said he concentrated on the sounds of deflation he produced all night, the groans and grunts of fans in the crowd of 49,116 who expected more from their team's intimidating lineup. 
"There's not a hitter out there that will get me rattled," Redman said. "Babe Ruth is no longer playing, so I guess I don't have to worry about him."
But the bombast from the bleachers was prophetic. The Yankees came back in the ninth inning to foil Redman, 2-1, earning a victory for their own left-hander, Andy Pettitte, who also worked a complete game. Jorge Posada's two-out, line-drive single to left scored Derek Jeter from second base with the winning run.
Pettitte's complete game was his second in his last four starts. He allowed 11 hits, but was much more dominant than that; five of the hits were infield singles, and another was a broken-bat blooper. Pettitte is making something of a season that started in distress.
"There were times early on when I wasn't sure how I was going to do this year, if I was going to be able to come through it," said Pettitte, who missed two months with elbow tendinitis. "To be able to see that my arm strength is there is a great sign for me."
The Yankees were handcuffed by Redman's changeups for eight innings, held mostly to dribblers or pop-ups as the Tigers clung to a 1-0 lead. But Alfonso Soriano led off the Yankee ninth with a double that skipped past Shane Halter at third. Soriano leads the majors in extra-base hits, but Halter was playing in, out of respect for his speed and the possibility of a bunt. He could not react in time.
Jeter walked on a full count, the first walk of the game by either pitcher, and after a conference on the mound, Redman retired Bernie Williams on a popout. Jason Giambi lashed a single to center, tying the game, but Raul Mondesi popped out for the second out.
Then Posada, batting right-handed, came up and got ahead in the count, 2-0. He looked for a high changeup and blistered it over Halter's head and into the left field corner. Jeter knew the Tigers had no play, and he started cheering before he had rounded third.
"We were just trying to do too much early," Posada said. "When we got to the ninth inning, we said, 'Let's calm down.' Soriano got a double; the ball took a funny hop on the third baseman, and that was it. You get a double leading off the inning with nobody out and Derek gets a walk, you've got a pretty good chance."
Pettitte gave the Yankees that chance by stifling the Tigers after Damion Easley's run-scoring single in the third. The Tigers hit Pettitte hard in the fourth, but Mondesi squelched that rally.
Halter led off with a single, and Robert Fick dumped a broken-bat single into right. Halter kept going, challenging Mondesi's strong arm. Few, if any, runners had challenged Mondesi since his trade to the Yankees on July 1, and he fired a strike to third. Robin Ventura tagged Halter on the shoulder for Mondesi's first assist with the Yankees.
Mondesi slapped his glove with his hand and Pettitte pointed to him from the infield. Pettitte took care of things himself the rest of the way, pounding four-seam fastballs -- the pitch he throws hardest -- on the inside corner. 
"I was throwing nothing but four-seam fastballs, not many balls to the outside corner," Pettitte said. "For me to be able to do that and face guys four or five times and still be doing that in the ninth inning is a good sign for me. I wanted to put a second good start together, so that was nice. I want to go on a run."
Pettitte, who won in Cleveland last Thursday in the first game after the All-Star Game break, would have been the losing pitcher had Redman survived the ninth. He nearly did, with a fastball that probably did not hit 90 miles per hour but a changeup that devastated a team of power hitters.
"He had a good changeup going tonight, and he wasn't making a lot of mistakes with it," Giambi said. "He was keeping it down in the strike zone and then all of a sudden popping one in there and jamming guys. He did a great job changing speeds."
The Yankees' lineup came in with 2 hits in 28 career at-bats off Redman, who did not want to share his secrets. But he did say the environment made him better.
"I think it's the atmosphere, the history, the stadium, the respect that this team has around the league," Redman said. "They win."
They were not winning last night until the last pitch Redman threw. Then, as any fan in the bleachers would have been happy to remind him, it was over.

INSIDE PITCH
ORLANDO HERNANDEZ might be suspended for throwing at CARLOS DELGADO in Toronto on Monday, but he should make his scheduled start for the Yankees against the Boston Red Sox on Saturday. Baseball's chief disciplinarian, BOB WATSON, said last night that he was not close to a decision. Watson said that he was reviewing tapes but that had not spoken to the umpires from Monday's game. Watson did interview Manager JOE TORRE and General Manager BRIAN CASHMAN on Tuesday. Hernandez and Torre, who were ejected, earned automatic fines but may face additional punishment.

Cain and Abel Played Out in a Run-Down Amazon Port

BYLINE:  By RICHARD EDER 

 BODY:
THE BROTHERS
By Milton Hatoum
Translated from Portuguese by John Gledson.
226 pages. Farrar, Straus & Giroux. $23.
 "The world turns many times and yesterday a tower fell," the Spanish saying goes. Two towers in New York, and a metaphorical as well as a literal fall: our twin trusts in physical security and economic integrity. 
 In the years when we were continentally assured, the world felt like somewhere to visit, not somewhere that would visit us. When our literature now and then dealt with abroad, it was usually a matter of us in another place, not of them in ours. (Except for Henry James, whose Americans, whether at home or in Europe, harbored inklings of inner invasion.)
The point was to get "us" right, in a different setting. It seems time for our imagination to make room for "them" and listen to voices coming from far off.
Art has only a low-powered microphone; it requires our ears. We have to bend them to hear the voices of Milton Hatoum's Lebanese immigrants living some 50 years ago in a decayed Brazilian river town. Partly, what makes them audible and affecting is the timbre of Mr. Hatoum's sentences and sensibility; partly, perhaps, it is that in the world's growing wilderness we may want to pay heed to the messages conveyed by small sounds.
"The Brothers" is a harsh story told in lush tropical colors that veil its harshness. Mr. Hatoum, a Brazilian of Lebanese descent, has placed it among his own people. Whether the plot is invented or borrows from reality, it takes second place to a teeming memory of place and culture. More exactly, to the imagination of memory: blurring the edges in legend while intensifying its emotional resonance.
Manaus, far up the Amazon River, is the setting. Once the El Dorado of world rubber production, it was ruined -- thanks to purloined seeds or cuttings -- by British plantations started in Malaya. It has lived since then in a teeter of stagnation, revival and backsliding. The river meant trade, though: small trade conducted by small traders, many of them immigrants from the Middle East.
"The Brothers" tells of Halim, a peddler grown into a shopkeeper; his wife, Zana; and their twin sons. More than Cain and Abel, the enmity between Omar and Yaqub resembles the fratricidal cycle of the blue shark, whose progeny tear at each other while still unborn.
When the twins are 8, Zana's beloved father dies on a visit to his village in Lebanon. Her mourning is extravagant: a temporary ban on the voracious sex she enjoys with Halim, and her insistence on sending one twin to stay for a while with her father's relatives. Doting on Omar, she selects Yaqub, but World War II stretches the boy's exile to five years.
The story begins when he returns at 13 with rough peasant manners and little Portuguese. Working with taciturn brilliance to catch up, he wins a coveted place as an engineering student in Sao Paulo. Success follows, with rare visits home; his long-forced absence remains an unhealed wound. So does his pain over Zana's near-incestuous passion for his brother.
Omar grows up to be a dissolute, arrogant, womanizing layabout. His own resentment of his brother's success -- apart from everything else, Yaqub stole his girlfriend when they were young and later married her -- erupts in a series of physical assaults over the years, capped at last by Yaqub's cold vengeance.
Mr. Hatoum evokes better than he narrates. His family epic is a series of episodes confusedly linked. The chronology is hard to follow and occasionally hard to believe. Important developments are casually introduced, seemingly dropped, revived. Mysteries planted with no great conviction (among them the true identity of the narrator, raised as the twins' half-brother) are resolved or partly resolved with no great impact. It is a narrative without vertebrae, oozing forward and back as a worm does, and not so much progressing as pulsing.
In the pulsing, though, lie the book's allure and eventually its wisdom. The twins are not true characters in themselves (and without a character behind them Omar's repeated wastrelings become tedious), but blows of fate. The victims are Halim and Zana, along with Domingas, whose relationship is more than that of a servant.
Beyond the parents' vulnerability is the frailty of family, token of seeming permanence but subject to time and vicissitude. Beyond this is the precariousness of a particular community and culture in a city that has itself known a sudden transition from riches to ruin due to events as far away as the Far East and as close as an Englishman carrying off a package of propagating material. A package no larger, perhaps, than a few box cutters. The rubber trees of Manaus fell like towers.
Who would care, of course, about towers, cities or even families if all these weren't different crystallizations of hopes, achievements, affections and griefs? Mr. Hatoum lustrously evokes, in a mode as much of comedy as nostalgia, the life of his Lebanese riverside community. He evokes the smells, savors, noises and bustle of Manaus's old town and waterfront.
He gives us the stumbling, intensely human characters of Halim and Zana. The young peddler is too timid to court directly the beautiful daughter of the local cafe owner. A friend writes him a ghazal -- an Arabic love poem -- which he recites in the stunned silence of the cafe. Zana takes two weeks to consider his courtship, then accepts under stringent conditions. Her severity, along with her helpless pleasure in Halim's leonine lovemaking, mark their early marriage.
Later come her obsession with Omar and, in her last years, a burning hope for her sons to be reconciled. To burn is to burn out.
Dying, Zana lifted her head up and asked in Arabic, so that only her daughter and her friend, herself nearly a hundred, could understand: "Have my sons made their peace with each other yet?"
"No one answered. Then Zana's smooth, almost unfurrowed face vanished; she merely turned her face to one side, searching for the only tiny window in the gray wall, where a patch of evening sky was gradually going dark."

HEADLINE: ART REVIEW; 
Viennese Tales From the Berkshire Woods

BYLINE:  By HOLLAND COTTER 

 BODY:
VIENNA in the Berkshires in the summertime sounds like a publicist's dream. And in a sense the series of cultural events called the Vienna Project, under way this summer in western Massachusetts, is exactly that. Nearly a dozen local museums, theaters and musical institutions are offering 20th-century Viennese fare, which means Strauss lieder, paintings of alpine landscapes and a "Sound of Music" singalong.
 But historically, Vienna has meant many other things, too, and they aren't all pretty. It has meant Sigmund Freud and Gustav Mahler but also the young Adolf Hitler. It has meant a rich, imperial capital in decline; a city of abject poverty and radical social ideas; an ethnic melting pot that nurtured the seeds of Aryanism. In recent years, a vivacious contemporary-art scene has formed, but so has an atmosphere of right-wing xenophobia. In short, travel brochures may serve up Vienna mit schlag, but it is a confection that can leave a bitter aftertaste. 
 In the Vienna Project, four museums share the task of presenting art produced in the city throughout the 20th century and up to the present: the Sterling and Francine Clark Art Institute and the Williams College Museum of Art, both in Williamstown; the Massachusetts Museum of Contemporary Art, or Mass MOCA, in nearby North Adams; the Berkshire Museum in Pittsfield; and the Norman Rockwell Museum in Stockbridge. Technically, all four can be visited in a day, but only if you're in hit-and-run mode. The Clark alone has several interrelated shows of circa-1900 Viennese work; they're small, but even small takes time. So, of course, does big, which is what you find at the cavernous but art-friendly Mass MOCA, where new conceptually based Viennese art requires sustained attention to make its effect. And then you have a drive: North Adams and Stockbridge are about an hour apart. So spreading a Viennese visit over two days might be an idea.
"Gustav Klimt Landscapes" at the Clark Art Institute is the summer's sure-fire Berkshire art draw, both because shows at this exquisite museum always are and because Klimt is a familiar name, known for his paintings of women swathed in gilded, pattern-flecked cloaks and gowns that virtually define the Jungendstil movement.
Born in Vienna in 1862, Klimt began his career as a muralist whose talent and ambition early on landed him juicy public commissions. His brilliant career-on-the-rise veered off the mainstream track, however, when his experiments with content and style drew the censure of the academic establishment. Always a self-confident leader, he responded by spearheading a separatist art movement.
Called the Secession, it held its own exhibitions and found a steady source of patronage in the city's wealthy bourgeois elite. In line with his outsider status, Klimt worked a bit at being a character. He took to dressing in blue, muumuu-like floor-length smocks inside and outside the studio, and had himself photographed in them, looking soulful.
I've always had trouble with Klimt's iconic figurative paintings. Their insistent visual flash looks as hard and sleek as the surface of a credit card; their sexiness seems lacquered over and their Byzantine theatricality slightly silly and already old-fashioned. (It's useful to remember that Cubism was being invented in Paris at the same time.) But the 15 landscapes in the Clark show, organized by Stephan Koja, a curator at the Galerie Belvedere in Vienna, are different.
They aren't particularly innovative paintings: they are basically a goulash of Impressionism, Symbolism and 19th-century Austrian realism. But they have an appealing elasticity and fleetness, and a sense of unmystical mystery. They share the sensuality of Klimt's pattern-wrapped figures, but add breath and a pulse.
Many of the landscapes were done during Klimt's annual summer stays in the Austrian and Italian countryside; he painted them for himself, not on commission. The earliest in the show are near-abstract expanses of flickering water and shadowed fairy tale forests. Then come paintings of thick, wall-like, flower-dotted foliage, images that have almost no foreground or sky: they feel as dense as a patch of peat moss cut straight from the earth. (Klimt, it seems, used a telescope to compose many of his landscapes, which helps to explain their sense of squashed space.)
Later come scribbly paintings of flowers and pointillistic depictions of lakeside towns. Despite their basis in naturalism, these images look as elaborately, self-consciously decorative as most Secession work. And just how decorative this can be is made clear in satellite exhibitions at the institute featuring two of Klimt's colleagues, the designer Josef Hoffmann and the architect Otto Wagner.
The Hoffmann show is made up of furniture and tableware that he -- or rather the Wiener Werkstatte, the artisanal association he helped found -- produced for the Wittgenstein family, high-powered Viennese industrialists. It's off-putting stuff. When a design is clean-lined, it seems to weigh a ton: a writing desk on view is as thick and blank as a safe. And when it's ornamental, as in the case of a solid silver vertical vitrine encrusted with enamel and moonstones, it is fantastically, grotesquely, unstoppably so.
The same applies to Otto Wagner's design for a hall of a new Academy of Fine Arts, seen at the Clark in an 1898 table model. Conceived to be sited on the edge of the Vienna Woods, where nature and culture met, it is a Neo-Classical nightmare of decorative excess or, if you prefer, a bold, proto-postmodern example of architectural pastiche. Anyway, it was never built.

Williams College Museum of Art
For every successful Klimt that Vienna turned out, it also produced hundreds of failures: -- artists who came, and saw, and didn't conquer the art world. One of them was Hitler, who at 18 arrived from Germany with stars in his eyes. He wanted to be a painter or architect or theater set designer, and above all, something great. And at first he adored the city: he attended the opera nonstop, joined the crowds to watch the elaborate public spectacles that surrounded the imperial family and diligently prepared for his entrance exams to the art academy.
He failed the exams; who knows how different 20th-century history might have been if he had passed. Broke, depressed and resentful, he was reduced to sleeping in shelters for the homeless and to selling drawings of landscapes and cityscapes to earn a little money. (One of his drawings is in the show; it's not bad.) Many of his friends at the time were Jewish, but his politics were growing increasingly reactionary. When he learned that his mother was dying, he returned to Germany, embittered by his Viennese experience and filled with a hatred for the city that never subsided.
The story of Hitler's sojourn there and how it affected his later life is considered in minute, fascinating detail by "Prelude to a Nightmare: Art, Politics and Hitler's Early Years in Vienna, 1906-1913" at the Williams College Museum of Art. Organized by Deborah Rothschild, curator of exhibitions, it uses films, photographs, books, drawings and a wealth of period ephemera to travel between two conjoined but very different cities. One was the glittering Vienna of imperial ritual and bourgeois wealth. The other was the impoverished, dirty, overcrowded Vienna whose citizens were growing more restive by the day in the years preceding World War I. Hitler had contact with both cities and learned from each.
From working-class Vienna he absorbed a strain of radical populism that he later twisted into a German nationalist political platform. From imperial Vienna, he picked up tips on how to produce effective political theater. In a 1907 Viennese photograph, for example, we see little girls with wreaths of flowers in their hair lined up to honor the Hapsburg emperor. Identical girls in the same bucolic attire appear in a German photograph, but now it is 1937, and they are giving the Nazi salute.
The exhibition, which was inspired by Brigitte Hamann's book "Hitler's Vienna: A Dictator's Apprenticeship" (Oxford University Press, 1999), requires patient reading -- there are many wall labels -- as well as looking, but it is worth the effort. It suggests that while Vienna certainly wasn't the birthplace of Nazism, as filtered through one man's eyes, it contributed to the movement's final shape. The city changed Hitler's life, and by default changed the lives of millions of other people, many of whom never set foot in its streets.

Mass MOCA
The Nazis' arrival in Vienna in the 1930's more or less put an end to innovation in the visual arts. Modern styles were banned as degenerate; private patronage, much of it Jewish, was eliminated. A once multicultural metropolis became a monocultural island.
In the 1970's, an internationally visible vanguard art known as Viennese Actionism briefly emerged with a brutalizing version of Conceptual and performance art. Then after the collapse of the Soviet empire in 1989, a new art scene began to coalesce, thanks in part to an influx of artists from Eastern Europe, whose presence helps to re-establish the multiethnic culture of old.
Some of these contemporary developments are surveyed in "Uncommon Denominator: New Art From Vienna" at Mass MOCA in North Adams. Organized by Laura Stewart Heon, a curator at the museum, the exhibition includes work by 15 artists who live in the city (but only half are Austrian by birth). 
The art shown is uneven -- little of the large-scale painting is of much interest --but a sense of exploration is palpable, as are links, affectionate or otherwise, to the past. The spirit of Klimt pops up repeatedly. He's there in the pattern-on-pattern self-portrait drawings of Adriana Czernin, a 33-year-old artist from Bulgaria, and in a video that shows her struggling to free her head from a suffocating flower-print scarf.
There are echoes of Klimtian landscapes in a wall drawing of woodland trees by Barbara Eichhorn, and in a film titled "Hole" by Hans Schabus, in which the artist is seen digging a ditch in a forest clearing. The setting, with its towering trees and filtered sunlight, is gorgeous. But the shoveler's ceaseless and apparently purposeless activity -- the video is a continuous loop, without beginning or resolution -- undercuts the ideal of repose in nature that seems to have inspired Klimt's summertime paintings.
In fact, culture, not nature, is the subject of much of the rest of the show. Mr. Schabus has a second, very funny video, in which he gives a horror-movie suspense to the story of an artist -- himself again -- working in his studio. Heimo Zobernig also pursues an art-about-art ad absurdum tack, in installations and videos that treat classical Modernism as a kind of do-it-yourself kit of formal effects. And as far as references to the original Secession's ornament fixation, Peter Kogler has the final word in a room-filling digital projection of constantly shifting and morphing linear grids.
Other contributions play down visual in favor of conceptual concerns. Vienna's historically diverse but economically inequitable social and cultural makeup is touched on both in paintings by Johanna Kandl and in an installation by Lois Weinberger titled "Portable Garden." Mr. Weinberger has grown weeds -- plants either ignored or actively eradicated -- in plastic shopping bags of a kind commonly used by poor European and African immigrants to hold their belongings.
By contrast, wealth is the subject of a set of outsize BMW promotional products created by Swetlana Heger and Plamen Dejanov, while conspicuous consumption finds an apt embodiment in Erwin Wurm's "Fat Car II," a normal automobile transformed into a bulging mass of dimpled and puckered pink flesh that gives the phrase "gas guzzler" fresh meaning.
Finally, many of the exhibition's themes come together in the work of Franz West, Vienna's most frequently exported contemporary artist. His deliberately tatty, handmade, handpainted, portable and usable furniture is a reminder both of the city's elite and illustrious design tradition and of its invisible populations who are forced to recycle their lives from the street.

Berkshire Museum
For a quick recap of early modern Viennese art at its best, you won't do better than the succinct exhibition titled "Secession Graphic Art Through World War I: Posters of the Vienna Secession," at the Berkshire Museum in Pittsfield. The dozen or so posters, on loan from the Historisches Museum der Stadt Wien, were made by artists to advertise the movement's exhibitions, and practically anybody who was anybody, Secession-wise, in the early days is represented here.
Klimt's poster for the first exhibition, in 1898, is here. It shows a nude Theseus slaying the Minotaur to rescue the noble youth of Athens, much as Klimt and his fellow refuseniks imagined themselves freeing Viennese art from the ogres of the academy. In this case, he paid a price: the poster was cited for indecency, and he had to scratch out the genitals of his mythical liberator.
Also in the show are a melancholic image by the death-haunted Swiss painter Ferdinand Hodler; a picture by Egon Schiele of artists working together around a table like disciples at the Last Supper; and a famous Alfred Roller poster in which the repeated "s" characters in Secession unfurl from the top to the bottom of the sheet with the grace of Islamic calligraphy. Roller was particularly renowned as a church muralist and opera designer. (He did the original sets for "Der Rosenkavalier.") The young Hitler worshiped him as a hero. 

Norman Rockwell Museum
In "Lisbeth Zwerger's Land of Oz," at the Norman Rockwell Museum in Stockbridge, you will find more contemporary Viennese art, but with scant immediate resemblance to that at Mass MOCA. Ms. Zwerger, who was born in Vienna in 1954 and works there, is a children's-book illustrator; the delicate watercolor paintings and pencil drawings on display were recently done for a new edition of L. Frank Baum's "Wonderful Wizard of Oz."
For years, the idea has circulated that Baum intended his book, first published in 1900, as a Populist allegory, with the Tin Woodman representing the American worker, the Scarecrow the American farmer, and the Wizard himself President Grover Cleveland, or maybe William McKinley. The show's organizer, Stephanie Plunkett, associate director for exhibitions and programs at the museum, has looked into the matter and found no evidence that Baum actually intended such a reading, giving us the option of enjoying Ms. Zwerger's designs without a political gloss.
Her take on the story is remarkably fresh, partly because she has never seen the Hollywood film. She turns an American adventure story of moral valor and folk wisdom into a delicate Neverland ballet. Each scene is as airy as a stage set, and although the characters are rendered with wit and charm, they have dark moods and cast long shadows. The effect, in short, is bittersweet, the characteristic Viennese blend.

HEADLINE: Philip Morris Profit Up 14%, Helped by Foreign Sales 

BYLINE:  By GREG WINTER 

 BODY:
Despite a constant erosion in the national demand for its cigarettes, the Philip Morris Companies said yesterday that its profits grew 14 percent in the second quarter, primarily because its prices continue to climb and the appetite for American cigarettes remains particularly strong overseas. 
 With the average price of premium-brand cigarettes like Marlboro now at $3.64 a pack, about 31 cents higher than they were at the beginning of last year, Philip Morris has been more than able to make up for the steady decline of smokers in the United States. 
 Even though the company sold 7.4 billion fewer cigarettes to wholesalers across the country over the last few months, a drop of nearly 14 percent from last year, its operating profit in the United States still rose to $1.45 billion in the quarter from $1.38 in the period a year earlier, in part because Philip Morris cut back on promotions and has raised cigarette prices by about 12 cents a pack so far this year.
"That's the beauty of pricing," said Bonnie Herzog, a tobacco analyst with Salomon Smith Barney. "You may lose some customers, but for the ones who continue to buy, your profits are very high." 
More important for Philip Morris, its international sales grew 3 percent during the quarter, totaling more than 185 billion cigarettes -- four times as many as the company sells in the United States.
That growth, occurring on virtually every continent but particularly pronounced in Asia and Eastern Europe, helped push Philip Morris's profits up to $2.6 billion for the quarter that ended in June, compared with the $2.28 billion it earned during the corresponding period last year. 
Per-share earnings also rose, to $1.21, from $1.03. Were it not for certain unusual expenses, like the cost of integrating its two food businesses, Nabisco and Kraft, the company said its earnings would have been $1.24 a share, about a penny more than what Wall Street expected.
Overshadowing the results was a subtle acknowledgment that the company's dominance in the United States has slipped, if only slightly, for two consecutive quarters. Since the start of the year, Philip Morris cigarettes have lost nearly 1 percent of market share in stores, to 50.2 percent, particularly as prices go up and smokers switch to generic, discount cigarettes that are often half the price of well-known brands. Besides Marlboro, other Philip Morris brands include Benson & Hedges, Parliament and Virginia Slims. 
To combat the slide and reach more overseas smokers, the company said it would spend an extra $350 million this year on promotions, a move that would bring its earnings down to "the lower end" of its 9 to 11 percent growth target. And while there is little chance that prices will come down, few analysts expect them to rise quite as fast as in the past. 
Since the 1998 tobacco settlement, cigarette prices have gone up by $1.46 a pack, according to Prudential Securities. On top of that, no less than 14 states, racing to plug the sudden holes in their budgets that appeared when the economy started slowing down, have raised cigarettes taxes to an average of 53 cents, up from 42 cents a pack in the last year. 
Yet because the increase has come in a series of small increments, usually no more than a few percentage points, smoking rates have hardly deviated from their historic rates of decline of roughly 1 percent a year.
"If people bought all their cigarettes for the year upfront and had to pay $5,000 at once, it would make a huge difference," said Robert T. Campagnino, a Prudential analyst.
Shares of Philip Morris fell $1.67 yesterday, to $42.45.

HEADLINE: How Pitt Could Make Fraud Less Tempting 

BYLINE:  By FLOYD NORRIS 

 BODY:
WHEN Republicans are demanding the kind of prison terms for accounting shenanigans that used to be reserved for drug dealers, you know you're seeing what a British prime minister once called "the unacceptable face of capitalism."
 But the possibility of long prison terms won't end corporate fraud any more than it has halted the sale of heroin. There's more than enough money in drugs to entice dealers to take the chance. And nothing has been done to end the easy millions that bosses can get from even a temporary rise in a share price. 
 And that is where Harvey L. Pitt should come in. Until 1991, top executives cashing in stock options could not do so quickly. The Securities and Exchange Commission required them to wait six months between the time they bought stock, whether in the market or by exercising options, and the time they sold it. If they did not wait, trading profits had to be turned over to the company.
But the S.E.C. changed the rule so executives no longer had to take any risk when cashing in options. An S.E.C. official back then told me that "better economic analysis" had convinced the S.E.C. that "the opportunity to profit begins when the option is acquired," so that is when the holding period began. Within a few years options became the biggest part of the pay packages for many bosses. Among 50 big American companies last year, chief executives received options valued, on average, at $6 million each.
An interesting study by Jennifer N. Carpenter of New York University and Barbara Remmers of Virginia Tech shows that in the old days, bosses who had to hold on to shares for six months exercised options when the shares were likely to rise. Under the new rule, it appears that chief executives of smaller companies developed a tendency to take option profits shortly before their stocks declined. Did someone say "inside information"?
As Mr. Pitt ends his first year as S.E.C. chairman, he can point to an impressive record of enforcement actions, including two cases this week. One showed that PricewaterhouseCoopers had allowed two companies, Avon and Pinnacle Holdings, to inflate profits by wrongly accounting for consulting fees they had paid to -- you guessed it -- PricewaterhouseCoopers. Another showed that even after Enron collapsed, PNC Financial was using off-balance- sheet magic to mislead investors about its growing portfolio of bad loans.
But that record has not helped Mr. Pitt's public image very much. Repealing the misguided 1991 rule change might help him establish a reputation as a reformer. Now that we know that some executives fake profit numbers, requiring a holding period of at least six months makes more sense than ever. 
Another good move for the S.E.C. would be to force companies to disclose important information more often. More and more investors now understand that the failure to treat the value of options as an expense is deceptive. And they realize that optimistic assumptions on pensions have allowed companies to manufacture dubious profits. But disclosures on those issues are only in annual reports, and companies are not eager to change that. (I.B.M. ducked questions on both issues in its conference call this week.) Such numbers should be in every quarterly earnings report.
Similarly, debacles at Kmart and Enron have shown that it can be crucial to know whether a company could be forced to repay debt early if its bond rating was cut. Moody's reports that hundreds of companies with such triggers have not disclosed them to investors. The S.E.C. could order such disclosures immediately.
Mr. Pitt has had a rocky first year at the S.E.C. Making option-rich bosses take risks again, and giving investors better information, would get his second year off to a good start.

HEADLINE: THE MARKETS: STOCKS & BONDS; 
S.&P. 500 Index Drops to Its Lowest Level Since 1997

BYLINE:  By Bloomberg News 

 BODY:
Stocks fell yesterday, driving the Standard & Poor's to its lowest level since 1997, as companies including Automatic Data Processing, Eli Lilly and PNC Financial Services lowered profit forecasts and executives said there was little sign of a rebound in technology spending by businesses.
"The earnings picture is not strong enough to get stocks out of their funk," said James Awad, who invests $900 million as chairman of Awad Asset Management.
 The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index slid 24.48 points, or 2.7 percent, to 881.56. Financial and health care stocks contributed about half the loss. The United States stock benchmark has not been that low since Oct. 27, 1997. 
 Declines in Coca-Cola and Philip Morris led the Dow Jones industrial average down 132.99 points, or 1.6 percent, to 8,409.49. The Nasdaq composite index dropped 40.30 points, or 2.9 percent, to 1,356.95.
The broadest measure of the United States stock market, the Wilshire 5000 total market index, has dropped 15 of the last 17 weeks. This month, 36 of the S.& P. 500's stocks have gained.
About two stocks fell for every one that rose on the Nasdaq and on the New York Stock Exchange yesterday. About 1.7 billion shares traded on the Big Board, 20 percent above the three-month daily average.
Microsoft, which reported earnings after the close, led a decline in computer-related shares. Its shares fell 89 cents, to $51.11. 
Thomas M. Siebel, chief executive of Siebel Systems, said sales at his company, a maker of customer service software, would probably not improve for the rest of the year. Joseph M. Tucci, chief of EMC, a maker of computer data storage systems, echoed the Siebel forecast. Siebel dropped $2.12, to $9.62; EMC declined 23 cents, to $8.40.
Stocks extended their slide after the Philadelphia Federal Reserve Bank said its general economic index expanded in July at the slowest pace in seven months, as weaker orders and shipments brought activity down from a four-year high.
Eli Lilly shed $2.36, to $48.54. The company, the maker of the antidepressant Prozac, cut its 2002 earnings targets, saying regulators' concerns about manufacturing problems may delay new products. Lilly reported that second-quarter earnings fell 20 percent as generic competition reduced Prozac sales.
Banks were the second-biggest decliners in the S.& P. 500 after PNC said profit might be hurt by a settlement with regulators over how the company accounted for units it created with American International Group.
PNC fell $6.91, to $39.69. American International, the largest insurer, dropped $3.67, to $57.23.
Automatic Data Processing fell $9.75, to $31.60, after the company, the largest payroll processor, said 2003 results would be hurt by slumping United States business spending.
Philip Morris fell $1.67, to $42.45. The company, the world's largest tobacco company, reported second-quarter profit that missed estimates and projected 2002 per-share earnings growth at the low end of the 9 percent to 11 percent range.
Coca-Cola dropped $2.07, to $47.93. After Coke reported earnings on Wednesday, investors questioned if too much of Coke's volume growth had come from lower-margin juice brands.
Bonds surged as investors ran from equities. By late in the day, the price of the 10-year note rose 19/32, to 102 1/32. The note's yield, which moves in the opposite direction from the price, fell to 4.61 percent from 4.68 percent on Wednesday. The 30-year bond climbed 22/32, to 99 18/32. Its yield dropped to 5.41 percent from 5.46 percent.

HEADLINE: When a Crop Becomes King 

BYLINE:  By Michael Pollan; Michael Pollan is the author, most recently, of "The Botany of Desire: A Plant's-Eye View of the World."

DATELINE: CORNWALL BRIDGE, Conn. 

 BODY:
Here in southern New England the corn is already waist high and growing so avidly you can almost hear the creak of stalk and leaf as the plants stretch toward the sun. The ears of sweet corn are just starting to show up on local farm stands, inaugurating one of the ceremonies of an American summer. These days the nation's nearly 80 million-acre field of corn rolls across the countryside like a second great lawn, but this wholesome, all-American image obscures a decidedly more dubious reality. 
 Like the tulip, the apple and the potato, zea mays (the botanical name for both sweet and feed corn) has evolved with humans over the past 10,000 years in the great dance of species we call domestication. The plant gratifies human needs, in exchange for which humans expand the plant's habitat, moving its genes all over the world and remaking the land (clearing trees, plowing the ground, protecting it from its enemies) so it might thrive. 
 Corn, by making itself tasty and nutritious, got itself noticed by Christopher Columbus, who helped expand its range from the New World to Europe and beyond. Today corn is the world's most widely planted cereal crop. But nowhere have humans done quite as much to advance the interests of this plant as in North America, where zea mays has insinuated itself into our landscape, our food system -- and our federal budget. 
One need look no further than the $190 billion farm bill President Bush signed last month to wonder whose interests are really being served here. Under the 10-year program, taxpayers will pay farmers $4 billion a year to grow ever more corn, this despite the fact that we struggle to get rid of the surplus the plant already produces. The average bushel of corn (56 pounds) sells for about $2 today; it costs farmers more than $3 to grow it. But rather than design a program that would encourage farmers to plant less corn -- which would have the benefit of lifting the price farmers receive for it -- Congress has decided instead to subsidize corn by the bushel, thereby insuring that zea mays dominion over its 125,000-square-mile American habitat will go unchallenged.
At first blush this subsidy might look like a handout for farmers, but really it's a form of welfare for the plant itself -- and for all those economic interests that profit from its overproduction: the processors, factory farms, and the soft drink and snack makers that rely on cheap corn. For zea mays has triumphed by making itself indispensable not to farmers (whom it is swiftly and surely bankrupting) but to the Archer Daniels Midlands, Tysons and Coca-Colas of the world. 
Our entire food supply has undergone a process of "cornification" in recent years, without our even noticing it. That's because, unlike in Mexico, where a corn-based diet has been the norm for centuries, in the United States most of the corn we consume is invisible, having been heavily processed or passed through food animals before it reaches us. Most of the animals we eat (chickens, pigs and cows) today subsist on a diet of corn, regardless of whether it is good for them. In the case of beef cattle, which evolved to eat grass, a corn diet wreaks havoc on their digestive system, making it necessary to feed them antibiotics to stave off illness and infection. Even farm-raised salmon are being bred to tolerate corn -- not a food their evolution has prepared them for. Why feed fish corn? Because it's the cheapest thing you can feed any animal, thanks to federal subsidies. But even with more than half of the 10 billion bushels of corn produced annually being fed to animals, there is plenty left over. So companies like A.D.M., Cargill and ConAgra have figured ingenious new ways to dispose of it, turning it into everything from ethanol to Vitamin C and biodegradable plastics.
By far the best strategy for keeping zea mays in business has been the development of high-fructose corn syrup, which has all but pushed sugar aside. Since the 1980's, most soft drink manufacturers have switched from sugar to corn sweeteners, as have most snack makers. Nearly 10 percent of the calories Americans consume now come from corn sweeteners; the figure is 20 percent for many children. Add to that all the corn-based animal protein (corn-fed beef, chicken and pork) and the corn qua corn (chips, muffins, sweet corn) and you have a plant that has become one of nature's greatest success stories, by turning us (along with several other equally unwitting species) into an expanding race of corn eaters.
So why begrudge corn its phenomenal success? Isn't this the way domestication is supposed to work? 
The problem in corn's case is that we're sacrificing the health of both our bodies and the environment by growing and eating so much of it. Though we're only beginning to understand what our cornified food system is doing to our health, there's cause for concern. It's probably no coincidence that the wholesale switch to corn sweeteners in the 1980's marks the beginning of the epidemic of obesity and Type 2 diabetes in this country. Sweetness became so cheap that soft drink makers, rather than lower their prices, super-sized their serving portions and marketing budgets. Thousands of new sweetened snack foods hit the market, and the amount of fructose in our diets soared. 
This would be bad enough for the American waistline, but there's also preliminary research suggesting that high-fructose corn syrup is metabolized differently than other sugars, making it potentially more harmful. A recent study at the University of Minnesota found that a diet high in fructose (as compared to glucose) elevates triglyceride levels in men shortly after eating, a phenomenon that has been linked to an increased risk of obesity and heart disease. Little is known about the health effects of eating animals that have themselves eaten so much corn, but in the case of cattle, researchers have found that corn-fed beef is higher in saturated fats than grass-fed beef.
We know a lot more about what 80 million acres of corn is doing to the health of our environment: serious and lasting damage. Modern corn hybrids are the greediest of plants, demanding more nitrogen fertilizer than any other crop. Corn requires more pesticide than any other food crop. Runoff from these chemicals finds its way into the groundwater and, in the Midwestern corn belt, into the Mississippi River, which carries it to the Gulf of Mexico, where it has already killed off marine life in a 12,000-square-mile area. 
To produce the chemicals we apply to our cornfields takes vast amounts of oil and natural gas. (Nitrogen fertilizer is made from natural gas, pesticides from oil.) America's corn crop might look like a sustainable, solar-powered system for producing food, but it is actually a huge, inefficient, polluting machine that guzzles fossil fuel -- a half a gallon of it for every bushel. 
So it seems corn has indeed become king. We have given it more of our land than any other plant, an area more than twice the size of New York State. To keep it well fed and safe from predators we douse it with chemicals that poison our water and deepen our dependence on foreign oil. And then in order to dispose of all the corn this cracked system has produced, we eat it as fast as we can in as many ways as we can -- turning the fat of the land into, well, fat. One has to wonder whether corn hasn't at last succeeded in domesticating us.

HEADLINE: TRACES OF TERROR: LEGAL STRATEGY; 
Rebuff for Shoe-Bomb Defendant

BYLINE:  By The New York Times 

DATELINE: BOSTON, July 18 

 BODY:
A federal judge denied a motion today to throw out statements made to investigators by Richard C. Reid, the man accused of trying to blow up a Paris-to-Miami flight with bombs hidden in his sneakers.
 Lawyers for Mr. 
Reid, 28, a British citizen, argued that he had invoked his right to remain silent after his arrest on Dec. 22. But Chief Judge William G. Young of Federal District Court found that Mr. Reid had been read his rights several times and still agreed to talk to investigators. 
 According to a memorandum prosecutors filed in court in May, Mr. Reid told law enforcement agents after his arrest that "he decided to choose an American target after the United States began bombing the Taliban in Afghanistan."
The memorandum said Mr. Reid "claimed to have chosen to attack an airplane because he believed an airplane attack, especially during the holiday season, would cause the American public to lose confidence in airline security and stop traveling, leading to a substantial loss of revenue which would, in turn, hurt the American economy."
Prosecutors say Mr. Reid, while aboard American Airlines Flight 63, tried to light a fuse sticking out of the tongue of one of his black high-top sneakers. Flight attendants and passengers overpowered Mr. Reid, and the flight was diverted to Boston. 
Mr. Reid has pleaded not guilty to attempted murder and attempted use of a weapon of mass destruction. His trial is scheduled for November.

HEADLINE: Albany No Longer a Secret In High-Tech Chip World 

BYLINE:  By RICHARD PEREZ-PENA

DATELINE: ALBANY, July 18 

 BODY:
It sounded forced when, a few years ago, local officials took to calling the verdant Hudson River basin Tech Valley. More people scoffed at the nickname, and the strained boosterism it represented, than used it.
 No one was scoffing today, when a consortium of the world's biggest computer chip makers announced that they would plant their new, $400 million research and development center here, at the State University of New York. The consortium, International Sematech, and state officials predicted that the project would have something of the same effect here as its precursor did in Austin, Tex., drawing a range of computer-related businesses to the area. 
 To much of the rest of the world, the choice of New York, and particularly this somewhat sleepy city, came as a surprise. As Gov. George E. Pataki said, "There are a lot of places where jaws have been dropped."
Linley Gwennap, principal analyst at the Linley Group, which studies technology markets, said: "Albany certainly wouldn't have been on my list of places to go. I'm just not that familiar with what's going on there."
Albany reached the top of Sematech's list through years of commitment by New York State leaders to the highest-level chip research -- work that drew little attention outside that field -- and an aggressive selling job over the last 10 months by Governor Pataki and a handful of others.
It began last Sept. 10, when the Semiconductor Industry Association, which includes the Sematech consortium members, met at the Sagamore, a grand 19th-century resort on an island in Lake George. Mr. Pataki addressed the group and met the consortium leaders for the first time.
"I've seen the Silicon Valley," the governor said he told the chip executives. "It's hot, it's dry, it's very expensive, they have earthquakes, the lights go out. Come look at Albany."
At that point, the Sematech members had just begun talking about a new research center, more advanced than the one in Austin, to develop new methods of making faster, smaller, more capable chips. When officials here learned of that plan, Mr. Pataki and a few of his aides; Karen R. Hitchcock, president of SUNY Albany; and Alain E. Kaloyeros, dean of the university's School of Nanosciences, began lobbying hard to have the industry put that center here.
Today, industry officials said they were impressed by the involvement of Mr. Pataki and Dr. Kaloyeros in the months spent romancing the consortium. Juri Matisoo, a vice president of the Semiconductor Industry Association, referred to the governor's "clear vision and remarkable determination."
To outsiders, the most surprising element of the process may have been its secrecy, in contrast to the public competition among states that the consortium held in 1987. Until the news broke today, few people outside the consortium, SUNY or the governor's office knew Sematech was even considering sites for the new center, and no serious talks were held with other states. 
When asked about that secrecy, C. Robert Helms, president of Sematech, said, "It was clear who the winner was going to be in the first place."
That was, in part, because I.B.M., perhaps the most influential member of the consortium, is a New York company, based in Westchester County, and liked the idea of having the research center nearby. Mr. Helms said, "I wouldn't minimize the support we've received from I.B.M., just to help us understand what is here, what the advantages are to this region."
Industry executives said that in the end, it came down to Albany versus some foreign contenders, particularly a proposal from Belgium. They said the federal government, particularly the Department of Defense, voiced some concerns about putting such valuable technology overseas. Mr. Helms confirmed that, but insisted it did not influence the final decision.
Sematech officials said they saw a value in choosing an area that was not already a high-tech hub or a crowded metropolitan area. They liked the region's cluster of colleges and universities, and the fact that the cost of living and doing business is lower here than in established high-tech capitals.
But chip makers said the most important factor was the caliber of work already being done at SUNY Albany, and the enthusiastic backing it had had from the governor and the Legislature. The university created a center for advanced chip research in the mid-1990's, the state invested more than $100 million in it, and I.B.M. pledged $100 million more.
That center will essentially play host to the new Sematech plant, which will be housed in two adjoining buildings on university-owned land. The state will contribute $210 million to the project and the chip makers will put in $193 million.
In June, Mr. Helms led a delegation from the major chip makers on a tour of the Albany campus. "There were a lot of skeptics, but not by the end," he said.
And then, too, there was that talk of "Tech Valley," and the grain of truth behind it. I.B.M. is nearing completion of a $2.5 billion microchip plant in Dutchess County. General Electric recently decided to build a $100 million research center outside Schenectady. Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute's industrial park in nearby Troy has drawn a number of computer-related businesses.
"I've gone to economics conferences around the country where people talk about the high-tech economy, and people there know that it's an up-and-coming area," said Dr. Ann E. Davis, director of the Bureau of Economic Research at Marist College in Poughkeepsie. "But the public hasn't really known. Not yet."

HEADLINE: Daimler Profit Up 52%; Restrained Optimism for Rest of Year 

BYLINE:  By MICHELINE MAYNARD 

DATELINE: DETROIT, July 18 

 BODY:
DaimlerChrysler reported today that its second-quarter profit jumped 52 percent, buoyed by cost-cutting at Chrysler that is running ahead of the company's turnaround plan. 
 Thanks to improved results, Jurgen Schrempp, the chief executive, said Daimler expected its 2002 results to be at least triple the $1.3 billion profit it forecast at the start of the year. 
 But Mr. Schrempp said analysts should not expect Daimler simply to repeat its performance in the first half -- in which it had $3.7 billion in net income, in contrast to a $1.6 billion loss in the period a year earlier -- warning that the industry outlook is uncertain for the rest of the year. 
"The signal that we are receiving from our main markets do show a rather growing uncertainty as far as political and economic developments are concerned," he said, noting that the current period, the third quarter, is usually the weakest of the year for the industry.
For the second quarter, DaimlerChrysler, based in Stuttgart, Germany, posted net income of $1.1 billion, or $1.08 a share, compared with $720 million, or 72 cents a share, in the quarter a year earlier. Revenue declined 5 percent, to $40.8 billion.
Mr. Schrempp declared himself "obviously very pleased" with progress made by the Chrysler unit, its largest operation based in Auburn Hills, Mich., which had an operating profit of $408 million, in contrast to a $179 million operating loss in the period a year earlier.
Mr. Schrempp attributed the gain largely to job reductions, cost savings on auto parts and manufacturing efficiencies, as well as to slightly stronger sales. Chrysler's share of the United States market has stabilized this year at 15 percent, and sales rose in the second quarter for minivans and the PT Cruiser.
Under a turnaround plan announced in January 2001, Chrysler pledged to cut costs by $8 billion through 2003. Last year, it saved $3.3 billion, $200 million more than its initial goal. This year, its savings goal is $2.6 billion. Company officials declined to say how much Chrysler has saved thus far in 2002 -- only that it is ahead of schedule.
DaimlerChrysler's chief financial officer, Manfred Gentz, acknowledged, however, that Chrysler's pension plan, which was fully financed at the beginning of the year, is now underfinanced by $3.5 billion to $4 billion, and that the gap could grow if investment markets continue to decline. If it remains underfinanced, the company will have to decide whether to inject cash or shift equity.
Mr. Gentz said the action would not affect the company's bottom line. "We remain comfortable with our pension status," he said. Concerns about General Motors' pension fund have hurt its stock price and overshadowed its earnings improvement this year.
Elsewhere, Mr. Schrempp said Mitsubishi Motors, in which Daimler holds a 37.3 percent stake, was also ahead of schedule on cost cuts, even though its sales had fallen in Japan this year. In March, a Daimler executive, Rolf Eckrodt, took charge at Mitsubishi, which has been stymied by debt and quality issues. 
Daimler's most profitable unit in the second quarter was its Mercedes-Benz and Smart car division, whose earnings rose 3 percent, to $833 million, although vehicle sales were flat. But Mr. Schrempp said he expected sales gains from a new version of the E-class sedan, which is to reach the United States this fall. It is already selling well in Europe.
Another car that may be headed for the United States is the smallest Mercedes auto, the A-class. Mr. Schrempp said Daimler was studying "whether it wouldn't make sense" to ship the A-class to America once a new version is ready in 2004. A decision will be made in the next 12 months, he added.
"There is some risk there," said Michael Luckey, president of the Luckey Consulting Group in Kinnelon, N.J. "But as long as the car is a good car, and the quality is good, and as long as it is viewed as premium, that's the key." Once the price gets down too low, he said, "it's a real stretch to call them luxury vehicles."
Mr. Schrempp indicated that the A-class cars would cost less in the United States than the least-expensive Mercedes, the CLK, which starts at around $25,000. The A-class had a rocky start in 1997, tipping over when Swedish journalists ran it through the "elk test," a course designed to see how cars maneuvered around unexpected obstacles, like an elk in the road. Daimler briefly took it off the market to install stability controls, and it has since sold well.

Microsoft Results Beat Expectations

BYLINE:  By JOHN MARKOFF 

DATELINE: SAN FRANCISCO, July 18 

 BODY:
Buoyed by strong revenue across a range of its businesses, Microsoft reported fourth-quarter financial results today that slightly exceeded analysts' expectations.
 The company said that despite shrinking personal and corporate computing markets, it had continued to find strength in the sales of the new XP version of its Windows operating system, growth of its Office desktop software business and improved performance of a number of its consumer lines, including its MSN online service. 
 "We're finally really seeing the fruits of the long-term R.& D. investments Microsoft has been making in its Windows operating system," said John G. Connors, the chief financial officer. He also said that the company had paid greater attention than in the past to controlling its expenses. 
The largest disappointment for the company was sales of the Xbox gaming system, which the company said had sold 3.9 million units by the end of the quarter. Microsoft had originally projected sales as high as 6.5 million for the year, but the system has so far done poorly, particularly in Europe and Japan.
Shares fell as low as $50.07 after the report. They lost 89 cents, to close at $51.11 in regular trading.
Although the company continued to see no reason for optimism during the second half of 2002, Mr. Connors said that he still believed that "mid-single-digit" growth would be possible during the second half of its fiscal year.
The company called the past year "challenging" and Mr. Connors acknowledged that Microsoft, based in Redmond, Wash., had outperformed the computing world by growing while the rest of the industry shrank.
This evening the International Data Corporation released sales data for the personal computer industry indicating that for the second quarter of 2002, global PC shipments shrank by half a percent, to 31.1 million machines.
Financial analysts said that the company's impressive performance in view of the widespread difficulties of many of its hardware business partners highlighted the company's remarkable business position.
"This is testimony to how strong and unique their business model is," said David Readerman, a partner and director of growth equity strategy at Thomas Weisel Partners, the San Francisco-based investment firm.
Microsoft said it earned $1.53 billion, or 28 cents a share, in its fiscal fourth quarter ending on June 30, up from $65 million, and sales climbed 10 percent, to $7.25 billion.
Excluding the charge, Microsoft earned 43 cents a share. The earnings included an after-tax charge for investment impairments in telecommunications and cable industry investments of $806 million, or 15 cents a share. Analysts had been expecting Microsoft to report earnings of 42 cents a share, on sales of $7.1 billion, according to a consensus of 24 analysts polled by Thomson First Call.
For the year the company said its revenue was $28.37 billion, an increase of 12 percent over the $25.30 billion reported last year. Net income was $7.83 billion, or $1.41 a share, an amount that included after-tax charges for investment impairments of 53 cents, estimated expenses in connection with consumer class-action lawsuits recorded in the December 2001 quarter of 8 cents, and a one-time gain on the sale of Expedia, recorded in the March 2002 quarter, of 15 cents.
Despite forecasting personal computer growth in single digits for next year, Mr. Connors said that he expected Microsoft's revenue next year to grow by 11 to 13 percent.
For the fourth quarter, desktop software revenue grew 9 percent, to $4.97 billion, driven in particular by its desktop operating system, Windows XP, which posted growth of 20 percent in revenue during the same period.
In contrast, the enterprise software business was up only 4 percent, to $1.35 billion. 
During a conference call with analysts, Mr. Connors repeatedly stressed what he referred to as the "long-term view" of the company's two leading executives, Bill Gates, the chairman, and Steven A. Ballmer, the chief executive.
But he acknowledged that if the economy failed to rebound next year, Microsoft would be unlikely to continue to defy gravity.
"If there were a further contraction it would certainly hit us as well," he said.

HEADLINE: Divided by a Call for a Common Language 

BYLINE:  By JODI WILGOREN 

DATELINE: GREEN BAY, Wis., July 18 

 BODY:
One board member called the resolution the "least significant document" to cross his desk in a decade on the Brown County Board of Supervisors. Yet Nancy Nusbaum, the county executive, said it would most likely prompt her first veto in 15 years.
 The resolution, making English the official language of county government here, has no practical impact -- the county translates documents and provides interpreters only when required by federal law. But the symbolic effects have already torn through this fast-changing city in weeks of angry debate. 
 "Either you just don't get it, or you just don't care," Kevin Kuehn, a supervisor who opposed the resolution, told his colleagues before the bitterly divided board voted 17 to 8 on Wednesday night in favor of the resolution. "Is it that you don't understand? Is it that you have fear? Or is it a racist act? Because I don't understand what else it can be."
In passing the resolution, which also calls on the state and federal governments to pay for English classes for immigrants, Brown County joins at least 11 other Wisconsin counties, and 27 states, that have adopted English as their official language. Though the movement has gained strength in recent years as part of a backlash against growing numbers of immigrants, it has taken on particular force since Sept. 11, fueled by patriotic fervor and fears about an uncertain economy.
"English has been the most important unifier of our country for the last 200 years -- it's a symbol of being American, right up there with the flag, 'The Star Spangled Banner,' the Pledge of Allegiance," said Valerie Rheinstein, a spokeswoman for U.S. English, a Washington group that advocates such resolutions. 
"You're free to come here and you're free to make a life for yourself, but you're also free to leave," Ms. Rheinstein added. "You're coming here to be an American. Being an American means you're going to have to speak English."
Here in Green Bay, the battle over the English resolution has exposed the discomfort that quietly accompanied the shift from a largely homogenous town united in devotion to the Packers football team to a city where Hmong farmers pick cilantro and onions in community gardens and Mexican flags flap from cars on the Cinco de Mayo holiday. 
According to the 2000 census, 7 percent of Green Bay's 102,313 residents, and 4 percent of Brown County's 226,778, are foreign born, up from 2 percent of the city and 1 percent of the county in 1990. Two decades ago, Green Bay was 97 percent white; now it is 85 percent. The county is home to 5,000 Asians and 9,000 Hispanics.
Amid the apartment buildings along Imperial Lane, near the Packerland meat processing plant where some 70 percent of the workers are immigrants, a barrio has sprouted, with signs marking tenant parking in English and in Spanish. In the basement of the First Presbyterian Church, where Hmong girls learn traditional dances for New Year's, twin yellow posters in two languages announce free immunizations.
When Isaias Alvarez opened La Guadalupana, a Mexican grocery, three years ago, he had to drive to Chicago weekly to stock his shelves with flax seed, epazote and chile morita. Now, with about 10 bodegas in town, delivery trucks arrive every Thursday with those spices, along with Spanish-labeled products like Nestle's La Lechera, a form of sweetened condensed milk, and Knorr's Caldo de Tomate, tomato bouillon. 
Karl Txajkaug Thoj, director of the Hmong Association of Green Bay, sees the resolution as an unwelcome mat that says to his community, "You're not important, forget about your culture, forget about being different." After Mr. Thoj protested the measure at a public hearing, he received an anonymous letter. "Yes, you people are not welcome in Green Bay," it said. "Green Bay was nice until you freeloaders came. You multiplied like animals and want everything for nothing."
Noting that the 26 members of the county board are all white, a columnist in The Green Bay Press-Gazette likened the resolution to apartheid. Green Bay's mayor and the Chamber of Commerce have joined nuns and rabbis in opposing it.
In a series of contentious public hearings over the past two months, residents favoring the resolution expressed concern that the county would have to spend money translating documents and providing interpreters as the community continued to diversify. Invoking the Americanization of their European ancestors, they said the resolution would unite the community, not divide it. 
"If I cannot exchange ideas with you, we're already divided," Mary Verheyen told the board at a June meeting. "We need one thing to unite us. Let it be we can understand each other."
But the measure's opponents make the same point. May Xiong, whose family were the first Hmong to arrive in the area in 1976, and who now owns an Asian grocery where Hmong videos and shaman's incense sticks are for sale, recalled her years as a nurse treating bleeding American soldiers in the Vietnam War.
"They do not speak any Lao," she said. "What would happen to their legs, their arms, their eyes? They need a translator."
On Wednesday night, 31-year-old Sean Ryan, who owns a fast-food restaurant, stood in a corner of the crowded hearing room holding aloft three sarcastic signs. "Mi casa NO es su casa," one read. Another attributed a quotation, "More conformity is better for all of us," to Hitler and Brown County.
After several contentious meetings over two months, the supervisors changed the title of the resolution from "Resident Responsibility Act" to "Brown County Diversity Resolution," and tried to soften its language. Proponents said it was aimed at unity.
John VanderLeest, a supervisor who voted for the resolution, said he hoped it would push people to learn English more quickly, thus enabling them to find better jobs and become citizens. Pat Collins, who sponsored the initiative, said that "the vast majority of the middle of this county" supported it and that calls from constituents had been 9 to 1 in favor.
"When we pass it, the sun's going to rise in the morning, people will get on with their lives," Mr. Collins said. "This county will have made a statement. That's all it is."

HEADLINE: Sun Microsystems Has Profit But Expects Losses to Return 

BYLINE:  Reuters 

DATELINE: SAN FRANCISCO, July 18 

 BODY:
Sun Microsystems Inc. reported today that it had achieved its first quarterly profit in a year. But the company forecast another loss as it fought for deals in the midst of the technology downturn.
 Sun, which is based in Santa Clara, Calif., and makes computers that manage networks, said it had missed profit-margin targets but beat Wall Street revenue expectations, in part because it had cut prices in the current tough environment. 
 "People think we're getting squeezed, yet we're gaining share," Scott G. McNealy, the chief executive of Sun, told investors in a conference call.
Sun shares dropped in after-hours trading to $4.90 on Instinet from a close of $5.80 on the Nasdaq, where they had gained 2.11 percent during the day.
Sun reported a profit of $20 million, or 1 cent a share, in contrast to a loss of $88 million, or 3 cents a share, in the fiscal fourth quarter a year ago, when the company posted its first loss in a decade.
Sun earned $28 million, or 1 cent a share, excluding an $18 million loss on equity investments, a $4 million credit for adjustments to restructuring charges, and a $6 million benefit for related tax effects.
Revenue was $3.4 billion, compared with $4 billion in the quarter a year ago.
Analysts polled by Multex had expected on average a profit of 1 cent a share on revenue of $3.3 billion, with a range of forecasts from a 1-cent loss to a 2-cent profit.
Sun has cut jobs and trimmed costs to lower its break-even point, but its gross profit margin fell from the previous quarter to 41.1 percent of sales in the fourth quarter, while the company had forecast a slight improvement on the previous quarter's 42.1 percent.
Sun's chief financial officer, Steve McGowan, said he expected a slight loss in the fiscal first quarter and a decline in revenue of 10 percent to 15 percent from the fourth, although he saw revenues rising 10 to 15 percent for the full year and earnings of 10 to 15 cents a share.
"The revenues look great, but margins are a lot worse than I would have guessed as well," said Daniel T. Niles, a Lehman Brothers analyst. "Guidance was disappointing."
Mr. McGowan, responding to analysts, said Sun had not cut prices at the end of the quarter to make up for a revenue shortfall.
"Our intention is to take market share," he said. He added, "The state of the economy is still unchanged and uncertain."
Shares of Sun have fallen more than 50 percent this year, compared with a nearly 30 percent fall for the American Stock Exchange computer hardware index. 
The company also announced that another senior executive -- Masood Jabbar, head of global sales operations -- was stepping down, after retirements by a number of his colleagues. Sun said Mr. Jabbar would be succeeded by the Europe, Middle East and Africa sales chief, Robert Youngjohns.

HEADLINE: SPORTS BUSINESS; 
Alarm Bells Louder Than Even Selig's

BYLINE:  By Richard Sandomir 

 BODY:
If only Major League Baseball could blame its financial woes on illegally inflating losses from the sale of corked bats, disguising billions of dollars in profits as clubhouse catering costs or burying revenues in off-balance-sheet limited partnerships called "Mo Vaughn's Diet" and "Goes Well to His Right."
 If those things were true, there would be indictments, Senate hearings and the deployment of Strat-O-Matic to bring Gerald Ford-like calm to the troubled industry. 
 But if there are no baseball Enrons and no illegal shredding of Yankees yearbooks by a rogue official scorer, the fault is a flawed economic model that is worse off than Commissioner Bud Selig is saying, said Sal Galatioto, managing director of the sports advisory and finance group at Lehman Brothers.
"I think he's understating the crisis," Galatioto said, referring to reports that two teams, Detroit and Tampa Bay, recently avoided missing paying their players. "He's in a tough spot. If he says that too many teams are in trouble, it hurts the teams' abilities to get financing." 
Galatioto is one of the leading investment bankers in sports; his group, first at SG Cowen and now at Lehman, has provided financing for some of the largest team and stadium deals of the past few years. 
He is an unabashed sports fan who happens to be a confidant of owners like Jerry Colangelo of the Arizona Diamondbacks and Daniel Snyder of the Washington Redskins. One of his cherished possessions, a Redskins helmet signed by the team, was lost when his former office at the World Financial Center was damaged during the Sept. 11 terror attacks.
He consorts more with owners than with players, but he sounds like someone sounding an alarm to warn anyone who wants to buy any team except for the wealthiest ones.
"I have no upside in saying the sky is falling," he said Wednesday.
When potential buyers approach Galatioto about buying a baseball team, he said he asks, "How much can you afford to lose?" He continued, "And I tell them if you can break even and take advantage of the tax-shelter aspect, you should be happy, because as a straight investment, you won't get a cash-on-cash return."
His view of baseball is bleak: teams with too much debt; a diminished capacity to borrow from banks that are uncertain about the future baseball economy; owners who are less wealthy and liquid than in the past; and possible bankruptcies and chaotic contraction.
"Two years ago, I said baseball had overexpanded and should contract, and they were very unhappy with me about that," he said. But in Congressional testimony last year, when Selig trumpeted a two-team contraction, "he referred to me as an interested outside observer."
"I went from being an idiot to an interested observer," he said.
He added: "I don't know why you need 30 teams. You can have a viable 24-team league and placate the players association by adding two roster spots." But he is realistic: a two-team contraction is more likely.
Listen to Galatioto and this is what you hear: The union will care about the financial crisis he is outlining only when teams file for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection or liquidate through Chapter 7 proceedings.
He sees a strike, and its aftermath, hurting teams at the gate and causing economic distress, especially to teams that have borrowed heavily for stadiums or for working capital. He sees those franchises, some of them in good baseball markets that deserve teams, folding under the weight of debt and lower revenues.
"If revenues decline because attendance is down or the media contract is down, no amount of revenue-sharing can fix it," he said.
In his scenario, there could be forced contraction, not one like Selig's unfulfilled plan to lop off Minnesota and Montreal. Major League Baseball now runs the Expos; Galatioto figures it can't prop up too many other sagging teams.
Galatioto said that in a bankruptcy, an owner can affirm or reject player contracts. If a contract is affirmed, the player is paid as an employee.
"But if you reject a contract, and the player has $50 million coming over 10 years, he'll get what he can get after the secured creditors are paid off," he said. 
In bankruptcy proceedings, banks and other secured creditors would be paid first, with players falling into the ranks of unsecured creditors, a less important category.
"If the players win, they lose," Galatioto said, "because some teams can't function under this economic model."
Galatioto doubts that a strike or a lockout will solve anything, and offers this prescription:
*Contract at least two teams.
*Increase revenue-sharing, but not to such a level that the redistribution hurts the value of the richest clubs. "If you dilute the value of the Yankees, Dodgers and Red Sox, you won't get any improvements by helping Milwaukee," he said. 
*Forget the salary cap and hope that a draft of contraction-freed players would stabilize salaries; that assumes, perhaps with too much hope, that the supply of better players would exceed the demand from two, four or six fewer teams.
*Set a minimum payroll that would force needier teams to spend most of the cash they get from revenue-sharing, rather than pocket it.
"It's not that complicated," he said. "I'm not the sharpest tool in the shed. If I were, I'd be doing exotic derivatives. All I can say is it's a basis for negotiations."

HEADLINE: Greeks Claim Victory Over Terrorist Group But Questions About Suspects' Ties Remain 

BYLINE:  By ANTHEE CARASSAVA 

DATELINE: ATHENS, July 18 

 BODY:
After decades of elusiveness, the guerrilla group November 17 has suddenly cracked.
 On Wednesday, five government agents surrounded a Paris-born intellectual on a remote island in the Aegean. Today the police identified the man, Alexandros Yiotopoulos, 58, as one of a handful of leaders of November 17, a small but persistent group that has killed at least 23 people in Athens in a sporadic anti-American, anti-imperialist campaign over nearly three decades. 
 Three other suspects, already in custody, were charged today with offenses that included first-degree murder, bomb attacks and bank robberies. The police say they have confessed and have described the crimes. 
"This has been a very good effort by Greek authorities," said the State Department spokesman, Richard A. Boucher. "We commend them." The group's latest victim was the British defense attache here, Brig. Stephen Saunders, who was shot and killed two summers ago. A spokesman for the British Embassy said today, "We are encouraged by the progress made." 
The breakthrough comes as Greece prepares to be the host of the 2004 Summer Olympics, an honor it nearly lost because November 17 members remained at large. The government had made no progress for years in its investigation, despite pressure from the United States, which even provided a list of suspects.
Greece's government is dominated by a Socialist party, Pasok, and some American experts contend that both the party and November 17 arose out of the same opposition to the military junta that ruled Greece from 1967 to 1974. The government has scoffed at that idea, but a string of retired American officials, including Thomas Niles, a former ambassador to Athens, have seen links between Greece's political elite and November 17. 
The group, which took its name from a bloody 1973 student uprising that helped bring down the junta, was understood to be small. Its top level consisted of perhaps three people, the police have said, and its small troop of foot soldiers numbered perhaps 10. At least seven people connected to the group are now in custody.
Starting in 1975, with the assassination of the Central Intelligence Agency's station chief in Athens, Richard Welch, the group managed to identify and kill American intelligence officers, Turkish diplomats, a British military officer and several Greek businessmen, offering justifications for those and other attacks in long, sometimes hardly intelligible proclamations. 
In one of its more recent tracts, found in a garbage bin shortly after after the June 2000 killing of Brigadier Saunders, the British officer, the group railed against NATO's bombing campaign to stop the Serbian assaults on Kosovo. "Even the greatest criminals of the 20th century, the Nazis, look like romantic humanists, compared to 78 days of bombing NATO and American force waged against a Yugoslavia without an air force," that tract read. 
The group often used one of two .45-caliber guns, both American-made, for its assassinations. 
After the military government fell, left-wing and anti-American sentiment was strong across the country. Yet some Greek officials have speculated that the organization's beginnings could lie within the country's secret service or police apparatus, a situation that would make its leftist statements a cover for an ultranationalist ideology. 
In a report two years ago, L. Paul Bremmer, a former diplomat appointed to lead a Congressional inquiry into world terrorism, suggested that the State Department impose sanctions against Greece for its failure to crush November 17. For many years the State Department has listed the group as a wanted terrorist organization. 
Many in Washington disagreed with the Bremmer recommendation, but he warned at the time, "The Greeks are but a bullet away from losing the Games, especially if it's aimed at another American."
Capt. William Nordeen of the Navy, the American Embassy's military attache, was killed in a car bombing in 1988. His widow, Patricia Nordeen, said that she was stunned by the news of Mr. Yiotopoulos's arrest and that she was preparing to fly to Athens. 
"It's almost beyond belief that after so many years, progress has finally been made," she said, by telephone from her home in Rhode Island. "I'm numb."
Greek news reports described Mr. Yiotopoulos as a former professor of mathematics. The police commissioner, Fotis Nassiakos, said Mr. Yiotopoulos was suspected of being "the ideological instructor of the group and the writer of its proclamations."
The group's hatred of the United States arose from American backing of the junta. During its rule, from 1967 to 1974, hundreds of leftists fled to France. Paris proved the breeding ground of the Greek resistance movement that helped topple the junta, in 1974. 
"Among the then-youth leaders, a Trotskyite by belief, was Yiotopoulos," said a source close to the police investigation. Lofty, lanky and code-named Lambros by his comrades, he ended up back in Greece operating under the alias Michalis Economou. He is believed to have written at least some of the proclamations the group issued. His wife, a French national, was being pursued by the police. 
The group began unraveling on June 29, when a 40-year-old icon painter, Savas Xiros, was injured in a botched bomb attack at the country's largest port, Piraeus, and was held by the police. He apparently began cooperating with them, and within a week, they had stormed two Athens apartment buildings used by the group and found a Smith & Wesson handgun that November 17 used in many of its attacks. 
They also found Mr. Yiotopoulos's fingerprints. 
Mr. Xiros remains in the hospital, where he was visited by two of his brothers. All three have now been arrested. They are the sons of a Greek Orthodox priest, and the police describe them as executioners for November 17. 
The three have confessed to "involvement or active participation" in a string of attacks claimed by November 17, Mr. Nassiakos, the police commissioner, said today. 
When armed agents today raided Mr. Yiotopoulos's flat on the high hills of the Athens suburb of Vyrona they found a typewriter, a computer and a box of financial records linked to his operations with November 17, a senior police official said.

HEADLINE: Fare Drama Alters Cast, But the Plot Is Familiar 

BYLINE:  By RANDY KENNEDY 

 BODY:
The mayor of New York City, desperately looking for ways to repair his broken budget, decides to give less help to subways and buses. Transit advocates fear a fare increase as a result. Both the mayor and the governor -- the man who ultimately decides whether to raise fares and knows the political risks -- decry the very idea of an increase.
 And what happens in the end? An increase, the largest in the transit system's history, plus the most extensive service cuts in a decade. 
 This was the situation in 1994 and 1995, the last time transit fares were raised, to $1.50 from $1.25. The mayor has changed since then. But the governor, George E. Pataki, is the same, and in many ways so is the stylized public dance that has begun this month, with Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg suggesting, as he did again yesterday, that he might try to save money by cutting the annual subsidy for mass transit. 
This time around, however, there are significant differences that many people say could mean not only that a fare increase is inevitable, but that it will inevitably be even steeper than the last one.
In 1994, for example, when Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani announced that he planned to cut $100 million from the city's subsidy to mass transit, New York City Transit, the agency that runs subways and city buses, was running a rosy surplus, mostly the result of greater-than-expected increases in ridership.
Today, the transit agency's finances could hardly present a more stark contrast: the parent Metropolitan Transportation Authority, which also operates commuter trains and bridges and tunnels, has projected a deficit of more than $600 million for the next fiscal year.
Pieces of an array of taxes that go to support the operating budgets of the subways and buses have, along with the economy, grown smaller -- from January to May of this year, the taxes contributed $58 million to mass transit, compared with $115 million in the same period in 2001.
In addition, labor costs are certain to rise as contracts expire this year. And debt service -- paying the interest on billions in bonds that are used to buy new trains and to refurbish stations -- is growing rapidly, expected to eat up as much as 13 percent of the transit operating budget within two years.
Even taking into consideration that transit deficit projections are notoriously slippery -- as much about politics and strategy as about accounting -- the picture is not a healthy one.
The possibility that the city, and perhaps the state, might reduce aid to mass transit to help solve their budget problems has caused many transit advocates and city officials this week to start talking about the specter of an unusually large rise in the fare, perhaps to as much as $2, which could become reality in short order after the elections in November.
Such an increase, they argue, would essentially make transit riders, among them the poorest city residents, disproportionately responsible for footing the bill for many other things that the city must find money for. 
It also, they say, puts Mr. Bloomberg into a highly contradictory position: he campaigned on the importance of mass transit, has so far honored his pledge to take mass transit to work every day (usually the jampacked Lexington Avenue line) and has shown a willingness to try to push drivers out of their cars and into subways and buses.
But unlike Mr. Giuliani -- who at least publicly opposed a rise in the fare and denied that his reduction in subsidies had anything to do with it -- Mr. Bloomberg's message seems to be: An increase is inevitable, I won't pretend to stand in its way, and since an increase is coming, why not make it big enough to relieve the city of some of its burden in paying for subways and buses?
"I think this is unique in the annals of New York City politics," said Gene Russianoff, a staff lawyer with the Straphangers Campaign, who opposes a rise in the fare and complains that Mr. Bloomberg's unusual stance makes it much more likely by relieving some political pressure on Mr. Pataki. (Mr. Pataki, when asked yesterday about the possibility of an increase after the election, said, "I certainly hope not.")
Beverly Dolinsky, executive director of the M.T.A.'s Permanent Citizens Advisory Committee, said that while Mr. Bloomberg wants to be seen as a cheerleader for mass transit, "he's one who wants someone else to pay for it."
"I think it would be unrealistic to think that there's not going to be a fare increase," Ms. Dolinsky said, "but the city doesn't have to make it worse."
Ms. Dolinsky, along with members of the city's Independent Budget Office, analysts with the state comptroller's office and others who monitor the M.T.A.'s finances, says she believes that a fare increase of some kind has been inevitable for months, and that one was prevented this year only because Mr. Pataki decided to speed state subsidies to the transit agency to prevent an increase as he campaigned for re-election.
The M.T.A. itself, while repeatedly saying that there have been no discussions about an increase, talked about the possibility of one during a conference with institutional investors in April, saying that one way to close its projected budget gap was to "increase fares and tolls." The other possibilities, transit officials said, were to scale back or eliminate "new service improvements or expansions" or "certain customer amenities," although it is unclear in both cases what exactly this would mean.
The only other way to close the gap, the agency said, would be to "secure extra intergovernmental assistance," a remedy that now seems especially remote.
But transit advocates contend that it has been next to impossible over the last year to determine exactly how much financial trouble the agency is in, because it has not released detailed budget numbers.
The M.T.A. contends that it did not do so last year and will not this year "due to the extraordinary circumstances relating to the terrorist attack" on the World Trade Center. But some advocates maintain that the lack of hard numbers is purely a political strategy, a way for the agency to improve its bargaining position in upcoming labor negotiations and to justify a fare increase.
"We are talking about a fare hike in a vacuum, essentially," Mr. Russianoff complained.
As a result, he and other advocates say, there has been almost no informed debate on the possibility of an increase and what could be done to avoid it.
Preston Niblack, a deputy director of the Independent Budget Office, said he believed there were still ways to avoid an increase or to make it smaller, such as devoting larger portions of some taxes to mass transit and making an effort to reinstate the commuter tax, which the State Legislature abolished two years ago and which would now be worth about $500 million a year to the city. But those solutions also seem unlikely in an election year.
And so, as November approaches, the perennial ritual that always seems to precede a fare increase continues.
Asked yesterday about the possibility of an increase, Mr. Bloomberg said that he had no choice but to balance the city's budget, and so some things had to give.
"All I can tell you at this point is there's clearly a problem, and the law does not allow you to sweep a problem under the rug and hope it goes away," he said. "It's not going to go away."

CORRECTION-DATE: July 20, 2002

 CORRECTION:
A news analysis article yesterday about budget pressures that could lead to fare increases at the Metropolitan Transportation Authority misstated the view of analysts at the state comptroller's office. While they say a fare increase might be needed, they have not said an increase is inevitable.

HEADLINE: Still Poor, Latin Americans Protest Push for Open Markets 

BYLINE:  By JUAN FORERO

DATELINE: AREQUIPA, Peru, July 13 

 BODY:
The protest that shook this colonial city last month was very much like others in Latin America recently. There were Marxists shouting 60's-era slogans, and hard-bitten unionists. But there was also Fanny Puntaca, 64, a shopkeeper and grandmother of six.
 Though she had never before protested, Ms. Puntaca said, she could not bear to see a Belgian company buy what she called "our wealth" -- the region's two state-owned electrical generators. So armed with a metal pot to bang, she joined neighbors in a demonstration so unyielding that it forced President Alejandro Toledo to declare a state of emergency here, suspend the $167 million sale and eventually shake up his cabinet. 
 "I had to fight," Ms. Puntaca said proudly. "The government was going to sell our companies and enrich another country. This was my voice, my protest." 
Across Latin America, millions of others are also letting their voices be heard. A popular and political ground swell is building from the Andes to Argentina against the decade-old experiment with free-market capitalism. The reforms that have shrunk the state and opened markets to foreign competition, many believe, have enriched corrupt officials and faceless multinationals, and failed to better their lives.
Sometimes-violent protests in recent weeks have derailed the sale of state-owned companies worth hundreds of millions of dollars. The unrest has made potential investors jittery, and whipsawed governments already weakened by recession.
The backlash has given rise to leftist politicians who have combined pocketbook issues and economic nationalism to explosive effect. Today the market reforms ushered in by American-trained economists after the global collapse of Communism are facing their greatest challenge in the upheavals sweeping the region.
"The most worrying reading is that perhaps we have come to the end of an era," said Rafael de la Fuente, chief Latin American economist for BNP Paribas in New York. "That we are closing the door on what was an unsuccessful attempt at orthodox economic reforms at the end of the 90's."
For a time the policies worked, and many economists and politicians say they still do. The reforms increased competition and fueled growth. Stratospheric inflation rates fell back to earth. Bloated bureaucracies were replaced with efficient companies that created jobs.
The formula helped give Chile the most robust economy in Latin America. In Mexico exports quintupled in a dozen years. In Bolivia, poverty fell from 86 percent of the population in the 70's to 58.6 percent today.
Still, the broad prosperity that was promised remains a dream for many Latin Americans. Today those same reforms are equated with unemployment and layoffs from both public and private companies, as well as recessions that have hamstrung economies.
"We privatized and we do not have less poverty, less unemployment," said Juan Manuel Guillen, the mayor of Arequipa and a leader in the antiprivatization movement here. "On the contrary. We have more poverty and unemployment. We are not debating theoretically here. We are looking at reality."
Indeed, 44 percent of Latin Americans still live in poverty, and the number of unemployed workers has more than doubled in a decade. Tens of millions of others -- in some countries up to 70 percent of all workers -- toil in the region's vast informal economy, as street vendors, for instance, barely making ends meet. Economic growth has been essentially flat for the last five years. 
Popular perceptions -- revealed in street protests, opinion polls and ballot boxes -- are clearly shifting against the economic prescriptions for open markets, less government and tighter budgets that American officials and international financial institutions have preferred.
A regional survey supported by the Inter-American Development Bank found last year that 63 percent of respondents across 17 countries in the region said that privatization had not been beneficial.
"It's an emotional populist attitude people have," said Larry Birns, director of the Council on Hemispheric Affairs, a Washington-based policy analysis group. "It may not be reasoned, but it's real, and it's explosive and it's not going to be easily contained by coming up with arguments that free trade is the wave of the future."
In Brazil, South America's largest country and its economic engine, revulsion with American-led market orthodoxy has fueled strong support for the labor leader Luiz Inacio da Silva, known as Lula, who is now the front-runner in the October presidential election, to the chagrin of worried financial markets.
In Paraguay protests last month blocked the $400 million sale of the state phone company by President Luis Gonzalez Macchi, whose government has been dogged by a dismal economy and corruption charges. This week deadly demonstrations led the president to declare a state of emergency. 
In Bolivia the country's political landscape was redrawn this month when Evo Morales, an indigenous leader who promised to nationalize industries, finished second among 11 candidates for president.
This spring, the sale of 17 electricity distributors in Ecuador fell through in the face of political resistance, a blow to a country that has adopted the dollar as its currency and is heavily dependent on foreign investment. 
Meanwhile, in Venezuela, President Hugo Chavez's left-leaning government has been intent on scaling back reforms, exacerbating the divisions that led to his brief ouster in April.
The backlash in many of these countries gathered momentum with the economic meltdown in Argentina, which forced a change of presidents after widespread rioting in December.
While the causes are multifold, many Argentines blame the debacle on a combination of corrupt politicians and the government's adherence to economic prescriptions from abroad that have left the country with $141 billion in public debt, the banking system in ruins and one in five people unemployed.
Argentines now look for possible salvation from Elisa Carrio, a corruption fighter in Congress who has been scathing in her criticism of the International Monetary Fund. She is now the early favorite in the upcoming presidential election.
"This has created the backlash because now there's a debate all around Latin America," said Pedro Pablo Kuczynski, Peru's former economy minister and a favorite of Wall Street who resigned under pressure last week. "Everywhere you look, people say, 'The guys followed the model and they're in the soup. So obviously the model does not work.' "
The backlash comes as foreign direct investment in Latin America has fallen steeply, dropping from $105 billion in 1999 to $80 billion in 2001. A big reason for the decline is that many big-ticket sales of state companies to private investors have already been completed. But economists like Mr. Kuczynski, who say market reforms must continue for capital-poor Latin economies to progress, are worried.
Bolivia, for instance, was an early convert along with Chile in the 1990's to what is called the neoliberal model. It reined in loose monetary policies and shrank the government by unloading dozens of state-owned companies to private international investors. The results, particularly in taming inflation and reducing poverty, were impressive.
But in one of Latin America's poorest nations, it is hard for Bolivian officials to talk about progress to the wide portion of the population that continues to live in grinding poverty and feels that entitlements the government once provided in the form of subsidized rates for water and electricity have been stripped away.
The better services that have accompanied the sale of state enterprises have left many indifferent, particularly in impoverished areas where residents had invested their own money and sweat to string up electrical lines or put in water pipes and drainage.
"Clearly if you're poor and have no water, sewage and live in a rural area, having three long distance telephone companies when you have no phone lines doesn't make a bean of difference," Bolivia's president, Jorge Quiroga, acknowledged in an interview.
In Peru the resistance to privatization and market reforms is especially pronounced and, for its government, puzzling.
Unlike most of Latin America, the economy here has steadily grown since Mr. Toledo's election in June 2001 as the government has continued sales of assets begun during the decade-long rule of Alberto K. Fujimori.
Government officials say the program has been successful. Phone installation, which used to take years and cost $1,500 or more, now costs $50 and takes a day or two. Electrical service, once shoddy and limited, has spread across the country.
The privatization of mines, which is nearly complete, has improved efficiency and output so much that employment in that sector and related activities has increased to more than 60,000 today from 42,000 in 1993.
But government belt-tightening also led to widespread layoffs. Mr. Toledo's government has been hit hard by protests and popular discontent, much of it fueled by its inability to alleviate poverty. Many have blamed the privatizations, seeing them as a vestige of the corruption-riddled presidency of Mr. Fujimori, who is now in exile in Japan.
Here in Arequipa, where the economy was already limping, when word came that the government was about to sell the two state-owned electric companies, Egasa and Egesur, people recalled that Mr. Toledo had campaigned on a pledge never to sell the companies to private owners. 
It did not matter that the government promised Arequipa half the sale price, and that the investor, the Brussels-based Tractebel S.A., would invest tens of millions of dollars more to improve services.
The promises were not believed. Soon the workers federation, neighborhood organizations and university students organized protests, suspecting that higher electricity costs and layoffs were on the way.
"Thanks to our fight, our perseverance, the government backed down," Alejandro Pacheco, a leader in the protests here, told a roomful of supporters this week. "Now we need to do this in the rest of Peru."

HEADLINE: SHAKE-UP AT AOL: THE FORMER EXECUTIVE; 
The Fading Fortunes of AOL's 'Bob Pitchman'

BYLINE:  By AMY HARMON 

 BODY:
On his ascent to the No. 3 position in the world's largest media company, Robert W. Pittman earned the nickname "Bob Pitchman," the best marketer of his time.
 But as Mr. Pittman resigned his post at AOL Time Warner yesterday under pressure from the company's board, it appeared that he had fallen victim to his own sales pitch. Once seen as a master manager who could serve as the bridge between the old media and the new, Mr. Pittman came to personify the failures of the AOL-Time Warner merger. 
 In part, that was because he was the executive charged with selling the notion of synergy as profit, both inside and outside the company. With his trademark blend of self-confidence and statistics, Mr. Pittman insisted to Wall Street, investors and employees that the company could meet revenue projections viewed as unrealistic by many analysts. Their skepticism turned out to be justified.
Some executives of the old Time Warner saw Mr. Pittman as brash and hubristic. His credibility as the manager most responsible for building America Online into a mainstream consumer brand was undermined as the online service -- promoted as the growth engine of the merger -- instead faltered and dragged the company's share price down.
Although Mr. Pittman began his career at Warner Amex Satellite and rejoined Time Warner in the early 1990's, he was largely seen in New York as an outsider trying to impose the cowboy culture of the Internet industry on a venerable media company, even as the dot-com economy was beginning to be seen as hollow and corrupt.
Even at AOL headquarters in Dulles, Va., where Mr. Pittman was long viewed as a hero, the stock ticker perpetually open on many computer screens served as a deeply demoralizing force in the face of what some saw as his political maneuvering to gain power in the company.
But whatever Mr. Pittman's personal or diplomatic flaws, friends and colleagues said yesterday that his downfall might have been his belief in his own message.
"Bob is a true believer," said Henry Silverman, the chief executive of Cendant, who hired Mr. Pittman to save Century 21 in 1995. "I think he really believed what he was saying. It just didn't turn out to be right."
In an interview yesterday, Mr. Pittman was careful to avoid saying directly that he had been made a scapegoat. Still, he noted that his job as chief operating officer was to carry out the strategy set by Stephen M. Case, the company's chairman, and Richard D. Parsons, its chief executive.
"The promises were not my job," Mr. Pittman said. "I was the operations guy. My job was once someone made the promise to make it happen." 
Mr. Pittman's inability to make it happen came from a combination of the difficult economic climate, a weak strategy and his own weaknesses as a manager, analysts said yesterday.
The son of a Methodist minister from Mississippi, Mr. Pittman built his career in start-ups and turnarounds, where a certain religious zeal came in handy. After helping to start MTV in the 1980's, he went on to bolster the flagging business of the Six Flags theme parks, and then to revive the real estate company Century 21. In 1996, Mr. Pittman joined America Online, where he oversaw its transition from an obscure technology company to an enormous online service that everyone's mom could understand.
The dense bureaucracy and scale of AOL Time Warner was a sharp contrast to the previous organizations he served, and some analysts said it simply might not have been the kind of environment where Mr. Pittman could thrive. 
Tom Wolzien, an analyst with Sanford C. Bernstein, remembered Mr. Pittman's appearance four years ago at the company's annual conference for pension and mutual fund managers at the Plaza Hotel as a revival meeting where many were for the first time converted to the idea that an online service could be attractive to a mass market. Last month, Mr. Pittman appeared again to sell the synergy message.
"It was not the old Bob selling AOL," Mr. Wolzien said. "He was playing the corporate thing as opposed to being the preacher. It didn't fit him as well."
That may be because the synergies envisioned in the merger -- like inducing AOL's 34 million members to buy more Time Warner movies, magazines and music, or to subscribe to Time Warner Cable's broadband Internet services -- have not materialized.
Last December, Mr. Pittman said he believed that the company could increase the amount the average household spends on the AOL service from $20 a month to $150 by offering "old media" products like magazine subscriptions and other information and services through its new-media outlets. Likewise, he said it might be possible to coax $200 a month out of each home that now subscribes to its cable service for $60 a month by selling other AOL Time Warner products. Nothing like that has happened either.
In April, Mr. Pittman was sent to revive America Online, which is suffering from an advertising slump and sluggish subscriber growth. Mr. Pittman promised analysts that he could recreate the service as a growth engine of the company by selling more advertising and other services, but that also proved more difficult than he realized, and he lost his chance to be seen as a savior.
"You have to go bang some heads together, and it appears that that urgency has not permeated the organization," said Adam Klein, lead partner of the media and entertainment practice at Booz Allen Hamilton. "Inasmuch as a strategy has been articulated and not implemented, that's the piece Pittman is carrying responsibility for here."
Still, Mr. Pittman was working in a uniquely hostile environment. "People had these stock options and they were planning their futures based on them, and they blame the AOL people," said David Geffen, co-founder of DreamWorks and a friend of Mr. Pittman. "Who are the AOL people? Steve Case does not have an operations job. The only person who had an operations job is Bob Pittman and he took the fall." 
Mr. Pittman, 48, who like many AOL executives grew wealthy by selling his stock over the years, said yesterday that he planned to take at least six months off to spend time with his family before contemplating a return to the business world.
As AOL Time Warner executives try to determine what caused the gap between promises and delivery in the coming months, however, Mr. Pittman may not be able to keep quite as low a profile as he might like. "It's going to get worse for Bob before it's going to get better," one industry executive predicted.

HEADLINE: New Aid Claims by Jobless Fall 

BYLINE:  By The Associated Press 

 BODY:
The number of Americans who filed for state unemployment benefits for the first time fell sharply last week to its lowest level in 17 months, the Labor Department reported yesterday, offering some hope for a largely stagnant job market.
 A separate report yesterday showed that a crucial gauge of economic activity remained unchanged in June, a further sign of an uneven recovery. 
 "The numbers reflect the slow nature of this recovery," said Mark Vitner, an economist at Wachovia Securities. "We may see a few more discouraging numbers in the next couple of weeks, but nothing suggesting that the recovery is faltering."
The Conference Board, a private research group based in New York, reported that its index of leading economic indicators held steady last month, at 112.4, after rising by a revised 0.6 percent in May. The June figure met analysts' expectations.
Consumer expectations and falling stock prices put pressure on the index, the Conference Board said. Another weak area was manufacturers' new orders for nonmilitary capital goods.
"We continue to be in a jobless, profitless recovery," said Ken Goldstein, the group's economist.
The index measures where the economy is headed in the next three to six months. It stood at 100 in 1996, its base year. June's figures are the third instance in the last four months of the index's failing to increase.
Initial jobless claims fell by 28,000 last week, to a seasonally adjusted 379,000, the Labor Department said. The decline, which was larger than many analysts expected, came after claims shot up by 21,000 the week before. The more stable four-week moving average of new claims edged down to 391,000 last week, the lowest level since the beginning of March.

To the Editor:
 The horrors of Sept. 11 have given New York City an opportunity to offer a bold new vision of architecture and urban planning to the national and international communities. 
 To rebuild should mean to create the sort of breakthrough structures envisioned by architects like Frank Lloyd Wright, Louis Kahn, I. M. Pei and Frank Gehry. Instead, the Lower Manhattan Development Corporation has offered six variations of a mediocre office complex surrounding a lawn (front page, July 17). 
The World Trade Center was an architectural icon. Should its replacement be anything less?

HEADLINE: Senators Question Credibility of Army Secretary on Enron 

BYLINE:  By JAMES DAO 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, July 18 

 BODY:
Thomas E. White, the Army secretary and a former top executive for the Enron Corporation, told a Senate committee today that he was unaware of any efforts by Enron to manipulate energy prices in the California power crisis of 2000 and 2001.
 But in heated exchanges with Mr. White, Democrats on the panel said they doubted his credibility, and they called on the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission and the Securities and Exchange Commission to investigate his role in the energy crisis and his sale of millions of dollars in Enron stock last year. 
 "There is substantial evidence that Mr. White misled investors," said Senator Ron Wyden, Democrat of Oregon. "What especially troubles me is that I don't see any evidence to date that these actions are being timely and thoroughly investigated by this administration's regulators." 
Mr. White, who was vice chairman of Enron Energy Services before becoming Army secretary, is the most senior member of the Bush administration to have worked for Enron, and his 11-year tenure at the company has come under intense scrutiny by Democrats. Today's appearance was Mr. White's first sworn testimony before Congress concerning the Enron scandal.
California energy regulators contend that Enron engaged in sham transactions in late 2000 that drove up electricity prices and deepened the energy crisis in the West. The regulators have said that Enron Energy Services was one of several Enron divisions that participated in the phony transactions.
For two hours today, five Democrats on the Senate Commerce, Science and Transportation Committee peppered Mr. White with questions about his knowledge of the California transactions. They also asked about numerous contacts -- 77 in all -- he had with former Enron colleagues after becoming Army secretary in May 2001, the accounting practices at his former company and his use of Army jets for personal trips.
Only two Republicans appeared at the hearing, and they offered Mr. White little support, an indication of the political power that the issue of corporate malfeasance holds just now. But Mr. White, his knees bouncing nervously under the committee's oak table, vigorously defended himself, saying he was "ashamed" about revelations of improprieties at Enron -- while also insisting that he played no part in any wrongdoing.
"While I was employed in the private sector, I carried out my responsibilities in an entirely ethical manner, just as I did over the 28 years that I served my country in the United States Army," Mr. White, a West Point graduate and retired brigadier general, said in his opening statement. 
At the heart of the Democrats' attack was what Senator Byron L. Dorgan, Democrat of North Dakota, called "smoking gun" evidence of wrongdoing: Enron memorandums released by California regulators in May that outlined strategies to inflate prices artificially in California's deregulated energy market.
At least one of those documents mentioned Enron Energy Services, and Mr. Dorgan seized on that fact to allege a conspiracy to drive up prices in California involving Mr. White's former division and Enron's energy traders.
"The scheme of Fat Boy could not possibly work without E.E.S.," Mr. Dorgan said, using the code name for one of the strategies. 
When Mr. White denied having had any prior knowledge of Fat Boy or the other trading strategies, Mr. Dorgan fired back: "You're all kissing cousins here. You're under the same corporate umbrella."
Mr. White replied that Enron Energy Services maintained an "arm's length" relationship with the wholesale division, which he said developed Fat Boy and the other strategies. "When we had our profit and our numbers and our targets to make, and the wholesale group had separate targets to make, we were not kissing cousins," Mr. White said. 
The secretary also exchanged sharp words with Senator Barbara Boxer, Democrat of California, who raised questions about telephone calls Mr. White made to friends and former colleagues at Enron at the same time that he was selling $3 million in Enron stock last fall.
"Calling all those insider people, it just doesn't look right," Ms. Boxer said. "Just like it doesn't look right for Martha Stewart."
Mr. White said the calls were personal, and he objected to Ms. Boxer's suggestions that he was spending too much time making phone calls to friends while the country was at war. 
"I never said you didn't work hard to prosecute the war," she said.
Mr. White shot back, "Well, yes you did." 
After the hearing, Ms. Boxer sent a letter to Mr. White saying she found his answers "evasive, deceptive, argumentative, and not helpful in any way."
Senator Max Cleland, a Democrat from Georgia who was a decorated Army captain in Vietnam, chided Mr. White for earning more than $12 million on Enron stock sales last year when small-time investors and low-level employees were losing their savings. 
"In combat, officers eat last," Mr. Cleland said. "In the economic turmoil, the economic warfare that they faced, Enron officers ate first."
Mr. White said that he was required to sell his stock under government ethics rules and that he also suffered financially when the stock's price plummeted last fall. He said he returned options for 665,000 Enron shares in January after they had become worthless. 
"I am ashamed of what's happened to that corporation," Mr. White said.

HEADLINE: Metro Briefing New York: Manhattan: Economy May Be Stabilizing 

BYLINE:  By Leslie Eaton (NYT) (Compiled by Anthony Ramirez)

 BODY:
 New York City's economy is showing signs of stabilizing, if not recovering, according to economic data released yesterday by state and city agencies. The unemployment rate, which had risen sharply over the last year, was unchanged in June at 8 percent, the New York State Department of Labor said. 
And while the total number of jobs in the city dropped last month because of a decline in government employment, private companies added about 1,500 employees, according to William C. Thompson Jr., the city comptroller. Both reports are adjusted for seasonal variations in employment. The city and state budget gaps will continue to hurt the outlook for government jobs, Mr. Thompson said in a statement. "In the near future, to increase jobs we will have to rely on the private sector," he said. Leslie Eaton (NYT)

 A selective listing by critics of The Times of new or noteworthy movies playing this weekend in New York City. * denotes a highly recommended film. Ratings and running times are in parentheses.

Now Playing

"THE BOURNE IDENTITY," starring Matt Damon and Franka Potente. Directed by Doug Liman (PG-13, 113 minutes). Mr. Damon plays Jason Bourne, a C.I.A. superassassin with amnesia who is chased across Europe in the company of a charming German waif (Ms. Potente) by his employers. There are espionage writers who use the genre to explore the complexities of geopolitics, but Robert Ludlum, on whose novel this competent, enjoyable picture is based, was not one of them. At a time when thrillers are shadowed by real-world anxieties, the implausibility and irrelevance of this movie, which amusingly imagines the C.I.A. as a supercompetent, virtually omniscient operation, comes as something of a relief. Mr. Damon handles his character's existential crisis with fierce adroitness, and Mr. Liman's direction has an old-fashioned swiftness and efficiency (A. O. Scott).

"THE CROCODILE HUNTER: COLLISION COURSE," starring Steve Irwin. Directed by John Stainton (PG, 90 minutes). In addition to the crocodiles that are his specialty, the irrepressible Mr. Irwin, an Australian naturalist whose hyperactivity has made him a star of American cable television, wrangles poisonous snakes and fanged spiders. His shenanigans, during which he addresses the audience in his trademark Down Under idioms ("crikey!," "have a go at that!"), are bundled into a ludicrous, amusing story of international intrigue involving a spy satellite, an ornery Queensland rancher and a pair of C.I.A. operatives whom Mr. Irwin treats as another peculiar species of wildlife. Though Mr. Irwin's antic good spirits can be annoying (one occasionally envies the reptiles' inability to hear), they can also be very funny. Whether you're laughing at him or with him, you will find yourself laughing a lot (Scott).

"LIKE MIKE," starring Bow Wow, Eugene Levy and Morris Chestnut. Directed by John Schultz (PG, 100 minutes). A 13-year-old orphan named Calvin (Bow Wow) turns around the fictional Los Angeles Knights pro basketball team, courtesy of a pair of magic sneakers that he finds. Calvin's new powers are observed when he wins a chance to shoot against a spoiled N.B.A. star during a half-time stunt. Naturally, he's asked to join the team. The successful kid rapper Bow Wow is a talented actor whose boyish eagerness here is a marked contrast to his taciturn rappadocio. The director's breezy steadiness keeps the movie from hitting us over the head -- well, not too hard, anyway, no small feat since the steroid-juiced sentimentality of the ending may force some to flee before the outtakes unspool under the credits (Elvis Mitchell).

* "LILO AND STITCH," with the voices of Chris Sanders, Daveigh Chase, Tia Carrere and Ving Rhames. Written and directed by Chris Sanders and Dean Deblois (PG, 89 minutes). In this charming exercise in intergalactic multiculturalism, Stitch, the snaggle-toothed, ill-behaved result of an alien genetic experiment, crashes to Earth, where he is adopted by a young Hawaiian girl named Lilo. The pair must contend with extraterrestrial law enforcement and a nosy earth-bound social worker, and their triumph over these adversities involves the usual Disney blend of comic anarchy, musical numbers (this time with an Elvis theme) and heart-tugging sentimentality. The movie's family relationships are addressed with low-key realism, and the animation has a lovely, gentle precision, with plenty of room for visual comedy but less of the noise and chaos that have become the hallmarks of 3-D animation. This movie suggests that the old-fashioned, flat, painted kind of animation still has much to offer (Scott).

* "LOVELY AND AMAZING," starring Catherine Keener, Brenda Blethyn, Dermot Mulroney and Emily Mortimer. Written and directed by Nicole Holofcener (R, 91 minutes). This smart, acidic comedy by the director of "Walking and Talking" could be described as a West Coast answer to "Sex and the City," minus that series' high-gloss glamour and erotic joie de vivre. Ms. Keener and Ms. Mortimer are sisters, both attractive and in their 30's, who have major self-esteem problems and poor taste in men. Ms. Blethyn is their vain mother who develops complications after liposuction. The movie zeroes in on contemporary narcissism with a relentless, needling accuracy that illustrates exactly the way some people allow their insecurities to poison their intimate relationships. But once it has limned its characters (Ms. Keener's is by far the most vivid), it doesn't go anywhere in particular (Stephen Holden).

"MEN IN BLACK II," starring Tommy Lee Jones, Will Smith, Lara Flynn Boyle, Rip Torn, Rosario Dawson and Tony Shalhoub. Directed by Barry Sonnenfeld (PG-13, 82 minutes). If your memory of the first one is a little hazy, don't worry: that was the point all along. And in any case this sequel provides the same pleasant, pointless mixture of whimsy and kineticism. Of course, like the "Ghostbusters" and "Austin Powers" sequels (to give only two out of several thousand possible examples), the fun has diminished because the novelty has worn off. Mr. Smith and Mr. Jones coast along, joined by Mr. Torn and Mr. Shalhoub (and a talking bulldog) from "Men in Black," and a host of creepy, scaly, funny aliens, including Ms. Boyle, her icy charms enhanced by hundreds of slimy tentacles and an extendable green tongue (Scott).

* "METROPOLIS," starring Rudolf Klein-Rogge, Gustav Frohlich and Brigitte Helm. Directed by Fritz Lang (not rated, 120 minutes). Lang's silent modernist fever dream -- a nightmarish grand opera of romantic love, alienated labor and technological power -- is one of the most studied and imitated films of all time, and has been reissued many times. Except for a brief theatrical run in 1927, though, the movie as Lang made it has never been seen. This latest version, the result of a four-year restoration project using archival materials and new digital techniques, may not be the director's cut, but it is as definitive a "Metropolis" as we are likely to see. The new 35-millimeter print is beautiful, the score has been newly recorded, and Lang's swirling, visionary stew of Christian symbolism, Expressionist set design and political anxiety is more grand and troubling than ever (Scott).

"MINORITY REPORT," starring Tom Cruise and Colin Farrell. Directed by Steven Spielberg (PG-13, 140 minutes). This atmospheric new thriller is a muscular and dense exercise of skill and verve. (Ironically, this exercise may be the most adult film that Mr. Spielberg has made in some time; it's about the bloody blurring of passion and violence -- a compassionate noir.) In 2054, a law enforcement unit called Pre-Crime exists to stop murders before they begin; three Pre-Cogs -- beings who float in a nutrient-rich fluid -- can predict when a crime will be committed and know the identity of the perpetrator. When the unit's chief, John Anderton, is accused of a crime he hasn't yet committed, he's soon on the run. Mr. Cruise does as much sprinting in this picture as he has in his entire filmography. The fluid bursts of quick-cut images seen on the monitors also show that Mr. Spielberg isn't about to be shown up by those quick-fingered, compulsively exhibitionistic upstarts like David Fincher. With "Minority Report" he toys with the idea that there's more -- and less -- to Mr. Cruise than meets the eye and says we shouldn't trust our eyes anyway. But doesn't he always? (Mitchell).

"MR. DEEDS," starring Adam Sandler and Winona Ryder. Directed by Steven Brill (PG-13, 91 minutes). It could be said that the remake of Frank Capra's "Mr. Deeds Goes to Town," starring Mr. Sandler in the title role, is redundant, since the actor has been remaking Capraesque movies for most of his career. As in Capra's original 1936 classic, Longfellow Deeds still lives in Mandrake Falls, is an aspiring greeting-card poet and has no patience for pretension. And once again, he is left a fortune by a distant relative: adjusted for inflation, the amount is $40 billion instead of $20 million. He's taken to New York, where he'll presumably be enticed by the city. But Mr. Sandler's Longfellow Deeds is too austere ever to be tempted by Manhattan's bright lights. Mr. Sandler's films are always about the arrogant getting a deserved comeuppance at the hands of humbler types, but this is the first time he seems a little smug himself. "Mr. Deeds" has him rehashing a role he has performed so many times before he could be doing this picture in his sleep. The result is likely to be that he'll put audiences to sleep, especially those he won over with "Happy Gilmore" and "The Wedding Singer" (Mitchell).

"PUMPKIN," starring Christina Ricci, Hank Harris and Brenda Blethyn. Directed by Adam Larson Broder and Tony R. Abrams (R, 116 minutes). In this uneasy mixture of satire and sentiment, Ms. Ricci plays Carolyn McDuffie, a Southern California sorority sister who risks everything -- the respect of her peers, her tennis-star boyfriend, her very sanity -- to pursue a love affair with a young retarded man named Pumpkin (Mr. Harris). The movie is sometimes sweet and often incisive in its mockery of social ambition and phony compassion, but the filmmakers have not figured out how to balance earnestness and mockery, and they end up sneering at the charming, naive love story they have, perhaps in spite of themselves, created (Scott).

* "ROAD TO PERDITION," starring Tom Hanks, Paul Newman and Jude Law. Directed by Sam Mendes (R, 119 minutes). This solemn, rain-washed period gangster film based on a graphic novel is a cool but stately work that achieves the grandeur of a classic Hollywood western. An exploration of father-son relationships viewed largely through the eyes of a 12-year-old boy, it follows the fugitive journey of Michael Sullivan (Mr. Hanks), a hit man for the mob outside Chicago, who flees the wrath of the middle-level boss (Mr. Newman) who is also his surrogate father. Filled with memorable tableaus, the movie is a serious picture show whose cinematography by Conrad L. Hall lends every frame an Edward Hopper-like mood. Mr. Newman (with an Irish brogue) steals the movie as Rooney, the mob boss faced with agonizing life-and-death choices. Mr. Hanks holds his own as the movie's enigmatic antihero on a vengeful mission: a killer-for-hire with a social conscience and a devotion to his young son (Holden).

"SCOOBY DOO," starring Freddie Prinze Jr. and Sarah Michelle Gellar. Directed by Raja Gosnell (PG, 105 minutes). The old Hanna-Barbera cartoon was cheap, silly and occasionally charming in its blithe stupidity. This adaptation, combining live action with 3-D computer-generated animation, looks pretty expensive, and its stupidity is, for the most part, charmless. The human cast -- Mr. Prinze, especially -- does a good-humored job of sending up and paying homage to the old show, but its efforts are overwhelmed by a relentless pop music score, hideous special effects and a plot that violates all the rules of the old series for no good reason (Scott).

* "SUNSHINE STATE," starring Edie Falco, Angela Bassett, Mary Alice, Mary Steenburgen and Timothy Hutton. Written and directed by John Sayles (PG-13; 141 minutes). Mr. Sayles's panoramic exploration of life in Delrona Beach, a fictional Florida coastal town in the throes of development, is as rich and even-handed a mosaic of American life as any filmmaker has brought to the screen. The overlapping stories revolve around two families, one white, the other black, who are being pressured to sell their property to greedy developers. Among more than a dozen characters who cross paths in the course of the story, the most compelling are Marly Temple (Ms. Falco), a sardonic young woman who runs her family's motel, and Desiree Perry (Ms. Bassett), a former teenage rebel who returns after a 25-year absence to confront her straitlaced mother (Ms. Alice). More than a probing civics lesson, the movie takes the political and spiritual pulse of our restless national psyche (Holden).

HEADLINE: Better Development Through Democracy 

BYLINE:  By Jennifer L. Windsor; Jennifer L. Windsor is executive director of Freedom House, a nonprofit organization that monitors political and human rights around the world.

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
African leaders meeting in Durban, South Africa, recently dissolved the moribund Organization of African Unity and replaced it with a new and purportedly more powerful body called the African Union. By pledging to conduct democratic elections and respect the rule of law -- and to intervene when member states violate human rights -- these leaders hope to attract more than $60 billion annually in new trade and investment from wealthy countries. Their efforts to link politics and economic growth, spearheaded by President Thabo Mbeki of South Africa, have received widespread praise.
 While hopes are high for the new organization, the promise of a regional union for better development through democracy could rapidly become a charade. For example, Col. Muammar el-Qaddafi, Libya's sole ruler for more than 30 years, and President Daniel arap Moi, who has thwarted any democratic reform in Kenya for two decades, have joined the steering committee of the New Economic Partnership for Africa's Development, a program endorsed by the African Union that is supposed to reward democratic practice with increased aid and investment. Colonel Qaddafi's declaration in Durban -- "We accept help, but we refuse conditions" -- epitomized tensions between democratically accountable statesmen like Mr. Mbeki and the older autocratic rulers like Colonel Qaddafi, Mr. Moi and President Robert Mugabe of Zimbabwe. 
 While outside support can help, the African Union and the new economic partnership will only be realized in full when elected African leaders bring democracy to the forefront of their push for economic development.
How timely, then, that in recent speeches President Bush has articulated a new foreign assistance policy, one that is of historic significance. The new Millennium Challenge Account, created by the Bush administration, represents a $10 billion total increase in American aid by 2006. It aims to reward governments that "make the right choices for their own people." The choices Mr. Bush emphasizes include a respect for human rights and a commitment to root out corruption.
Through the Millennium Challenge Account, the president has elevated the connection between democracy and development. In the past, development experts have simply ignored the political environment in which assistance programs operate, believing they could help those in need in a purely technical way without immersing themselves in the messy business of politics. In more recent years, the need for good governance and citizen participation has gained credence even among supposedly nonpolitical multilateral institutions. But the word democracy has still largely been avoided.
Basing the allocation of foreign aid on the commitment of a government to rule democratically is perhaps the best way to avoid the problems that have plagued previous development efforts. If the president's experiment works, it could fundamentally change the way America spends the rest of its official foreign development aid, totaling some $10.9 billion in 2001 alone.
Administration officials are now working hard to develop criteria for selecting countries to receive challenge-account funds, and economists are busily trying to find links between specific governance measures and economic outcomes. Some want to weaken the democracy and human rights criteria to make them fit the best theoretical economic model. That would risk losing the core of President Bush's development ideal.
We should be making the principles governing the Millennium Challenge Account clear to the world. The United States will not support governments that refuse to listen to their own citizens or be held accountable to them. We will not subsidize regimes that violate universally accepted principles of political rights and civil liberties.
That means we should not compensate countries like Vietnam that pass legal reforms but fail to recognize the basic due-process rights of their own citizens. We should not reward countries like Uganda and Egypt that curtail freedom of association, including the right to form political parties and politically active civil society groups. And we certainly should not support countries like Zimbabwe and Pakistan that fail to hold elections that meet international standards.
No regime can have sustainable development -- even with sizable foreign assistance -- without being accountable to its people. If there is one lesson to be learned from earlier decades, it is that democracy matters.

HEADLINE: Mayor Warns of More Belt Tightening 

BYLINE:  By MICHAEL COOPER 

 BODY:
Just 18 days after his first budget took effect, Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg called yesterday for city agencies to gird themselves for another round of cuts to make sure that the budget stays balanced and to save money to offset next year's deep deficit.
 Mayor Bloomberg said that the city would withhold 7.5 percent of the funds for every agency this year, for a savings of roughly a billion dollars, and that budget officials would begin negotiating specific cuts with each commissioner soon. 
 The mayor outlined the plan at the annual meeting of the New York State Financial Control Board, which was created during the fiscal crisis of the 1970's and which monitors the city's finances.
While specific service cuts will not be chosen until September, a series of contingency cuts that the Bloomberg administration considered earlier this year may offer clues as to the kinds of city services that could be affected. That plan called for fewer garbage collections, further cuts in the size of the police force, removing fire companies from some fire stations that house more than one, and closing a number of health clinics. 
"It will be painful," Mr. Bloomberg said. "And if the economy recovers, and tax revenues along with it, faster than what we're projecting, nobody will be happier to take that money and to spend it on providing things that the citizens of New York City need.
"But we want to start now, anticipating the deficit problem, and a solution to that in the future. Anything we can save in fiscal 2003 will help us with our problem in 2004."
The mayor made his call for further cuts during a week in which the city comptroller, William C. Thompson Jr., the state comptroller, H. Carl McCall, and the financial control board all issued reports warning that the city's current budget relies on more than a billion dollars in revenues and savings that may not materialize. They all warned that the city would face gaps of at least $3.7 billion next year.
By immediately announcing that he was calling for another round of budget cuts, the mayor preemptively addressed many of their concerns. He also sent a message to the credit ratings agencies, whose assessments of the city's bonds can save or cost millions.
But after a rare month of budget peace at City Hall, after the successful negotiation with the City Council that managed to avoid most painful cuts, the mayor appeared to be initiating a new round of wrangling over potential cuts. 
City Council officials played down the threat of further cuts, noting that past mayors have often called for potential cuts in the summer as a sort of exercise. David Weprin, the chairman of the Council's finance committee, said that just because the mayor was asking agencies to identify cuts did not mean they would be made.
"It's a responsible thing to do, to set a reserve fund," he said. "That doesn't mean that there are going to be any service cuts. It just means that we are preparing for the worst."
Mr. Bloomberg made it clear that while cuts of 7.5 percent were the target, he would be flexible as to how much each agency would be cut.
"I don't plan to hew to that 100 percent," he told the financial control board. "If the streets are in danger of becoming unsafe, we will spend the money, we will find the money to keep the streets safe."
The current budget already reduces the size of the police force to 39,110 positions from its recent peak strength of 40,710. A previous plan called for reducing it by a further 1,320 positions.
Mr. Bloomberg said he would make sure that cuts to education would not affect classrooms.
"I have made a commitment that we will not cut services in the classroom, moneys to instruction," he said. "We will not do that."
By effectively reopening the city's budget, the mayor injected a note of drama into the control board meeting. The meetings used to be of paramount importance to the city back when the board actually oversaw the city's finances, to help it out of the fiscal crisis. But now that the board merely monitors the finances, the meetings have become more of a formality. The board voted that since the city had ended the past year in balance and could still sell bonds, there was no need to take over the city's finances.
There was politics afoot as well, as is perhaps inevitable when one member of the board, Mr. McCall, is seeking the office held by another, Gov. George E. Pataki. Governor Pataki, who acted as a sort of M.C., twitted Mr. McCall for arriving late. And the City Council chose Randi Weingarten, the head of the teachers' union, as its representative at the meeting. She thanked the officials for giving raises to teachers. 
Speaking for the Council, Ms. Weingarten called for reinstating the commuter tax, which was long levied on people who work in the city but live elsewhere. Mayor Bloomberg did not call for the tax this year, maintaining that state officials, including Governor Pataki, would be unwilling to approve a tax increase while seeking re-election. 
Yesterday Mr. Bloomberg indicated that he would entertain the possibility of raising taxes next year.
"I think Ms. Weingarten, on behalf of Speaker Miller, is correct: You cannot just look at expense cuts," he said. 
"To put it in perspective, a 7.5 percent cut, thereabouts, would roughly reduce the deficit by a billion dollars," he continued. "The deficit is projected to be anywhere from four to six billion, depending on the economy. So this is a step going in the right direction, but if anybody thinks it is a total solution to the problem, they are unfortunately mistaken."

HEADLINE: SHAKE-UP AT AOL: ADVERTISING; 
Beyond Broken Promises

BYLINE:  By SAUL HANSELL 

 BODY:
As the smoke lifts, it has become clear that the company that resulted from America Online's acquisition of Time Warner is very much like the old Time Warner. AOL Time Warner has strong brands but is dependent on the fickle advertising market. It has an experienced management, but one with a penchant for corporate infighting at Olympian levels.
 In fact, once all the broken promises about being a new breed of company for a new millennium are discounted, AOL Time Warner does not seem to be in such bad shape, considering the economy. 
 America Online, it turns out, was not some sort of jet fuel that could turbo-charge the rest of Time Warner's businesses. But it is a big, profitable operating division that fits naturally into a company with major holdings in magazines and cable television, which also merge subscription and advertising revenue. 
Certainly, AOL's Internet service has more than its share of problems, not least because so much of its advertising came from the short-lived dot-com boom. But some perspective is in order. It is not as if AOL Time Warner were the child of a shotgun marriage between a water utility and a media conglomerate, like Vivendi Universal.
Rather, AOL Time Warner's biggest problem -- the one that its new management team is bound to tackle first -- is its credibility with investors and customers, not the soundness of its various divisions. 
Investors, advertisers and subscribers alike were promised far more than the company could deliver. Fairly or not, the resignation yesterday of Robert W. Pittman, the chief operating officer and previously America Online's president, is seen as a repudiation of many of those promises, because Mr. Pittman was the executive most responsible for keeping them.
Were Time Warner to have acquired America Online and simply called it another division, there would be no crisis of confidence today. But in January 2000, when the deal was struck, that was not possible. That was at the peak of the Internet stock boom, and America Online was worth $200 billion, more that double the value of Time Warner, a far larger company by every other measure.
As a result, a merger consummated at that time would be an acquisition of Time Warner by America Online. Today, even Richard D. Parsons, the company's current chief executive, acknowledges that Time Warner should have walked away and tried to buy AOL on better terms later. Of course, picking the top of any market is a bit easier in hindsight.
Moreover, Gerald M. Levin, the chief executive who sold Time Warner to America Online, saw hitching his old-world wagon to AOL's rocket as the answer to two problems that had vexed him for a decade: getting Time Warner's fiercely independent divisions to work together and positioning the company to benefit from the rise of digital technology that was bound to transform the media.
But Mr. Levin had to justify a deal that gave Time Warner shareholders only 45 percent of the combined stock in the company, even though Time Warner represented some 80 percent of the revenue and 70 percent of the operating cash flow. Talk of how the deal would create the "world's first Internet-age media and communications company," as the announcement said, was meant to convince investors that AOL's sky-high stock market multiple should be applied to the combined company. 
Indeed, the company kept the stock ticker symbol AOL. Mr. Levin promised that the deal would add $1 billion to operating cash flow in 2001, creating a 30 percent growth rate -- far higher than that of other media conglomerates. This promise, and the company's insistence that it could keep it for much of last year -- is the source of much of Wall Street's anger today. The growth rate last year was 13 percent.
In January 2000, when the merger was announced, few imagined the severity of the advertising recession that began last year, and certainly not the economic effects of the terror attacks last September.
But from the start, the $1 billion promise overstated the natural benefits of combining America Online with the Time Warner units. There were costs to be cut by using AOL's network for the Time Inc. Web sites. And there was money to be made selling magazines and promoting movies on America Online. But the value of all these linkages was far less than $1 billion.
Instead, much of the gain was meant to come from running the new company better and finding ways to get units to work together -- for example, by selling advertising in packages. And the assumption was that Mr. Pittman and the AOL management team would be able to produce results in ways that Mr. Levin had not been able to.
Now Mr. Pittman is out, and his job has been divided among two Time Warner veterans: Don Logan, the longtime head of the Time Inc. magazine unit, and Jeff Bewkes, who ran Home Box Office. They and Mr. Parsons -- also from the Time Warner side of the house -- are left to confront the question of what now to make of AOL Time Warner.
Some investors are calling for the merger to be unwound. But Mr. Parsons insisted yesterday that America Online belonged in the corporate fold. "The whole should be -- and will be, under this management team -- greater than the sum of its parts," he said in an interview.
Jessica Reif Cohen, a media analyst at Merrill Lynch, agreed that AOL, which will post $2 billion in operating cash flow this year, is a valuable asset to the company. "AOL is a great brand name, and it throws off cash," she said. "Obviously, this shouldn't have been a merger of equals, but AOL is a division that has tremendous potential." 
Filling that potential involves challenges. Mr. Parsons must find a new chief executive for America Online. AOL needs new sources of ad revenue to replace the dot-coms. And it must find a way to reverse its slow slide in market share, sapped largely by the steady switch of customers to high-speed services offered by cable and phone companies.
The rest of Time Warner's empire is a mix of good and bad news. The publishing unit, while hurt by the advertising slowdown, has increased its market share. The movie studios have had a strong year, with hits like "The Lord of the Rings." But the music unit seems perpetually troubled. And the Time Warner cable systems are burdened by unresolved negotiations to end a joint venture with AT&T.
None of these problems challenges the fundamental premise of AOL Time Warner. Tom Wolzien, an analyst with Sanford C. Bernstein & Company, points out that the old Time Inc. successfully expanded from print to broadcasting to cable. Adding the Internet, he said, was a logical extension. "The company has always been moving to the next major media platform," he said.
But Mr. Wolzien also warned that the pendulum could swing too far in restoring Time Warner's management culture, and its penchant for infighting. It took a year, he said, for Warner Brothers to agree to let the company's cable unit use the Road Runner cartoon character's name for its high-speed Internet service. 
"The criticism of Time Warner in the mid-90's was that it was a bunch of duchies where they killed each other for sport," he said. "If things are going to get better, they will still need a more integrated view."

HEADLINE: Consumer Confidence 

 BODY:
To the Editor:
 The University of Michigan's poll reporting a decline in consumer confidence (front page, July 13) may grossly exaggerate the problem. Rather than a decline of 5.9 points during the last month, consumer confidence may have increased. 
We know that survey results are only approximations. This one may be off by as much as 10 points in either direction, according to Michigan's own methods statement. 
 The preliminary results from this poll are nothing more than replies from the 250 people who were easiest to reach from a larger sample. Given the widespread influence this poll has with market analysts, the Fed and others, preliminary results should have never been released. It would take a sample of at least 750 before one could reach a credible conclusion that consumer confidence declined this much.

HEADLINE: U.S. to Punish 10 Businesses For Iran Sales 

BYLINE:  By JAMES DAO 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, July 19 

 BODY:
The Bush administration has imposed trade sanctions on nine Chinese companies and an Indian businessman that it says sold goods or technology to Iran, where they were put to use by that country's chemical and conventional weapons programs, administration officials said today.
 The sanctions will bar the firms from doing business with the United States government, forbid them to export goods into the United States and prevent American companies from exporting certain items to them. Most of the sanctions will last two years, officials said. 
 Richard A. Boucher, the State Department spokesman, said the sanctions were being imposed under the Iran-Iraq Arms Non-Proliferation Act of 1992, which addresses transfers to Iran, and the Chemical and Biological Weapons Control and Warfare Elimination Act of 1991. 
He declined to name the firms, saying that the list would be made public as soon as Congress is formally notified of the sanctions, probably next week.
The imposition of the sanctions was first reported in The Washington Times today.
The Bush administration is deeply divided over whether to seek closer relations with China. This is the fourth time in the last year that the administration has imposed sanctions on Chinese companies for improper sales of military equipment. Mr. Boucher said it was the second time sanctions were being imposed on some of the firms involved in today's announcement. 
Gary Milhollin, director of the Wisconsin Project on Nuclear Arms Control, a nonprofit group that monitors the spreading of weapons, called the sanctions toothless and urged Congress to enact tougher rules.
Mr. Milhollin said the current rules allowed these firms to purchase highly sophisticated American commodities, including supercomputers that can be used for weapons production.
He also said companies could easily circumvent sanctions by having subsidiaries or parent companies purchase regulated commodities for them. 
"Some of these guys are recidivists," he said. "The sanctions aren't deterring them."

HEADLINE: Losing My Stake in the Economy 

BYLINE:  By Robert Hemsley; Robert Hemsley is a member of the Association of Western Pulp and Paper Workers Union.

DATELINE: EVERETT, Wash. 

 BODY:
I work operating industrial machinery at a paper mill that is owned by a global corporation. My mill was built in the 1920's, when the stock market was soaring, F. Scott Fitzgerald was writing about the rich and Babe Ruth was hitting home runs for the Yankees. I get paid by the hour and do not understand the markets. I do not belong to a country club or own a suit. I just want to work at the mill until I retire. 
 My mill has survived the Depression, a world war, even a couple minor earthquakes. But I worry if it can survive Ken Lay. Small investors like me -- encouraged by politicians, financial advisers and CNBC -- poured our retirement savings into the stock market. Now we are dismayed that the corporate captains have abandoned accountability while the crew sinks with the ship. 
 Perhaps I am looking for excuses for the recent poor performance of my 401(k) plan, but I wonder if the market is fair. In 2001, the average chief executive's pay was more than $11 million, according to Pearl Meyer & Partners, an executive-compensation consulting firm. Executive pay has been climbing steadily for the past two decades and has outpaced employee pay. Two decades ago, C.E.O.'s were paid about 40 times more than the average hourly employee; now they make more than 500 times the wage of the average hourly employee.
Last year the C.E.O. of my company made 592 times more than I did. I wonder if that makes me underpaid or the C.E.O. overpaid. Recently management told hourly employees at my mill to make concessions or risk losing our jobs. We made the concessions last autumn, but last spring the C.E.O. received a stock "gift" worth $1.4 million.
This isn't capitalism, it's avarice. I am not naive. I know about the robber barons of the late 19th century and others throughout history who have abused the system. But never has the gap between executives and employees been greater. This disparity threatens the capitalist system itself. When employees make concessions while executives take bonuses, the bonds of common purpose are broken.
Contrast this with the Marine Corps, which is structured so that enlisted personnel and officers work together for a common purpose. The Marine Corps commandant runs an organization with 172,600 men and women, oversees an annual budget of some $13.2 billion and is paid $163,177 annually -- just 13 times more than the pay of a new private in boot camp. The system is successful because of a tradition of shared risks and rewards.
All employees want their company to succeed, and I am proud to work where I do. I imagine my concern about my company's share price is as great as my C.E.O.'s; a portion of my 401(k) is in company stock. I recognize my job depends upon my company making a profit.
But I wonder if corporate executives appreciate the role workers play in their success. Free enterprise is a system of risks and rewards. As it now stands, employees suffer most of the risks, while executives enjoy most of the rewards.

PERSON: Maria Asuncion Aramburuzabala 

HEADLINE: THE SATURDAY PROFILE; 
Daddy's Girl Turns Beer-and-TV Billionaire

BYLINE:  By GINGER THOMPSON 

DATELINE: MEXICO CITY 

 BODY:
THE newest member of this country's old-boy billionaires' club displays a penchant for frosted lipsticks and high heels. 
 Don't be fooled by the facade. Maria Asuncion Aramburuzabala fought a staunchly macho Mexican society in transforming herself from poor little rich girl to tycoon. Once unemployed, she now manages a billion-dollar family fortune built on beer money, having stunned the impenetrable corporate clique two years ago when she acquired a 20 percent stake in Mexico's media giant, Televisa. 
 Since then, Ms. Aramburuzabala, a slender, flirtatious woman whose face glows with meticulous strokes of makeup, has been named to Forbes Magazine's list of the wealthiest people in the world. To hear her talk about demolishing barriers that have kept Mexican women from the top of the corporate ladder, she is as confident in boardroom battles as in a cotton-candy-colored miniskirt. 
"In the mentality of corporate Mexico, women are considered synonymous with brainless," said Ms. Aramburuzabala, in a rambling interview from her 25th-floor office overlooking the mansions and chic shopping malls on the northwest edge of the capital. "I had three things going against me when I started out. I am a woman; I was young with no experience; and I was Daddy's girl."
Ms. Aramburuzabala, 39, a divorced mother of two, is an heiress to Grupo Modelo, one of Mexico's largest publicly traded companies, and now one of its most powerful directors. The brewer of Corona beer, Grupo Modelo was co-founded by her grandfather, a penniless Basque immigrant, in the wake of the Mexican Revolution. Her father, Pablo, helped make Corona the best-selling imported beer in the United States, and the fifth-most-popular in the world.
While Daddy worked, his daughter enjoyed the privileges of wealth. At 19, she married a successful business executive who was eight years older. She finished an accounting degree at the elite Technological Institute of Mexico. After she graduated, she began having children.
"Basically our lives were focused on family, not on work outside our homes," said Patricia Flores, who has been one of Ms. Aramburuzabala's best friends since college.
Ms. Flores, the daughter of a former general director of Quaker Oats in Mexico, had also married at a young age and had the first of her four children before she turned 20. The women were drawn to each other by their similar situations. There remains something similar about their vivacious and unabashedly feminine ways.
Ms. Flores said she and Ms. Aramburuzabala even dressed their children alike. She recalled trips downtown to see Santa at Christmas and vacations at Disney World. Sometimes the women would sneak away from their families for massages at a day spa or scandalous shopping sprees.
"If you would have asked me 10 years ago whether Mariasu would be doing what she is doing now," Ms. Flores said of her friend, "I would say no way."
EVERYTHING changed when Ms. Aramburuzabala's father died of cancer at 63. He left no male heirs, only a wife and two daughters. None of them had read a spreadsheet, much less annual reports. Still grieving, the women took stock of all that had been left them, and struggled to figure out how to save it.
Ms. Aramburuzabala recalled their situation in a speech last March at Harvard Business School. "It seemed we were a big pie to eat," she said with a wry grin, "and everybody wanted to eat it, by the way."
Mostly, she said, what many of her father's former business associates wanted was to move her and her mother and sister out of the way. "The world caved in on us," she said in the recent interview. "Friends, enemies, boyfriends -- everyone wanted control. Less than a month after my father died, we had people coming to tell us that he had left them in charge, and that they were going to manage things for us." 
Instincts for self-preservation took over, Ms. Aramburuzabala said. The offers for help and advice sounded to her like the promises of used-car salesmen. She consulted her mother, who was still in deep mourning, and sister, who was pregnant. She decided, she said, not to pursue control of the company -- her brother-in-law had been named general director -- but she was determined not to lose any of the family stake in Grupo Modelo.
On the day her youngest son started kindergarten, she started work. "I could have sat home eating popcorn and watching TV," she said. "But my mother, my sister and I decided that we were not going to put our fate in anyone else's hands."
From an office about the size of a supply closet, she followed the only advice her father had passed on to her. She read the company statutes, its investment agreements and all its outside contracts. With the help of her brother-in-law, she made alliances within the company to keep control of her father's seats on the board of directors and his shares in Grupo Modelo.
Still, without a victory of her own, she was hardly taken seriously by senior members of the board. "Most of them thought that because I was a woman I would get tired of work," she said. "They thought I was just playing the little businesswoman, and that after a while I would go back home." 
To prove herself, she took on the company's most difficult challenges. Two of its yeast companies had gone bankrupt, and directors at Grupo Modelo wanted to sell them. Ms. Aramburuzabala offered to make the companies profitable within a year. It would be, she said, her M.B.A. 
"I had an education, so I knew how to think," she said. "What I didn't have was experience."
She got the experience from the top to the bottom of the yeast companies. She reduced payrolls and merged divisions. She got rid of corrupt accounting managers and union leaders. She oversaw purchasing, and she helped managers on the overnight shift supervise production.
A YEAR later, the companies were back in the black. The board, she said, seemed pleasantly surprised. And next they assigned her to help lead negotiations to sell a 50.2 percent noncontrolling stake of Grupo Modelo to Anheuser-Busch.
It was a deal worth about $1.6 billion. Ms. Aramburuzabala's family is believed to have made about $500 million. But the deal won her something even more valuable: the respect of her associates. In 1996, she became vice chairwoman of Grupo Modelo.
Ms. Aramburuzabala says she has become extremely comfortable hobnobbing as the only woman in a corporate league dominated by men. But she still delights in girlish fun. Dinners with her, her friends say, are often filled with family talk and jokes and gossip.
Ms. Flores recalled a trip that she and Ms. Aramburuzabala took to Paris last year. They spent almost all of their time eating and shopping. On the last day, they realized that they had not seen a single monument or museum during the visit.
What would they tell their friends?
On the taxi ride to the airport, the travel buddies asked their driver to stop at several of the most important tourist attractions and take photos of them in front of each one.
"We were as silly as 15-year-olds," Ms. Flores said. "But we had so much fun."

HEADLINE: Cars Can Get Much Cleaner 

BYLINE:  By Fred Krupp; Fred Krupp is the executive director of Environmental Defense.

 BODY:
On Monday, Governor Gray Davis of California is expected to sign into law legislation to reduce greenhouse gas pollution, the prime contributor to global warming, from automobiles sold in California. Cars account for 40 percent of the greenhouse gas emissions in that state. Under the federal Clean Air Act, the other 49 states have the option of following suit, and California's example may well spur them to do so. The question now is: What will the car companies do? 
 To prevent passage of the law, automakers mounted a full-scale, multimillion-dollar advertising and lobbying campaign against the law. Their ads predicted economic catastrophe for California companies and consumers. The scare tactics did not dissuade state lawmakers. The law sensibly provides for standards that are cost effective, prohibits bans on any class of vehicle, and gives the carmakers until 2009 to comply. Yet the headline of one print ad was, "I'm scared to death and you should be too." The same ad proclaimed, "Supporters of this legislation just don't want you driving S.U.V.'s, pick-ups and minivans. If they really had their way, they wouldn't let you drive at all." California culture is built on driving, but Californians also know that reducing greenhouse gases is technically feasible -- just as it was feasible to build safer, cleaner cars than the ones we drove in the 1960's. 
 The automakers fought against mandatory seat belts in the 1960's. In opposing the original Clean Air Act of 1970, the American Automobile Manufacturers Association said that it would be impossible to achieve the new targets and that "manufacturers . . . would be forced to shut down." Another industry executive testified before a Senate committee in 1974 that by 1979 new fuel economy standards would "restrict the industry to producing subcompact-size cars -- or even smaller ones." In the debate over the 1990 Clean Air Act, auto industry executives claimed that further reducing auto emissions would be financially ruinous. Congress moved ahead and enacted new laws requiring a 39 percent reduction in hydrocarbons and a 60 percent reduction in nitrogen oxides in auto emissions. The result? Automakers enjoyed a decade of record profits. 
It's no surprise that the auto companies are poised to go down the same obstructionist road on California's greenhouse gases law. The industry is likely to try to put a citizens' referendum on the ballot that would override the new law. No doubt they will spend tens of millions of dollars trying to swamp the public with the same false warnings.
What if, instead, the auto industry were to take the resources it will devote to waging political warfare on the new legislation and use that money and the talents of its engineers to accelerate the development of technology to limit greenhouse gas emissions from cars and trucks? Much of the technology already exists today to accomplish this goal. As in the past, automotive engineers are likely to prove far more ingenious in producing new technological answers than their bosses give them credit for. There is simply no reason to believe that tighter emission controls can't be readily reached in seven years. 
In fact, four years ago, BP, the multinational energy corporation, committed to reducing their worldwide emissions of greenhouse gas pollution by 10 percent below 1990 levels by the year 2010. This spring, eight years ahead of schedule, BP announced that it had already achieved that level of reduction at no net costs while experiencing steady growth in its business.
Earlier this week, the attorneys general of 11 states wrote to President Bush urging strong federal action to cut greenhouse gas pollution. While the states wait for federal leadership, automakers need to be compelled to achieve what they can in fact achieve without onerous costs. By leading the way, California's new law will help set auto industry standards for the rest of the nation. This will not only benefit the environment, but it will keep American automakers competitive with our European and Asian rivals in making the clean cars that consumers and nations demand.

HEADLINE: Trade Deficit Widens, but Inflation Remains Tame 

BYLINE:  Reuters 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, July 19 

 BODY:
The trade deficit swelled to a record in May on strong consumer demand while tame inflation data solidified expectations that the Federal Reserve would keep interest rates low.
 The Commerce Department said today that American demand for imported cars, food and other goods pushed the trade gap to $37.64 billion from a revised $36.14 billion in April. 
 A report from the Labor Department said the Consumer Price Index, the main inflation gauge, inched up only 0.1 percent in June, both over all and in the closely watched "core" measure, which strips out volatile food and energy costs.
The increase in the Consumer Price Index was a more tepid reading than the 0.2 percent gains Wall Street had forecast for each measure. Prices last month were soft for a wide variety of goods, from apparel to cars and even housing.
A rise in the trade gap, the difference between imports and exports of goods and services, is sometimes seen as a negative sign for the economy because it can suggest consumers are buying more foreign goods than United States products.
Economists ratcheted down their forecasts for gross domestic product during the second quarter by about half a percentage point, with many economists now looking for an increase of about 2 to 2.5 percent.
Currency traders also interpreted the trade figure negatively, sending the dollar lower.
But economists said that at a time when consumer demand was so central to the fledgling economic recovery, the leap in imports held promise for the future pace of the expansion. "It's positive because it shows that people are out buying," said Cary Leahy, economist at Deutsche Bank Securities in New York.
Imports grew 1.8 percent, to $118.27 billion in May. Exports increased 0.7 percent, to $80.64 billion.

HEADLINE: A Forum on Rebuilding Lower Manhattan 

BYLINE:  By EDWARD WYATT

 BODY:
When more than 5,000 people gather today at the Javits Convention Center to talk about the rebuilding of Lower Manhattan, plenty of people, Gov. George E. Pataki among them, are likely to be listening closely. 
 Since Tuesday, when the Lower Manhattan Development Corporation and the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey released six initial proposals for the redesign of the World Trade Center site, a wave of negative commentary has flowed from architects, urban designers, politicians and journalists. 
 Several state and city officials have said they were surprised by the fervor of the reactions to the plans. That, in turn, has generated greater interest in the opinions of the more diverse cross-section of citizens who will participate in the event, "Listening to the City." 
"The purpose here is to invite the people most directly affected by the events of 9/11 as well as people who are concerned citizens," said Robert D. Yaro, the president of the Regional Plan Association, one of the lead organizers of the event and a member of the Civic Alliance to Rebuild Downtown New York, the event's sponsor. 
The result will be interaction among "a roomful of people who have no reason, or not a lot of opportunities, to talk to each other in daily life," Mr. Yaro said, from firefighters and rescue workers to business executives and downtown residents, and including residents of New York, Connecticut and New Jersey. 
The number of participants, selected in advance and intended to be around 5,000, might swell to 6,500 after an alternative session of registered volunteers is held on Monday. People who did not register for the event can participate in an online discussion beginning in about a week at www.listeningtothecity.org, or respond directly to the development corporation at www.renewnyc.com. 
The participants were selected from volunteers to produce a group that reflects the racial and economic makeup of the residents of the three states, organizers said. 
"This will not be like a traditional public hearing at all, where people show up with an advocacy position and are talking in broadcast mode to decision makers," said Carolyn J. Lukensmeyer, the founder and president of America Speaks, a nonpartisan, nonprofit group that organizes "electronic town hall" meetings like today's event. Ms. Lukensmeyer will be presiding over the discussion. 
The participants will be grouped at tables of 10, accompanied by a professional meeting facilitator who will address questions to the group and ensure that all participants have a chance to voice their opinions. The event is scheduled for 9 a.m. to 4 p.m.
Each of the participants will also vote periodically on points of interest using hand-held keypads, with the results tallied instantly. Among the topics that will be discussed and voted upon today are the six initial plans for the site released this week by the development corporation and the Port Authority. 
All the participants will be given a summary of the opinions voiced and decisions reached during the event. That material will form the basis of a report for the development corporation and other officials involved in the rebuilding. 
"I was surprised by the wide range of comments on the plans that were announced this week," Joseph J. Seymour, the executive director of the Port Authority, said yesterday. "Now, we need to hear more of what people think, and we need to sift through all that and refine the alternatives." 
A similar event held in February at the South Street Seaport helped to elicit opinions that influence the planning for the replacement for 7 World Trade Center, said Arthur J. Fried, executive director of the Center for Excellence in New York City Governance at New York University and one of the organizers for both events. 
Some details of the Javits Center event have been the source of tension among organizers and community groups that have been active in the planning for Lower Manhattan, according to people involved in the process. 
Some community groups wanted the event to begin with an open discussion about the future of Lower Manhattan, with the six specific site plans presented and discussed afterward. City and state officials, however, wanted the plans to be the focus of most of the session. 
The agenda now calls for about an hour of discussion among the participants about their hopes and concerns regarding the rebuilding process. After that, a three-hour period will focus on the six site designs, followed by two hours of discussion about specific themes related to the rebuilding, including jobs and the economy, housing, civic amenities and transportation.

 BODY:
No baubles are displayed in Cartier's window on Prince Street in SoHo. Instead, a huge bright-red sign advises passers-by, "Please Visit Our Other Locations."
 On nearby Spring Street, racks of discounted slides and pumps fill the yet-to-be-remodeled space that Charles Jourdan leased at a premium price and is now trying to unload. The Yves Saint Laurent Rive Gauche Homme store that made a brief appearance on Wooster Street is gone. 
 Only a few years ago, Madison Avenue seemed to be migrating downtown, as luxury retailers scrambled to plant their stiletto heels in SoHo, then one of the city's hottest shopping districts. Now, "for rent" signs dot the neighborhood, but they tell only part of the story. 
Real estate brokers estimate that as many as 50 retail spaces on prime SoHo blocks -- from Houston to Grand Streets and from West Broadway to Broadway -- are on the market. Among those, the brokers say, are some without signs whose current tenants are desperate to sublease.
Not since the recession of the early 90's have things in SoHo been this bad, said Stephen Tarter, a partner in Tarter-Stats Realty Corporation, which is based there. "There are more vacancies than there have been in eight or nine years," he said.
Like other shopping districts in the city, particularly those closest to ground zero, SoHo has suffered because of the economic downturn, the repercussions of Sept. 11, a slowdown in foreign tourism and the declining sales for many luxury goods.
Brokers say, though, that SoHo's problems are to some degree of its own making, a reaction to the fevered competition for space that had rents spiraling out of sight.
At the most fashionable addresses on Prince and Spring Streets, storefronts that fetched annual rents of $100 a square foot five years ago had more than tripled by last year to levels rivaling Madison Avenue below 72nd Street and beyond the reach of all but brand-name retailers. In contrast, vacancies uptown are scarce despite the lofty rents, said Robin Abrams, a broker with the Lansco Corporation. "Uptown is established," she said.
As SoHo started taking on the trappings of a fancy shopping center, it lost many of its art galleries and the smaller independent stores that had helped give the neighborhood its artsy flavor.
SoHo landlords are partly to blame, said Faith Hope Consolo, a vice chairwoman of Garrick-Aug Worldwide, a retail brokerage company. "Landlords have to be realistic," she said, "They killed the goose that laid the golden egg with these rents."
Ms. Consolo and other brokers say they are reminded of how Columbus Avenue lost its cachet as a shopping destination in the 1980's as rents rose and independent stores were squeezed out by chain stores. Columbus Avenue "is still viable," said Beth Greenwald, a broker at Newmark New Spectrum. "It just doesn't have an edge."
One retailer that is leaving SoHo is Pompanoosuc Mills, which sells a hardwood furniture line made in Thetford, Vt. The company is moving to Hudson Street in TriBeCa after 10 years on Broome Street, said Mary Meisenhzahl, the store manager. "The rents for people like us that came here then are out of our league," she said. "A lot of boutique-type stores have had to close and are being replaced by stores like Coach and Ferragamo."
The owners of Fishs Eddy, a small chain of housewares stores, learned the hard way that SoHo was not the right neighborhood for them. Their store at Broome and Mercer Streets lasted 10 months before closing a year ago. "There are no New Yorkers there," said Julie Gaines, one of the owners, referring to SoHo. "It used to feel really hip and cutting edge, but now it feels like a big shopping mall." 
The space has changed hands twice since Fishs Eddy moved out.
And that move occurred before Sept. 11, which only made matters worse for retailers. Traffic restrictions kept out shoppers from beyond Manhattan. European tourists, who admire SoHo for its cast-iron buildings and Left Bank ambience, have been scarce since the terrorist attack, and many luxury retailers have had their worst sales in years.
One retailer whose timing was especially unfortunate was Anne Moore, the owner of the Bridgehampton hat shop that bears her name. Ms. Moore had planned to open another shop, on Thompson Street, on Sept. 11. She finally opened in November, but then closed two months later because business was so bad. "All I did was speak to people about Sept. 11," she said. "It was a little dead world."
Cartier opened its store in November and closed it in January. A spokeswoman said the space had been leased solely to introduce the company's new Collection Delices de Cartier line of jewelry and was never intended to be a permanent store. Last fall, however, Women's Wear Daily reported that in January the store would be remodeled to resemble other Cartier boutiques.
In 1998, before Yves Saint Laurent opened its men's store, an executive vice president was quoted in The New York Times as saying, "Going to SoHo is a natural move for us." These days, company officials are less eager to discuss their SoHo experiences. "We do not have any information," a spokeswoman in New York said. "Everyone is on vacation." 
A Charles Jourdan spokeswoman said no one was available to comment on the Spring Street store. "They're in Europe," she said. 
Some SoHo retailers say business has picked up since the beginning of the year. "We were very pleased with June," said Barbara Cirkva, an executive vice president of Chanel, whose store on the corner of Spring and Wooster Streets carries jackets priced at $2,100 and sweaters at $580, "and July seems to be holding up."
At the outdoor market cater-corner to Chanel, merchants painted a gloomier picture. Barry Jumpita, who manages Beebop & Wally's space at the market, said sales of $24 blouses and skirts priced from $25 to $60 were off by 50 percent since Sept. 11. "The people," he said, "they are so much hesitant to spend."
In recent months, brokers say, rents in SoHo have dropped by 20 to 25 percent, and negotiations over leases are taking much longer than they used to. "There's another 10 to 15 percent to go before the market gets lively," said Bruce Sinder, the president of Sinvin Realty. "There are tenants who want to go to SoHo, but the price has to be right."
Even with its problems, SoHo is not stagnating. Earlier this week, Apple opened its first New York computer store at Prince and Greene Streets, after taking over the lease that Restoration Hardware gave up in April 2001. Crate and Barrel plans to open a store on the edge of SoHo, and Bloomingdale's is negotiating to take over the Canal Jeans store a few blocks south on Broadway.
H. Stern, the high-priced jeweler, has spent several years putting up a new building on Prince and Greene Streets but is not sure whether the store will be ready for Christmas. Andrea Hansen, the marketing director for North America, said this H. Stern would cater to the downtown market. "A major mistake that some people made," she said, "they take a successful model that works on Madison and have the same thing downtown."
Another retailer that cannot pinpoint an opening date in SoHo is Ermenegildo Zegna, the men's clothing designer. The company is upbeat about its prospects on Prince Street, said Djordge Stefanovic, a spokesman in New York. "We have all the intention to open the space we have," he said. "We believe that SoHo is a place where good brands need to be. We want to be among the players who bring it back on track."

HEADLINE: Help for Working Parents 

 BODY:
In a nation of 25 million working mothers, the competing pulls of family and work have never been greater. Where the job is a matter of economic necessity, child care is essential. 
But that does not erase fears over how it will affect the well-being of an infant. For every report that reassures parents, another casts doubt.
 For example, according to a new analysis by researchers at Columbia Teachers College, 3-year-old children scored a significant six points lower on a developmental test if their mothers were back at work by the ninth month after birth. This will surely worry the 1.5 million mothers with children under the age of one year, who may think twice about putting their children in day care so soon. 
 But Jeanne Brooks-Gunn and Jane Waldfogel, two of the researchers and working mothers themselves, say the report is more a verdict on child care in the United States generally. Usually a working parent in America can expect six weeks' paid absence around the time a baby arrives. Parents working for companies with 50 or more employees can take up to 12 more weeks without pay. Compare that with other Western nations, where the mean for time allowed after birth is 10 months. 
Working parents who wish to stay home obviously need help. Employers should allow part-time and flexible hours, but the onus cannot fall solely on businesses. Extended paternity and maternity programs like those in Minnesota and Montana, which pay parents a stipend based on child care costs if they stay home for the first year, bear examination. Otherwise, working parents will continue to face painful choices.

HEADLINE: Europeans Delay Sanctions In Battle Over U.S. Tariffs 

BYLINE:  By PAUL MELLER 

DATELINE: BRUSSELS, July 19 

 BODY:
The European Union stepped back from a potential trade war with Washington today by delaying a decision to impose sanctions on more than $300 million worth of United States products in retaliation for United States steel tariffs.
 The move for a two-month delay came after the United States offered to exempt from the tariffs a further $60 million worth of steel imports from the European Union. The United States had previously granted exemptions to $230 million of European Union steel products, but the European Union said on Wednesday that that was not enough. 
 In addition to the new tariff exemptions, "we have also seen an explicit written commitment to continue this process" of granting exemptions until the end of August, said Peter Carl, director general in charge of trade issues for the European Commission, the union's executive arm. 
"We welcome the cooperative attitude on the matter, especially in the past weeks and days," Mr. Carl said, but he added that the exemptions were still insufficient.
Under pressure to protect the troubled United States steel industry, President Bush in March imposed duties as high as 30 percent on steel imports. The European Union, Japan, South Korea, Brazil and other nations are challenging the tariffs at the World Trade Organization. More immediately, the European Union sought to retaliate by imposing sanctions covering $364 million of United States products, including steel, citrus fruit and textiles. The sanctions were delayed after Washington said it would review the tariffs.
"We're pleased to see that the Europeans have stepped back from unilateral trade retaliation, which would not have helped Europe, the United States or the world trading system," said Josette Shiner, associate United States trade representative for policy and communications.
The United States contends that Europe has no economic rationale for retaliation. It says that American steel safeguards have strengthened the prices for European steel products and stock prices.
The Europeans argue that the tariffs affect $2.3 billion of European steel. The latest offer of exemptions still means that less than 12.5 percent of steel from the European Union is exempt from the tariffs.
All 15 member state governments supported the proposal by the commission to delay a decision on sanctions until Sept. 30, Mr. Carl said.
But some member states were reluctant to delay. One diplomat noted that Italian steel companies had not been granted any exemptions. 
"Germany feels that its companies have not yet been granted enough,' he said, adding that Europe's two giants -- Arcelor, a recent combination of companies from Belgium, France and Luxembourg, and the Corus Group, a British-Dutch company -- "are better off." 
The 11th-hour gesture by the United States was only part of the reason the European Union backed away from opting for sanctions, Mr. Carl said. "If countermeasures were applied, they could provoke a patriotic response to external pressure," he said, adding that this would be counterproductive.
According to a European Commission report published on Wednesday, the short-term effects of the United States steel tariffs have hurt the United States economy more than European exporters, because of the upward pressure they have put on prices of finished steel products.
"We are mainly concerned about the medium and long term," Mr. Carl said. "Price increases are being accompanied by the de-mothballing of uneconomic capacity in the United States, which will come online in the coming months. This will pull prices down."
If the World Trade Organization rules in favor of the Europeans, a decision expected in August 2003, the United States will be obliged to withdraw the tariffs. Then prices will really tumble, Mr. Carl said.
He also said that while negotiations with the United States continue, the European Union will lead an initiative to tackle the underlying problem of overcapacity in the global steel market. He said the overcapacity was largely caused by cycles in trade policy. "We must stop this infernal cycle," he said.

HEADLINE: THE MARKETS: STOCKS & BONDS; 
MARKET CONTINUES FOUR-MONTH ROUT; DOW PLUNGES 390

BYLINE:  By JONATHAN FUERBRINGER 

 BODY:
Stocks continued their plunge yesterday in a four-month rout that has sent the major indexes below their lows of last September and to levels that, if they hold, will make this the worst year for the market since the 1970's.
 The persistence of the decline has made it harder for companies to raise capital and has eroded the retirement accounts and stock portfolios of many Americans. 
 Some bad earnings projections and a criminal investigation of another company helped unsettle investors yesterday. The Dow Jones industrial average, which had been the strongest of the major indexes, fell 390 points, completing its worst two weeks since the 1987 crash with a loss of 14.5 percent. For the year, the Dow is down 20 percent, and the other major indexes are down far more. 
Reports of accounting troubles at WorldCom, Xerox and other big companies have created an environment in which good news is ignored and slightly negative news is crippling. Congressional efforts to restore corporate accountability and President Bush's response appear not to have reassured investors anxious about the accuracy of financial results. Even positive comments about the economy from Alan Greenspan, the long-revered chairman of the Federal Reserve, seemed to provide little support to the stock market this week.
"There hasn't been any news in the last 12 weeks that has made anybody feel confident," said Thomas McManus, the equity strategist at Banc of America Securities. "There is nothing that has made people say there is a great opportunity here." 
Where the market goes from here depends in large measure on the confidence of individual investors, who have come to believe in recent years that stocks are the best long-term investment and, therefore, they have ridden out past stock market declines and even bought when prices fell. But after two and a half years of losses and with their faith in corporate management waning, this belief could erode. Even a small shift would be bad for stocks.
Howard Freeland, a doctor in Baltimore, watched the market yesterday on his computer but did not look at his own portfolio. "I was afraid to look," he said. Dr. Freeland, 47, called yesterday's plunge an overreaction and compared it, in reverse, to the excesses of 1999 and early 2000.
"People didn't look at what true values were when prices were high back then, and I don't think people are looking at true values now that prices are significantly lower," he added. "It's herd mentality."
One sign of the blow to investor confidence can be seen in the money flowing out of stock mutual funds. According to AMG Data Services, there were net outflows of $11.4 billion from stock funds in the week ended Wednesday. That brought the outflow for July to $18.5 billion, after an $11.1 billion outflow in June. Many mutual funds have some cash on hand to handle redemptions, but if investors continue to pull money out of funds, they will have to sell more stocks to meet the demand.
Robert Adler, the president of AMG Data Services, said that the outflow, as a measure of active investor sentiment, was the worst since he began collecting mutual fund data in 1992. The outflows in the two weeks after Sept. 11 were $5.9 billion and $4.9 billion, respectively.
But he said he did not see investor panic because much of the money is not being reallocated to safe money market funds. Instead, some is going into funds that invest in foreign stocks as investors seek to take advantage of the falling dollar, which enhances any investment gains from abroad. Some more of this money is being moved into funds that invest in the highest-quality corporate bonds.
Paul D'arienzo, a stock exchange floor broker, said that small investors were afraid to be in the market. "Small investors aren't chipping in the $100 or $200 a month," he said, "and the market feels that."
Domestic stocks have shown weakness virtually across the board. The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index is now at its lowest level since June 1997 and is down 44.5 percent since its high in March 2000. The Dow Jones industrial average is at its lowest level since October 1998 and off 31.6 percent from its high in January 2000. The Nasdaq composite index has not been this low since May 1997 and is down 73.9 percent from its peak in March 2000.
Since President Bush came to Wall Street on July 9 to reassure Americans that corporate malfeasance would be taken seriously, the Dow has fallen 13.5 percent and the Nasdaq composite index 6.2 percent.
The Nasdaq composite and the S.& P. 500 have fallen in 15 of the last 18 weeks, and the Dow has been down in 14 of those weeks.
Yesterday, bad earnings news from several major companies added to the already sour atmosphere on Wall Street. The expiration of option contracts on stocks and the replacement of seven stocks in the S.& P. 500 index at the end of the day contributed to the volatility. A record 2.66 billion shares traded hands on the New York Stock Exchange.
The sickness in the United States market is affecting major stock indexes in Europe and Asia, which fell as much as 5 percent yesterday. The global market decline is fueling some fears, stock analysts suggested, that consumer confidence will be broken and that consumer spending will be reined in, which could undermine economic recoveries both here and abroad.
"The fact that global stock markets are falling is making some think that this is going to lead to an economic downturn," said Thomas M. Galvin, chief investment officer at Credit Suisse First Boston.
The dollar also weakened yesterday, with the euro rising to $1.01, its highest level since January 2000.
Mr. Galvin said that many investors appeared to be staying on the sidelines until mid-August. The Securities and Exchange Commission will then require senior executives of the nation's biggest companies to begin signing a pledge, under oath, about the accuracy of their corporate financial statements.
"I just think that people don't want to get blindsided," he said, so they will wait until they see if this financial-statement oath will produce a "rigorous period of financial restatements."
At the close of the market yesterday, the Dow was down 390.23 points, or 4.6 percent, at 8,019.26. The Dow's 20 percent decline for the year so far follows drops of 7.1 percent last year and 6.2 percent in 2000. The broader S.& P. 500-stock index lost 33.80 points, or 3.8 percent, to 847.76. The S.& P. is down 26.2 percent for the year, after declines of 13 percent last year and 10.1 percent in 2000.
The worst performer remains the Nasdaq, which contains many technology stocks and former highfliers. It dropped 37.80 points, or 2.8 percent, to 1,319.15. For the year, it has lost 32.4 percent, after plunges of 21.1 percent in 2001 and 39.3 percent in 2000.
Much of the negative news that weighed on stocks yesterday was parsed from otherwise positive company announcements.
Microsoft said late Thursday that its earnings were better than expected last quarter. But sales of its Xbox game systems were disappointing, and executives were not optimistic about the rest of 2002. Microsoft stock dropped 3 percent, to $49.56.
Sun Microsystems predicted a loss for this quarter, and its stock fell 26.7 percent, to $4.25. Pepsico, despite reporting an 11 percent increase in earnings, plunged 10.2 percent, to $36.20, after saying its sales rose less than expected.
The biggest drag on the Dow industrials was Johnson & Johnson, which fell 15.8 percent, to $41.85, after reports surfaced that the government was conducting a criminal investigation into its Puerto Rico plant where an anemia drug is made. The drug has been linked to serious illnesses in Europe and Canada.
AOL Time Warner fell sharply for a second day after announcing late Thursday a management reorganization that included the resignation of Robert W. Pittman, the chief operating officer. AOL's stock was off 7 percent, at $11.58. The company continues to suffer from doubts about its real financial health and accounting practices.
"You never know when it's going to be over," Dexter Williams, who works in risk management on Wall Street, said yesterday. "It's going to take a long time to restore investor confidence." 
As investors moved out of stocks and into the bond market, bond prices rose and yields, which move in the opposite direction, fell. The yield on the Treasury's 10-year note dropped to 4.52 percent, from 4.61 percent Thursday, as the price rose 22/32, to 102 23/32.

HEADLINE: Big Airlines Reverse Strategy With Big Cuts in Leisure Fares 

BYLINE:  By EDWARD WONG 

 BODY:
The country's largest airlines made big cuts in round-trip leisure fares yesterday in virtually all domestic markets, signaling a desperate attempt to fill their seats in a depressed period for the industry.
 Fares were cut at least 25 percent, and up to 50 percent on some routes, according to airline representatives and Tom Parsons, the founder and chief executive of the fare monitor Bestfares.com. This is the first big sale by major carriers since April, Mr. Parsons said. 
 In the last three months, the airlines have tried four times to raise round-trip leisure fares by $20 but failed each time because at least one carrier refused to match the increase. Now it appears that the airlines have had to resort to the opposite strategy.
"We're getting into the deja vu of the winter," Mr. Parsons said. "The airlines have been trying to raise fares in the last few months. It's failed. Now they're at a point where they're cutting them to stimulate traffic."
The sale applies to nonrefundable 14-day advance purchase tickets and require a Saturday night stay.
The discounts began on Thursday evening, after US Airways announced that it was cutting its prices on round-trip leisure tickets in all its markets, including its international routes. The discounted prices range from $78 for short hops on the East Coast to $896 for flights from Washington to Madrid. Tickets bought online were discounted even more. The other major airlines all matched those fares on routes served by US Airways, whose flights originate mostly on the East Coast.
Yesterday morning, American Airlines, the largest carrier, spread the sale to almost all markets in its system, forcing the other airlines to do the same.
"When American Airlines did it systemwide, we subsequently matched it," said Joe Hopkins, a spokesman for United Airlines.
The fare sale comes at a particularly dark period for the airlines. With the economy still mired in a downturn, passenger traffic has remained depressed, even during the usually lucrative summer months. This week, all the major carriers except Southwest Airlines reported deep losses.
UAL, the parent of United Airlines, the second-largest carrier, said yesterday that it lost $341 million, or $6.08 a share, in the second quarter, more than any other airline and its eighth consecutive net loss. That compares with $365 million, or $6.87 a share, in the period a year earlier. It had a record loss of $2.1 billion last year. 
"The big airlines, they're in terrible trouble here," Mr. Parsons said. "It's not looking good."

HEADLINE: Angst and the Working Mother 

 BODY:
To the Editor:
Re "Study Links Working Mothers to Slower Learning" (news article, July 17):
 This latest study is a clarion call to the United States to join the rest of the world in making it possible for women to spend more time with their babies without sacrificing their economic security. 
The United States is one of only five countries that do not have paid maternity leave (the others are Papua New Guinea, Swaziland, Lesotho and Australia; Australia is expected to enact a paid leave in the near future). 
 As a result, American mothers, particularly poor mothers, have to go back to work much sooner after childbirth than mothers in other countries, leaving more American infants in nonparental care in their first few months than in any other developed country. Are these our real family values, stripped of all the hypocritical rhetoric?
If we care about children and the capabilities of our future work force, if we care about women's economic equality, if we care about lowering the stress on families, we will give every new parent the right to a paid leave.

HEADLINE: Tighter Rules For Options Fall Victim To Lobbying 

BYLINE:  By LESLIE WAYNE 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, July 17 

 BODY:
For all the talk of corporate scandal, one leading proposal for change -- tightening the rules on stock options -- was brushed aside in Congress this week, thanks in part to a powerful business lobbying coalition that has long fought to protect these rich pay packages.
 Long before the current wave of scandals, business interests have successfully protected stock options from attack in Congress. But last September, an umbrella group calling itself the Stock Option Coalition was formed from high-technology companies, executives of Fortune 500 companies, venture capitalists, biotechnology companies and the Nasdaq market -- all sending out platoons of lobbyists, conducting sophisticated e-mail campaigns and reminding Congress of their hefty campaign contributions. 
 The coalition is not the only business group lobbying Congress right now as the final, and most critical, decisions are being made on broad legislation to deal with corporate behavior. But their actions show how lobbying groups are effective not only in what goes into legislation, but what stays out. With both parties in a mood to punish corporate wrongdoers, especially before the midterm elections, this is the last chance for business lobbyists to have a say in the final outcome. 
"We have made it clear to Congress that they should do nothing to restrict stock options," said Richard White, a former Republican lawmaker and chief executive of TechNet, a bipartisan lobbying group representing 235 high-technology and biotechnology companies. "It's been a full-fledged effort for us."
So far, the group has been successful in deflecting popular sentiment and the weight of some powerful financial figures, among them the Federal Reserve chairman, Alan Greenspan, and Warren E. Buffett, the billionaire investor.
In Congressional testimony this week, Mr. Greenspan singled out stock options as one of the "avenues to express greed." He has also said that stock options should be considered a business expense and deducted from corporate revenue.
For the moment, the legislation before Congress to overhaul securities and accounting laws makes no mention of stock options. To those who believe that stock options tempt executives to bend the rules for personal gain, this is a gaping oversight. To members of the lobbying coalition, who believe that the widespread use of stock options enhances entrepreneurship and advances economic growth, it is a victory.
It is also a victory that drives others to distraction. Last Sunday, while being interviewed on "Meet the Press," Senator John McCain, the Arizona Republican who has long advocated limiting stock options, complained loudly that "it's a bipartisan fix that's in." 
He continued, saying, "The swarm of lobbyists that came onto Capitol Hill said this is their highest priority, this is going to destroy Western civilization as we know it."
Senator McCain was not far off the mark in describing the intensity of the lobbying campaign. Leading the parade were two prominent venture capitalists, John Doerr and Floyd Kvamme, two Silicon Valley legends. Joining them were Alan Patricof, a well-known New York venture capitalist, and executives and lobbyists from Cisco Systems, Intel, Dell Computer, AOL Time Warner and Sun Microsystems. In addition, 126 biotechnology chief executives wrote an open letter to Congress on this issue.
These companies are also enlisting rank-and-file employees in a Web-based grass-roots effort, as well.
Using the high-technology skills that made these companies famous, an employee can simply put his or her e-mail address on the TechNet Web site and a "Dear Lawmaker" letter will automatically be sent to Congress in less than a minute. "If my company does well, I hope one day to use my stock options to buy a home or put my children through college," reads the form letter. 
Mark Hesen, president of the National Venture Capital Association in Washington, said: "We have 14,000 emerging growth companies in our database. We've got venture capitalists all over the country who have been active."
To add extra firepower, the group recruited the Business Roundtable, which represents the chief executives of the nation's largest companies, along with Nasdaq -- the stock market of choice for most high-technology companies -- as well as lobbying groups representing corporate financial officers.
For them, hundreds of millions of dollars are at stake -- including millions in the personal net worth of many high-technology executives. For many start-up companies, stock options are a popular way of providing employee compensation -- not only for executives, but for rank-and-file workers as well. With cash flow tight at many emerging companies, stock options -- and the lure of riches yet to come -- are a way to attract top talent.
"For a lot of these chief executives, we are talking about their personal pay," said an aide to a senator who supports the restrictions. "You can be talking about $100 million in stock options for some of these guys. That makes them willing to direct lobbyists to protect their own personal pay."
A recent study by the Standard & Poor's rating agency showed high-technology companies were the biggest users of stock options. The leader was Microsoft with $2.3 billion outstanding followed by Cisco ($1.7 billion), AOL Time Warner ($1.4 billion), I.B.M. ($1.2 billion) and Intel ($1 billion). If forced to deduct stock options as a corporate expense, these companies -- and others -- argue that their profits would automatically fall in an already weak economic environment.
"We started working this issue last fall," said Grace Hinchman, a Washington lobbyist for Financial Executives International, a trade group of chief financial officers. "And we won't go away. We realized what was happening back when. We saw the writing on the wall and figured we had to get organized."
High-technology's effectiveness on this issue reflects a coming of age for an industry that first burst onto the political scene in 1996 -- even then defending option-rich pay packages was one of its major issues.
With a flair for organizing, a cutting-edge image and a bipartisan appeal, high-technology caught the imagination of many in Congress. Having an open wallet and a willingness to write big campaign checks did not hurt, either -- then or now. In the 2000 election, for instance, high-technology companies donated $40 million to both parties, on par with other leading business segments and trade unions.
"The high-tech industry came late, they came in big and they gave so much money in the last election," said Larry Makinson, a senior executive at the Center for Responsive Politics, which tracks campaign contributions. "When you write $40 million worth of checks, you accumulate a lot of i.o.u.'s and can bump ahead of everyone else in line. That is what they are doing."
Of that amount, $20.7 million went to Democrats and $18.5 million to Republicans. For Democrats, Silicon Valley remains one segment of corporate America where they have made successful inroads. While the high-technology bust may have tarnished some of the luster of this group, its political tactics remain as aggressive as ever. 
"This time, they are post-dot-com meltdown," said Patrick McGurn, a vice president at Institutional Shareholder Services, a Washington proxy advisory service. "They still have a lot of money to throw around in Washington, but they do not have the cachet of being the engines of the new economy. So that means they have to rely on lots of arm-twisting and dollars to make the difference this time."
To wage the fight, the group, in a Power Point presentation, asked for $10,000 donations from concerned companies. It called for a "mailstorm from coast to coast and internationally." 
The president of the Information Technology Industry Council, Rhett Dawson, meanwhile, has written to Senator Tom Daschle, the Democratic majority leader, with not-so-veiled hints of the consequences for those opposing the coalition's views. On top of that, Mr. Doerr, the venture capitalist and a leading Democratic donor, also called Mr. Daschle, who helped kill the stock options restrictions in the Senate.
In lobbying Senator Daschle, Mr. Dawson said, "At the end of the 107th Congress, key votes will be compiled and analyzed to assign a 'score' to every Member of Congress." The score, the letter said, will be used in determining who will get the high-technology industry's political support.

HEADLINE: Bush Renews Pledge to Strike First to Counter Terror Threats 

BYLINE:  By DAVID E. SANGER 

DATELINE: FORT DRUM, N.Y., July 19 

 BODY:
President Bush today used a visit to the troops that battled Al Qaeda fighters in Afghanistan to renew his vow that the United States will strike pre-emptively against countries developing weapons of mass destruction, telling 2,000 cheering troops that "America must act against these terrible threats before they're fully formed."
 As Mr. Bush stood surrounded by the camouflage-clad troops of the 10th Mountain Division, among the first sent to Uzbekistan and Afghanistan last fall, one of the soldiers yelled, "Let's get Saddam!" Mr. Bush, dressed in shirt sleeves, just smiled for a moment as a roar of approval raced through the crowd. He did not mention Iraq but hardly stepped in to quell the cheers. 
 Mr. Bush was visibly relieved today to be back in a welcoming military setting after two weeks of questions about his handling of the corporate scandals that have rocked Wall Street and dominated talk in Washington. The country's economic troubles have been Mr. Bush's first major distraction from his intense focus on the effort to curb terrorism. 
The cheers that followed him around this sprawling military base in upstate New York seemed more like the kind of reception he routinely received in the months after the Sept. 11 attacks. He used the moment to rail against the newly created International Criminal Court, a tribunal intended to prosecute perpetrators of war crimes and major human rights violations. 
"The United States cooperates with many other nations to keep the peace, but we will not submit American troops to prosecutors and judges whose jurisdiction we do not accept," Mr. Bush said. 
European nations in particular have been highly critical of Mr. Bush's opinions regarding the court, saying he is trying to put Americans above international law. 
Until today, Mr. Bush had said relatively little about the strategy of pre-emptive action that he first described at a speech in June at West Point. At that time, he made it clear that he envisioned several types of pre-emptive action, from boosting foreign aid to acting covertly against potential enemies to sending in troops. Today, Mr. Bush suggested he would not hesitate to send troops into any country that poses an imminent threat to the United States.
"Some parts of the world, there will be no substitute for direct action by the United States," he told the troops. "That is when we will send you, our military, to win the battles that only you can win."
The White House announced today that Mr. Bush planned to spend roughly four weeks this summer at his ranch in Crawford, Tex., beginning Aug. 6. But a rigorous travel schedule from Texas will take Mr. Bush to many of the states with the most hotly contested House and Senate races around the country.

HEADLINE: G.O.P. LAWMAKERS BOLT BUSH'S HERD 

BYLINE:  By ALISON MITCHELL 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, July 19 

 BODY:
Less than four months before the midterm elections, nervous rank-and-file Republicans are going their own way on issue after issue in Congress, fearful about the economy and no longer counting on President Bush's wartime approval ratings to carry them back into office.
 Some Republicans on Capitol Hill are lurching and improvising. At times, they are defying the White House, at other times staking out far different ground from the president -- and even from each other. All this tumult has spurred Republican leaders to work overtime to try to keep their members in line. 
 "There's a belief of members of Congress, particularly those in tough races, that they have to win these races on their own," said Representative John Thune of South Dakota, who was recruited by President Bush to challenge Senator Tim Johnson, a Democrat, in one of the most competitive races in the country. 
Representative James C. Greenwood of Pennsylvania, one of the first Republicans to recognize that his party had to respond fast to the Enron collapse early this year, said: "We're three and a half months away from election. We know some of these issues are very volatile. The president isn't on the ballot. His popularity, which is sky high, isn't going to carry us anywhere."
As a result, new Republican divisions become evident every day. Individual lawmakers are feeling their own way on potent election-year matters like corporate accountability, access to low-cost drugs, the shape of a Homeland Security Department and spending on regional concerns like fighting forest fires.
"We don't feel we're in our game at the moment," said Representative Christopher Shays of Connecticut.
Only months ago, many Republicans believed that Mr. Bush's extraordinary ratings and the war on terror would help them expand their majority in the House and regain control of the Senate. Now, some say, not only do they not expect Mr. Bush to have coattails, they also worry that some Democratic candidates for governor might.
In what has been a turbulent two weeks, the Republican-run House approved legislation to arm commercial airline pilots, which was opposed by the White House. Senate Republicans sailed far out ahead of the White House in supporting tough penalties for corporate crimes.
House Republican committee chairmen overturned large parts of the president's domestic security legislation, leaving it to a special committee, dominated by Republican and Democratic leaders, to put it back together. The White House also came out against legislation to expand access to low-cost generic drugs this week, after five Republicans voted for the legislation in committee, helping Democrats bring it before the Senate for debate.
Many dynamics are in play. Some lawmakers are fighting to please their constituents by funneling projects back home in an election year and running headlong into the White House's insistence on controlling spending. More senior Republican committee chairmen are resisting giving up Congressional oversight and spending powers in the creation of a vast new domestic security agency.
For many Republicans, too, the overriding concern has been the president's inability to shore up confidence in the stock market -- and their fear of what could happen on Election Day if the economy's problems deepen.
"I worry about it all the time," Representative Mark Foley, Republican of Florida, said of the economy, as he circulated a letter urging Speaker J. Dennis Hastert to accept the Senate version of a corporate accountability bill instead of trying to negotiate differences between the two chambers. "I think people vote with their pocketbooks, and they are not very confident right now."
Republicans worked closely with the president, Mr. Foley said, but "you've got Republicans who want to be part of the agenda not just the president's emissaries on Capitol Hill."
"We do have a view of our own," he said.
Still, it is not unusual for members of the president's party to seek their own way in midterm elections. Moreover, the ferment is far from the kind of rebellion against President Bill Clinton in 1994 when Democrats could not even deliver on their president's signature health care overhaul and barely salvaged an anticrime initiative.
Even as Congressional Republicans chart their own courses, they speak warmly of Mr. Bush. In addition, White House officials and party leaders insist that their members will fall in line on big issues of importance to the president. They predict that next week, the full House will approve a creating a Department of Homeland Security substantially similar to Mr. Bush's proposal. 
"The president has proposed the most substantial reordering of the federal government since the 1940's," said Representative Rob Portman of Ohio, a member of the special homeland security committee. "To have us basically accept his framework is remarkable." 
Ari Fleischer, the White House press secretary, played down any tensions, saying, "There are always going to be occasional issues on which the big tent of the Republican Party goes in different directions."
But citing issues like tax cuts and Republicans' ability to prevail by one vote on trade authority for the president, Mr. Fleischer said, "On the president's top priorities, the Republicans on their worst day are more united than Democrats on their best."
Indeed, many Republicans say Mr. Bush's style of focusing on only a few big issues is part of the reason for some of the disarray on Capitol Hill: there sometimes is no set White House position to rally behind.
Representative Peter T. King, Republican of New York, said: "The White House seems to save pressure and legislative SWAT teams for issues that mean a lot to them. They are not out to impose discipline just to show they are boss."
Yet some Republicans bristle at the administration's operating style. Representative C. W. Bill Young of Florida, the chairman of the Appropriations Committee, said he remembered with envy how closely the budget director in the Clinton administration coordinated with Congressional Democrats.
"When they came to me and my counterpart, they came to me as a united front," Mr. Young said. 
"That kind of a relationship does not exist between me as chairman and the O.M.B. director of this administration," he added. 
The White House dismisses the complaint as an expected tension caused by their desire to hold down spending.
Despite the rank-and-file fears, party leaders insist that their incumbents will do well on Election Day, as long as they tend to local concerns and can point to legislative accomplishments on security.
"Right now, we're headed toward ground war, grass-roots races," said Representative Thomas M. Reynolds, a New York Republican in line to take over his party's House re-election committee next year.
Many Republicans are watching the economy closely. "The economy is really the wild card in every election," Mr. Thune said. "Everybody is very cautious." --------------------

G.O.P. Head Attacks Democrats
By The New York Times
SAN FRANCISCO, July 19 -- The chairman of the National Republican Party accused Senate Democrats today of repeatedly blocking measures pushed by House Republicans to improve corporate governance and the economy, suggesting that Democrats were cheering for an economic downturn because "they feel they can only win is if the economy is disrupted."
"As my grandmother would say: 'Shame on them,' " the Republican chairman, Marc Racicot, told Republicans gathered for the closing session of their summer meeting here.
Mr. Racicot's attack on Democrats who control the Senate indicates that the Republicans gathered here viewed winning back the Senate as their best opportunity in the fall elections. Mr. Racicot said he was confident that the Republicans would retain control of the House; he seemed resigned that the party would lose some races for governor.
To make his case, Mr. Racicot listed measures that had been passed by the Republican-controlled House dealing with prescription drug subsidies, pension reform and tax cuts, only to be blocked in the Senate. In most of the cases he cited, Democrats have pushed through their own versions of the legislation, dismissing the Republican bills as limited measures. The result has been deadlock on Capitol Hill.
Jennifer Palmieri, a spokeswoman for the Democratic National Committee, said the Republicans have a three-part strategy: "One is to ignore the problem, say it doesn't exist. The second play is to blame Clinton. And the third play is to blame Senate Democrats. The evidence just goes in the other direction."

HEADLINE: THE MARKETS: Market Place; 
Adding to Loss Of Investments, A Loss of Faith

BYLINE:  By FLOYD NORRIS 

 BODY:
It is the summer of the bear.
 In the nine weeks beginning a week before Memorial Day, the traditional start of summer, the major United States stock market averages have lost more than 20 percent of their value, one of the fastest falls in Wall Street history. 
 The decline has come amid signs that some Americans are beginning to lose faith in the stock market as a sure-fire long-term investment. Money is flowing out of mutual funds at the fastest rate in years, faster even than last September, in the wake of the terrorist attacks.
Historically -- at least since the end of the Depression -- such rapid declines have come near the end of bear markets and have often been followed by rapid advances. 
Many investors hope that will be the case this time, too, and Wall Street analysts talked of capitulation yesterday -- a term indicating that so many have sold that the bottom must be near. Some even pointed to the rally of more than 50 points in the Dow Jones industrial average in the final seven minutes before the stock market closed yesterday.
Certainly, investors are leaving the market. "Money stopped going into stock funds in May," said Robert Adler, president of AMG Data Services, which monitors cash flows into mutual funds. The redemptions gradually grew, and by the week ended on Wednesday they were running at twice the peak level of last September.
"There has been denial" that prices were falling, said Hugh Johnson, chief investment officer at First Albany. "Traders said they were long-term investors and were not worried." But now, he said, he is hearing from more customers who want to cut their losses by selling stocks.
Mr. Johnson told of one couple who had lost half the $1.8 million they had when they retired and are now considering putting more money into bonds as well as going back to work. They are also cutting back on spending, a decision that if followed by enough consumers could slow the economy. But with most people still holding jobs, that kind of behavior appears largely limited to retirees so far.
This summer has recorded a continuation of the scandals that alarmed, but did not completely depress, investors some months ago. Even before the summer slide began, energy companies were being forced to admit that they had made trades that did nothing except inflate their revenue figures, and the Rigas family, accused of using Adelphia Communications as a piggy bank, had been forced to resign. Bernard J. Ebbers, the founder and chief executive of WorldCom, had been forced to resign, but there had been no indication yet of accounting fraud at that company.
Despite all that, blue-chip stocks stood up reasonably well until May 17. The Dow was at 10,353.08, far above where it was at the start of the year. Public pressure for an overhaul of corporate America appeared to have faded. The House had passed a relatively weak bill, and some lobbyists expected the Senate to deadlock on the issue.
Just what caused share prices to plunge is not clear. But the disclosure by WorldCom late last month that it had improperly accounted for $3.8 billion in expenses may have been significant. The company's stock, and its bonds, had become a favorite of investors who focus on value rather than growth -- a group of investors who had not owned the worst performers before this. But the collapse of WorldCom, which is expected to file for bankruptcy protection soon, has depressed many of those investors.
The WorldCom debacle also renewed public pressure for Congressional action, and the Senate passed a bill last week that is far stronger than anyone thought possible a few weeks earlier. It remains to be seen what will come out of the House-Senate conference committee.
In the nine weeks since May 17, there has been nowhere to hide in the stock market.
The Dow remains the most widely followed stock index, and the relentless declines, often measured in hundreds of points, have taken a toll. 
In the nine-week period, the Dow has shed 2,333 points. That is 22.5 percent of its value, but the psychological significance of the decrease may be greater than that. The decline has wiped out more points than were in the index on Jan. 20, 1989, when the first President Bush was inaugurated.
Of the 30 stocks in the Dow, every one is down, with the best of the group, Microsoft, off 11.5 percent in the nine-week period. Of the stocks in the Standard & Poor's 500, 495 have fallen. The index is off 23.5 percent.
Investors in funds indexed to the S.& P. 500 have also been selling. Because those funds typically carry no cash reserves, such selling can translate immediately into orders to sell all 500 stocks.
In the 1980's and even more so in the 1990's, many investors came to believe that stocks were virtually guaranteed to rise over the long term. Polls show many are still confident. A poll of investors in June, conducted by Northwest Survey and Data Services, found that half expected the market to rise 10 percent a year or more in the next decade. That is down from earlier surveys but is still relatively optimistic.
Such confidence, though, runs head on into the reality that after stunning returns in late 1990's, the market has lost a lot of money for investors who got in late. Many who still believe in a rising stock market apparently have no more money that they are willing to bet on the rise.
The S.& P. is now down 44.5 percent from the peak it set in early 2000. That is approaching the 48.2 percent fall recorded in the 1970's in the most brutal bear market of the postwar period. That bear market, which ended Oct. 3, 1974, came in the midst of a severe recession that was far worse than the minor downturn that is thought to have ended early this year.
The Dow is down 31.6 percent from its peak, while the Nasdaq composite index, which starred on the way up, has lost 73.9 percent of its peak value, with a fall of 24.2 percent over the last nine weeks.
The economic statistics of late have indicated a moderate recovery, and both President Bush and Alan Greenspan, the chairman of the Federal Reserve, have sought to reassure investors about the economy over the last two weeks. But the stock market weakness has inevitably stirred talk of a double-dip recession. 
Comparable falls over nine-week periods have occurred in just four eras since World War II: in 1962, when President John F. Kennedy scared investors as he forced U.S. Steel to back down on a price increase; in 1974, with the nine-week period ending less than a month before that bear market bottomed; 1987, when a crash terrified investors but had little effect on the economy; and last autumn, when share prices plunged after the Sept. 11 attacks.
In each of the first three cases -- 1962, 1974 and 1987 -- there was a solid long-term opportunity to buy stocks. There was also a rally after the market hit bottom last Sept. 21, but those gains have now evaporated.

HEADLINE: The Road to Perdition 

BYLINE:  By FRANK RICH; E-mail: frankrich@nytimes.com

 BODY:
Wagging the dog no longer cuts it. If the Bush administration wants to distract Americans from watching their 401(k)'s go down the toilet, it will have to unleash the whole kennel. 
 Maybe only unilateral annihilation of the entire axis of evil will do. Though the fate of John Walker Lindh was once a national obsession, its resolution couldn't knock Wall Street from the top of the evening news this week. Neither could the president's White House lawn rollout of his homeland security master plan. When John Ashcroft, in full quiver, told Congress that the country was dotted with Al Qaeda sleeper cells "waiting to strike again," he commanded less media attention than Ted Williams's corpse. 
 What riveted Americans instead was the spectacle of numbers tumbling as the president gave two speeches telling us help was on the way. For his first pitch, he appeared against a blue background emblazoned with the repeated legend "Corporate Responsibility." Next came a red backdrop, with "Strengthening Our Economy" as the double-vision-inducing slogan. What will be strike three -- black-and-white stripes and "Dick Cheney Is Not a Crook"? Maybe this rah-rah technique helped boost the numbers back when George W. Bush was head cheerleader in prep school. But he's not at Andover anymore. Where his father's rhetoric gave us a thousand points of light, his lopped a thousand points off the Dow. 
Once the market dissed him, the president waxed philosophical, if not Aristotelian, professing shock that his fellow citizens would care about something as base as money. Invoking Sept. 11, he said, "I believe people have taken a step back and asked, 'What's important in life?' You know, the bottom line and this corporate America stuff, is that important? Or is serving your neighbor, loving your neighbor like you'd like to be loved yourself?" 
Easy for him to say. It's hard to engage in lofty meditation about loving your neighbor if your neighbor is Kenneth Lay or Gary Winnick or Bernard Ebbers or any other insider in "corporate America stuff" who escaped with multimillions just before the corporation cratered, taking your job or pension or both with it. 
Democrats celebrate the Republicans' travails as if it were Christmas in July. But the party's chief, Terry McAuliffe, was a Winnick crony who made his own killing before Global Crossing tanked, and its most visible presidential candidate, Joseph Lieberman, is fighting to the political death for loosey-goosey stock-option accounting. Just as the Harken-Halliburton stories gathered fuel, such tribunes of the people as Tom Daschle, Hillary Rodham Clinton and John Kerry boarded corporate jets supplied by companies like Eli Lilly and BellSouth to rendezvous in Nantucket with their favor-seeking fat cats. 
But the hypocrisies of the Democrats, however sleazy in their own right, do not cancel out the burgeoning questions about this White House. Each time Mr. Bush protests that only a few bad apples ail corporate America, that mutant orchard inches closer to the Rose Garden. If there's not a systemic problem in American business, there does seem to be one in the administration, and it cannot be cordoned off from the rest of its official behavior. Compartmentalization, Republicans of all people should know, went out of style with the Clinton administration. 
In the real world, everything connects. What is most revealing about Mr. Bush's much-touted antidote to the bad apples, his "financial crimes SWAT team," is how closely it mimics Enron's Cayman Island shell subsidiaries. It exists mainly on paper, as a cutely named entity with no real assets. It calls for no new employees or funds and won't even gain new F.B.I. agents to replace those whom the bureau reassigned from white-collar crime to counterterrorism after Sept. 11. 
The SWAT team's main purpose is to bolster the administration's poll numbers as the Enron off-the-books partnerships did its corporate parent's stock price. And like its prototypes, it may already be going south. No sooner did the SWAT team's chief, Deputy Attorney General Larry Thompson, hold his first photo op than The Washington Post revealed that he was an alumnus of yet another bad apple, the credit-card giant Providian. Mr. Thompson had headed the board's audit and compliance committee and escaped with $5 million before the company threw thousands of employees out of work and paid more than $400 million to settle allegations of consumer and securities fraud.
Even the war on terrorism is not immune from Enron-style governance by this administration. Last weekend Jeff Gerth and Don Van Natta reported in The Times that the Halliburton unit KBR got a unique sweetheart deal with the Army last December, despite being a reputed bill-padder and the target of a criminal investigation. Why? Call it the perfect Halliburton-Enron storm. The company grabbing the deal is the former employer of the vice president. The government agency granting the deal, the Army, reports to the former Enron executive Thomas White, who is nothing if not consistent: he doesn't protect taxpayers' dollars any more zealously than he did his former shareholders'.
We still don't know the full extent of our Enron governance because we still don't have a complete list of former Enron employees hired by the Bush administration. (It hardly inspires confidence to know that one of them is its chief economic adviser, Lawrence Lindsey, who also offered such valuable wisdom to Ken Lay.) Nor, of course, do we know the full details of the president's past history at Harken Energy or the vice president's at Halliburton. Those details matter not so much because of any criminality they might reveal -- we are rapidly learning that there is no such thing as a prosecutable corporate crime anyway -- but because of what they may add to our knowledge of the ethics, policies and personnel of a secretive administration to which we've entrusted both our domestic and economic security. 
What we know about Harken so far is largely due to the S.E.C. documents unearthed and posted since 2000 by the enterprising and nonpartisan Center for Public Integrity, also a leader in uncovering the Clinton administration's Lincoln Bedroom scandals. "It's Forrest Gump does finance," says Charles Lewis, the center's founder, in looking at the story line of the remarkable George W. Bush business career. "Every time he seemed to be in trouble, he would end up with a box of chocolates."
The president's self-contradictory defense of his past is to say he was "fully vetted" by the S.E.C. even though he still hasn't "figured it out completely" himself. But the S.E.C. never interviewed Mr. Bush during its investigation. The agency was then run by an appointee of his father, Richard Breeden, who recused himself from the case. Last Sunday, Mr. Breeden turned up on Fox News as a George W. defender. Yet when Tony Snow asked him twice if he could give the president "a clean bill of health, yes or no," Mr. Breeden pleaded ignorance and ducked. Perhaps that's why the White House has not asked the S.E.C. to release its Harken papers, even though Harvey Pitt last weekend said he would if it did. The president has also told the press that "you need to look back on the director's minutes" to answer questions about Harken -- and then refused to provide those minutes or to instruct Harken to release them either. But yesterday Mr. Lewis's organization posted a pile of them at www.publicintegrity.org, and says that more documents are yet to come.
What is the president hiding? Clearly the story here is not merely a hard-to-prove case of insider trading, tardy stock-sale forms and Mr. Bush's knowledge of the sham transaction involving Aloha Petroleum. Most likely it also involves the mystery first raised by The Wall Street Journal and Time in 1991. Back then, their investigative journalists tried to break the cronyism code by which tiny Harken, which had never drilled a well overseas, miraculously beat out the giant Amoco for a prized contract for drilling in Bahrain. They also tried to learn what various Saudi money men, some tied to the terrorist-sponsoring Bank of Credit and Commerce International, may have had to do with Harken while the then-president's son was in proximity.
These questions, like the companion questions about Halliburton's dealings with Iraq on Mr. Cheney's watch, are not ancient history but will gain in relevance in direct proportion to the expansion of the war on terrorism and the decline of the Dow. Sooner or later George W. Bush will have to answer them, because even though he cares more about loving his neighbors than the bottom line, the rest of us are just irredeemably crass.

HEADLINE: National Briefing South: Arkansas: Clinton Library Seeks Tax Breaks 

BYLINE:  By Stephanie Strom (NYT) 

 BODY:
 The nonprofit foundation supporting the development of Bill Clinton's presidential library has sued the State of Arkansas, accusing the state of withholding tax benefits that it gives to for-profit businesses. 
The foundation contends that the $200 million Clinton library complex will generate jobs and tourism that will add $10.7 million a year to the Arkansas economy. It is seeking $3.6 million in tax credits and rebates under a program created when Mr. Clinton was governor to retain business and attract investment. Jim Pickens, the official who heads the program, said the state did not believe that nonprofit organizations were eligible. Stephanie Strom (NYT)

HEADLINE: She Walks Through Walls 

BYLINE:  By Dennis Cass; Dennis Cass is a writer living in Minneapolis.

 BODY:
Every day at 3:30 a.m., Mary Jo Copeland gets up and goes to church. St. Alphonsus in Brooklyn Center, Minn., isn't open, but Copeland has a key, and she lets herself in, lights a candle and begins her daily two-and-a-half-hour prayer regimen. She prays to the Virgin Mary, does the Stations of the Cross and power-walks around the abbey as she says the rosary. When she turns to the Liturgy of the Hours, Copeland adds the Office of Readings because she's too busy to recite it at midday. "It's a very special grace I've been given," she says. "I wake up running to God." 
 Copeland is the founder and director of Sharing and Caring Hands, a charity she runs with her husband, Dick, in downtown Minneapolis. Sharing and Caring Hands helps the homeless and the working poor, but Copeland has larger ambitions, and for the past two and a half years she has been trying to find a place for Gift of Mary Children's Home, a 200-bed facility named in honor of the Virgin Mary. Copeland says there is an "unbelievable need" going unmet by our nation's child-welfare agencies, and last month the City Council of Eagan, Minn., a St. Paul suburb, agreed by approving Copeland's proposal. Copeland's quest had caused Nimby jitters in several communities, angered the foster-care establishment and sharply divided public opinion, but throughout it all she demonstrated an unshakable faith in the righteousness of her cause. The night a third Minnesota community turned her down, she told the City Council: "This will be built whether it's here or somewhere else. I know it, and God knows it. Amen." 
 She was right, as it turned out -- though whether it was because of her zealotry or her record of service, it's hard to say. Her mission at Sharing and Caring Hands is to fill the gaps in services offered by other charities and government agencies. One of her favorite catch phrases is "Mary said yes"; if she hadn't, then Jesus wouldn't have been born. Sharing and Caring Hands has a free dental and medical clinic, showers, a food-and-clothing bank and a large dining room that serves up to 1,000 meals a day. It provides cash for anything from bus tickets to funeral expenses, as well as vouchers for eyeglasses and mattresses. There is an entire room stocked with free sneakers. Across the street there is a youth and day-care center as well as Mary's Place, a 92-unit transitional-housing facility that is more like a business hotel than a homeless shelter. 
Copeland works her ministry with an energy that is exhausting to watch. "She moves through walls," says Mark Schindeldecker, a retired postal worker who runs Sharing and Caring Hands's food-service division. At first, I think he's being mystical, but take your eyes off Copeland for one minute and she will literally vanish. While trying to keep up with her on her morning rounds, I watch as she helps a crew of recovering alcoholics unload donations, settles a dispute over boxes of free cereal and inspects care packages heading over to Mary's Place before declaring, "More soup." After organizing the food bank, Copeland picks up a blue Dine-a-Wipe food-service rag and soaks it with water. Very particular about cleanliness, Copeland will carry the rag around for the entire day, mopping up spills and wiping down counters. Dick says that his wife runs Sharing and Caring Hands the way she ran their family of 12 children. She has never taken a sick day. "If she felt sick," he says, "she'd throw up and keep working."
I visit Copeland at Sharing and Caring Hands late one afternoon. Her office is a warehouse of recognition. The walls are covered with gold plaques and Native American dream catchers; the side tables are thick with Lucite service awards. Copeland dislikes formality, and rather than sit behind her desk she pulls up a chair next to mine. 
She sits with her head slightly bowed, ankles crossed, her hands folded loosely in her lap, but despite her passive air Copeland has a powerful, charismatic personality, and before she'll answer any questions, she first wants to tell me the Mary Jo story in its entirety. Copeland makes good use of her past. At most public meetings, she will tell a version of her story, and like an actor at the end of a long run who speaks her lines as if they were her own, Copeland makes it sound fresh every time. 
Born Mary Jo Holtby, Copeland spent her first six years with her affluent grandparents, who, according to Dick, "kept her like a china doll." When her brother, John, was born, Mary Jo moved back in with her mother, a hairdresser, and her father, a Korean War veteran, who Copeland says beat her mother and verbally abused little Mary Jo. Their house was filthy, she says, and her mother would go to the bingo hall and play for food. Traumatized, Mary Jo would sit huddled next to a statuette of the Virgin Mary. She says that sometimes she slept in her own urine, that she was unpopular with other kids and that she got bad grades, but thanks to the nuns at her elementary school, she found salvation in prayer. 
Copeland recalls the feeling of saying the Baltimore Catechism as "almost like breathing oxygen." At a very young age she realized she wanted to be a nun. "I'll be a saint," she remembers saying to herself. "I'll please God." But then, as a high-school sophomore, she met Dick Copeland at a sock hop. Despite both of their parents' disapproval, they married shortly after Mary Jo graduated. Dick worked as a buyer for a grocery chain; Mary Jo raised their 12 children -- 6 boys and 6 girls. By the time her youngest was school age, Copeland started volunteering at Catholic Charities, which today she publicly takes to task for miring her in "paperwork" and "bureaucracy" to the point where she felt compelled to hand out food and clothes from the trunk of her car. Then in 1985, she received a $2,200 grant from a local television station, and Sharing and Caring Hands was born. 
The Copelands have built Sharing and Caring Hands from a storefront operation into an elaborate web of social services. Since its inception, Sharing and Caring has brought in nearly $50 million in donations, largely from small individual donors, but also from companies like the Target Corporation. Other than 14 paid staff members (Dick draws a salary; Mary Jo does not), Sharing and Caring Hands is run entirely by volunteers, and the organization has never taken any state, federal or even United Way financing.
Sharing and Caring also runs on prayer. Every day, Copeland leads group and individual prayers to God and the Virgin Mary, and she prays with every family she admits into Mary's Place. During my first visit, I watch Copeland gather up an incoming family -- a ghostly man, a sobbing woman and their three children walleyed with confusion. She hugs the children, calms down the woman, explains the rules of Mary's Place, then asks them all to join hands in prayer. Afterward, when one of her assistants appears, Copeland says, "You get them a cross; I'll get them some money." 
This mixture of faith and entrepreneurial spirit has made her a favorite among powerful men. Representative Jim Ramstad of Minnesota calls her "America's Mother Teresa." Tom Lowe, the chairman of Lyman Lumber, publicly pledged $1 million to Gift of Mary, not because he believes in the idea of orphanages, but because he believes in Mary Jo. "Good work will be done," he says. During his campaign, George W. Bush visited Sharing and Caring Hands, where he prayed with Copeland. At the Republican National Convention, Bush used her ministry as an example of the kind of work he claims government can't do. In February 2001, Copeland spoke at the president's first National Prayer Breakfast. After Bush's campaign stop, a reporter asked Copeland if she was going to vote for him, but she played it coy. Even though she welcomes the president's support, she has never publicly endorsed a candidate. "I don't want anybody to use me as a political backdrop," she says.
Copeland has her detractors. Charities are typically built around causes, not personalities, and some advocates are put off by how much attention Copeland gets. Sharing and Caring has also drawn fire for not adequately documenting all the cash it dispenses. Harsher critics say that Copeland's stopgap approach perpetuates poverty by meeting short-term needs but ignoring systemic problems, while others point to the arbitrary intake policy at Mary's Place, which in fact is no policy at all. (Copeland uses what she calls her "discernment," which for single men often means no admission.) 
But the criticisms never stick. This, in large part, has to do with feet.
Every day, twice a day, Copeland washes the feet of the homeless. After doing intake for the shelter, she heads back into the main room, where seven men are soaking their feet in plastic tubs. Copeland puts on latex gloves, gets down on a floral-print garden kneeler and starts ministering to Tom Lynch. Standing at Copeland's side is a volunteer named Little John, who squirts hydrocortisone cream into the palm of her hand. Lynch, who is shaking, has been coming to Sharing and Caring Hands since the late 80's, and Copeland has seen both man and feet go through their ups and downs. Copeland rubs Lynch's calluses, massages his ankles and carefully works the ointment between his toes. 
Doing feet has become Copeland's trademark, an evergreen story in the local press, and I come to the moment wary of theater. But for an act this physically and spiritually loaded, I find it surprisingly mundane, like the warm, distant care you find in a good hospital. Copeland attends to each man in turn, sometimes taking off her gloves to clip toenails, listening to complaints, sharing in gossip. "I need a job like a dead man needs a casket," one man says. Another man's sneakers are shot, so Copeland calls out to Dick to bring him a fresh pair. "Better make it an 11," she hollers, then turns to the man and says, as matter-of-factly as if they were at Foot Locker, "They run a little small." 
As Copeland tries to find a place to build her orphanage, she invites me to her first meeting with Pat Awada, the mayor of Eagan, and Peggy Carlson, a councilwoman. Copeland needs to raise $30 million to build Gift of Mary, and an additional $30 million for the endowment. In the current economic climate, when all charities are suffering, it will be no easy task. Yet she pitches Gift of Mary with complete confidence. "Don't think about the money," she tells them, when the issue of financing comes up. "The money is the least of our worries. Sixty million dollars. What is that? It's nothing. Money is paper."
She then tells a story about Target's C.E.O., Bob Ulrich. While watching Copeland do feet, Ulrich asked what he could do. She asked him for $3 million for Sharing and Caring Hands. Ulrich said he couldn't give $3 million, but he'd give her $1 million. When Target recently offered $1.5 million to help with Gift of Mary, Copeland told Ulrich that Target would not get its name on the children's home. "You can't ever put Target in front of the Blessed Mother," she told him. "I appreciate the attorneys, but I run the show." 
In her more politic moments, Copeland calls Gift of Mary a "children's home" but she is also unashamed of the Dickensian imagery the word "orphanage" evokes. (In fact, the true orphan is more the stuff of fiction than history. Even late-19th-century orphanages weren't filled exclusively with children who had lost both parents; many were children whose parents or families, for whatever reason, could not fulfill their responsibilities.) While Copeland shows compassion for the chronically homeless and the working poor, she can be unsparing in her judgment of them as parents. The foster-care system has strict laws about terminating parental rights -- extreme poverty, mental illness or even drug addiction aren't necessarily enough -- but Copeland says that some of the kids who live at Mary's Place belong in a children's home simply because their moms and dads are unfit. "They are orphans," she says. "They don't have parents. Bottom line."
Copeland is not alone in wanting to find alternatives to foster care. In the past four years, residential academies, which serve academically motivated but impoverished or neglected teenagers, have opened in Washington, D.C., Minnesota, Maryland and California, with 12 more in the works across the country. Like charter schools, residential academies bill themselves as private alternatives to a failing public trust, in this case, foster care. Overwhelmed by the 80's crack epidemic, the system has not fully recovered. There are now 588,000 children in foster care, more than double the number in 1985, and despite recent reforms there are still issues of children bouncing from foster home to foster home before "aging out." In many states, courts appoint special advocates to ensure that children's rights are being protected. 
Copeland's vision for Gift of Mary is motivated by personal experience rather than by public policy research. The facility will have a K-12 private school, a community center and ball fields, but Copeland is less interested in education than in providing safety, structure and love -- and teaching the power of prayer. Children will live in one of 20 group homes, each managed by a specially trained married couple and their live-in assistant. The most controversial aspect of her plan -- and the one that most strongly differentiates her facility from residential academies -- is that Gift of Mary will house children as young as 4. And while foster care strives to place children in families, Copeland envisions providing long-term care. Ostensibly a child could spend her entire childhood at Gift of Mary.
Copeland's opponents say that children under 8 don't fare well in either institutional settings or long-term care. Yet despite resistance from county child-protective-service workers, negative editorials in the local press and opposition from groups like the North American Council on Adoptable Children, the Minnesota chapter of the Children's Defense Fund and the Child Welfare League of America, Copeland says it is her critics who are out of touch with the true need. "Either they don't want to understand it," she says, "or they can't." Copeland even expresses sympathy for the opposition, once telling me that she prays for them. "Faith is a gift," she says. "Many people don't want it."
"I don't know if you've noticed it yet, but she has a huge ego," says Tom Lowe, to date the largest private Gift of Mary donor. During a public meeting on whether one Minnesota community, Chaska, would allow the orphanage, 75 mostly middle- to upper-middle-class landowners expressed their concern about property values, road assessments and the safety of their children. Instead of reassuring them, Copeland tried to bowl them over with faith. "This is the community God wants it in," she said. At one point, when a woman asked Copeland to hear her out, Copeland grew short. "I can't listen to you," she said. "I have to listen to God."
When I ask Copeland why she isn't more diplomatic, she says: "I don't mean to sound presumptuous, but I never really was a part of this world. I belonged to God. Belonging to the world didn't mean anything to me." I ask her if she has visions or conversations with God, but she waves me off. For Copeland, everything comes down to good works. "When I think about God in my life, I want to be a saint," she says, adding, "It's not time that makes a saint; it's how you live."
In his 1949 essay "Reflections on Gandhi," George Orwell said that "saints should always be judged guilty until they are proved innocent." Copeland can be infuriating, but other than occasional indulgences like her white Lincoln (the vanity plates read PRAYNOW), it seems that Copeland gives back far more than she takes. 
One Thursday evening, I follow her over to Mary's Place to witness a weekly ritual her husband teasingly calls "The Mary Jo Show." Copeland slumps with fatigue on the way over, but when she enters the rotunda at Mary's Place she snaps into song: "If you're happy and you know it, clap your hands." There are about 200 mostly African-American kids sitting on the spotless linoleum floor. Red paper hearts and sparkly snowflakes hang from the ceiling. Parents and teenagers sit on the fringe, a scant few joining in the fun. "If you're happy and you know it, praise the Lord," Copeland sings. "Praise the Lord!" a chorus of kids shouts back.
"This place is a gift," Copeland says for the benefit of the new families there. She reminds them that they don't have to pay for rent or lights or food, that this is an opportunity to "rest the spirit." She says there are rules, and consequences if the rules are broken. "I'll start doing room checks, and then what will happen?" she asks. Some of the kids who have been here for a while smile in anticipation. "Smackdown!" Copeland hollers, and the kids start to laugh. Copeland then gets serious and tells them that if they cooperate, Mary's Place can work wonders. "The kids never want to leave," she says. "I don't want you to leave, either. Because I love you."
Then Copeland asks the kids whom they prayed for this week. Almost every child says Mary Jo, and each time Copeland gets a prayer she acts a little silly. "I've got so many prayers I think I'm going to fall on the floor," she says, stiffening up and walking like a zombie. When Colin, a volunteer at Mary's Place, gets a few prayers, Copeland teases him that she has more. The final tally: Mary Jo, 15; Colin, 3. Jesus gets 1.
Later, the children line up for Mary Jo. A silver boom box plays "He's Got the Whole World in His Hands." A volunteer stands at Copeland's side holding a brick of dollar bills thicker than a phone book. Copeland gives each child a hug, chats briefly, then dispenses $2. One little girl is so excited to touch Mary Jo that she looks as if she is about to burst. In fact, many of the kids seem less interested in the cash than in the hug. Copeland is ecstatic, and despite the strange assembly-line setup, she seems to take joy in each child. It's one of her most powerful gifts, an ability to make you feel as if you are the center of her universe, and even though the moment is theatrical, it doesn't feel like an act.
The Copelands were optimistic going into the approval process in Eagan thanks in part to the open support of the mayor. On the night of the final vote, the speakers in support of Copeland included Sharing and Caring volunteers; Joe Senser, a former Minnesota Vikings tight end, who is an alumnus of the Milton Hershey School, a Pennsylvania orphanage; and a woman who said she flew in from Seattle to urge the council to vote yes. During the public testimony, Copeland mouthed the rosary. The opposition was equally present. Foster-care experts testified that Copeland's proposal was a "solution looking for a problem." It was a tense night. When one resident said that people move to Eagan to be away from the inner city, a woman shouted, "Racist pig!" Later, an African-American activist called Gift of Mary a "plantation." At the end of the public testimony, Copeland delivered her rebuttal. She dismissed the foster-care experts by saying she had worked with children for 20 years. "If anyone knows what a child needs, it's Mary Jo Copeland." As for the racial issue, Copeland said, "God does not know color; he does not know culture; he made souls."
Then her voice started to tremble. "I prayed really hard last night," Copeland said, bowing her head. Her hands were clasped in front of her, and suddenly she sounded like a little girl. "I prayed the rosary all night. Mary will hear us. Mary, please say yes."
After Copeland sat down, the council members held a brief discussion before explaining their thinking behind how they intended to vote. With the exception of one councilwoman, Meg Tilley, the numbers were in Copeland's favor. Mayor Awada went last, and when she said offhandedly that the proposal would pass, Copeland grew emotional. "Don't cry, Mary Jo," one council member said, pouting at Copeland.
"Please don't cry," Awada said. 
Copeland stood up and moved toward the dais as if she were rushing up to give her acceptance speech before receiving the award. She was on the verge of tears, but this time it was more joyous than strategic. She thanked God for hearing her prayers and said that everyone in Eagan will be blessed. She said this truly was the night the Lord had made. But then she pulled back. 
"God bless all of you," she said. "Even you, Meg. I still like you." The audience laughed; the tension evaporated. Up on the dais, Copeland's supporters on the City Council tried not to look too amused. Meanwhile, Tilley smiled a wry smile, then put her hands together and slowly, begrudgingly, applauded Mary Jo Copeland for an irresistible performance.

 The Sit-Down Comic
6:28 p.m. (32 minutes to game time)
Rich Eisen, ESPN "SportsCenter" anchor and ESPN2 play-by-play novitiate, looks out at some of the 12,402 San Diego Padres fans settling into their seats on an unseasonably cool May evening and informs Chili Davis, his partner in the booth: "The crowd is gathering. The crowd is congealing. The crowd is coagulating."
 Davis, a 19-year major-league veteran with a shaved head and a World Series ring, is too nervous to do anything more than spit a sluice of smokeless tobacco into an empty water bottle. 

6:42 p.m. (18 minutes to game time): The heroic P.A. system pumps out a sublimely dinky five-note disco intro from 1980. Eisen turns to his partner again and says, "Chili, I believe we're about to get taken to Funkytown."

6:48 p.m. (12 minutes): Eisen to Davis: "Is this Qualcomm Field or Qualcomm Stadium?"
"Stadium," Davis says. 

6:59 p.m.: Eisen to Davis: "We are two handsome men."
The 33-year-old Eisen, whose plump, reddish cheeks and audacious self-confidence recall a young Orson Welles, is a sports announcer for the new millennium. Al Michaels, the suave dean of network play-by-play men, called 200 college games at Arizona State University and another couple hundred high-school, college and minor-league baseball and football games in Hawaii before returning to the mainland to call his first major-league game for the Cincinnati Reds. Tonight is Eisen's seventh baseball game at any level, and beyond the relevant snippets from the six years of footage that have passed before his eyes at ESPN headquarters in Bristol, Conn., Eisen has no expertise about either team. He didn't even know he would be doing this game until yesterday morning. Yet, with minutes to go, he is still calmly fielding calls on his cellphone.
Our most revered play-by-play men have traditionally been pathologically precocious sports prodigies so determined to glom onto any fragment of athletic action, they turned their childhoods into announcing apprenticeships. By 5, Michaels was turning down the sound on his parents' TV and supplying his own calls and as a kid began lugging a tape recorder into the upper reaches of Ebbets Field to make his first demos. 
If you've ever wondered why so many play-by-play announcers sound like children impersonating adults, it's because as kids they spent years sitting on their beds talking into a microphone straining to sound 20 years older. Keith Olbermann sent his first audition tape off to the Pittsburgh Penguins when he was 14. In eighth grade, Marv Albert ran an imaginary radio station "complete with commercials, interviews, sports updates and game coverage," according to his memoir "I'd Love to, But I Have a Game: 27 Years Without a Life." As a teenager, he had a regular gig on Howard Cosell's radio show, and Olbermann was the first caller when Albert later got his own show, precious airtime passed down like a torch from generation to generation of sports geek. 
Eisen, on the other hand, was well past his teens before he saw the inside of a broadcast booth. He earned his live-performing chops doing three years of stand-up as an undergraduate at the University of Michigan. Starting as a freshman, he wrote new material every six weeks and took it to an Ann Arbor comedy club. He seriously considered pursuing it as a career, but he gave up after less than two weeks on the road when he performed to an audience of three for 10 bucks and a cheeseburger. Because he now works for Disney, Eisen was unwilling to rummage too deeply into his old joke bag, though he did reveal that his signature bit, the one he claims never failed to bring down the house, was reading Penthouse letters in the depraved, biting cadences of Howard Cosell.
Eisen's skills, it turned out, were in demand, because by the time he got to ESPN, the highlight show had become a highly refined form of male comedy. The television writer Aaron Sorkin, creator of "The West Wing," has called "SportsCenter" one of the funniest and best-written shows on the air. So although Eisen's audience got a lot bigger when he got to ESPN, he was still doing what for him had become a very familiar ritual: telling jokes to frat brothers.
The thrill this night at Qualcomm is certainly not based on the matchup between the Montreal Expos and the San Diego Padres, or his considerable affection for the game of baseball, or even about sports at all. Rather, it is the daunting challenge of pulling off three hours of live television with little more than quick wits and a couple of media guides.
In a subdued, windswept stadium, the game congeals and coagulates into a lethargic pitchers' duel. But Eisen keeps things percolating, briskly calling the action, loosening up Davis, staying in the moment, enjoying himself.
Davis had a substantial career, hitting 350 home runs, and looks sharp in a broad-shouldered suit. But in the booth, Eisen is the stud and Davis, despite a sly, melancholy wit, is the bullet-sweating neophyte. Eisen loosens him up like a first date, and Davis rewards him with a charming story about facing a young hard-throwing Expos pitcher named Floyd Youmans. "It was a day game after a night game," Davis says, "and I swear I could hear the ball hiss as it flew by." 
"Day game after a night game," Eisen says, staying right with him, his voice full of mocking suspicion. "I guess the Quebec nightlife beckoned." 
Earlier, Eisen told me: "You watch a game at home, a guy steps out of the box, scratches himself, stares at the sign, spits, scratches himself again. You nod off on the couch. But if it's your job to move things along, it's actually an amazingly fast-paced game. A three-hour game feels like 10 minutes. You blink and it's over."
This one doesn't feel like 10 minutes. Going into the eighth inning, the game is tied at 1 and, after both sides botch scoring chances, crawls into extra innings. Exhausted by the tension of doing only his second game, Davis fades badly, confiding in me, "I never liked extra-inning games even when I was a player, unless I was like 4 for 5 or something." 
But even as groans go up all around the booth every time yet another rally fizzles, Eisen displays the indefatigable zip of an Avon Lady. "We go to 11!" he says, as if it were cause for celebration. "Ten was insufficient!" 
Like any employee, there are all kinds of things a sports announcer must feign -- authority, sincerity, bonhomie -- and Eisen aces all three. But what makes his future limitless is that even at nearly 1 o'clock in the morning, with a bladder about to burst and the most compelling action the hot-dog wrappers swirling in the wind, he can still muster that little pinch-me-I-must-be-dreaming-but-I-actually-get-paid-to-do-this catch in his throat.
As the innings pile on, Eisen's verbal facility becomes farcical. Nothing the director in the truck outside puts on the screen gives him an instant's pause, and when he follows his tongue into what seems like a certain trap, he pulls off an escape worthy of Spiderman. The camera goes tight on the bat rack and Eisen promises, "As long as there are bats in the rack, we'll show you the action." The camera sweeps over the thinning crowd and alights on a comatose blond woman and her fleshy-faced companion, and Eisen salutes "Shelley Long and Depardieu." When a Montreal catcher makes no attempt to throw out a runner stealing second, Eisen calls him "the personification of catcher indifference." The game mercifully ends, after a second seventh-inning stretch, in the 14th.
No one would be watching this game on national television between two teams to which they have no allegiance if there were anything better to do or the hotel had porn. But sometimes you don't, and sometimes it doesn't. On those nights, all you're hoping for is to be transported from one moment to the next as painlessly as possible until, like the cavalry, blessed unconsciousness arrives. 
Televised sports is a vast repository of male loneliness. For four hours and 14 innings on a Wednesday night in May, Eisen did everything he could to help. He was a bright, buoyant, amusing voice in the room. He was real good company. 

The Primordial Pun
Like many revolutions, it started in the hours before dawn with a single man trapped in an underventilated room, surrendering to the wanton urges of his febrile brain. It was the spring of 1980, the room an ESPN studio in Bristol, and the urges belonged to Chris Berman, a lumpy 24-year-old son of the suburbs, hired the previous fall because this start-up 24-hour sports channel was looking "for a couple guys who could speak in complete sentences and wouldn't embarrass them."
Twenty-two years later, Berman can't pin it down it exactly, but at about 3:15 a.m., while plowing through that evening's baseball highlights, either "Frank Tanana Daiquiri" or "John Mayberry R.F.D." plopped out of his mouth. After these words, whichever ones they were, had gone out over the airwaves, Berman shuddered and thought, "Oh, my God, what have I done?" 
Berman knew that anyone watching ESPN at 3:15 a.m. in 1980 was, to put it charitably, a highly committed sports fan, and by augmenting those names in such a punch-drunk way, Berman was revealing himself to be just as far gone. Instead of another talking hairdo dumping scores into the void, he was a junkie communing with fellow addicts. He was sowing the first seeds of a new community. 
The charm of Berman's early-morning indiscretion was that it conceded the point that there was something absurd and even a wee bit pathetic about earning a living sitting in an empty room at that hour in Bristol, Conn., reading scores into a lens, not to mention sitting alone in some other room in some other town ingesting them. And while Berman was at it, he was also acknowledging that there was something absurd and pathetic in having such an exaggerated interest in the outcome of this endless succession of essentially identical encounters and of the people who participate in them or, in other words, in being a man. But rather than alienating his audience, it forged a bond. It was like bumping into an acquaintance in the waiting room of your college mental-health center, and from that shared nadir being pals for life. Now instead of being just another lonely guy watching a highlight show at 3 in the morning, you were part of a nervy underground of like-minded and wittily self-disparaging, self-aware lonely guys watching a highlight show at 3 in the morning. 
And as was obvious to Disney when it bought ESPN in 1995 and to anyone who has been to Bristol and has seen the Pentagonian girth of its headquarters, hard-core sports fans are not a fringe cult. With the odd allowance for extreme mathematical or artistic ability and eccentric parenting, they include pretty much every heterosexual male in America. 
When I asked Keith Olbermann why, despite the mind-numbing monotony, he kept returning to sports, he said, "It's my first language." It's true for all of us. Sports is the first thing we were good or bad at, the first event we watched rapt, the first thing we ever read we didn't have to. Our first strongly held opinions were about players or teams, and the way in which they differed from those of our friends were among our earliest intimations of a self. 
It took programmers 30 years to appreciate how thoroughly our brains have been pickled in the brine. Through the 60's, TV sports was limited to the weekend, and when in the early 70's it slipped over to Monday night, it was such a national thrill that ABC has spent the last 32 years trying to recapture it, mistakenly believing it was all about the magic of Cosell, Don Meredith and Frank Gifford. 
Now sporting events, and the vast array of TV programming that is derived from them, are transmitted every second. Shows like "Pardon the Interruption," "The Best Damn Sports Show Period" and "The Last Word with Jim Rome" are ubiquitous. And the reason they find an audience is that we still have stronger opinions about sports than anything else, we still read the sports page more closely than any other part of the paper and it's still the only thing the average American man comes close to caring about with any regularity. 
And with the floor of the world falling out from under us, it's comforting to turn on a show that uses the one language in which we're fluent, that never makes us feel ignorant, apathetic and disconnected. Plus it's heartwarming listening to people who actually care enough about something to get exercised, even if it's whether Shaq is better than Kobe or whether or not Pete Rose belongs in the Hall of Fame. 
For this community, sports is, more than it has ever been, a refuge from the real world. When I asked Eisen if he could imagine a major sports broadcaster today taking a stand as heroically unpopular as Cosell's support of Muhammad Ali, he said: "The days of the heavyweight champion as civil rights leader are long gone. You think you'd see Ali rolling around on the floor of an ESPN Zone? I don't think so. The days of a tennis champion as a gender rights leader are over. Anybody expecting that now will be sadly disappointed." 
As televised sports withdraws from the world, it gets more and more masculine, which is reflected and expressed by its top announcers. The 66-year-old John Madden, having quickly found that the company of his wife and children was "overrated," has spent much of the last 21 years cruising the country without them on a customized bus. Sixty-year-old Tim McCarver lives alone on the beach on the Gulf of Mexico. 
There has been, in recent years, a surge in women's sports, even in formerly all-male preserves like soccer and basketball, and many of these games, professional and college, are shown on cable television. But the overwhelming bulk of TV sports, particularly the highlight shows, the talk shows and the call-in shows, are stag parties. Watching "The Best Damn Sports Show Period," in which the host, Tom Arnold, gabs mindlessly with a circle of marginally famous pals, feels like sitting in a booth at a topless club, with the dancers just offscreen. 
"SportsCenter" may be brought to you by Disney, but tuning into ESPN's highlight centerpiece late on a Sunday night, with the footage flashing and the acid-house beats throbbing underneath, the only pause in the frenzy the raucous, strategically blacked out 90-second commercials for the latest "Girls Gone Wild" video, is to all but taste the sweaty male residue of a long, hot weekend.
Near the end of the N.B.A. regular season, in the midst of "SportsCenter," there was video of Dallas Mavericks guard Steve Nash letting go a 48-foot shot just before halftime of an inconsequential game. As the ball fell through the twine, the "SportsCenter" anchor Dan Patrick emitted the gut-shot squeal, "nothing but net!" that was both stirring and self-mocking, and all over the country thousands of guys chuckled and sighed and shook their heads and thrilled to it together. 

Living Extra-Large
Of all our major sports announcers, John Madden best understands his job is less about providing expert analysis than it is about creating a comfy, all-male clubhouse of the air. That his membership policy is lax enough to include the widest swath of male humanity, and yet exclusive enough to have a dollop of aspirational cachet, is why he earns four times his nearest rival in the booth (including endorsements for companies like Ace Hardware and Outback Steakhouse).
When I go to talk with him, it's not in the den of his suburban home in Pleasanton, Calif., but in a sprawling office, with the requisite retro pinball machine in one corner, in an anonymous corporate park. With his real-estate and film-production companies and the millions rolling in every year from his partnership in "EA Sports Madden NFL," the most popular sports video game ever, Madden is an empire unto himself, and at least as big a cultural icon as Howard Cosell, whose old spot Madden is filling on "Monday Night Football" in the fall. 
Madden, who became head coach of the Oakland Raiders at 33 and retired from the team at 43 with the best winning percentage in N.F.L. history, is a genius masquerading as a meathead. From his perch in the back of the booth, Madden can see what all 22 players are doing on every play, and he has an ex-teacher's ability to make sense of the mayhem. But his far more crucial TV talent is as a populist. When it comes to making the average citizen feel a little better about himself, he's as good as Oprah. Somehow in the course of a football game, Madden lets you know it's O.K. to be fat, even borderline obese, no big deal to be ugly, bearable to be lonely. Madden's every unslick flailing gesture and blurted syllable is a source of comfort to the unsexy, unripped, underpaid and underappreciated lonely American man.
Madden's virtual club is the fraternity of the American big guy, and both "big" and "guy" are important. For Madden the word "guy" is the cornerstone of his worldview and saturated with affection and respect. "Football," says Madden, "is 22 guys, 11 guys on offense and 11 guys on defense," his ex-players are "my guys" and when I ask him if he sees himself as a journalist, he succinctly disabuses me. "No," he says. "I'm just a football guy."
Madden's overriding thesis is that football (and perhaps also heaven) is about big guys shoving around other big guys. Games aren't won and lost by the attention-seeking pyrotechnics of neurotic quarterbacks, running backs, receivers and other former high-school homecoming kings, but by the grunt labor of the less conspicuously talented everymen in the middle.
For 21 years, Madden, an all-conference lineman in college who suffered a career-ending injury before playing a down of pro ball, has been educating football fans about the value and charms of these unpretty behemoths who never get the girls, the publicity or the money. "The only time they ever used to mention offensive linemen was when they got holding penalties," he says. "But I always knew that if they didn't do their job everything else offensively was academic. And that's not just some theory. That's what the deal is. And if you believe that's true, why keep it a secret?" 
Madden hung just as tough on this point when in 1982 a young stranger named Trip Hawkins petitioned him in a parking lot about a possible computer football game, and Madden decided that anyone who could persuade Harvard to let them major in games was worth hearing out. (Actually, it was "game theory," but close enough.) "The first thing I said was, 'O.K., if we're going to have a game, we have to have all 22 players -- you can't just have 3 on 3 or 5 on 5,"' he recalls. "'And if we're going to do it, we need offensive linemen and defensive linemen."' Madden's stubbornness on this point delayed the debut of the game by three years and resulted in the violent verisimilitude that has made Madden a cult hero with both gangster rappers and the preteen suburbanites who buy their CD's -- and that has made both him and Hawkins extravagantly rich. In fact, it's the popularity of "Madden NFL" more than anything that gives ABC executives hope that Madden will be able to lure more of those young male viewers that are the object and desire of all TV programmers. 
"We never promise numbers," Madden says, "but I've got great demographics." 
Madden's celebration of lumbering linemen goes beyond giving them their football due to arguing their moral superiority. Even though he concedes that half his favorite gridiron characters would be unemployable or possibly incarcerated if not for pro football, he believes they're less vain, warmer, kinder and more spontaneous than their smaller counterparts. In fact, for Madden, the most crucial perquisite of his broadcasting career isn't the money or the ego stroke or the luxuriously tricked-out bus; it's that he gets to keep his membership in this Brobdingnagian society of pro football. For Madden, who 20 years ago suffered a series of extreme panic attacks on airplanes, it's the only world in which he feels comfortable, the only place he can breathe. 
That's why Madden is devastated when a player on any team gets seriously hurt, as he was when the New England Patriots' Daryl Stingley was paralyzed after a ferocious hit by one of Madden's Oakland players, in what would be the last year of his coaching career. After the game Madden went to the hospital to check up on Stingley and to his horror found that he was the only person there, not just from the Raiders but from Stingley's own team. Madden called the airport and stopped the Patriots' charter from taking off until they promised to send someone to the hospital, although the best they could eventually muster was to send the business manager. "To me, football is a brotherhood," Madden says. "We're all in this together." 
In the booth, Madden fetishizes lack of physical definition the way Calvin Klein underwear ads fetishize a six-pack. During the Super Bowl Madden veered into an extended riff about St. Louis Rams fullback James Hodgins simply because he weighed 270 pounds and was nicknamed Meat. 
"All fullbacks should be called Meat," Madden told 86 million Americans. "Better tackle him low." And when he started reeling off the weights of the Rams' sumo offensive linemen, it was apparent that just mouthing the huge numbers -- 300, 310, 320 -- made him happy, the way a kid gets a kick out of reciting the horsepower of a muscle car. 
By his own reckoning, Madden's emotional development halted at 16: "I've never been an adult. Adult things that people do, I've never enjoyed. I've always liked kid things." But sometimes when Madden starts talking happily about big guys colliding and grinding each other into the mud he evokes an even earlier presexual stage. It's as if he's describing the halcyon days of toddlers rolling around in a sandbox. 
The solace Madden offers the lonely is the happy example of himself. When Madden retired as the Raiders head coach, he planned on doing nothing for a year but hang out at home and reacquaint himself with his wife and two sons. "When you're gone all the time, like I was, you get these guilty feelings. 'Oh, geez, you don't spend any time with your family.' Hey, they didn't want me. My wife had gotten used to life without me. My sons didn't want to play catch with me. They had other kids to play catch with." 
For the last two decades, Madden has found he is far happier spending his days and nights in the fancy tour bus, alone or with a couple of pals, crisscrossing the country from game to game. Some might find this womanless nomadic existence a bit lacking if not desolate, but to Madden, life on the bus is the finally realized ideal of pure, unfettered freedom. 
Recounting his carefree routine on the road, he sounds like Huck Finn ticking off the finer points of floating downstream by raft. 
"You can sleep and take a nap anytime you want," he says. "I can watch tapes. I've got television. I've got a telephone. I've got a fax machine. And if I want to exercise or eat some food or take a walk, I pull over." 
Madden has some of Huck's solitary outsider's poetry in him too: "I enjoy going across the country and pulling into a town and finding the local restaurant, although that's getting tougher to do. But you know, watching a high-school football game from the side of the road, just leaning on a fence, or taking in a minor-league baseball game in Omaha -- there's something about lights and fields and gyms at night that makes me pull in and stop and take a look." 
That Madden has opted for an overwhelmingly male life built almost totally around sports is not only a balm to the lonely guy; it's also a blanket endorsement. And this approval isn't coming from a pair of his fellow loser friends but from a Hall of Fame coach, a figure of towering popularity and authority, not just a big guy, but a molder and shaper of big guys.
Age and eminence have made Madden a figure beyond reproof. This was especially clear in how little was made of his highly questionable call in the closing moments of Super Bowl XXXVI. It was, of course, the St. Louis Rams versus the New England Patriots, and with the scored tied and 1 minute 21 seconds left on the clock, the Pats had the ball deep in their own territory. Without skipping a beat, Madden said that they ought to run out the clock and play for overtime.
This advice seemed dubious as soon as it came out of his mouth. St. Louis had taken over the game in the second half, and if the Patriots ran out the clock and then lost the overtime coin flip, they would probably have never touched the ball again. Instead, New England's stud quarterback, Tom Brady, the rookie who clearly has gotten the girls all his life, rallied his team to a spectacular game-winning drive.
Months later in his office, Madden was still defending the call, saying he had no way of knowing the Rams' porous prevent defense would allow New England to gain yardage and stop the clock again and again. But there was something else behind Madden's reasoning: by suggesting the Patriots play it safe, what he was really saying was: "Rely on your big guys to grind it out. Don't count on the flashy quarterback." In those final seconds, as Tom Brady emerged a hero, the only consolation Madden could find was to point out how much weight the rookie had put on since he got out of college. It was at least a good 30 pounds, and that must have made the difference.

The I-Told-You-Soer
If John Madden is a big white male Oprah, Tim McCarver is a Tim Russert -- the insider who lives for minutiae, for calling our attention to inconsistencies and screw-ups that are about to happen. He is baseball's most gifted analyst, a precog so immersed in the warm pool of baseball data he can see the outcome of plays before they happen.
Unfortunately for him, however, insight and prescience are not that high on the list of what today's sports fans require from their virtual buddies on the tube. 
An example of McCarver's almost freakish propensity for seeing the future was the way he called the final play of last year's World Series between the New York Yankees and Arizona Diamondbacks. In the ninth inning of Game 7, with the score tied at 2, the bases loaded and one out, Yankees manager Joe Torre waved his infielders in so that on any ground ball, his team could get the force at home. 
As Mariano Rivera gathered himself to face Luis Gonzalez, McCarver noted that Rivera led the league in breaking bats. McCarver has no use for statistical abstracts. He says he tosses the latest Bill James into the trash as soon as it arrives. But based on 19 years of major-league experience and some aspects of bridge that he can't quite put his finger on, McCarver has developed his own set of probabilities. And one thing he has observed is that when an overpowering pitcher with a tendency to saw off bats like Rivera faces a powerful batter like Gonzalez, the result is often a weak flare into the shallowest part of the outfield. And in that case, he told viewers, bringing the infield in is exactly the wrong move. 
McCarver stopped talking in time for Rivera to send a 95 mile-per-hour fastball bearing down on Gonzalez's wrists. The hitter was handcuffed but got the bat around with just enough power to lift a little no-account pop over Derek Jeter's glove and end the 2001 series. 
"When you the consider the pressure of the moment," Keith Olbermann says, "the time he had to say it and the accuracy, his call was the sports-announcing equivalent of Bill Mazeroski's home run in the seventh inning to defeat the Yankees in 1960." 
McCarver does this kind of thing all the time. He thinks of what he does as "first guessing" (as opposed to second guessing) and considers the job description "baseball analyst" almost insulting because of its inference that he is talking about something after the fact. 
All of which leaves his peers much more impressed than the fans. If one was admired as a sportscaster largely on the quality of the information delivered, McCarver would be at least as much of phenomenon as Madden. Yet every time Madden's contract is up, there's an all-out bidding war for his services; McCarver, meanwhile, has had a nomadic career. Though he has held on to his once-a-week post as a broadcaster on Fox's national telecasts, he has essentially been let go by his most recent regular employers, the Mets and the Yankees. This year, he is calling a limited schedule of regular-season games for the San Francisco Giants. To his many detractors, McCarver's brilliant call was just another example of him trying to prove how much smarter he is than they are, and why he's so annoying. 
McCarver, whom I visited in his condo on the Gulf Coast, does not have an empire like Madden's. There are no video games that have his name on them. Your typical American teenager has no idea who he is. Instead, he has become famous for his run-ins, usually with baseball managers. Bobby Valentine, the Mets manager, couldn't bear to have his moves constantly scrutinized on the air, and that's how McCarver lost that job; Seattle manager Lou Piniella became incensed when, on a national telecast, a strategic maneuver of his backfired precisely the way McCarver predicted it would. Granted, these confrontations are the stuff of inside baseball, but they show how different McCarver's relationship is to his sport and audience than Madden's.
McCarver is fully aware of it. "I bet you didn't talk to John about his detractors," he said. "I don't get the feeling coaches ever go toe to toe with John." 
The other thing that distinguishes McCarver from Madden is that from the moment he sat down in front of a microphone, he stopped thinking of himself as an ex-ballplayer. Rather than straddling the worlds of playing and broadcasting, McCarver, like some high-level Soviet scientist, took everything he learned from one side, defected to the other and never looked back.
"A lot of players can't make the break -- I made it immediately," McCarver says. "My job ceased being one of the fraternity the moment I became an announcer." 
More than any other sports analyst, McCarver has the instincts of a journalist. He likes to think of himself as working for the TV station that broadcasts a team's games and not for the team itself. "That gives me the freedom to legitimately criticize according to my background as a player and my sense of fairness and my sense of an organization." he says, and if it causes problems with his new employer, so be it. "If Bonds doesn't run to first base, I'm going to say it. You got to run. That goes for everybody."
But McCarver's outsider integrity does even less for his popularity with fans than it does with managers. Having willfully exiled himself from the fraternity, McCarver is just another guy out there on his own, like the rest of us. He has no special sense of inclusion to offer viewers, no free passes to get us into secret athletic societies. 
McCarver is all about distinctions, about the difference between doing it right and doing it half right. "I have reverence for playing the game the right way," he says. "I don't apologize for that." In fact, for McCarver, variations on the phrase "I don't apologize," as in "I don't have to apologize for trying to get it right," is a kind of solitary hard-guy mantra. Joe Morgan, a former player and respected ESPN baseball analyst, will let a bonehead play slide, particularly if it turns out to be inconsequential. To McCarver, the same lapse is "inexcusable."
McCarver also makes it clear that baseball is not his life. Most of his close friends have nothing to do with the game. When I visited him he had just returned from a trip to Argentina with two male friends and was still looking for a spot to hang a photo of two tango dancers he'd brought back from Boca, the Buenos Aires barrio where the dance was invented. As I arrived, Carl Steger, a local jazz pianist, was just leaving, and after I left, McCarver would be heading to a wine tasting. 
McCarver reads books and lets people know about it by sprinkling references to Shakespeare and "Beowulf" into his telecasts. Madden, who has an apartment at the Dakota and two sons who went to Ivy League colleges, reads books, too, but has the good sense to keep any evidence off the air, going so far as to pretend during last year's Super Bowl broadcast that he didn't know how to use the word "inordinate." While Madden sees as the triumph of his life his finding a way to freeze his development at 16, McCarver's is that baseball has taken him beyond baseball, and that's the last thing a sports fan wants to imagine. 

I Hate This Game!
The recently retired superstar is an especially popular breed of television announcer. For them, there is no need to hone their shtick the way Rich Eisen has. They're honorably excused from any reporting, interviews or prep work of any kind. Even watching the game itself is optional. The only non-negotiable requirement is that they act like themselves in front of a camera, that they give the viewer what feels like an authentic link to the game they so recently played.
The greatest current practitioner of this art is the former N.B.A. star Charles Barkley, now a commentator for Turner Sports. When I go to talk to him, I find him in the TNT greenroom at the Meadowlands, where, to anybody within earshot, he is sending out a stream of putdowns and comebacks, wisdom and nonsense. He cautions the TNT public-relations man, Greg Hughes, about the perils of a comb-over. "Accidents happen when you go from one lane to another," he says. He muses about buying his own jet, perhaps because the airline lost his luggage this afternoon: "I hear I could get a pretty good one for 15, 20 million and lease it out a lot."
Then he addresses the shy teenager stocking the buffet. "Hey, little fella, you with the bad haircut, could you get me a Diet Coke?" he asks. When a TNT staff member tries flattering Barkley to finagle an invitation to a party, Barkley offers it to the youth as a parable. "Now that's a lesson for you, kid," he says. "There are two ways to make it in this world, you can be damn good or you can be a kiss-up."
About 200 feet or so from this room, there is a professional basketball game being played. Not just any old game, but the Eastern Conference finals between the New Jersey Nets and Boston Celtics. Barkley will be on the air discussing the details of this game three times within the next two hours, and yet he can scarcely summon the energy to watch more than a few seconds of action on the television at one end of the room. Walking out to see the game live is apparently out of the question.
How can he do his job with this level of inattention? "I know the game as well as anyone alive," he says. "I like my chances against anybody."
Maybe so, but Barkley's lack of interest goes beyond boredom to disdain. This evening, when he does allow his mind to wander toward basketball, his comments are uniformly derisive. The Celtics, who will go on to win this game, aren't playing well, he tells me (and then repeats more or less the same thing on air at the halftime); it's just that the Nets are playing worse. The Sacramento Kings didn't show him anything by winning Game 2 of the Western Conference finals the night before against the Lakers. The Lakers came out disgracefully flat. 
Barkley's knee-jerk negativism gives his analysis the gritty ring of truth even when it proves to be wildly inaccurate. "I'm going to tell you exactly what Sacramento is going to do," he says. "After they're down 3-1, they're going to know there's no way they can beat these guys three games in a row. So they're going to say to themselves, 'Instead of going back to L.A. and getting our butts kicked, we'll just lose at home -- then we can spend the night at home.' I know how these teams think. They think, 'Let's just keep it close to the end so people won't know we packed it in."'
In the greenroom, Barkley tests out a joke he plans to use at halftime: "This game is so boring I'm going to spend the second half looking for Jimmy Hoffa's body." He ends up not using it but instead discusses how United Airlines, one of the show's sponsors, lost his suit. He likes to do impertinent things like this. Last year, he made a point of repeatedly cracking on the car manufacturer Hyundai, another sponsor.
For all this, Barkley has been flooded with praise from fans and critics. To white male TV viewers, he offers the same thing he offers his white male colleagues in the greenroom: the exotic, bracing company of a funny, contrary, slightly out-of-control black man for whom the rules don't seem to apply. And since we all know (from him, mainly) that he's best pals with both Michael Jordan and Tiger Woods, he offers indirect entree to the most exclusive athletic V.I.P. room (black or white) on the planet. 
In the past couple of years Barkley has also presented himself as the voice of civil rights in sports, steering any interview toward race. "I'm trying to get away from sports," he says. "I want to get into social issues." This drives his TNT partner, the former Houston Rockets point guard Kenny Smith, nuts. Smith was particularly offended when Barkley was depicted as a slave in chains on the cover of Sports Illustrated earlier this year with the headline "Charles Unchained."
"Since when has he been chained?" Smith says. "The league is full of people who have opinions on race and other things, but he's the only who gets asked." 
Barkley lives within the world of TV the way Madden resides in football. Like Ozzy Osbourne, he gets over just by being his own entertainingly flawed self. 
Barkley's admirers love the fact that he comes to them unfiltered; if he's annoying, discursive, plainly wrong, even if he's talking about things that have nothing to do with sports, at least he's not pretending to be someone else. He's not a phony. The person up there yapping is the real Charles Barkley, and because he seems to be holding so little back for himself, it's easy for us to believe that we're seeing all there is to see and that our relationship with him is just about as real and intimate as anyone's, even Tiger's and Michael's. 

The Male Nurses
When I started this article, I had a girlfriend. Things were going really well. Pushing the button on her intercom made me smile, and when she went away on business, she called and reminded me to floss. But one afternoon something clicked in her head, and she went from being angry about not having met my kids to not wanting to meet them at all, and nothing I could do would change her mind.
The next Saturday morning, I did what most men do in that 3 a.m. of the soul. I crawled to my couch and turned on the television. "Sports-
Center" may make billions for Disney, but in dire times, it's also a public service. Its prime show for the night, the one that Olbermann and Dan Patrick made famous and that Eisen has anchored on occasion, is the 11 p.m. slot. They telecast a very slightly edited version at 1 a.m and then play that same show every hour on the hour from 5 a.m. to noon. Having made it to the couch, I hooked up "SportsCenter" like an intravenous drip and watched seven in a row, back to back.
"SportsCenter" is such a dense wall-to-wall montage of scores, video, music, pop-culture references and wisecracks, the two VJ's stepping on the edges of each other's solos like bebop horn players, that you almost need to watch it consecutively to appreciate the content and flair that has been shoehorned into each episode. It's practically Joycean. Every time you rub your eyes, you notice something else. That's why it's such a favorite in whatever rung of hell includes airport bars. 
The two guardian anchors looking out for me that morning and gently directing me to the cathode light at the end of the tunnel were John Anderson and Scott Van Pelt, who, like almost all "SportsCenter" tandems, are a pair of very straight-looking white fellows in their early 30's, clamping down loosely on their absurdist tendencies. ESPN management, and sometimes even the anchors themselves, are forever trying to play down the comic element of the show, talking about how the gist of what they do is to inform and only a minuscule percentage of the material is intended to crack you up. But a "SportsCenter" anchor who plays it straight isn't going very far; he certainly isn't going to be featured on one of the hilarious promos made by Wieden & Kennedy, the same agency that convinced us that buying a pair of Nikes made in a Southeast Asian sweatshop was a subversive act. 
And one other thing. All of the funny anchors are men. There are several competent, well-informed female anchors on SportsCenter, but none do much on the comic end of the spectrum. Women can't be funny about sports. Not yet. They haven't been pickled in it for enough generations, and they're too grateful to have the job. Unless you have lived the true patheticness of the whole enterprise, you can't be funny about it. 
Anderson and Van Pelt have lived it and then some, and they pull me through the morning. Since ESPN went on the air in 1979, every 18-foot putt still looks like every other 18-foot putt, every home run looks like every other home run, every diving stab by a Dominican shortstop looks like a thousand acrobatic plays before it. But they can't change the games, so ESPN changes the language. Since Berman's first path-blazing pun, the best "SportsCenter" anchors have been inventing and reinventing a new postmodern sports lexicon almost weekly. This morning the call of the clip showing the great play at short is: "This is Omar Vizquel's highlight. You're just lucky to see it." The call of the home run, that great American iconic moment, is: "Good to see you. Got to GO!" and when Tiger Woods rolls in the millionth 18-footer of his well-documented career, Van Pelt, as white a human being you're likely to encounter, says in a way that is sublimely absurd, "Tiger Tiger Woods y'all!" For a highlight of a runner scoring in baseball, there's a reference to Chuck Berry: "Rounding third and heading home, he's a brown-eyed handsome man"; and for a point guard leading the break a reference to LL Cool J: "Pushing it and pushing it and pushing it good."
For five hours they almost make me smile. They almost make existence seem bearable, and when, at 12 noon, the "Mission: Impossible" graphics fade out for the last time and the show doesn't restart, I have a flash of fresh panic. What am I going to do? But then, shuttling through the channels with my remote, I spot a CBS promo for the Houston Open, and I know that very soon after Anderson and Van Pelt's shift ends, the nurses Gary McCord and David Feherty -- aka the best golf announcers on television -- will arrive to puff up my pillows, take my temperature and dispense what's needed from a tray full of new meds, and it's only a matter of time till I'm my old self again.

HEADLINE: THE WAY WE LIVE NOW: 7-21-02; 
My Fault

BYLINE:  By Walter Kirn; Walter Kirn is the author, most recently, of "Up in the Air," a novel.

 BODY:
Five years ago, at the urging of a market guru known for his folksy approach to stock picking and his prematurely snow white hair, I divided my economic self into two theoretical entities: an innocent middle-American consumer who roamed the malls in search of new sensations and a second, analytic self who monitored the first self's purchases in the hope of spotting smart investments. The idea, as outlined in Peter Lynch's book "One Up on Wall Street," was to unleash my inner market genius by setting aside all those fancy charts and graphs and concentrating on the world around me. Was I drinking a lot of espresso? Buy stock in Starbucks. Were all of my friends on Prozac? Buy Eli Lilly. 
 It was an existential transformation, and I was not alone in making it. Aiming to score what Lynch called "10 baggers" (stock investments that appreciated tenfold or more), I turned myself into a human market indicator. No longer would I waste my life by merely living it; by seeing myself as a roving one-man focus group, I would learn to profit from it too. Did I like my long-distance carrier? Buy WorldCom. 
 Which I did -- lots of it -- and you know the ending. But as much as I'd like to blame the current market slide on megalomaniacal C.E.O.'s, corrupt accountants, lazy federal regulators and Martha Stewart's extended social circle, my own little feverish random walk down Wall Street reminds me that even the largest market bubbles are inflated one breath at a time, by millions of suckers blowing in unison. 
Since there's no Congressional hearing room large enough to hold us all -- the lunch-counter Morgans and couch-potato Rockefellers whose hunches and tips and systems warped the markets as surely as all those fraudulent corporate audits -- the investigations into where the money went will, of necessity, be witch trials. Which isn't to say they won't feature some actual witches many of us will be happy to see burned, if only to exorcise our guilt for making them celebrities in the first place. Years ago, when the great fever struck me personally (I was drinking a Gatorade one minute and buying Quaker Oats, its maker, the next), I alarmed myself by sitting down one day and listing the names of 20 C.E.O.'s I hadn't realized I'd known until that moment. The names came to me from the media ether, magically, the way ballplayers' names had when I was 12. I resented this unbidden mental invasion. Ellison, Welch, McNealy, Ebbers, Whitman -- useless info-bytes breeding in a brain that soon, to make room for them, would be forced to dump whole college seminars on Roman history and the complete set of Los Angeles area codes.
It seemed like such vital information then: P/E's and Ebitda's and split dates and Morningstar rankings. But what was this esoterica displacing? Just as every stock purchase implies a sale, every thought about stocks implies a nonthought about, well, you name it -- art, love, gardening. If the rest of the amateur investors were behaving anything like I was then -- pondering why they'd lunched at Wendy's that day rather than at Outback Steakhouse; walking several blocks out of their way for a glimpse of an electronic jumbo ticker; checking the closing numbers on the Nikkei before looking out the window at that day's weather -- then a whole lot of things worth doing in America weren't getting done.
No matter how many subpoenas Congress issues, we'll never know the toll of our obsession with making money while remaining motionless. For how many years was the cure for cancer delayed by researchers staring at streaming real-time quotes? How many novels went flat in Chapter 6 when their authors were interrupted by e-mailed "sell" alerts? How many budding romances went cold when one lover broke the other's searching gaze to peek at a stranger's open Wall Street Journal? 
Real-estate agents call it "deferred maintenance": the squalor that results when property owners are too distracted to make routine repairs. Deferred maintenance feels like American capitalism's general condition now. There are the corporate officers who postponed telling people during all those quarters of rising earnings that they barely cleared enough money for a cold soda minus the deposit on the can. There are the brokers who postponed telling clients that everyone inside the firm had just sold the stock it now rated a "strong buy." There are the husbands who postponed telling their wives that they'd have to postpone that trip to Paris they'd planned, not to mention their retirement. It's as if the whole country put up an "Out to Lunch" sign sometime around mid-1997, except that we didn't really go to lunch; we logged onto the Motley Fool Web site behind closed doors and screened our calls while quietly tracking Intel.
That was me, at least, and I'm glad the fever has broken, since I'm not sure I could have cooled down on my own. By the end there, the market and I had merged. Every time I stopped to smell the roses, I asked myself, "Who owns the roses?" and "What's their share price?" When I noticed how much organic baby food my wife was buying after our first child was born, my reaction was not "What a careful, thoughtful mother," but "How does Merrill Lynch rate Whole Foods Market?" Every Pampers change was a promotion for Procter & Gamble, but then came our household's sudden switch to Huggies, which my wife said fit better. How to trade on this?
To gain the market but lose one's soul. It sounded like a good deal once, and may again someday (though not too soon, I hope). In the meantime, as the fall guys fall and the pros take their high-profile legal beatings, we amateurs have permission just to live again.

YOU don't usually see people smiling in the dentist's chair, but the woman at the Madison Avenue office of Dr. Paul Tanners looked, well, happy. The dentist had just completed the last of a full reconstruction on her upper and lower teeth, and the patient was enjoying a foot rub from the massage therapist on his staff.
 In a city where healthy competition is a given in most professions, some dental practices are now offering previously unheard-of services and other perks, from massages to DVD screenings, as a way to build up business. 
 "There are currently more dentists in Manhattan than there are in 40 other states," said Robert Raibur, president of the New York County Dental Society, which counts 2,500 members. Yet demand for their services, especially cosmetic treatments like tooth whitening, bonding and dental implants, has softened in the bumpy economy of the last couple of years, according to Leslie Seldin, a consumer advisory spokeswoman for the American Dental Association.
What to do? According to Mr. Raibur, an increasing number of Manhattan dentists are providing additional services, like digital photography to show patients how they will look after cosmetic improvements. And some practitioners are doing more than that.
Two years ago, Jay Neuhaus decided to give his 25-year-old practice, Gramercy Dental Arts on Park Avenue South, a nudge by hiring Laura Norman, a foot reflexologist, and two members of her staff, who are at his office two days a week to give foot massages to patients who want them.
About half of Dr. Neuhaus's patients opt for the free massages, which take place during treatment and include aromatherapy, with fragrant essential oils like lavender, citrus and mint rubbed onto bare feet.
"People come in nervous, even about having their teeth cleaned," says Ms. Norman, who also has a private practice on Park Avenue. "This is a great way to reduce their stress. I've had patients tell me they sleep much better after having reflexology that day."
While having their foot rub, patients can also dip their hands in a skin-smoothing warm paraffin bath that Dr. Neuhaus provides. And the dental chair itself has built-in rolling massagers for the back and legs, so that even when Ms. Norman or her assistants aren't there, patients can use a control panel to get a mechanical rubdown.
Also on hand: a video collection for patients who want a film as background while undergoing lengthy procedures, a selection of teas and cookies baked on the premises each morning. "As you approach the office, it smells like a bakery," Dr. Neuhaus boasted. "So instead of being anxious and afraid about seeing the dentist, people walk in smiling and feeling good."
As word spread of the massages and cookies, business boomed. "It's the 'wow!' factor," he said. "About 99 percent of new patients come to us through referrals, rather than advertising."
At Marvin Fiedler's office on East 86th Street, technology reigns. Each treatment room has a flat-screen TV attached to the dental chair. There is a wireless mouse that patients can use to channel surf or even go on the Internet (wireless keyboards are available for those who want to cruise the Web or check their e-mail).
"People like to see updated modern technology," said Dr. Fiedler, whose office also offers digital X-rays ("90 percent less radiation than the regular kind," he avers) that patients can see on the flat screen and print out. Special software allows for color photo enlargements that show every cavity in vivid detail.
For 23 years, Dr. Fiedler practiced dentistry in a traditional office, on 96th Street. When he made the move 10 blocks south last June, he had the office decorated in soft lavenders and grays "designed to soothe," he said, and had the digital systems installed.
"It's made a world of difference," he said. "At the previous office, we had fewer than 500 patients. Now there are close to 700, and that number is growing. Every week we get seven or more new patients. People hear about us, and they're intrigued."
Dr. Tanners, who specializes in reconstructive dentistry, says he has given his 35-year practice a boost by bringing in not only a massage therapist, but a plastic surgeon as well.
The surgeon, Michelle Zweifler, who joined the staff last year, divides her time among Dr. Tanners's practice, hospital work and her own private practice in Manhattan. Dr. Tanners's patients are informed by mailings that Dr. Zweifler is in the office on Tuesdays and Thursdays to offer free consultations.
For a fee, Dr. Zweifler also performs simple, noninvasive procedures in the office, usually injections of Botox (which reduces facial wrinkles by temporarily paralyzing underlying muscles) or collagen (which fills in facial creases). As many as eight patients a week opt for one of these treatments. Those who want cosmetic surgery need to book an appointment with Dr. Zweifler at her Upper East Side office.
Why a plastic surgeon? "Patients used to complain to me about their wrinkles," Dr. Tanners said. "Once people's mouths were fixed, they became more aware of other imperfections, and they wanted to look better."
He recounts the case of a patient who came in one morning with a cracked front tooth from a fall she had had the previous night. After Dr. Tanners made her a temporary crown, Dr. Zweifler examined her swollen nose to see if there was any fracture. 
Another patient, concerned about her "gummy smile," has booked an appointment with Dr. Zweifler to have her upper lip surgically lowered.
Dr. Tanners's massage therapist, who goes by the name Izamar, joined the practice two years ago, and "the response has been phenomenal," Dr. Tanners said. About 80 percent of his patients opt for the free hand, foot and calf massages she offers.
"It's so relaxing that some patients don't even want nitrous," he said. "I've seen patients fall asleep during treatment."

HEADLINE: MUSIC; 
The Jazz Wife: Muse and Manager

BYLINE:  By ROBIN D. G. KELLEY; Robin D. G. Kelley, a professor of history at New York University, is writing a biography of Thelonious Monk.

 BODY:
ON July 2, family and friends of Mrs. Nellie Monk gathered at St. Peter's Church in Manhattan to pay their last respects to the woman who shared most of her life with the pianist and composer Thelonious Monk.
 Monk and Nellie, as they were known to their friends, were one of the grand couples in jazz. The eulogies reminded us just how critical she was in sustaining her husband's career. She was his personal manager and musical consultant, at times the family's chief wage earner, and mother to their children, Thelonious Jr. and Barbara. After Monk's death in 1982, Nellie Monk helped establish the Thelonious Monk Institute, which promotes jazz through educational programs and competitions, and more recently she was a driving force behind the family record label, Thelonious Records. 
Mrs. Monk was not alone. Many spouses of jazz musicians have not only maintained stable households but often run the "business" -- handled publishing, tours and booking and written proposals for grants. The trumpeter and bandleader Dizzy Gillespie, who died in 1993, often praised Lorraine, his wife of 53 years, for her financial skills. "Lorraine knows how to handle money," he said. "Without her, I wouldn't have a quarter." 
Women like Nellie Monk and Lorraine Gillespie were not simply muses who inspired their husbands' creative passions or housewives relegated to the background of their spouses' public lives. Rather, they became a significant social and economic force in the jazz world and thus were ahead of their time.
Long-lasting partnerships like theirs call into question the pervasive stereotype of the male jazz musician as a womanizing free spirit. Some of the other great couples in jazz include Mona and Milt Hinton, Lucille and Sonny Rollins, Dolly and Jackie McLean, June and Percy Heath, Mona and Jimmy Heath, Dorthaan and Rahsaan Roland Kirk, Sue and Charles Mingus, Rosemary and Bobby Hutcherson, Sandy and Milt Jackson, Iola and Dave Brubeck, Sandy and Clifford Jordan. But stories of such stable, nurturing relationships rarely find a place in the countless movies and books about jazz artists.
Mrs. Monk first met Thelonious in 1933, when she was an 11-year-old named Nellie Smith. Her family had just moved to West 62nd Street in Manhattan, and the Monks lived on the next street over. Her brother, Sonny, quickly befriended Monk, who was a local hero because of his prowess on the basketball court and at the piano. "A lot of young girls used to go to his house to hear him play," Mrs. Monk recalled recently. "Of course, a lot of girls had a crush on him." Eventually their friendship grew into a romance, and they were married in 1947.
Mrs. Monk loved her husband's music, and he trusted her opinions. In the late 1950's they acquired a portable reel-to-reel tape recorder, which she used to capture his playing. While he was at the piano, she occasionally sang along in unison. She also welcomed -- and fed -- the many musicians who dropped by their tiny apartment on West 63rd Street to rehearse or just hang out. Although she had no formal music training, musicians frequently solicited her opinions about their work.
"Monk would always ask Nellie what she thought about the music, not just his music but the cats Thelonious dug, like Nat Cole, Teddy Wilson and Erroll Garner," recalled Marcellus Green, a longtime family friend and barber who counted many of the musicians as his patrons. "Nellie got to be such a critic that everybody who was around of any note would ask Nellie, 'How's this sound?' " 
Many women had been involved in jazz long before they met their husbands. (Lorraine Willis was a chorus dancer with Edgar Hayes's orchestra when she met Gillespie in 1937.) Anita Cooper grew up on Staten Island listening to jazz on the radio, and while completing her masters degree in social work at Fordham University, she moved to the West Village in 1961, largely because of the music scene. There she met Gil Evans, a struggling arranger and pianist, and two years later they married. She said he asked her to become director of his orchestra "just because Gil didn't have any interest in, or talent for, taking care of that."
"Nor did I," she added. "But in order to avoid starvation, I took on the phone calls and tried to make stuff happen."
Making stuff happen was not always easy. Mrs. Evans kept things together by securing gigs, writing grant proposals and pinching pennies, and all the while managed to raise their sons, Miles and Noah.
During the 1980's, Mr. Evans even asked her to play percussion in the band. "Gil said to me, 'I can't see you in the audience; I can't feel your pulse anymore.' "
Gladys Hampton was the model of the wife and manager. She began managing Lionel Hampton's band in the late 1930's and oversaw his publishing and record companies. Her shrewdness was legendary -- and so was her fierce independence. Once, Mr. Hampton fired the singer Betty Carter, and Mrs. Hampton rehired her. As Carter recalled years later, "That was the first time I ever experienced dealing with a woman who was the boss."
In a period when jazz musicians often complained about the ineffectiveness of their own union, it was women in many cases who fought the club owners and record companies to improve the working conditions of musicians. Maxine Gordon had been active in the music industry years before she met her husband, the tenor saxophonist Dexter Gordon. She started going to the Village Vanguard in 1957 when she was only 15. Over the years, she became well-acquainted with the hazards of a life in jazz: the late hours, the erratic work schedule, the lack of steady income and health insurance. In the 60's and 70's she gained a reputation for her outspoken insistence that musicians learn the business and work together to protect their own interests.
In 1972 she teamed up with other women to found Ms. Management, which booked gigs, arranged tours, negotiated contracts and helped musicians get their work published. She met Mr. Gordon in 1974, and they married several years later. For much of the last two decades of his life -- he died in 1990 -- she managed his career. "I got a lot of heat for putting off promoters, club owners, record companies and other musicians when Dexter didn't want to do certain things," Mrs. Gordon recalled.
She also remembered being called pushy, domineering or worse, but dismissed such criticism as part of the job. She believes women were better suited to the task because their egos were not at stake. "The way we as women are socialized enables us to work, although we don't get any credit," she said. "You wouldn't last a day if you did this work to get public recognition."
Beyond an unyielding love of the music, what marked these relationships was a commitment to home and family. As the saxophonist Johnny Griffin once said: "If Monk isn't working, he isn't on the scene. Monk stays home." Thelonious Jr. remembered his father as "a guy who had a fabulous love affair with his wife, who partied with his children, who wrote tunes named after family members." One of his favorites, his son said, was the lovely ballad "Crepuscule With Nellie."

HEADLINE: IN PERSON; 
A Job With Bragging Rights

BYLINE:  By ROBERT STRAUSS 

DATELINE: HIGH BRIDGE 

 BODY:
NANCY BYRNE took off her sandals and dipped her toes into the south branch of the Raritan River where it bisects the Ken Lockwood Gorge Wildlife Management Area. She gingerly stepped onto some rocks part of the way into the rushing stream amid a clot of trees, letting in rays of sunshine and making the water twinkle wondrously.
 Ms. Byrne had driven over a rutted dirt road for several miles just to find this spot -- a secret fishing hole that local officials directed her to in the hope of making it a little less secret. 
 "Who would believe this is New Jersey?" said Ms. Byrne, the new executive director of the state's Office of Travel and Tourism. "Actually, I would. And the problem I have is to convince everyone else that this is the real New Jersey." 
Ms. Byrne's Hunterdon County escorts wanted her to know about the area's natural wonders. Of course, that's an occupational hazard, though hazard is hardly the word she would choose. Down in Monmouth County, they want her to make sure she is aware of all the nuances of the Jersey Shore. In Newark, it is the new downtown arts area and the Ironbound section with its variety of ethnic restaurants. Over in Camden County, it is the plethora of historical towns and buildings and parks that officials hope are on her agenda.
With New Jersey's economy -- like that of most other states' -- under siege, working a little bit harder is a lot harder than it used to be. Everyone from Chamber of Commerce officials to amusement park owners to casino operators to museum docents want to bend Ms. Byrne's ear. When business is not booming, people look to tourism to rescue the local economy. And despite all of the things there are to do in the state year round, New Jersey's big season -- and consequently Ms. Byrne's -- is summer.
"We're looking for those people a tank of gas away," said the 44-year-old Ms. Byrne. "There is a lot to do in New Jersey, but except for the shore, it's not on everyone's radar screen. So we just have to work a little bit harder."
Ms. Byrne -- who is no stranger to public relations, or the state of New Jersey, for that matter -- has her work cut out for her. Her office has about $8 million to work with -- only about a third of what Pennsylvania tourism officials use to promote their state and only a fifth of the $40 million tourism budget in New York. Each of six regions around the state gets $50,000 to promote its specific features, with the rest going toward a statewide effort.
"It isn't much, I'll admit," she conceded. "It means finding ways to do things cooperatively and efficiently, so I want to visit as many of these sites as possible to see how they all can come together."
In some ways, Ms. Byrne was born for the job. Her father, Brendan, happens to be the former governor and her brother Thomas was the state Democratic chairman who made a brief effort to gain the party's Senate nomination, though it ultimately went to Jon Corzine.
And she has lived -- and played -- all over the state. One of seven children, she was born in Newark and moved to Mercer County while her father, elected twice, was in office. She graduated from Princeton High School and Clemson University in South Carolina, and during those years she spent many of her summers at the governor's summer house at Island Beach State Park.
After graduating from Clemson, Ms. Byrne worked in the Essex County parks department, then became director of public relations for the Virginia Slims women's tennis tour. During the Clinton administration, she switched gears and worked for Interior Secretary Bruce Babbitt, setting up many of the events he attended.
"I have always been interested in the environment, so that was wonderful," she said. "And this job, too, will play into that -- my environmental bent."
With that, she gestured to the isolated beauty of the Ken Lockwood Gorge, watching as two horseback riders trotted up the dirt road and fishing enthusiasts cast their lines in the Raritan. "If we encourage this type of relatively local environmentally sound tourism," she said, "we'll being doing a service for everyone."
Tourism in New Jersey is a tough sell outside the state. Though the shore is well known to outsiders, it is mainly a three-month summer destination. The rest of the state is often no more than a bypass along the Northeast Corridor, set between New York to the north and Philadelphia and Washington to the south.
During Gov. Thomas Kean's administration there was something of a push for tourism (Remember the "New Jersey and You: Perfect Together" television commercials?), but during Gov. Christie Whitman's tenure, the ads primarily emphasized either the state's livability or favorable business climate.
The state's current budget crisis is not making Ms. Byrne's job any easier. For instance, the official state map still features former Governor Whitman and her family -- not Governor McGreevey with his wife and their infant -- at a New York Giants football game.
"We can't waste anything right now," Ms. Byrne said with a sigh. "You have to choose the right battles in a budget crisis."
Despite the obstacles, Ms. Byrne has gotten good marks so far from local tourism officials.
"We're always part of a regional tourism effort down here, but she has made us feel like we are included in her thinking," said Diane Wieland, the director of the Cape May County Department of Tourism and chairwoman of the state's Southern Shore tourism region. "She invited us to an event with travel writers way up in Atlantic Highlands, knowing we could get something out of it. We all complain to her. There is never enough money. But she listens."
Judy London of the Camden Waterfront Marketing Bureau, concurred.
"I've been working on the waterfront for six years now and have been the chair of the Delaware River region for the state for that time, and no other director of tourism ever came down to tour the Camden riverfront," said Ms. London. "Within six weeks, Nancy was there. She's not even from the tourism industry and she knew to visit everyone and learn. Even without a lot of money, that is a good sign."
For Ms. Byrne, it is a matter of educating New Jersey residents about what there is to see and so in their state.
"For us, a tourist is someone who has come from 50 miles away, in state or out," she said. "Even I didn't know this existed. What about people in Newark who could go, say, to Cowtown Rodeo or the people down there who might visit the Liberty Science Center? People in New Jersey can be a tough sell for their own state. We have to change that thinking, too."
To that end, Ms. Byrne said she was trying to concentrate on coordinating events that give a splash of publicity, like the New Jersey Festival of Ballooning in Readington or the Hambletonian races at the Meadowlands.
"Lots of people will come to these things and then say, 'What else can I do here?' " she said. "That's when we can get them to come to a historic house or a stream like this, three or four little things. Or when your cousin from Michigan comes in to visit and just wants to do something for the afternoon. We should have information available for everyone for that. Anyone who comes from 50 miles away we consider a tourist.
"So we want to have more events that bring a lot of people in?" she continued. "Wouldn't it be great to have something like the Special Olympics? People would come from all over the world for that, and then we could show them things like this gorge. Then they would tell their friends and family what a great, diverse place New Jersey is."

HEADLINE: Stages Change, but the Music Endures 

BYLINE:  By ROBERTA HERSHENSON 

 BODY:
RICHARD KAPP, music director of the Dobbs Ferry-based chamber orchestra, Philharmonia Virtuosi, was pondering the idea of permanence. "How many years before you're considered permanent?" He smiled wryly. "Twenty-five years aren't enough?" 
 It has been 25 years since Philharmonia first appeared in Westchester, playing the inaugural concert of the Performing Arts Center at Purchase College (which, not coincidentally, is also celebrating its 25th anniversary this year). Orchestras throughout the country, as well as the county, have folded during that period, but Philharmonia, a group that ranges from 2 to 40 players, depending on the program, has been making music on a variety of stages in Westchester ever since. The organization is leaner than in the past but has sustained its focus. Its players say music-making with the group has never been more fun or rewarding. 
 Mr. Kapp, a lanky, voluble conductor who is known for his talks to the audience, founded Philharmonia in 1968 and virtually personifies it. (The orchestra began in Manhattan with players from the New York Philharmonic, and in 1979 changed to a freelance group paid union fees) His wife, Barbara, has been executive director for the past five years, and their daughter, Madeline, who graduated from Hastings-on-Hudson High School last month, has been working this summer both behind the scenes as the group's only other staff member and on stage as a violinist. With such a tight family affair, questions of permanence naturally arise. Will Mr. Kapp, who is 65, be passing on the baton anytime soon? 
He wants to, he said, when the time is right and if the right person comes along. Meanwhile he has been busy this summer leading the orchestra's "Sunset Serenades" series at Lasdon Park and Arboretum in Somers and planning a number of concert series to begin in the fall. These include an orchestra season at Purchase College in Purchase; a smaller chamber group season at Westchester Community College in Valhalla; a Cushion Concert series for children at Hoff-Barthelson Music School in Scarsdale, and an orchestra series at the Metropolitan Museum of Art. He will also continue the series of lectures he presents each year at the Met with Mela Tenenbaum, Philharmonia's concertmaster; appear as a featured artist and lecturer with Ms. Tenenbaum on special music cruises and continue to run Ess.a.y Recordings, the small, privately owned classical music record company he founded in 1988. 
All this from a man who believes quite firmly that classical music is facing its own sunset.
"The question is, what goes first, it or me," he said. "It's no longer in the consciousness. The culture has moved on." 
When the classical work horses are played or recorded, he said, the music is often below par because "the standards are gone." Mr. Kapp takes the existential view that brow-beating about this decline is pointless; what counts is continuing to play the best one can and help form public taste.
"We have to inculcate the power of discrimination, or it's all McDonald's and Disney," he said. Like someone facing a death sentence, "you maintain your humanity while you're alive and then it's over."
A prodigy who began the piano at age 2, Mr. Kapp left professional music for law school early in his career after becoming disenchanted with what he saw as an ego-driven and competitive music world "that had nothing to do with music." 
He got the law degree, but music pulled him back in. He takes a dim view of anything that detracts from the music itself, whether it's status-seeking board members ("We're not a status organization in the county, so no one can join the board to improve on his position") or players inclined to compete for power. The principal viola player, Richard A. Brice, who has been with the orchestra since 1991, said the musicians have settled into an amiable group who no longer carp at the conductor's mistakes or "take advantage of his vulnerabilities" as some long-gone players used to do. Robert Bush, principal flute, said that of all the freelance groups he plays with, Philharmonia has a singular rapport "as a result of Dick."
A shift in the orchestra began 10 years ago with the arrival of Ms. Tenenbaum, an immigrant from Ukraine who brought her extensive experience as a concertmaster and soloist with her. She became concertmaster after two years and began what continues to be a thriving artistic partnership with Mr. Kapp. She has made 30 CD's for Ess.a.y to what are often glowing reviews; many of the records feature her on the violin or viola and Mr. Kapp on the piano. Players suggest that Mr. Kapp may rely on Ms. Tenenbaum too much; she not only plays solo parts as the concertmaster but often appears as a featured soloist in works like Vivaldi's "Four Seasons," which she will play next Saturday at 6 p.m. at Lasdon and again at the Performing Arts Center in Purchase on Feb. 9 at 3 p.m.
She lauds his "dedication to music" and his "encyclopedic view" of the repertory. He describes her simply as one of the most extraordinary musicians he has ever worked with.
Their fertile collaboration may have softened the impact of a weakened economy and other factors to which the orchestra has adapted by downsizing. The factors include audience attrition as aging subscribers have moved away or died; the loss of corporate sponsorship as companies have left Westchester, and competition for audiences from other groups like the Westchester Philharmonic. Philharmonia has survived, Mr. Kapp said, by reducing its budget from a high of $1 million to the current $600,000 to $700,000 annually; conducting marketing by direct mail rather than through expensive newspaper or radio advertising; and reducing its staff, although Mrs. Kapp said the board had approved the salary for an additional full-time employee.
The group has no deficit, a feat Mr. Kapp said was due partly to "people coming out of the woodwork"' with financial contributions. One admirer on a cruise wrote a five-figure check to Philharmonia so Ms. Tenenbaum could record all of Mozart's violin concertos. The recording was made in Prague with Czech musicians to hold down costs. Mr. Kapp said Philharmonia's players benefited by "savings accrued to the orchestra."
A yearly gala, which Mrs. Kapp organizes, aimed for $40,000 last year and met its goal. She holds a doctorate in music theory but has spent her career in arts administration, both at Philharmonia and Hoff-Barthelson.
When asked what it is like to work so closely with her husband, she replied, "It's fine now," and laughed. 
"Dick works from home in Hastings and I work from the office in Dobbs Ferry," she said. "I don't advise him on repertoire and he doesn't tell me what colors to use at the gala."
The orchestra's five-concert season at the Performing Arts Center begins Oct. 13 at 3 p.m. with a program featuring the guitarist Eliot Fisk as soloist. Other programs in Purchase include the complete Brandenburg Concertos by Bach on Dec. 8 at 3 p.m. and the world premiere of Stephen Paulus's Piano Concerto, a work commissioned by Philharmonia and played by Anton Nel, on March 23 at 3 p.m. (For ticket information: 914-693-5595.)
The question of retirement comes up often, Mr. Kapp said, but his answer is always the same: "If I stop, I die."
Mrs. Kapp says the group is looking for someone who will carry on with the kind of commitment that she and her husband have made to Philharmonia's longtime survival. "We've given our whole lives to this," she said. "This is what we do. We don't play golf. We can't imagine not doing this."

HEADLINE: L.I. @ WORK; 
In CD Sales, Contrarian Runs Away From Pack

BYLINE:  By WARREN STRUGATCH 

 BODY:
NO ONE who knows Michael Koch would be surprised that in the middle of a recording industry slump that shows no signs of easing, he has picked this moment to expand. 
 Sales of CD's are down 14 percent this year over last, itself a dreary period, and the future is clouded by disputes over which recording formats. But Mr. Koch, an Austrian-born music entrepreneur, says his company expects to outpace its 2001 sales of $117 million by as much as 20 percent. 
 Mr. Koch is merely doing what he always does: forging ahead in precisely the opposite direction as the rest of the pack.
He has built his 15-year-old company, Koch Entertainment in Port Washington, into the country's largest independent distributor of recorded music largely by rereleasing performances of classical, jazz and ethnic music that slipped out of the catalogs years ago. He remains an industry contrarian who does not flout the rules so much as ignore them.
"I think one reason we have succeeded is because we didn't realize how much we didn't know," he said. "We learned by doing. We made mistakes, and we learned important lessons."
Mr. Koch started out as the American sales representative for his father's CD-pressing company in Innsbruck. It took some effort, but record executives gave him a chance, and he made the most of his opportunities. "I polished lots of doorknobs, and learned I might hear 'yes' if I heard 'no' 15 times and didn't give up," he said. 
In 1999, he founded his own record label, also called Koch Entertainment, based in Manhattan, and started signing up artists like Carole King and Charlie Daniels whose glory days might be behind them but whose fans still buy their recordings, albeit in numbers too small to interest larger labels.
"The major labels get rid of artists who don't go gold or platinum," Mr. Koch said. "We can make money with an artist who sells 100,000 recordings, or even 50,000." 
Koch Entertainment also produces its own jazz, classical and country recordings. "We're still a small label, but I think we're getting known pretty fast, in part because we have the distribution already in place," said Bob Frank, the label's president. "The label already produces maybe 40 percent of the company's revenues."
Last month, Mr. Koch celebrated his company's 15th anniversary by making a few characteristically contrarian deals. The largest was the acquisition of a neighboring building in Harbor Industrial Park in Port Washington, which will provide 30 percent more warehouse space for his distribution subsidiary.
"Whatever is going to be the future of the CD as a music recording medium, we know it's going to be around for another five to 10 years at least," Mr. Koch said.
Those who know Mr. Koch often say his work ethic is his defining characteristic. In recent weeks, as many of his larger-living competitors slipped away on vacation, the soft-spoken but highly focused Mr. Koch stayed on the job and reached a series of distribution agreements to give his label more muscle in the urban music category. Johnny Wright, the manager of artists like Britney Spears and Sean Combs, will bring Triple Image, a pop trio aimed at young audiences, to Koch. Koch will distribute FUBU Records, the label formed last year by the urban-wear fashion entrepreneurs, and will reissue the Suave House Records catalog. 
Somewhat improbably, the rappers, hip-hoppers and rhythm-and-blues performers will be joining a distributor teeming with reissues of classical, jazz, ethnic, folk and spoken-word albums, many of them connoisseurs' choices pressed decades ago that met with critical acclaim but tepid sales. Through Koch, these performances have found a new generation of enthusiasts.
The reissued recordings represent 70 independent labels, including prestigious and decidedly noncommercial American labels like Smithsonian and Arhoolie and imports like Kyrichord Discs, Chandos and Melodiya. The operation has made the Port Washington warehouse a repository for performers as varied as Cajun accordionists, Celtic fiddlers and Peruvian pipers, music prized by collectors but unlikely to wrest shelf space from pop albums.
By massing the catalogs of dozens of small labels, Koch has achieved an economy of scale previously limited to the largest pop labels, making hundreds of obscure recordings profitable their second time around. 
In buying up rights, Mr. Koch specifies that his company be the sole distributor, in contrast to traditional arrangements. "If there was one thing we did that made us successful, it was probably insisting on exclusivity," he said. 
Michael Rosenberg, the president of the distribution subsidiary, predicted that record sales to adults would rebound, possibly soon. "People over 35 don't go into CD stores and browse very often," he said. "Older consumers will learn about a recording if it's mentioned in the news or if it's a soundtrack to a film they see. Otherwise, they feel they already own enough CD's. The key is to get them interested in a new recording and then reach them with other recordings that are similar in some ways but different in others."
Along with the old recordings, Koch also distributes hundreds of albums by contemporary performers, including those on a Buffalo label called Righteous Babes Records, founded by the singer and songwriter Ani DiFranco, called "the poster child for grass-roots indie success" by Billboard magazine.
Scot Fisher, Ms. DiFranco's manager, credited Koch with helping her recordings reach a wider audience. "It's important for Ani to have complete artistic control over her recordings, and we found out that isn't possible when you get distributed by the companies controlled by the major labels," he said. "You want a big distributor to go and kick the door in at Tower Records and get you in the bins, based on the muscle they have from their big-selling artists. But they want things their way in terms of the recordings."
"With Koch," he added, "Ani was able to keep artistic control over her CD's and at the same time get into the listening posts that Koch has set up at Tower Records. That was so important. Whatever Koch may lack in size, we saw them make up for it in hard work for their labels."
Koch has just 220 employees, and its current market share, just above 2 percent, is puny by the standards of the major record companies, but impressive for a business built on Elgar and Rossini, mariachi bands and readings by Gregory Corso, the Beat poet.
Holly Rosum, the director of membership services at the National Association of Recording Merchandisers in Marlton, N.J., said she found that Koch employees brought a combination of enthusiasm and expertise to their work that helped them compete against deep-pocketed competitors.
"They're passionate about their recordings and at the same time extremely knowledgeable," she said. "The people they deal with on all levels start feeling that way, too, about their products."
"These are thousands of marvelous recordings getting a second chance to be heard because of Koch," she added. "Without them, they'd be getting moldy in boxes in people's attics."

HEADLINE: First Take on New Taxes 

BYLINE:  By VIVIAN S. TOY 

DATELINE: HICKSVILLE 

 BODY:
DOMINICK DELIA gave the letter from Nassau County announcing the new assessed value of his house a quick read and then set it aside.
 "You have to be a lawyer to understand all this, and I'm not a lawyer," he said. The letter showed a lower assessment that would have meant a $198 reduction in his property taxes for this year. But with the wisdom of his 87 years, Mr. Delia said, "It looks like the taxes are down, but I'll believe it when I see it on the real bill." 
 This month, Mr. Delia and about 12,000 other homeowners in Hicksville became the first to receive notification of their new assessments. The county sent out about 143,000 letters in the last two weeks as part of Nassau's first countywide reassessment in 64 years. The remaining 273,000 notices will go out to property owners by Sept. 1. 
Interviews with about two dozen Hicksville homeowners found that many, like Mr. Delia, were a little befuddled by their assessment notices. But since the average assessment in Hicksville decreased by about 6 percent, many had received lower assessments and seemed content to leave well enough alone.
In fact, many believed the market value the county had assigned to their home might actually be a little on the low side, meaning their homes might be underassessed. But even if their letters showed a tax decrease, many were deeply skeptical, especially as next year's tax rates have not been calculated yet and their tax bills may still go up.
Take Matthew Fine, a Hicksville homeowner and hospital lab technician, who said his assessment notice showed a tax reduction. "But I don't believe it's going to happen," he said. "I mean, come on, taxes never go down."
There also was no shortage of homeowners who believed their homes might have been overassessed. In the four days after the Hicksville letters went out, 265 homeowners, most of them out to challenge their new assessments, had already made appointments to meet with officials from Cole-Layer-Trumble, the Ohio-based consultant the county hired to do the reassessment.
"I'm not surprised at all that some people obviously disagree with their new assessments," said Edward P. Mangano, the county legislator for Hicksville. "Errors were going to be inevitable in a process this monumental."
County officials said Hicksville was chosen as the first community to receive its new assessments because it is centrally located and it also fit the prediction that the revaluation would result in a third of assessments going up, a third going down and a third staying roughly the same. They hoped to learn from the response of Hicksville homeowners and use it to plan for the coming months as notices are sent out to the rest of the county.
The county usually handles about 50,000 residential assessment challenges a year, but Charles O'Shea, chairman of the county board of assessors, has already predicted a record number of challenges. The new assessments will be entered onto county tax rolls in January and will be used to calculate taxes starting in October 2003.
"Obviously people who get increases are not going to be happy and I expect challenges will be up," Mr. O'Shea said. "But these numbers will hold up to challenge."
He said that given the size and scope of the revaluation, "there are going to be some inaccuracies because we're only human." But, he added, "I think people will find in the end that this is not going to be as bad as they thought it would be."
County officials started the reassessment process two years ago in hopes of eliminating a widening disparity between tax bills and actual market values. The archaic system often benefited wealthy homeowners at the expense of lower-income homeowners and prompted charges of racism and thousands of lawsuits. Paying refunds to property owners who have successfully challenged their tax bills has cost the county about $100 million a year in the last decade and accounts for about $1 billion of the county's current debt, which is nearly $3 billion.
While most municipalities base their assessments on market value, Nassau used complicated formulas based not on market value but on construction costs of 1938 and land values of 1964. The method ignored long-term shifts in property values, leading residents of struggling communities where values have dropped over time to complain that they were being overtaxed while people in higher-priced areas paid similar or sometimes lower taxes.
The new system assesses properties at 1 percent of estimated market value, meaning a home assessed at $4,290 would sell for $429,000.
For people like Mr. Delia, whose assessment went down, the revaluation was welcome relief. Mr. Delia, a retired engineer for New York City's hospital system, said he long suspected his assessment was too high. But while the county assessed his home at $3,097, meaning an estimated market value of $309,700, he said he suspected he could get as much as $350,000 for his four-bedroom home. "I'm not going to tell them that, though," he said sheepishly.
Sean Acosta, president of Property Tax Reduction Consultants, an East Hills firm that works with about 10,000 Nassau County homeowners every year, said there would probably be thousands of homes assessed either too high or too low. Since only those whose properties are overassessed are likely to challenge their assessments and people like Mr. Delia can be expected to keep mum, equity even under the revaluation is relative, he said.
"You're never going to have 100 percent of the county fairly taxed because the market changes so quickly," he said. "But it's like income taxes. Is everything fair? No, but you have to settle on some kind of method to collect the taxes."
One source of confusion and skepticism among homeowners is that assessment changes do not necessarily translate into similar changes in tax bills. So just because average home assessments in Hicksville went down by 6 percent, estimated taxes did not go down by 6 percent.
That is because the consultant's estimates include recalculated tax rates designed to make sure localities continued to collect their full tax levy. If the overall assessed values within a school district went down, for example, the tax rate would be raised to keep the district's property tax revenues level. Nassau has nearly 400 different taxing jurisdictions, which together collect $3.5 billion in taxes annually.
The tax estimates also include calculations for tax exemptions like those for veterans, the elderly or the clergy. But the formulas are often complex, and homeowners looking for easy equations to check their tax figures will be out of luck.
Frank P. Cifarelli, for example, couldn't understand how the assessed value of his four-bedroom house could have been reduced from $5,000 to $3,000 and yet his projected taxes showed an increase of nearly $700. He said he suspected that his tax exemption under the state's School Tax Relief program might have been miscalculated, and an official told him on the phone that he might be right but that the exemption would have to be reviewed at a scheduled appointment with a consultant from Cole-Layer-Trumble.
Mr. Cifarelli, a retired county public works employee, said he also had questions about the $3,000 assessed value of his home, which means the county believes its market value to be $300,000. "That sounds high to me," he said. "It almost seems like they want to raise it to make you feel good, like your house is worth more and you can say, 'Hey, I got a $300,000 house here.' "
Ben Nadola, a spokesman for Cole, said the multistep reassessment process was thorough and ultimately "the marketplace dictates what the assessments are."
The first step involved the photographing of virtually all of the 416,000 properties in the county. The firm then reviewed property records for each structure at the county's Department of Assessment and compared the information with what they could see of a building from the curb.
Property owners then received a letter asking them to verify Cole's synopsis of the property. About 65,000 owners responded, resulting in revised records for 49,000 parcels, with changes like the addition or subtraction of a bathroom, garage or deck. Then for each home, the firm identified five comparables, similar homes in the same area that had been sold in the last three years, and calculated an average sale price to set the full market value, then divided by 100 to get the assessed value. Mr. Nadola said that the market value was a weighted average, meaning a comparable that more closely matched the subject home would be given more emphasis in the calculation, and that sales in which a buyer clearly seemed to have overpaid or underpaid were thrown out.
Mr. Cifarelli was told he would be given the addresses of the five homes used to figure out the market value of his home, and he said he was eager to see them. "I personally doubt that they could show me five houses that sold for that amount," he said.
Regardless of what the revaluation did for their property, most homeowners said they believed the reassessment was long overdue.
"I'm glad they finally changed the system," said Bob Findlay, a retired economist. "You couldn't explain it to anyone without getting laughed at."
In Mr. Findlay's notice, his three-bedroom home was assessed at $2,687, a figure he thinks is in the ballpark for homes that have sold recently in his neighborhood. Even though his taxes would have gone up by about $200 using the new assessed value, he said he would probably not challenge the assessment. "Taxes are reasonable here to begin with," he said, noting that Hicksville has a healthy commercial tax base, which helps keep residential taxes down.
Honey Skolnick, a 72-year-old grandmother who works part time at a local gift shop, was notified that the three-bedroom house she has lived in for 50 years had a market value of nearly $300,000. "That pleased me," she said. "Not bad from the $11,590 I paid for it." A tax reduction of more than $400 was also good news, and she said she did not even mind that she might have been overassessed for many years.
"It was time for a reassessment when you look at all the rich areas that paid nothing compared to the poor areas that were paying much more than their fair share," she said. "Some people will be hurt by it, but it was time for it all to be equal."

HEADLINE: Library Caught in Financing Feud 

BYLINE:  By WILLIAM S. BEAVER 

 BODY:
HOME to international dance programs and the second-highest circulation of Westchester County's 38 libraries, the New Rochelle Public Library is a model of success.
 But instead of focusing on serving patrons and sponsoring events this summer, the library is struggling for survival after its $3.4 budget was defeated in two votes. 
 On July 9, the budget was defeated 3,948 to 3,770 as voters flocked to 12 polling places. In an earlier vote, held June 12 at only one polling place, the Huguenot Children's Library, the budget was defeated 2,208 to 1,518. 
Until recently, money for the library has come from the city's municipal budget. The total 2002 city budget is $76.6 million, of which $2.8 million is allocated for the library.
But New Rochelle learned this year that it was not in compliance with a state law passed in 1996 that requires school districts to submit their budgets to a public vote. The legislation also affected four Westchester public libraries that were chartered by local school districts. 
Ossining and Chappaqua have voted on library budgets for decades and Mamaroneck has done so since 1990. Not a single one of those budgets has been voted down. 
Maurice J. Freedman, director of the Westchester Library System and president of the American Library Association, said support for libraries in the county was very strong and the budget votes were usually a formality.
"Who really wants to say no to libraries?" Mr. Freedman said. "Most people would pay an extra penny of tax to give their librarian an appropriate salary."
In fact turnout was high in both library votes. By comparison, in a May vote on the school district budget, 2,650 of New Rochelle's 37,000 registered voters went to the polls.
But the issue in New Rochelle has moved beyond the issue of support for the library. 
"The Republicans are making this a political issue," said Arnold Klugman, chairman of the Democratic city committee. "We have tough economic times and they are using the library just to make matters difficult for the city's Democratic administration."
Republicans say the library's budget is inherently a political issue because the library's board of trustees, who are not elected, are creating a new tax.
"The city has been mismanaged for the last 10 years under the Idoni administration and Democrat-controlled council," said Douglas Colety, chairman of the Republican city committee. "They tried to use the library as a way to circumvent tax caps that protect the people and cover up their financial troubles."
Under the proposal put before voters, the library would be financed by a new tax, approximately $200 annually for a family of four, on residents' property tax bills.
The New Rochelle City Council had hoped to use the money previously set aside for the library to cover a projected deficit. Now it is scrambling to cut costs. On Tuesday night, the council voted to cut $1.39 million from the budget, eliminating 27 city jobs, street cleaning and closing one firehouse. 
The library board of trustees will meet Tuesday to explore options and has retained a lawyer, said Rob Seitz, a trustee.
The city will continue to provide the money to keep the library open through this year. 
If a budget approved by voters is not be in place by the end of the year, the alternatives include continued city funding, direct state aid, temporary closure and emergency intervention by the commissioner of education.
While the library's fate is uncertain, what's clear is that the issue has set off an intense political feud.
"It's going to be war until next November," said Mr. Colety.

HEADLINE: The View From/Fairfield; 
A Fitting Place for Artists to Take Up Residence

BYLINE:  By KENNETH BEST 

 BODY:
DURING its peak as one of Fairfield County's first-tier retailers, the D. M. Read Company was not only the department store of choice from 1926 to the mid-1970's, but it also served as a cultural center.
 In addition to presenting highly decorative window displays, Read also sponsored exhibitions by artists and craftsmen from the region and around the world. 
 Situated at the corner of Broad and John streets in downtown Bridgeport, the 100,000-square-foot store played host to afternoon book discussion groups led by such literary luminaries as Clifton Fadiman, a former book editor at The New Yorker magazine.
Now, after being abandoned since 1981, the old department store is coming full circle as clean up is under way to convert the building into an artists' colony by sometime in mid-2004. 
The renovation of Read is being directed by Artspace Projects Inc. of Minneapolis, a nonprofit agency that provides long-term living and working space for artists and their families at below-market rates.
"It's a really exciting project," said Thomas Nordyke, vice president of Artspace. "I think one of the things that has helped is that it is modeled around other projects in other cities.
"Every community we approach as a long-term commitment, not to do one project and go home. Hopefully that's the beginning of a long-term relationship with that community."
The $11.5 million project is the latest in a series of redevelopment efforts aimed at reviving activity in the Park City's downtown area (adjacent to Interstate 95) and a previously dormant waterfront.
During the last five years, the downtown area has been awakened by the relocation of Housatonic Community College from the city's East Side and the construction of the Ballpark at Harbor Yard, home to the Bridgeport Bluefish, a minor league baseball team, and the Bridgeport Barrage of Major League Lacrosse.
Last year there was the opening of the Arena at Harbor Yard, which in addition to bringing minor league hockey and Division I college basketball games to the city, also became the new site of the circus founded by the city's most famous citizen, P. T. Barnum. The circus returned to the city for the first time in nearly a half a century.
The Read building will be transformed into 63 one-, two- and three-bedroom apartments that combine studio and living space ranging from 1,100 square feet to 1,600 square feet. There will also be exhibition space on the first level of the building.
Sarah Constant, president of Mission First, a real-estate development group assisting Artspace, said the artists would pay from $260 to $820 a month for rent, in addition to having "tremendous benefits, such as well-designed space for their work needs, high ceilings and plenty of natural light."
One of the artists who hopes to live in the building is Jim Reed, a professional printer since 1970 who has lead a nomadic existence as an artist. Through the years he has had to move his 30 lithography stones, three presses and various other equipment several times as landlords have sold properties or evicted him. He creates his own work but is also a printmaker for other artists.
Mr. Reed lives in an apartment in Ansonia. His studio is at the Remington Arms building on the East Side in Bridgeport. He has previously lived and worked in Milford and South Norwalk and once worked in a storefront in Norwalk. "This eviction thing has taken a toll on me over last 20 years," Mr. Reed said. "It would be nice to know things are stabilized and not have to look over my shoulder from a landlord." 
The Bridgeport project came about after the city of Norwalk rejected the idea of converting an old lock factory into space for living and working for a group of artists.
C. William Kraus, an independant consultant, first contacted Artspace when he was trying to relocate the artists in Norwalk.
Mr. Kraus was referred to several economic development people in Bridgeport and eventually came in contact with the Bridgeport Economic Development Corporation, which obtained financing for the project after working with city officials and private groups.
William Finch, a state senator and the president of the Bridgeport Economic Development Corporation, said he was surprised by the response to a meeting in December 1999 to determine the interest in the Artspace project.
"We put a flyer out around town and 60 people showed up," he said. "We didn't realize how many people thought artist housing in downtown Bridgeport was an exciting idea. It got a lot of people's imagination."
Mr. Kraus said: "It was a very interesting and great response. It tells you a couple of things. It tells you there are a lot artists in the region and that people are willing to relocate to Bridgeport from a great distance. This kind of building in an urban setting can be an attraction for new urban pioneers. Not only is it great to have artists in the community but, from an economic point of view, they are a catalyst for attracting other businesses." 
Eileen Walsh, who began working in metal sculpture three years ago, said she would be looking forward to living and working in the same space. With a day job as a manager of recreation art therapy at a Stamford adult day-care center for people with Alzheimer's disease, she creates her artwork after hours.
Ms. Walsh, a native of Bridgeport who now lives in Stamford, used to visit the Read store regularly as a child with her grandmother. 
"You never can find space; you're always getting kicked out," said Ms. Walsh, who started doing sculpture art after taking a class at Bullard Havens Regional Vocational Technical School in Bridgeport. "I did work at Bullard Havens when I was signed up as a student but I had restricted hours. I do most of my work at night. I'm a night person. Having your own studio to work at your own creative time is important."
Giving new life to the building will also help efforts to restore the adjacent properties in the area, said Michael V. Rosso, a vice president of People's Bank, who is the chairman of the Bridgeport Economic Development Corporation.
A fire earlier this year damaged the adjacent Pollock Building, which housed a restaurant, a sandwich shop and is also part of the cluster of buildings that includes the historic Arcade Mall and Hotel.
"The concept is to create a nice corridor starting on Fairfield Avenue and running right down to State Street," Mr. Rosso said. "There are some beautiful historic buildings rehabbed with law offices, and the new federal courthouse."

WITH interest rates lingering at attractively low levels and little land available for new development, the demand for Fairfield County houses continues to be strong, except for homes at the extreme high end of the price scale.
 A similar fever is evident in the market for condominium apartments. This is in sharp contrast with the rental market, where some complexes are offering concessions to individual tenants and leasing blocks of apartments to corporations as inexpensive substitutes for hotel rooms. 
 Nationwide, exceptionally strong demand for houses seems to be confined mainly to the New York metropolitan area, Washington and San Francisco, according to John Tuccillo, an economist and real estate analyst in Arlington, Va. These areas, he said, "are in a bubble, in danger of a repetition of the 80's, yet there is no bubble nationally." He expects little change in the next 15 to 24 months. 
In the meantime, brokers in the county are riding high. Paul Breunich, managing partner at William Pitt Real Estate in Stamford, is exuberant. "Our first six months are off the charts," he said. "We are up 30 percent in closings and up to 12 percent in prices."
But other executives take a bit more cautious view. "Prices reached a point where the consumer got smart," said Mary Ann Evick, president of Raveis Homelink Real Estate. "Some inventory seems to be sitting. What sold in a day is now taking three weeks." 
The median price of homes listed for sale in Greenwich is currently $2 million, according to figures compiled by Raveis, and in Stamford, $670,000. But the prices of actual sales in January to June of this year were $1.39 million and $501,000, respectively, up 24.1 percent and 16.6 percent from a year earlier. 
Even in Greenwich, though, not everything is lofting toward the stratosphere. Victor Borge's house overlooking Greenwich Harbor has been on the market for a year and two months, said Gideon Fountain, a broker at the Cleveland Duble & Arnold Corporation. "It started at $30 million, came down to $18 million, then $16 million. The only soft spot is the very high end. Everything else is selling fast."
Overpricing has caused some houses to linger on the market, said Elayne Jassey, sales executive at Prudential Connecticut Realty in Stamford. "Buyers are willing to pay -- they know its a seller's market -- but they're not willing to be gouged," she said.
There has been a trend in Fairfield of trading up within the same town, as home buyers and their agents make private contacts through cocktail party chatter.
Vincent DiMasi, for instance, paid $350,000 three years ago for a two-bedroom cottage on an acre in Westport. "He put very little money into it," said his broker, Addie Conti of Raveis Real Estate. "We sold it last month for $860,000 and sold him another house in Westport for $805,000."
"The stock market has declined," said Mr. DiMasi, whose business is insurance and finance. "So I thought spending a bit more on real estate would yield potential profits. Before we can put the new house on the market, it needs about $120,000 worth of landscaping and interior work." The four-bedroom 2,800-square-foot house was built in 1942 by an architect with a taste for the unique, he said. "It will go back on the market for $1.43 million in about a year, and I'll probably buy another house in Westport." The cottage he sold will be knocked down by its new owner, who will build a new house for around $3 million, Ms. Conti said.
The condominium market in the county also seems energized. Many units are being snapped up by downsizing empty-nesters who want a local pied-a-terre for the months they do not spend at a vacation home elsewhere. Condos are also sought by young couples, young families and singles who are not ready for a house but prefer to build equity in a condominium rather than in the troubled stock market. 
This renewed popularity has pushed condo prices up in tandem with single family homes. Raveis's figure for the median sale price in Stamford in January through June was $215,000, up from $190,000 last year. In Norwalk the median was $226,000, up from $174,000 last year.
The robust demand for condominiums has produced a major change in plans for a large mixed-use development on the Stamford waterfront. Admiral's Wharf, a $250 million complex proposed by Collins Enterprises Inc., was to include 620 rental apartments in four buildings, but the company recently applied to city boards for a switch to condominiums.
"We will have 580 condos," said Arthur Collins Sr., the company's chief executive. "The market is much stronger for condos than rentals, although some of the affordables may wind up as rentals." The reduced number of units reflects the fact that condominium apartments tend to be larger than rental apartments, he said. Final approvals are expected in August with construction to start in the fall. "There's so much rental supply, it could take years before it's absorbed," Mr. Collins said.
Richard Redniss, a principal at Redniss & Mead, development consultants, has participated in the development of some 1,200 apartments in Stamford in the past few years. "This is not overbuilding," he said. "This is a correction. We have had a lot of demand for rental housing, and developers and investors have been trying to beat that demand and make money. We are beginning to catch up, but it takes time, especially when we have vacant commercial space and fewer jobs pushing the demand down."
The weakness of the rental market is not limited to apartments; a similar slump is recorded in the market for summer vacation properties. "For the first time in memory," said Eugene Kelly, head of Kelly Associates in Darien, "summer rentals are not renting. Year after year we'd rent the same houses for the same people who go to Nantucket and Martha's Vineyard and Fisher's Island. They've gone, but they won't be picking up that income."
The combination of high prices for homes and a glut of rentals has some people holding off on buying houses, according to Garth Schwamm, a rental broker at Prudential in Stamford. "They feel rentals are so good they are comfortable renting for a year or two, thinking maybe the housing bubble will burst." He noted that the Classic and the Windermere, large apartment buildings that usually rent in-house now welcome real estate agents.
A BANQUET of concessions is being offered at a number of apartment complexes. At Newbury Commons on Washington Boulevard in Stamford, the first month's rent is free and rents have been reduced for one-bedroom apartments from $2,200 to $1,995; two-bedrooms from $2,500 to $2,200 and three-bedrooms from $4,500 to $3,500. Included in the rent are a health club with trainers, indoor parking, an indoor-outdoor pool, 24-hour concierge service, a convenience store that delivers cooked meals, an A.T.M., a business center and dry cleaning and laundry service. 
The inducements being offered by AvalonBay Communities, which has a nationwide presence and deep pockets, are a bit narrower. According to Mark Forlenza, regional vice president of development, "rents that vary widely in the five Stamford complexes have been reduced 4 percent and any additional concessions have been targeted to only 50 apartments out of over 1,800." 
Empty apartments are frequently turned into corporate accommodations, many of them negotiated by Oakwood Corporate Housing, headquartered in Los Angeles. "We have 50 units at Avalon Grove," said Susan DeSimone, the district manager in Stamford. "We usually take a block of apartments, furnish them, supply linens, dishes, electronic and kitchen appliances. It's a turn-key situation." Leases are by the month at $135 to $155 a day, depending on the number of bedrooms. "We deal with Fortune 1,000 companies like Cendant, Purdue Pharma, Kraft, UBS, Xerox and G.E.," she said. "Right now we have no vacancies." 
Robin Stein, Stamford's longtime land-use planner, remarked: "We knew sooner or later that the rental market will have to adjust, that supply was increased dramatically in the last couple of years."
He predicts that the sales market will also eventually experience changes. "When interest rates start creeping up," he said, "the high-priced houses will again be worth less than their mortgages."

HEADLINE: ECONOMIC VIEW; 
A Question Of Accounting Has No Easy Answer

BYLINE:  By DANIEL ALTMAN 

 BODY:
WASHINGTON and Wall Street are buzzing with speculation that companies may soon be required to treat stock options as expenses. The options are worth something, because they give employees a chance to buy company stock at a discount in the future. Calling them expenses, of course, would take a bite out of reported earnings. Yet much of the debate has lacked careful consideration of the question that matters most: How would the decision affect the economy as a whole?
 Economists' knee-jerk answer is "not at all." Companies have been offering options as compensation for years. One has only to read and understand the footnotes in reports by publicly traded companies to the Securities and Exchange Commission to learn how many options were granted in a year. Simply calling the options expenses changes the accountant's bottom line, economists say, but it doesn't change the economic bottom line. There is no free lunch; investors should know that the company will bear the cost of the options either way. 
 Unfortunately, it's not quite that simple. Even though the information is readily available, not everyone puts in the time and effort to read all the footnotes.
Robert Willens, a managing director specializing in taxes and accounting at Lehman Brothers, was surprised at how few of the specifics his clients knew. "They weren't quite as familiar with the procedures and the amounts as I thought they might have been," he said. "I'm finding that they weren't familiar with the footnote or they weren't aware of the information."
To the extent that investors are surprised by the amount of options that companies grant, those companies would indeed suffer reversals. The investors would lower their expectations for earnings, and share prices could take a one-time hit. That could limit companies' ability to grow by acquisition.
That said, the hit might not be very big. Mr. Willens does not expect companies to dole out fewer options, he said, because they would still cost slightly less than grants of stock. "Even expensing, you still get something of a break compared with other forms of compensation," he said.
Without a change in compensation, employees still have an incentive to work hard, leaving a company's prospects intact. There would be no reason for share prices to fall. Investors would then see price-to-earnings ratios rise, but with no cause for concern.
This still sounds fairly rosy, but there's one more fly in the ointment. Figuring out how much those options are worth is downright difficult, and it could open the door to more problems.
Mark Rubinstein, a finance professor at the University of California at Berkeley, explained it this way: To figure the value of an option when it's granted, you have to estimate the company's future ability to generate dividends and the volatility of its share price. These tasks are manageable for the kind of short-lived options that trade like wildfire in over-the-counter derivatives markets, but they're not at all easy for the sort of long-term options companies use to pay their employees.
"The percentage error that you make in dividends isn't too important for a short-lived option, but for a long-lived option it affects the value much more," Professor Rubinstein said.
In the case of volatility, he added, "if you go out longer, of course it gets harder to estimate." The combination of these problems means that two people, using the same formula for an option's value but with varying assumptions, would reach different estimates.
THAT kind of uncertainty could make investors less willing to invest, which could ultimately reduce the amount of capital available to a company. Companies in need of capital to grow might shy away from options and remove performance incentives from pay packages. Workers might put in less effort, reducing productivity and slowing the rate of economic growth.
One way to encourage a company to get the options valuation right, Professor Rubinstein said, is to bind it to its mistakes. A company would have to declare as an expense its estimate of an option's value on the date an employee could exercise it and buy the stock. If the guess proved too low, the company would have to book extra expenses to make up the difference. 
This solution could lead to some pretty complicated accounting. Any alternative, though, could be better than the present situation. As Robert H. Herz, the new chairman of the Financial Accounting Standards Board, put it, "When you have accounting that masks reality, you're going to get all sorts of strange things happening."

HEADLINE: Investing; 
Is the P/E Ratio Becoming Irrelevant?

BYLINE:  By DANIEL ALTMAN 

 BODY:
IN the stock listings in many newspapers, only one calculated statistic appears next to the trading activity for every issue: the price-to-earnings ratio. But lately, an avalanche of earnings restatements has made the denominator of the ratio, earnings, a flimsy indicator of real money-making at a growing number of the country's biggest businesses -- tarnishing the ratio, too.
 Little wonder that some mutual fund managers are thinking twice about using P/E ratios even as a first cut for picking stocks. But what should they -- and individual investors -- use instead? 
 There are no easy answers. "The valuation process is an art as much as it's a science," said Thomas J. Dillman, co-chief of global research at Deutsche Asset Management. He and his colleagues have spent more time lately questioning the assumptions of their formulas. 
"There's a lot more conversation about how you really got to the numbers that you're using to determine whether a stock is overvalued or undervalued," he said.
The P/E ratio, typically calculated using the latest 12 months' earnings but often using year-ahead projections, was once the undisputed champion of stock eyeballing. As Robert J. Shiller, the contrarian Yale economist, wrote in 1996, "The simplest and most widely used ratio used to predict the market is the price-earnings ratio."
Many stock pickers used it as late as the mid-1990's as the first measure of a share's prospects. High P/E ratio? That meant either a growth stock, worth the risk for participation in a bright future -- or maybe one that was just overvalued. Low P/E ratio? That meant a value stock -- possibly good for steady dividend income.
In the Internet boom, that logic went out the window. Companies' prospects were measured in page views, clicks and how fast the businesses were burning capital. After the start-ups unwound in 2000 and 2001, investors may have thought it safe to trust the ratio again. No such luck. Those reported earnings could vanish with the wave of an accounting whistle-blower's hand.
SOME stock pickers still stand by the P/E ratio as a useful tool. "The first issue from my perspective is generally valuation, and the major valuation measure from my perspective is price-to-earnings ratios," said Douglas D. Ramos, a senior equity portfolio manager at Dreyfus.
But even Mr. Ramos does not always use P/E ratios. Companies with few or no earnings are not rejected out of hand but are subjected to other metrics.
There are alternatives. "We're using cash flow available for dividend payments," said Marilyn G. Fedak, the chief investment officer for American value stocks at Sanford C. Bernstein. She said her company had never used P/E ratios. Looking at cash flow, she said, "helps you get behind all the accounting issues that can cloud how much you understand, as an outside investor, of what a company is really doing."
Mr. Dillman's company prefers to gauge stocks' prospects with a statistic called cash flow return on investment, a measure that compares a company's cash receipts to its cost of capital and the return on competing investments. But can ordinary investors make sense of such a mouthful? "Some of the caveats and assumptions that underlie all of these things are pretty arcane," he allowed. "If we started to put cash flow return on investment numbers instead of P/E's, no one would know what they meant. I can't think of anything that would be necessarily better in terms of what belongs in the newspaper."
Accounting shenanigans can render substitutes for P/E ratios based on cash flow just as useless, analysts warn. "The problem with cash flow," said Burton G. Malkiel, a professor of financial economics at Princeton, is that it "is subject to exactly the same kinds of problems that the 'E' is subject to." 
Analysts often use earnings measured before a company pays taxes and interest on debt, or deducts depreciation and amortization, as a proxy for cash flow. But this measure, called Ebitda, also ran into problems recently, said Mr. Ramos at Dreyfus. "WorldCom has sort of showed you that you can't necessarily trust cash flow either, as defined by Ebitda," he said.
Even an apparently transparent measure of a company's potential, like the price-to-sales ratio, can be misleading, according to Professor Malkiel.
"Think of the telephone companies that would swap their fiber optic networks," he said. "They've got all this excess fiber optic capacity in the ground. At an inflated price, I sell you some fiber optic capacity; you sell me some fiber optic capacity. They tell you there's a business purpose for this, but then the sales are overstated."
A certain amount of analysis of a company's books will always be based on trust, Ms. Fedak at Sanford C. Bernstein observed. "Unless you're going to sit there and you're going to count -- looking through all the invoices and receipts -- you can't be 100 percent sure," she said. 
Mr. Ramos agreed that putting companies under multiple microscopes would help. "You look at the balance statement, you look at the footnotes, you do a lot more fundamental research, and you question things more in this market environment," he said, "although you should have been doing that two years ago."
When companies can be trusted to disclose their true earnings, Professor Malkiel said, one can again look at P/E ratios. "I don't think there's anything wrong with the valuation metrics that we use, including price-to-earnings multiples," he said.
Even if all companies told the truth, there would still be some wiggle room. Many economists recommend using forecasts, rather than earnings from the past year, to calculate P/E ratios. A share's price represents the value of profits yet to be earned, the thinking goes, so the appropriate ratio would use the company's best guess about those profits. But that guess is inevitably subjective.
"A lot of what goes into that P/E is a lot of variables based on individuals' and analysts' expectations of the future," Mr. Dillman said.
Those views can change with the market, Mr. Ramos added. "What you're dealing with is investors' time horizons," he said. "They expand in bull markets and they contract in bear markets. The fact of the matter is that the reality is somewhere in between."
The cautious mood on Wall Street is likely to affect those expectations and horizons. Even companies that have not had to restate earnings from previous years may rein in their forecasts. That could mean that investors will have to become accustomed to higher price-to-earnings ratios.
Indeed, P/E ratios may have been held down artificially for a long time. Ms. Fedak said she believes that earnings have been inflated for years before the recent periods for which companies have been revising results. "There have been all kinds of ways, over time, that companies have used for creative accounting," she said, adding that she expects P/E ratios to creep upward.
This trend is likely to be accelerated by corporate decisions, like those by Coca-Cola and by a handful of other companies last week, to count the cost of options as expenses, which reduces earnings.
Trying to tell whether a share -- or the whole market -- is overvalued by comparing its past and present P/E ratios might make little sense. If investors' expectations take time to catch up to more cautious earnings reports and higher P/E ratios, the market could be headed for more trouble.
"I just don't believe all these earnings," Professor Shiller said. "If you don't believe them, then P/E ratios are really high. Investors are not going to tolerate that."

HEADLINE: MONEY & MEDICINE; 
Health Care Appeals Are No Snap

BYLINE:  By MICHELLE ANDREWS; Michelle Andrews is a freelance writer in Manhattan specializing in health care. Her column on its economics appears the third Sunday of each month. E-mail: moneymeds@nytimes.com.

 BODY:
IMAGINE that you're sick and your health plan turns you down for treatment you consider essential. For some people, this scene is all too real. 
 In 42 states and the District of Columbia, you can appeal your health plan's decision to an independent reviewer that will evaluate the evidence in your case and make a ruling. Last month, the Supreme Court gave its official stamp of approval to state laws governing that appeal process, ending longstanding uncertainty about its legality. 
 For consumers, having access to an independent review is certainly better than nothing -- especially when the patients' bill of rights, which would mandate such reviews, is still stuck in Congress. But the situation is hardly ideal. State laws vary widely, and even the most consumer-friendly ones force people to navigate a thicket of regulations, a daunting process for patients who are already sick and scared. 
Most states require consumers to first exhaust the internal appeals process of their plan. That can mean going through two or more levels of review, which can take months.
There are other stumbling blocks. About a dozen states limit who can use the process, excluding, for example, people who are part of preferred provider organizations or have individual health plans. California, Texas and Connecticut refuse to review after-the-fact denials. This means that if you get the treatment you think you need and then try to reverse a denial retroactively, your case won't be considered. In some states, you have just 20 days or less to file an appeal after a denial. The list goes on. 
Many cases are not pursued all the way through the system. In New York, for example, consumers appealed 25,527 denials to their health plans in 2000, but only 910 made it through external review, said Joanna Rose, spokeswoman for the New York State Insurance Department.
Karen Ignagni, chief executive of the American Association of Health Plans, a trade group based in Washington that supports independent review, said the low numbers showed the positive effect of health plans' internal appeals processes, which resolve disputes that might otherwise have gone to external review.
But Karen Pollitz, project director at Georgetown University's Institute for Health Care Research and Policy, isn't so sure. Pennsylvania's experience illustrates how many people drop out of the process before the independent review stage. From January 1999 to September 2000, consumers filed nearly 8,200 appeals with their health plans. At the first level of internal appeals, the health plans upheld their own decisions 55 percent of the time, said Ms. Pollitz, who recently wrote a report assessing state external review programs. 
But despite losing their appeal, only 1,062 consumers, or 24 percent, went on to the second level of internal appeals. At the second appeals level, health plans upheld their own decisions 58 percent of the time, but an even smaller proportion of consumers, 124 people, or 20 percent of the 618 who had been denied, went on to file an external appeal. 
"It seems people just get worn out, and they don't go on," Ms. Pollitz said.
That's unfortunate, because there is evidence that people who persevere can be successful. Five years ago, chronic lymphocytic leukemia was diagnosed in Terry Rigdon, 59, a sales clerk from Tulsa, Okla. When chemotherapy failed to halt the progress of the disease, she said, her doctor suggested a bone marrow transplant. That is a reasonable treatment for a relatively young, healthy person for whom standard treatments are not working, according to an expert, Dr. Wyndham Wilson, head of the lymphoma section of the Center for Cancer Research at the National Cancer Institute in Bethesda, Md. But Mrs. Rigdon's health plan said it denied the request, calling the procedure experimental.
Mrs. Rigdon waived her rights to her health plan's internal appeals process and went directly to an expedited external review. All states allow accelerated reviews in cases when a patient's life or health is in imminent danger. With the help of her nurse and the Patient Advocate Foundation, a nonprofit organization in Newport News, Va., Mrs. Rigdon submitted a case file of supporting documents from her doctor and articles from medical journals demonstrating the appropriateness of the treatment. Within days, her health plan's decision was overturned. 
Mrs. Rigdon was lucky to have had outside help; many patients are not as fortunate. Ron Pollack, executive director of Families USA, a consumer health care organization based in Washington, says state ombudsman programs are necessary to ensure that people get the help they need. Nineteen states currently have such programs in place for people covered by private insurance. 
"Many people are intimidated by the idea of going up against the big H.M.O.," he said, "and unfortunately, they're often too sick and too frail to appeal at the time when the service is essential."
Pity.

Travel Slump Is Translating Into Luxury for Less

BYLINE:  By JANE L. LEVERE 

 BODY:
THESE are tough times for the travel industry. Concerns about the stock market, the economy and potential terrorism have led many people to rethink or even forgo their travel plans, leaving some airlines, hotels, cruise lines and tour operators scrambling to fill vacancies.
 But for consumers still willing and able to travel -- sometimes at the last minute -- that means more discounts, particularly from high-end companies, many of which have been hurt severely. Many of those discounted luxury vacation deals can be found online. 
 David and Cookie Maleh of Brooklyn say they found a good deal on a last-minute trip to Barbados last spring. The Malehs and another couple stayed at Sandy Lane, a five-star resort on the beach. For $3,129 a couple, they each received roundtrip coach air fare and four-night accommodations, including breakfast, golf privileges and spa treatments. Such a trip would normally cost $4,737 a couple, according to Wanderluxe.com, a new service the Malehs used to made their arrangements. 
"It was a first-class trip," said Mr. Maleh, 36, a children's clothing manufacturer.
Deals like these certainly abound, but not every vacation package may be a bargain -- or even very luxurious. 
AllLuxuryHotels.com, for instance, sells rooms at 1,800 hotels worldwide, but only 20 percent of them are rated four and a half or five stars; a five-star rating is the industry standard traditionally deemed luxury. The remainder are rated at four stars.
Most travel Web sites do not display prices of the various components of the packages, so consumers have no quick way to know how much of a discount they are receiving unless they try to price a comparable trip on their own. (At Wanderluxe, coach air fares on its vacation packages are 20 to 60 percent off retail prices, while hotel rates at AllLuxuryHotels.com may range from no discount to up to 70 percent off the published rate.)
Sometimes, travel Web sites may not include important information like weather trends at destinations.
"You could be buying a hotel room in the Caribbean in the hurricane season, and you might not know this if you were buying simply on price," said Perry Lungmus, the executive vice president for marketing at Virtuoso, a consortium of high-end travel agencies.
Wanderluxe, which is now being tested, is owned by executives of the World Travel Specialists Group, a corporate travel agency in New York that said small stakes in Wanderluxe are held by Delta Air Lines and American Airlines, a part of AMR. Another site specializing in discounted, upscale travel is LuxuryLink.com. About one-quarter owned by Gannett, the large news media company, LuxuryLink has sold discounted hotel packages, cruises, tours and other vacations, both through auctions and at fixed prices, since 1998. LuxRes.com sells individual hotel rooms and hotel packages, often at discounts. The site, started last spring, is controlled by the Leading Hotels of the World, a distribution and marketing company for five-star hotels.
Other sites include two hotel consolidators that began selling discounted four- and five star-hotel rooms last summer: the Premier Collection service of the privately held Quikbook.com, and AllLuxuryHotels, a division of Hotels.com, a majority of which is owned by USA Interactive. Among others are 1st-Air.net, a broker that has sold discounted first- and business-class airline tickets since 1997, and firstclassflyer.com, which went on line last spring. It does not sell air travel, but it has published a monthly newsletter with advice on finding deals on first- and business-class fares since 1996.
Henry H. Harteveldt, an analyst in San Francisco for Forrester Research, which specializes in technology, says sites like these are proliferating "because there's an awful lot of excess inventory out there."
"They help bring customers that these properties and carriers might not necessarily know," he said.
Many of the travel industry's woes stem from a drop in business travel over the last 18 months, industry analysts say. Business travelers, who traditionally patronize luxury hotels, are either cutting back on their number of trips or staying at less expensive hotels. The problem of excess supply has been aggravated, analysts say, by the fact that many high-end lodging and cruise companies have added hotels and ships in recent years.
BJORN HANSON, who oversees the hospitality practice at PricewaterhouseCoopers, says luxury hotel companies in particular are working with the luxury travel sites because their business has been so weak. He predicted that on any given night this year, about one-third of the 600,000 most luxurious hotel rooms in the United States will be vacant. He also forecast that revenue per available room for domestic luxury hotels, which slid 11.6 percent last year, will dip an additional 0.8 percent this year, while revenue per available room for all types of hotels nationwide, which dropped 7 percent last year, will fall 0.7 percent. The revenue calculation is widely used in the industry to measure a hotel's performance.
Dr. Hanson also said travel Web sites were getting far more luxury hotel rooms to sell than in the past.
"The Internet no longer has the image of being just for price-sensitive travelers looking for cheap rooms," he said.
Still, travelers should take precautions when booking a hotel room, cruise or travel package online. To find out more about a site's reputation, they can talk with other travelers, try travel chat rooms or contact the Better Business Bureau to check if any formal complaints have been lodged.
Shoppers should also make sure that they understand a site's booking rules and policies. Sites like Quikbook allow travelers to look, book and buy online, while others like Wanderluxe sell only by phone through an agent. Although some sites permit cancellations and changes for a fee, vacations sold by others, like Wanderluxe, are usually nonrefundable. 
Consumers should make their purchases with a credit card, experts say; if there are problems, or if a site fails, they may have recourse through the card issuer.
Comparison shopping is important, too. Rates on a Web site can be checked against those offered by travel agents and other sites, as well as those offered directly, both online and off, by the hotel, cruise line or tour operator. 
For instance, a 12-night Pacific cruise for two departing on Aug. 24 on the Seabourn Spirit was $2,390 cheaper on Cruise411.com, a site that sells many types of discounted cruises, than on LuxuryLink. But a search failed to find a price lower than the $249-a-night rate available from Quikbook next month at the Peninsula hotel in Chicago; the next cheapest rate was $295, obtained from the hotel's reservations department and Web site.
"If you know what you're doing, you can get a trip for one-third to one-half off," said Kay Latona, 58, a retired lawyer from Fort Lauderdale, Fla., who has bought three vacations for herself and her husband Jack, 63, a lawyer, through LuxuryLink over the last two years. Her most recent trip was a 10-night Kenyan safari in June; it cost $5,515 a couple, without air fare.
"If you hit it right, it's a big win," she said. "But if you haven't, it's not the end of the world, because if you wait two or three months, that trip will probably come up on the site again."
You may not want to wait too long, however.
"There's no guarantee these sites will have the same access to inventory they do now as the economy starts to recover," said Mr. Harteveldt, the Forrester analyst.

HEADLINE: PRELUDES; 
Creditworthy?Be Credit-Wary, Too

BYLINE:  By ABBY ELLIN; Abby Ellin is a Manhattan writer. Her column on starting out in the world of money appears the third Sunday of each month. E-mail: preludes@nytimes.com.

 BODY:
I LIKE to think of myself as a fairly intelligent, financially sophisticated person. I know that big businesses don't always have my best interests at heart, that the customer is rarely right. I pride myself on not being a sucker.
 So you can imagine my annoyance when I read my most recent MasterCard bill and noticed two annual percentage rates: 14.5 percent for purchases and 19.99 percent for a $300 cash advance I took out in February. 
 As a rule, I pay my credit card bill in full, or at least in large chunks. I try to keep my balance below $3,000. What I didn't know was that my payments didn't cover cash advances. I also didn't know that I was being charged a monthly rate for purchases but a daily one for the advances (or that it's possible to have several A.P.R.'s on one card).
I called Citibank and asked how to pay off the cash advances. Online? Impossible. At the A.T.M.? No. In person at the bank? Sorry. Although I can do just about all my banking electronically these days, short of having my PC spit out money, I was told that I cannot pay cash advances that way. I had to send a check to a special unit, thereby accruing even more interest charges until the check arrived. 
You probably think that I'm a little naive, but I was genuinely stunned. If I'm finding all this a bit confusing, how about other young people, particularly college students and recent graduates? Within weeks of arriving on campus, most students are bombarded with credit card applications. 
"College kids are a good market -- the balances are low, so the risk to the lender is very small," said Howard Dvorkin, the founder of Consolidated Credit Counseling Services in Fort Lauderdale, Fla. 
Seventy-seven percent of full-time undergraduates at four-year schools have credit cards, according to a 1999 study by Michael E. Staten, a business professor at Georgetown University. While many students can manage their debts, some with help from their parents, others run into problems. A recent report by the National Center for Education Statistics found that 41 percent of graduating college seniors had $3,000, on average, in credit card debt. 
Credit card companies entice students with incentives like free baseball caps, compact discs, mouse pads and cheap airline tickets. Many schools encourage such solicitations; they usually get perks themselves whenever students, alumni or employees sign up. (First USA, for example, is paying the University of Oklahoma $13 million over 10 years, and gives the school 0.4 percent of every purchase made on the university "affinity" card.)
"It's hard when you're 18 or 19 and everyone else seems to come from money, and Visa, MasterCard and American Express are throwing offers of $3,000 at you," said Steve McKelvey, now 36, who works for a paper company in Valley Forge, Pa. As a student at the College of Wooster, in Ohio, Mr. McKelvey was issued four different cards, even though he had no income. 
Mr. McKelvey graduated in 1990 with a degree in music, along with $27,000 in student loans and $13,000 in credit card debt. Several months later, he was in bankruptcy court.
Eventually, he consolidated his student loans through the Pennsylvania Higher Education Assistance Agency -- those loans don't disappear even if you file for personal bankruptcy -- and began the task of rebuilding his credit. He has no black marks on his credit report today, he said, and his student loans will be paid off in March. "I will finally know, at the age of 37, what it's like to have no debt," he said.
Kevin Rubel, 22, cannot wait to see that day. Until last July, he was a student at Northeastern University in Boston, majoring in marketing. In three years, he had maxed out five cards, for a total of $6,000. That, compounded with $15,000 in loans, left him deep in red ink. He had to move back home to West Palm Beach, Fla.; he is now a senior at Florida Atlantic University. He also works two bartending jobs and pays Mr. Dvorkin a $15 fee each month to help him sort it all out, along with $500 to be distributed to the credit card companies.
"This is the toughest year of my life," he said. "There should be restrictions on credit card companies. They shouldn't be allowed to do what they do."
Some schools, like Georgetown University and the University of California at Irvine, have banned credit card solicitation on campus; the State of Arkansas requires universities to offer credit seminars at freshman orientation. The MBNA Corporation, a credit card giant that issues cards to students, conducts such sessions on campuses, as does Mr. Dvorkin's service.
Interestingly, Mr. McKelvey thinks the onus is on the student. "Obviously, companies are more aggressive than they've ever been, but the issue of personal responsibility has got to be raised in any discussion," he said. 
TRUE, young people must use credit responsibly -- and exercise restraint when they see that hot new leather jacket at the mall. It is also the responsibility of schools, parents and the credit card companies to educate them. 
After hanging up the phone with Citibank, I immediately mailed a check. I called 10 days later; the check had arrived, but I was told that I still owed $4.75 in interest. As a favor, the customer service representative offered to move that over to my purchase charges. 
And by the way, he asked, had I heard about the new gold card that the bank was offering? It has the same $50 annual fee as my current card, which accumulates frequent-flier miles on American Airlines. But the new one requires fewer miles for a free ticket. And, oh yes -- it also has "flexible spending," which means that I could go over my $13,100 credit limit.
"As long as you pay back what you go over that month you're fine," the customer representative said; otherwise, there is a $29 monthly fee on top of regular charges. "So, do you want it?" he asked.
I thought for about 20 seconds, weighed the options, inhaled deeply and asked how soon it could arrive. How's that for self-control?

CORRECTION-DATE: July 28, 2002

 CORRECTION:
The Preludes column on the Personal Business page last Sunday, about student credit card debt, misstated some financial circumstances from the student years of Steve McKelvey, who is now 36 and employed at a paper company in Valley Forge, Pa. Mr. McKelvey said that he incurred the bulk of $27,000 in student loans and $13,000 in credit card debt while a graduate student at the University of Michigan and in a later relocation, not as an undergraduate at the College of Wooster in Ohio, and that he had indeed received income from student jobs.
The column also misstated the year in which Mr. McKelvey graduated from Wooster. It was 1991, not 1990.

HEADLINE: NEIGHBORHOOD REPORT: LOWER EAST SIDE; 
Not on My Sidewalk: The Battle Over Street Trees

BYLINE:  By KELLY CROW 

 BODY:
Trees grow almost everywhere in this city, some in pits of earth between slabs of sidewalk. Councilwoman Margarita Lopez, who represents the Lower East Side, has seen many such trees grow to the point of cracking their concrete confinements, and she knows better than to blame them for the damage. 
 Ms. Lopez has spent the last 18 months trying to pass a law that would require the city to ask people's permission before it plants any more sidewalk trees. More specifically, she wants to give property owners a legal way to reject trees offered by the Parks Department or private groups. 
 The bill is now before the Housing and Buildings Committee. If it dies in committee, Ms. Lopez will try again in the fall.
Last week, Rosie Mendez, the councilwoman's chief of staff, said the bill was not prompted by a particular tree or by a general dislike of them. Indeed, Ms. Lopez's district, the Lower East Side, regularly clamors for more greenery. 
"We are not trying to seem antitree here," Ms. Mendez said. "This is not really even about trees. This is about economic injustice."
What bothers Ms. Lopez is that city law has long held building owners responsible for repairing sidewalks that border their properties. The cost to fix a tree-buckled stretch varies, but $8 to $27 per square foot is average, said Keith Calb, a Transportation Department spokesman.
A brownstone owner is responsible for the sidewalk to the curb. Store owners could be liable for up to a block of sidewalk. Last year, the department doled out 3,000 sidewalk violations, most of them tree-related.
"We know the price tag can be high," Mr. Calb said, "but our agency's first concern has to be with pedestrian safety, not trees."
The Parks Department is concerned about trees, however, particularly the reduced presence they might have on city sidewalks if the bill becomes law.
"Please let us keep planting trees," said Jane Rudolph, a department spokeswoman, "and I promise we'll come shave the roots, we'll trim or do anything to keep them there." KELLY CROW

HEADLINE: Corporate Bad Guys Make Many Seek the Road Less Traveled 

BYLINE:  By RACHEL LEHMANN-HAUPT and WARREN ST. JOHN 

 BODY:
JUST three years ago, Ameet Shah, 24, was successfully laying the groundwork for life as a corporate titan. After graduating from Duke University, he had landed a $50,000-a-year job in New York at J. P. Morgan Chase, working 100-hour weeks on deals involving companies like Enron and Kmart. But no sooner had Mr. Shah settled into the perks of his new career -- expense accounts, car services and enough cash to support an apartment in a doorman building -- than his world was shaken by a market downturn and a stream of stories about corporate malfeasance. The deals -- and the perks -- dried up, many of his colleagues were fired, and Mr. Shah got a peek at capitalism's dark side.
 "I saw people who put 15 years of service into the company get laid off in a day because of the irresponsible behavior of corporate executives," he said. "I started thinking that I didn't want to be associated with that." 
 Mr. Shah's disillusionment eventually became so complete that in June -- sometime between the indictment of L. Dennis Kozlowski, the chairman of Tyco, for tax fraud and the news that WorldCom had improperly accounted for $3.8 billion in expenses -- he quit J. P. Morgan Chase and joined Teach for America. He now lives in a dorm room and teaches summer school in a classroom without air-conditioning in the South Bronx, training to earn $35,000 a year. 
Where once a tough assignment may have meant fielding a call from an angry managing director, Mr. Shah said, "Last week I had to confiscate a weapon from one of my students."
Those in the current generation of aspiring professionals face a world they scarcely could have imagined three years ago, when they were filling out business school applications and Robert W. Pittman still seemed invincible at AOL. Not only is the job market grim but also the ethos of corporate America is under the cloud of what Alan Greenspan has called a culture of "infectious greed." 
This unpleasant reality has forced a reassessment of values among many at the start of their professional lives. For some, that means simply asking tough questions about their motives for getting into business in the first place. Others, like Mr. Shah, have decided that conspicuous consumption is not all it was cracked up to be. While not quite marching en masse to ashrams, they are choosing jobs that are more personally and spiritually rewarding and even -- gasp -- altruistic, according to interviews with dozens of recent graduates and career guidance officials. 
"Those who are sitting on the fence about corporate careers are definitely exploring other options in public service and nonprofits," said Beverly Hamilton-Chandler, the director of career services for Princeton University. "Students are somewhat more wary of business, and many are doing more research and asking more questions about the stability of the company." 
While there are always a few on the fringes who seem destined either to run for president or to open a Marxist bookshop, most graduates enter the real world straddling a sense of idealism and practicality and choose their careers by following the cultural winds or the influence of peers, parents and their heroes of the moment. 
In the 1970's, a wave of young idealists took to journalism, inspired by the Watergate reporting of Bob Woodward and Carl Bernstein. In the 80's, young liberal arts majors flocked to Wall Street aspiring to be the next Henry Kravis. In the mid-90's, the fantastically successful initial public offerings of Netscape stock and the tale of the company's whiz kid programmer, Marc Andreessen, spurred legions to embark on careers in computer technology. But what do you do when the good guys are anonymous investigators from the Securities and Exchange Commission?
"The fake revenues, the depreciation tricks, the personal loans to executives," said Murad Sofizade, 25, who is pursuing a joint degree in business and public service at the Harvard Business School and the Kennedy School of Government. "It's all an example of the kinds of abuses of power I read about in the public sector of underdeveloped countries." Mr. Sofizade had planned to work for an American corporation for several years before applying the lessons of the free market to problems like third world poverty. After the recent scandals, he said, "I'm now more inclined to go to the public sector directly." 
"My belief was the private sector was more efficient, and apparently that's not the case," he said. "It's a major shock for me."
Part of that shock comes from the fact that many of the new economy moguls studied by the recent crop of economics majors and business school graduates are the very people now under scrutiny for various alleged bad acts. Rob Zeaske, 29, an Iowan who graduated from the Harvard Business School in June, said that when Jeffrey K. Skilling, the former Enron chief executive, spoke to his class a little over a year ago: "We were enthralled by a company that was changing its industry. It was the spirit our class came in on. Everyone in our class wanted to work for this guy."
A year later, "People are scratching their heads and approaching a meeting like that with a different set of eyes," Mr. Zeaske said. "They're looking for an ethical component. That's a major change." As part of a new Harvard Business School program that seeks to place recent graduates in the public sector, Mr. Zeaske is moving to Portland, Ore., to join Mercy Corps, a humanitarian agency.
For those already set on a life of good works, the scandals have had a validating effect. Alana Clements, 22, a graduate of Williams College, said she has known since she was 13 that she wanted to be a nurse. She has been accepted at the Yale School of Nursing and is taking a year off to do a medical internship in Ecuador and to work in public health in Peru, possibly at an orphanage. News of corporate deceit, she said, "has confirmed my desire to be far away from business."
"I had friends who were going into banking," she said. "It's a little more abstract than taking care of people."
Of course, it is much easier to take a low-paying job at a nonprofit when your corporate-minded classmates can't find work. According to the National Association of Colleges and Employers, the number of graduates hired from the class of 2002 dropped 36 percent from the previous year. Wall Street has been affected as well. Data from the Labor Department indicates that there were 729,000 securities industry jobs in the country in June, down from a high of 780,000 in January 2001.
Some career counselors say that the weaker job market, combined with the aftereffects of the Sept. 11 attacks and the disclosures of executive malfeasance, have caused people new to the job market to deliberate more about their career choices. In the late 90's, when high-paying jobs in technology were plentiful, many young people embarked on careers of convenience, only to be forced to face hard questions about their true callings in their 30's -- after being laid off. 
"We think this is a positive step," said Sheila Curran, the director of career services for Brown University. "Taking the time right after college to figure out your passion will make you less likely to make bad decisions in the future." Ms. Curran said that at a career conference at Brown last semester, one of the most popular panels was called Off the Beaten Path and included a juggler, a professional triathlete, a freelance writer and a musician. 
But for the relentlessly business-minded, it is not the corporate scandals that create a problem so much as the resulting news coverage and Congressional scrutiny. 
"I do not take this to be an indication of widespread corruption in corporate America," said Jason Crawford, 22, who majored in computer science at Carnegie-Mellon University and who is working at a New York investment firm. "I'm worried that the government and the S.E.C. might use this as a way of grabbing power. If I become a businessman, am I going to be presumed guilty? That's the big question. I'm wary of that backlash."
Fred Ball, a managing director at Goodrich & Sherwood Associates, a New York human resources and consulting firm, advised recent graduates to plan careers based on their interests and not on trends in the market or culture. "There are always going to be issues out there, whether it is the savings and loan scandals in the 80's or the run-and-gun 90's or what's happening now," he said. 
"Young people shouldn't make decisions based on these temporary things," he added. "They should make them based on their skill sets, their interests and their passions."
To parents who have paid tens of thousands of dollars for their children's educations, the phrase "chasing your passions" may sound like 20-something shorthand for "doing something wildly irresponsible." Mr. Shah's parents, who immigrated to the United States from India and run a Super 8 Motel in Lexington, N.C., were none too pleased to hear that their son was rejecting Wall Street. 
"In the beginning I was disappointed," said Harsha Shah, Mr. Shah's mother. "I thought, 'He's giving up this great life going to work in a bad area.' "
Mr. Shah's parents have reluctantly come around. "A person should love what they do," said Umesh Shah, Mr. Shah's father.
Many of the adventures of wayward young professionals will no doubt end up as fond memories stored in picture frames on Wall Street desks. And, of course, not every renunciation of corporate culture is voluntary. Last week Kathryn Carlson, 24, a Wellesley graduate who lives in Boston, lost her job in the mergers and acquisitions department of Robertson Stephens when FleetBoston announced that it was shutting down the company. 
"When I graduated in 2000, it seemed glamorous," she said. "All my friends were doing it, and the money was seductive. But when I found myself working into the middle of the night making money for the Enrons and the WorldComs, it became a lot harder to justify." 
Ms. Carlson is now studying for the Foreign Service exam and in her spare time, practicing her violin. "I don't have a clear direction of what I'm doing next, but I definitely know that it is not going to be banking," she said. "Part of me thinks that I should go surfing in Thailand, or I actually have a friend who has a farm in India. . . . "

HEADLINE: Pass Ideas to Center Aisle. American Needs 'Em. 

BYLINE:  By EDWARD WONG 

DATELINE: CHICAGO 

 BODY:
MARY FRANCES FAGAN thought she had done her part to help salvage the world's largest airline. She had spent weeks brainstorming over American Airlines' chronic problems. How to turn a profit. How to trim costs. How to make people work harder and airplanes fly more efficiently.
 Then the idea struck her like a wave of turbulence: sell advertising space on the back of boarding passes, as grocery stores do with receipts. 
 "They sent my idea to the advertising department," she said with a wide grin over a chicken sandwich at O'Hare International Airport. "We could make a lot of money." 
As a regional manager of corporate communications at American, Ms. Fagan might not be the likeliest person to come up with new ways of generating revenue. But this is supposedly the brave new flight path of American, where every worker is being asked for suggestions. "Everything is on the table" is the catch phrase, and company executives say they are exploring all possible ways to bring down costs, from adjusting taxiing speed to rescheduling arrivals and departures here so jets turn around faster.
But in trying for greater efficiency, American is not so much leading the field -- as it did in the 1980's and early 90's -- as playing catch-up to healthier full-service rivals like Continental Airlines, some analysts and industry executives say. And it is jealously trying to copy some techniques that have made Southwest Airlines the only consistently profitable major carrier. To some eyes, much of the tinkering makes American look increasingly like a petulant schoolchild being forced to take summer classes to keep up with its cleverer peers.
The company has yet to introduce revolutionary ideas to bring down labor costs or to revamp a complex fare structure that has driven away many business travelers. It has remained guarded about what big changes, if any, are in the works, and it says no breakthroughs will occur before year's end.
"Anything they can do on the cost side can only help them," said Jim Corridore, an analyst at Standard & Poor's. "But these things are not enough. Certainly the larger issues are the only ones that can help in the long run. The wages are out of whack. The business fares are too high. Nobody is addressing the fare issue."
Darryl Jenkins, an airline consultant and director of the Aviation Institute at George Washington University, said that tweaking the O'Hare schedule was a step in the right direction and that American might overhaul its fare structure after it gradually makes its hubs in Chicago, Dallas-Fort Worth, St. Louis and Miami more cost-efficient.
But the airline must take more immediate steps to stanch its bleeding. On Wednesday, AMR, its parent company, reported a second-quarter loss of $495 million, only slightly less than in the period a year ago and mildly better than its first-quarter loss of $575 million, the largest of any airline. It lost $1.76 billion last year and, analysts say, will lose close to that this year. 
AMR's revenue per available seat mile, a standard benchmark, was 9.83 cents in the second quarter, a 10.6 percent decline from last year, worse than most rivals.
The company's shares closed at $12.01 on Friday, less than one-third of their 52-week high of $36.23 last August.
Donald J. Carty, the chief executive, has been upfront about American's "dire financial straits." But he also eagerly promotes the retooling effort. Some people in the industry say the soul-searching is wrapped up in Mr. Carty's desire to leave his mark on a company so closely linked to his predecessor, Robert L. Crandall, who retired in 1998 after 13 years leading AMR and, in many ways, the industry.
Mr. Carty, 55, was an executive vice president for finance and planning before he was appointed president in 1995. A lanky native of Montreal and a graduate of the Harvard Business School, he has a reputation for being less hot-tempered and hardheaded than Mr. Crandall. Months after taking over as chief executive, Mr. Carty was seen wearing reindeer antlers and a "Star Trek" mask while partying with Make-a-Wish children. He quickly doled out more travel perks to workers and tried to smooth over volatile relations with unions.
In a recent telephone recording, he told employees he had received 900 suggestions on efficiency improvements in an "Ask Don Carty" e-mail box. Many changes under consideration could greatly affect the travel experience, from permanently keeping meals off shorter flights to massaging hub schedules in a way that forces passengers to wait longer for connections. Executives are even re-evaluating American's most appreciated innovation: the removal of two rows of seats from 875 planes to add more legroom in coach.
"We're much more focused on making fundamental changes and trying to accelerate in a whole lot of ways," Mr. Carty said in a recent interview in New York. "We need to be more productive, we need to be more effective as an organization, we need to be more responsive. We need to learn a lot of lessons from some of the new airline models."
BUT the profitable model he was referring to -- the one used by no-frills carriers like JetBlue Airways -- was actually conceived three decades ago by Southwest, American's crosstown rival in the Dallas area. Analysts and executives say American has a long way to go before pulling off a similar revolution. They argue that such a breakthrough is necessary if American is to lead the full-service carriers from their dependence on the economic cycle.
"No airline is going to go out of business because it taxis too slowly or puts too many nuts on its sundaes," said Jamie Baker, an analyst at J. P. Morgan. "AMR's efforts to reduce costs may help the margin, but they don't address the basic design deficiency of its business plan."
Airlines like American that use hubs and spokes, funneling large numbers of passengers to connecting flights in central airports, should rethink their business models, said Alfred E. Kahn, a professor of political economy at Cornell who oversaw deregulation as chairman of the Civil Aeronautics Board in the late 1970's. The airlines traditionally offset high fixed expenses -- like those from costly labor contracts -- by relying on pricey tickets bought by business travelers. But that works only when the economy is prospering.
During downturns, those carriers stumble while ones like Southwest keep turning profits by not having to maintain hubs and by generally operating with low costs. On Thursday, Southwest reported a second-quarter profit of $102.3 million. Mr. Carty appears to be both envious and resentful of Southwest, liberally taking potshots at it. "We won't be 'Wal-Marting' American Airlines," Mr. Carty said in one of his weekly telephone messages to employees. "There are elements of our full-service airline that have tremendous value."
AMERICAN'S plans do not include abandoning the hub-and-spoke model, which it popularized under Mr. Crandall. No airline executive has come up with a better way to move large numbers of people across a broad network. But some analysts say American's cost-cutting is just shuffling in Southwest's footsteps without taking the necessary big leap.
American is trying to persuade passengers to use electronic tickets by charging an extra $20 for paper ones. Southwest introduced e-tickets in 1995, before any other major airline, and 85 percent of its passengers now use them. After Sept. 11, American shut down 107 ticket offices -- 14 in the Chicago area -- in the hope of having customers buy more tickets online. Southwest never had ticket offices and started online booking in 1996.
American has cut meals from most domestic flights of less than four hours. Southwest has never offered more than cookies, pretzels and chips, even on long flights. American has been trimming its number of plane types to 7, from 14, to save on training and maintenance. Southwest flies just the Boeing 737.
"I think the growth of those carriers and the growing amount of our network competitive with them is one of these trends we're going to take account of," said Henry Joyner, senior vice president for planning at American.
Even though Southwest's flights are often likened to cattle cars, its chief financial officer, Gary Kelly, sounded somewhat smug about hub-and-spoke airlines chasing Southwest's shadow. "It's clear that we have the cost advantage," he said. "It becomes crystal clear in tough economic times like this. We intend to stay the course and keep our focus on our costs to ensure that they're low."
The operations here at O'Hare, American's second-largest hub, after Dallas-Fort Worth, provide a window into the kinds of changes the airline is trying to make. From the gates to the ticket counters to the gray bowels of the churning baggage room, American has taken stabs at revamping. But much of it follows what rivals have already done.
Mr. Carty, though, boasted of one potentially radical experiment -- uncoupling arrival and departure schedules here. Hub-and-spoke carriers schedule all flights coming from the same direction to arrive at roughly the same time, shortly before those leaving in other directions, allowing passengers to transfer quickly. This results in two major inefficiencies: Peak hours become too congested; and workers and planes spend too much time sitting at both hubs and spokes during lulls.
In April, American changed its schedule at O'Hare so flights would not have to connect so closely and planes at spokes could turn around more quickly. Turnaround times have decreased 13 percent, the company said. This has allowed American to use planes and workers more efficiently; the airline has eliminated the use of three planes and the equivalent of five gates. 
The schedule is also more even now. Before April, for example, American had 31 departures from 1:14 to 1:47 p.m., and just three from 1:48 to 2:49. Now, about 15 planes leave in the first period and 20 in the second.
The downside is that connecting passengers now wait an average of 50 minutes, instead of 35 or 40, said Bernard J. DeSena, an American vice president at O'Hare. On the other hand, he added, labor is more efficient, and passengers boarding at Chicago have more varied departure times.
"It is more efficient from a manpower standpoint," acknowledged Kevin Knight, vice president for resource planning at United Airlines, American's main rival at O'Hare. "They have their operations spread throughout the day. They're betting on the fact that customers will wait."
Mr. DeSena said, "You have to look at a lot of things before you call this a success." It is not yet clear how much American has saved, or when it might try the same experiment at its flagship hub in Dallas-Fort Worth, Mr. Joyner said.
BUT American remains a hub-and-spoke airline, which ultimately limits how fast it can turn around its jets. Southwest never has to worry about that. It does not synchronize its flights so closely, and its planes usually turn around within 20 minutes.
The scheduling changes may not be obvious here, but many travelers have taken note of the 35 blue self-service kiosks scattered around the ticket counter. Ms. Fagan, the American spokeswoman, said 40 percent of passengers who are eligible to use the check-in kiosks, meaning those with e-tickets and traveling alone or in small groups, did so last month, a higher proportion than at any other airport. The airline has 221 kiosks at 29 airports and plans to add 450 by year-end, with 19 arriving at O'Hare in the next few months.
That allows American to thin an entire layer of labor. But it is not leading the way in this technology. Continental began setting up kiosks in 1995 and has 631 in domestic airports.
In trying to improve efficiency, American is equipping some ground employees with hand-held computers similar to Palms. Mechanics in San Jose, Calif., are experimenting with such devices to call up reference information quickly. If executives approve further financing, American could roll out 800 of these at 20 maintenance centers before year's end.
At O'Hare, up to 10 such devices are already being used occasionally by ticketing agents to check in passengers. In a dim, cavernous basement, where conveyor belts churn with luggage, some baggage-handlers are armed with hand-held computers that reads information from bag labels.
Again, American is blazing no trail with these devices. United has been using them for about three years and now has 3,000 of them worldwide.
Some of American's streamlining seems only an attempt to jettison dead weight that came with its purchase of Trans World Airlines in April 2001, a merger that some analysts and consultants faulted because it added too much capacity. For example, American is changing the cockpit configuration of all its T.W.A. jets so pilots do not have to be trained multiple times. Part of American's fleet simplification program includes retiring the Boeing 717's and DC-9-30's acquired in the merger.
After Sept. 11, American also trimmed some frills. It took magazines off planes, which it said saves $2 million a year, and pared its food offerings.
"The airlines are realizing that that's a way to keep costs down," said Christine Turneabe-Connelly, a spokeswoman for Southwest. "It's something we've known for 31 years. Travelers would much rather pay less for their air fare and skip their meal."
STILL, American has not come up with solutions to the two gaping problems that many analysts and executives say keep all hub-and-spoke airlines from making consistent profits. The first is high labor costs, inflated by generous work rules and partly rooted in antagonism between unions and management. For example, American and its pilots' union have reached an impasse in contract talks and are turning to a federal mediator.
Mr. Carty warned employees recently that more layoffs were ahead, on top of the 20,000 jobs eliminated last fall. But that won't change the labor cost model.
American also appears no closer to fixing the broken fare structure. Executives at the major airlines acknowledge that they have to simplify fares, paring dozens of arcane choices to something more akin to the four or five tiers offered by Southwest. "It's clear that something dramatic needs to be done, but it's too soon to know what that something is," Mr. Carty said last month in a speech in New York.
American executives still cringe at memories of the rivers of red ink in 1992, when the company simplified its pricing by offering only four kinds of fares. That ignited a price war. Travelers snatched up great deals, but the airlines suffered huge losses.
"The industry is too focused on cost reduction and insufficiently focused on redefining the revenue model," Sam Buttrick, an analyst at UBS Warburg, wrote last Monday in an investors' note.
But for now, American is not putting in place any truly radical changes. Marty Heires, a spokesman, was cryptic about "the big breakthrough items," saying only that "it'll be the end of the year before we see any of those plans rolled out."
Until then, executives will keep poring over the hundreds of ideas tossed around by workers like Ms. Fagan. 
After finishing her sandwich, she walked across the concourse to the self-service kiosks. A man was pulling out a boarding pass. She took it from him and held up the back of it. Her eyes sparkled as she envisioned an ad there.
"Perfect. This is just perfect," she said. "This is what we need."

HEADLINE: INVESTING WITH/Jeffrey L. Rippey and Kurt M. Havnaer; 
Columbia High Yield Fund

BYLINE:  By CAROLE GOULD 

 BODY:
THE difference in yields between junk bonds and United States Treasury securities has grown wider -- sometimes to eight percentage points or more. But that does not mean that all junk bonds are necessarily bargains, say Jeffrey L. Rippey and Kurt M. Havnaer, the co-managers of the $415 million Columbia High Yield fund.
 Treasuries maturing in at least a decade now yield nearly 5 percent, while the Merrill Lynch U.S. High Yield, Cash Pay index which tracks corporate bonds that are not investment grade, yielded 12.6 percent at the end of June. That is partly because some bonds of WorldCom and Qwest Communications International were downgraded to junk status in May, pushing up their yields. On June 30, for example, the 7.5 percent WorldCom issue due May 2011 yielded 51.4 percent. "The telecommunications industry is one of the biggest industries in the high- yield marketplace," Mr. Rippey said from his office in Portland, Ore., "and many people think a lot more companies in the industry will go bankrupt." 
 Telecomunications issues now yield about 28 percent, on average, according to the index. Among junk bonds over all, the default rate is averaging about 10 percent over the last 12 months, according to Moody's Investors Service.
Columbia sold its last telecommunications holdings in the spring and is free of them for the first time since the fund started nine years ago. Telecommunications bonds, meanwhile, have swelled to 8.7 percent of the Merrill Lynch index, up from 6.6 percent in March, because of the downgrades.
The fund returned 3.2 percent a year, on average, for the three years through Thursday, ranking in the top 5 percent of all funds that buy junk bonds, also known as high-yield bonds. The category lost 3.9 percent a year, on average, according to Morningstar Inc. The fund gained 0.5 percent in the 12 months through Thursday, versus a loss of 3.7 percent for its group.
Mr. Rippey, 45, is senior vice president of the fund's adviser, the Columbia Funds Management Company, a unit of FleetBoston Financial. Mr. Havnaer, 36, is a vice president of Columbia Funds Management, which oversees an additional $500 million of junk bonds, mostly for institutions.
Among managers of junk-bond funds, Mr. Rippey and Mr. Havnaer take a relatively conservative approach. They focus on the financial strength of individual companies, in addition to economic and industry data, to skim off the stronger issues. Over all, the portfolio issues have a weighted average credit rating of BB. (Junk bonds are those rated below BBB- by Standard & Poor's.)
"We concentrate on companies that we think have improving credit quality," Mr. Havnaer said. Ideally, they want issues that will move up to investment grade in two to five years.
The managers work with two analysts to choose the 60 issuers in the fund from more than 650 in the Merrill Lynch index. The fund's credit analysis model reviews each company's balance sheet, income and cash-flow statements.
One variable is the interest-coverage ratio, which shows how much cash a company generates internally to cover interest on its debt. Another is the company's ratio of debt to total capitalization, which tells to what extent balance sheet assets have been financed by debt and equity. 
The managers review five years of financial data, looking for upward trends. "Most important, we consider whether the trend will continue and lead to credit improvement or deterioration," Mr. Rippey said.
The managers expect the economy to improve in the next couple of years, but very slowly, with gross domestic product growth averaging about 3 percent a year, Mr. Havnaer said. "So we're not willing to buy very cyclical companies at this point," he said, and they are focusing instead on consumer companies.
In December, the managers bought 8 percent bonds issued by the Cott Corporation of Toronto. The bonds, due in December 2011, are rated B+ by S.& P. They paid $974.99 for each $1,000 face value for the issue, which closed on Friday at $1,000. Cott, which produces private-label soft drinks for Wal-Mart and other retailers, is moving into the bottled-water business, which Mr. Havnaer said should help increase sales and improve profit margins.
THE managers also bought 8 5/8 percent bonds due in August 2006 issued by Constellation Brands, formerly Canandaigua Brands, of Fairport, N.Y. They paid $1,052.50 for the bonds, which are rated BB and now trade at $1,050.
Constellation, the beer, wine and distilled-spirits company, has historically dealt in lower-priced wines, Mr. Havnaer said. But it has been acquiring producers of higher-priced wines with higher profit margins, which he said should aid cash flow.
Another favorite is XTO Energy, based in Fort Worth. "XTO acquires reserves that are already producing oil and gas," Mr. Havnaer said, "which is a less risky strategy than drilling in the ocean off Africa and hoping to hit a big one." As it makes more acquisitions, it should benefit from lower operating costs, he said, and its financial picture should continue to improve if energy prices rise.
The managers bought 7 1/2 percent bonds due in April 2012 and rated BB. They paid $1,000; the issue closed on Friday at $1,030.

HEADLINE: NEIGHBORHOOD REPORT: BROOKLYN UP CLOSE -- BUZZ; 
Back When the Usher Was a Brooklyn Girl Named Barbra

BYLINE:  By ROSALIE R. RADOMSKY 

 BODY:
THE SETTING -- A six-day trip by members of the Theater Historical Society of America to visit 24 defunct and operating movie theaters and playhouses in and around New York. A group of theater building enthusiasts, 202 strong, they came from across the country and from as far away as Canada, England and Australia. 
 On a recent sunny Friday, they toured six theaters, including the Loew's Kings on Flatbush Avenue in Flatbush, Brooklyn, a 1929 gem, now empty, in which a pigeon or two flew over the dusty maroon seats. (A subgroup of roller-coaster fans later managed a side trip to Coney Island.)

THE BUZZ -- Suzanne Whitten, who writes about movies, from Welland, Ontario, couldn't wait to see the Kings. "My fiance was at the Kings in 1976 before it closed, and I fell in love with him after he showed me his slides," she said. The couple had met on a similar outing, to visit Cleveland's historic theaters, in 2000.
 At the Kings, whose ornate terra cotta facade is worn but intact, the group rented an electric generator for $1,000 to light up the interior. The building had been unlocked for the occasion by the city's Economic Development Corporation, which owns the structure.
Orlando Lopes, a Brooklyn native and a walking encyclopedia of Brooklyn movie house lore, was instantly drawn to a dimly lighted ornamental bird above the stage. "That's the original peacock," he said. He effortlessly pinpointed the birth and death of the Kings, which opened its doors on Sept. 9, 1929, with "Evangeline," starring Dolores del Rio, and closed on Aug. 30, 1977, with "Islands in the Stream." 
Mr. Lopes also told the group that the full-size basketball court in the basement, where ushers once played, was intact. A few "ahs" pierced the ethereal light when he mentioned that a Brooklyn girl named Barbra Streisand worked as an usher at the Kings in 1958.
"If anyone knows Barbra, tell her to write a check for us," suggested Richard Sklenar, the white-haired executive director of the 1,100-member organization, which is based in Elmhurst, Ill. 
Rebecca Callister, a 16-year-old volunteer tour guide at Cleveland's Playhouse Square, which has four restored theaters, knew a movie palace when she saw one. "When this is restored," she said, "it'll beat the pants off us." ROSALIE R. RADOMSKY

HEADLINE: Investing; 
A Bet on Drugstores, If Not Drug Makers

BYLINE:  By ELIZABETH KELLEHER 

 BODY:
DRUGSTORES expect a strong tail wind from an aging population that will take more pills. Like-minded investors see the sector as a handy way to invest in health care, a contrast to pharmaceuticals, an industry where uncertainties abound about new products and political pressures.
 "I want to invest in health care long term, through a drugstore," said Blaine P. Rollins, manager of the Janus fund, which holds 15 million shares of Walgreen. 
 But analysts warn that only those chains that deftly manage the industry's various pressures will thrive. 
The "front ends" of drugstores -- which stock consumables that account for a third of sales -- are under assault from discount-store competition. Moreover, fewer new blockbuster drugs in the pipeline may hurt "back end," or pharmacy, profits.
Robert Summers, an analyst at Banc of America Securities, does not recommend the sector at all because he believes that drug-price inflation, 6 percent last year, will slow. In addition, during the 1990's, the share of prescriptions paid for by insurance or other third parties more than doubled, to 82 percent, according to IMS Health Inc. of Westport, Conn. That shift cut profit margins.
Filling huge volumes of prescriptions is one answer, said Mark Miller, an analyst at William Blair & Company. "Walgreen has handled the transition well," he said, "but second-tier stores have been hurt."
Walgreen fills 1,900 prescriptions a week per store, according to Andrew P. Wolf of BB&T Capital Markets. He estimates the comparable numbers at 1,600 for CVS, 1,500 for the Eckerd Drugstores division of J. C. Penney and 1,200 for Rite Aid.
Mr. Rollins at Janus said investors should look at chains that are expanding and are able to recruit scarce pharmacists.
Walgreen, with 3,785 stores in 43 states, leads the pack in market capitalization and growth. It plans to add a net 10 percent more stores this year, in contrast to a 10 percent net shrinkage by its three largest competitors, Mr. Miller said.
But Walgreen shares may be overvalued. Meredith Adler, an analyst at Lehman Brothers, who has a buy rating on Walgreen, nevertheless said of the stock, "It is hard to get excited, given its price." It now trades at $32, or 32 times her estimate of 2002 earnings.
CVS, however, looks cheap at $25.80, less than half its early 2001 peak of $63.75. Ms. Adler says she thinks the worst is over for the company. Last year, CVS suffered staffing and inventory problems, cut prices and missed profit estimates.
"Credibility is an issue," said Alison Kerivan, managing director at David L. Babson & Company, an investment adviser who does not recommend buying CVS.
Stephen C. Chick, an analyst at J. P. Morgan, recommends CVS. "It had too many balls in the air," he said, "but its stock will recover." The company says it is hiring pharmacists, taking tougher steps to cut shoplifting and fraud and changing prices to improve profit margins.
But Mr. Wolf at BB&T said the company's biggest mistake was buying Revco in 1997, well before last year's missed numbers. The purchase raised market share, he said, but many of the 2,600 stores were badly situated.
Rite Aid has been hurt by an acquisition binge and accounting scandals that have led to criminal charges against five officials. In reporting losses in 2000, Robert G. Miller, the chief executive, pointed to former management's "overly aggressive expansion." Mr. Miller joined the company in December 1999 and is credited with repairing the situation.
Still, Rite Aid shares remain volatile. The company is "not out of the woods yet," said Margaret A. Gilliam, the president of Gilliam & Company, a research firm.
Karen Rugen, a Rite Aid spokeswoman, disagreed. She points, for one thing, to the fact that its debt has shrunk to $4.1 billion from $6.6 billion when Mr. Miller took the helm.
"There may be a turnaround afoot, but it is a slow one," Mr. Wolf countered. He believes that until Rite Aid raises its sales per square foot closer to Walgreen's level of $628 in the last fiscal year, it cannot make a case for earnings power. Rite Aid estimates its sales per square-foot at $386.
Anthony M. Maramarco of Babson manages a mutual fund that holds 4.5 million shares of Rite Aid, half bought when the price was near $2 in February. While he feels like a loner, he said, "We still think we are right." The stock now trades at $2.19.
David Magee of SunTrust Robinson Humphrey recommends Duane Reade, a Manhattan-based chain that derives 60 percent of sales from New York City, where business slowed after Sept. 11. Duane Reade is a "riskier small cap with near-term potential" as New York's economy recovers, Mr. Magee said. The stock trades at $25.01, up from $16.50 when it went public in 1998, but down from $39 last August.

HEADLINE: MARKET INSIGHT; 
Chip Makers Held Down By Sluggish Recovery

BYLINE:  By KENNETH N. GILPIN 

 BODY:
IT'S hard to feel better about technology stocks in general if you don't feel good about the manufacturers of semiconductors. If the chip makers aren't doing well, most technology companies won't, either.
 The good news is that conditions are looking better in chipland. The bad news is that it's a relative judgment, because the downturn of the last two years was terrible. And investors are treating the industry horribly. 
 The Philadelphia Stock Exchange's semiconductor index rallied in the first three months of 2002 but has sold off sharply since, and is now down 30 percent so far this year.
Jonathan J. Joseph, an analyst at Salomon Smith Barney, called a turn in the stocks over a year ago, and they moved up. But then they fell again. Last week, he said he still thinks better days are ahead. Following are excerpts from the conversation.

Q. In April 2001, you said the semiconductor index could trade as high as 700 and as low as 400. Are you still satisfied with that call?

A. Our view back then was that semiconductor activity would bottom in the third quarter of 2001, and it did. We thought inventories would get worked down, and they did. That the sharp reduction in capital spending would result in firmer prices and higher utilization rates, and it has.
By the end of April this year, semiconductor stocks were up 20 percent over the previous 12 months. During that period the S.& P. 400 was flat, and the rest of technology was down 10 percent.
What has brought the stocks down since then is a realization in the investor base that a technology recovery was not happening as rapidly as some had hoped.

Q. Are conditions continuing to improve?

A. We were very happy with the fundamentals, beginning in the spring of 2001. But this spring we hit a soft patch. Because of continued weak corporate capital spending, in the first quarter the personal computer sector built up excess inventory. That was worked off in the second quarter. Now there are signs that we are heading into a seasonal upturn.
But the view is by no means monolithically positive. There are still big chunks of weakness, which is surprising, if not stunning. The lack of business response to 11 interest rate cuts has been a surprise.

Q. What evidence do you have that demand is firming?

A. Anecdotally, I can say that the main information technology guy at Citigroup, which is one of the biggest buyers of information technology in the world, called up a couple of weeks ago and said the personal computers in the research department are starting to break down, that it is more expensive to fix them than buy them, and to get ready for an upgrade next year.

Q. Last week, Intel missed its earnings numbers, but the stock wasn't punished badly. Why?

A. We actually thought Intel's numbers could have been worse. They said they would miss in early June, due to the inventory problem we talked about and the fact that microprocessor prices were falling. On their conference call last week they said prices didn't fall, but were flat.

Q. How comfortable are you with the financial statements these companies turn out?

A. We think most of our top companies are pretty clean. Managements have been in place a long time. They are electrical engineers, not financial engineers.

Q. How much of a hit would semiconductor company earnings take if stock options were accounted for as expenses?

A. Well, it's not nothing, but earnings would not be cut by that much.
Intel, for example, is probably exposed by 5 percent to 10 percent. Of peak 2000 earnings, companies like Advanced Micro Devices, Cirrus Logic, Cypress Semiconductor and National Semiconductor are exposed about 10 percent.

Q. Which stocks in the group do you like?

A. We are recommending the top-drawer companies, those that don't have shaky balance sheets and are leaders.
Micron and Intel are recommended stocks. They are real leaders and are attractive on a valuation basis. In addition, on a seasonal basis they are enjoying a reacceleration, not a dramatic recovery, of the personal computer market. We have a $35 price target on Micron and $27 on Intel.
Another name we like is Texas Instruments, which has wide diversification. We think it could go as high as $30.

Q. Which names are you avoiding?

A. We recently downgraded National Semiconductor, because they are beginning to see some order softness in the personal computer area. In addition, inventories of flat-panel displays have built up, and they have quite a large exposure to cellular handsets. And a few weeks ago we downgraded Cirrus Logic and Advanced Micro Devices.

HEADLINE: The Best Way to Spread the Wealth 

BYLINE:  By Joseph I. Lieberman; Joseph I. Lieberman, Democrat of Connecticut, is chairman of the Senate Governmental Affairs Committee.

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
One popular solution to the current crisis of corporate crime is to fix the accounting rules for stock options. Force companies to count those whopping stock option packages as expenses when they are granted, many say, and the fraud will recede. I wish it were that easy.
 The reality is that giving options to employees is an innovative idea that has been abused by greedy executives. But changing the accounting rules won't change their behavior; it will only deny options to average workers who have done nothing wrong. Our goal should be to deter the abuse of stock options without discouraging the use of a tool that plays a valuable role in the American economy. 
 My familiarity with this arcane issue dates back to 1993, when the Financial Accounting Standards Board, an independent group that sets rules on how to account for business transactions, first floated a plan to require stock options to be treated as an expense against earnings on profit-and-loss statements at the time they are granted.
I opposed this rule change. Options are a valuable tool for attracting talent and spreading wealth because they give employees a greater stake in their companies. And business leaders, particularly from the high-tech community, said they would have to issue fewer options if they had to subtract their estimated value from their profits. In addition, there is no accurate way to value an option on the day it is granted. Options only become valuable several years later, when they are exercised.
The circumstances have surely changed since I worked to defeat the board's plan. But the problems with the board's approach have not. Requiring firms to predict the value of options is still bad accounting, and it would still have damaging repercussions: it would significantly reduce earnings for many companies with large option plans, which in turn would reduce the value of their stock in particular and the market in general. That is the last thing we need now.
Faced with such a change, businesses would almost certainly decide to grant fewer options. And in all likelihood, the first to be cut out would be middle-class workers -- millions of whom, thanks to options, have seen their wealth grow substantially over the last decade.
There clearly is a problem with the abuse of options that demands a legislative response. But the solution has little to do with accounting. The fact is that some greedy executives, loaded up with tens of thousands of options, engage in all manner of fraudulent and deceitful accounting tricks to jack up earnings and their share price, cash in at the right time, and then leave the company.
How do you stop this from happening? The bill the Senate passed last week, by establishing independent oversight and tough new criminal penalties for bad behavior, will go a long way toward preventing the particular corruptions that may have been driven by large option packages.
We also should adopt new policies that change the way options are allocated, sold and approved. The number of people receiving options has grown significantly in the last decade -- the National Center for Employee Ownership estimates that between 7 million and 10 million people now hold options, and a number of companies, like Intel and Sun, have broad-based plans that distribute most options to rank-and-file workers, not senior executives. But the majority of options are still awarded to a small number of high-level managers. We need to stop this hoarding of options at the top of the corporate food chain.
In the past I've proposed changes in tax policy to encourage the expansion of broad-based option plans. But in light of this wave of corporate crime, it's time for more forceful measures. One sensible idea is to prohibit companies from deducting the cost of options when exercised if they do not offer the majority of them to rank-and-file workers. Another way to deter the misuse of options is to set up a mandatory holding period and curtail top executives from selling their shares while they are still employed by the company. We should also give shareholders a greater say in the design of option plans, particularly for company leaders, by requiring a majority approval of such plans by shareholders.
I intend to propose legislation in the weeks ahead that encompasses these reforms. I am confident that if we broaden our discussion, we can reach a consensus that will end the abuse of stock options without jeopardizing an effective tool that has played a critical role in the democratization of capitalism in this country.

HEADLINE: A Town's Hidden Memory 

BYLINE:  By Kati Marton; Kati Marton is the author, most recently, of "Hidden Power: Presidential Marriages That Shaped Our History."

 BODY:
As we debate the proper way to remember Sept. 11, there are lessons for us from places that have lost their memories. I visited one recently: my mother's hometown in northeast Hungary. This town, Miskolc, does not feel like part of the Hungary I have carried in my heart since my family and I began our exile many years ago. 
 Sitting in a McDonald's, I am strangely grateful for its familiar, garish, American decor, a place of refuge from the rest of Miskolc, a town I waited decades to visit. 
 I have come to this place in search of the grandparents I never knew -- or some memory of their world. I do not know what they looked like because no photographs or any other possessions survived their arrest and transport to Auschwitz sometime between June 11 and June 14, 1944. 
In fact, scarcely a trace is left of a Jewish community that once made up one quarter of Miskolc's population of 75,000 -- vanished as if by some natural phenomenon. At least that is what Miskolc, a sullen, economically depressed place, might like to believe. 
My grandparents' home at 59 Szeles Utca, where my mother grew up, is now occupied by an insurance company. Standing frozen in front of it, I try to imagine what it was like on that early June morning (it was always early morning, that was Adolf Eichmann's way) when they began their final journey. I try to evoke an image, but I can't. Instead, I have only the cold facts: the Miskolc town prefect, Emil Borbely-Maczky, with help from local citizens, supervised the roundup of 10,000 women, children and old men (the young men had already been taken away to do forced labor). They were marched to the ghetto, then to the brickworks and on to the Auschwitz-bound wagons. Neighbors took their worldly goods. What personal property remained was transported to the synagogue, which was used as a warehouse for stolen Jewish property.
But I had trouble finding the synagogue. The guidebooks (including the Guide Michelin for Hungary) do not mention its existence. It is not clearly marked on maps. The local residents I stopped on the streets told me they never heard of any synagogue. I finally found "Heroes' Square," a sorry, ugly paved square with a church well described and marked in all the guidebooks. At the other end of the square, behind tall concrete barriers, a Moorish facade soars high. It is the synagogue built in 1861, and far larger than I ever imagined. At first glance I assumed the concrete slabs were memorial tablets to the 10,000 citizens who disappeared, but they were, in fact, designed to obscure the towering synagogue partly hidden behind them. There is no sign, no schedule of hours to mark the synagogue, only a giant padlock on the iron gate. 
At noon the pub across the street opened for business. "Do you know when the synagogue opens?" I ask the peroxide-blonde bartender. "What synagogue?" she asks. "That one," I say pointing behind me. "Really? That's a synagogue?" She seems startled. "Why don't you ask the neighbors?" "You are the neighbors," I answer, suddenly angry. 
I return to the synagogue and spot a buzzer just inside the padlocked gate. A middle-aged woman dressed in spandex pants and oversize T-shirt answers the bell. She looks annoyed. "I was just about to wash my hair," she says, fingering her long, bleached platinum tresses. I have come a very long way to visit this place, I tell her. My grandparents were deported from here. She shrugs, but opens the heavy gate. Surprisingly, there is construction work underway. "Americans," she tells me. The interior wall of the courtyard is crowded with marble plaques honoring "the innocent people" who were "deported in the most brutal and dehumanizing manner." The language is strong, even moving. But who sees these plaques behind locked gates? Not the people in the pub across the street, not those at the McDonald's a few blocks away, certainly not young Hungarians. 
As I walk the bleak streets of Miskolc, I scan the faces of passersby. Where were you, where were your parents, what did you do before, during or after the disappearance of one quarter of your town's population? Were your parents my grandparents' neighbors? I feel slightly ashamed for thinking that these people share a collective guilt. But I cannot help it. The town of Miskolc has buried its past and so cannot expect redemption. 
Yet, even now, 58 years later, it is not too late for an honest reckoning. In neighboring Poland, local historians have recently concluded that the massacre of Jews in the town of Jedwabne in 1941 was carried out by Poles, not Nazis. This belated acknowledgment has already improved relations between Jews and Poles. Elsewhere in Central Europe, Serbs are now torn between those who are ready to confront the tragedy of Bosnia, and those who wish the whole issue of ethnic cleansing would go away. Yugoslav President Vojislav Kostunica has said the sight of Slobodan Milosevic in the dock makes him "sick to my stomach" -- language he never used to describe the carnage. Meanwhile Serbia's prime minister, Zoran Djindjic, is calling for greater exposure of the crimes of the past. 
Miskolc is not unique in fleeing its history. There are many other Miskolcs in the world, places where great crimes were committed and then buried. Without memory, these places pay the price of collective guilt. And for the people themselves, there can be no reconciliation. That is the bitter lesson of the age of genocide. 
Of course, acknowledging crimes does not erase them. No amount of honest reckoning will bring back my grandparents or their lost community. But this is not about the dead. Those living in a dark place, ignorant of their own history, are the ones at risk. Miskolc will remain a place of averted eyes, sour and soulless, as long as those tablets honoring its victims stay behind a padlocked iron gate.

HEADLINE: The World; 
The Global Cost of Crony Capitalism

BYLINE:  By DAVID E. SANGER 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
THROUGHOUT much of the 1990's, Washington had a standard and somewhat preachy -- message to the rest of the world: In an era when markets rule and military might is of limited use, a nation's influence rises and fall largely on its financial credibility.
 That was easy to say when the country's markets were rising, its biggest companies were trusted to report the facts each quarter and the rest of the world wanted to look like America. But now that a chunk of that 90's success has been exposed as mythical -- and markets have staggered back to pre-boom levels -- a sobering question is settling over Washington. 
 If America's corporate prowess and clean markets were as much a source of its superpower status as its military might, could corporate abuses erode a key element of national power? Is America going to pay a diplomatic price for crony capitalism, as so many other countries have?
"There's no question it undercuts us," said Joseph S. Nye Jr., the Harvard professor who coined the phrase "soft power" to describe the non-military sources of American global influence. "We had a model that looked like it worked better than the European model, certainly better than the Japanese model -- and it stood for no-crony capitalism. Now, that model is damaged, and, with it, so is a bit of our credibility." 
Just how much is open to debate. But history shows there is a strong connection between a nation's attractiveness as a place to invest and its ability to shape the world in its own image. Ask the Japanese. So more than the fate of the Dow may be riding on the quality of the reforms that Congress and Mr. Bush agree upon in coming weeks.
"If you step back and look at the 90's, American prestige was enhanced by our fiscal strengths -- the dollar was strong, the markets were strong, no one doubted that we were the safest place to invest," said Robert D. Hormats, a former senior State Department official who is an investment banker at Goldman, Sachs. "Now there is good reason to wonder whether we will be as generous with foreign aid" -- which President Bush announced just a few months ago he wants to increase by 50 percent in the next few years -- "and whether we will try to stave off imports, always a temptation in downturns."
If so, the rest of the world would see more of the hard edge of America, the America of pre-emptive strikes against its potential enemies, and less of the open economy the country hailed as a model for the world.
What the effects of that might be are hard to predict. The United States has not been through a major downturn since it emerged as the great winner of the age of globalization. So it has never felt the sting of what happens when the global investing herd stampedes out of the country. After all, until now America has been the undisputed gold standard, the safe haven in world storms.
Many in Washington argue that it still is. American clout hinges on far more than just the reliability of profit-and-loss statements -- the power of its ideas, its culture and the astounding reach of its military are all part of the mix. This was a point President Bush underscored Friday when he escaped questions about corporate America's troubles, and his own behavior as a private investor, to travel to Fort Drum, N.Y., to bask in the reflected glory of the 10th Mountain Division, whose troops chased Al Qaeda through the caves in Afghanistan.
But just as traditional American power is resurgent, the quality of its soft power is subject to more doubt than any time in recent history. Short-term effects are obvious. Even as Alan Greenspan assured the world that America's long-term prospects are good, foreigners pulled money out of the American market, sending the dollar spinning down. A single Euro, the European currency, is now worth slightly more than a dollar for the first time in two and a half years -- and that's not because Europe's economic prospects have improved.
I T'S a sign that we have lost the moral high ground," said Lael Brainard, a former international economic adviser to President Bill Clinton who drafted some of the speeches on good corporate governance. "We were in the awkward position of lecturing all the countries on regulation, bankruptcy procedures, international accounting standards. In an ideal world, we would now admit we had a lot of problems of our own and welcome some ideas from the rest of the world."
Mr. Bush's aides may not agree and, when asked about the diplomatic impact of recent woes, they insist it will be next to nil. "There may be some lectures to our trade negotiators," one senior official said. "Maybe some more resistance the next time the World Bank and the I.M.F. hand out prescriptions to the Argentinas of the world, or to Indonesia. But that's around the edges. It doesn't affect the central issues we're facing."
The official is probably right in the broadest sense: it's hard to imagine the French or the Saudis invoking Enron as they push back at Mr. Bush's insistence that it is time to depose Saddam Hussein. But that is about brute power, not subtle influence. And influence is harder to measure, partly because its accumulation and erosion are harder to detect.
The Chinese, once the greatest economic power, understand that, or seem to. That is why they overcame domestic opposition to join the World Trade Organization, in hopes that they would not only attract foreign capital, but extend their influence in Asia.
The Japanese learned the lesson the hard way: they have seen great influence wane as the world lost confidence first in their companies, then in their government. As investors decided the Japanese islands were sinking in a sea of debt and deception, Japan's diplomatic influence around Asia and the world diminished markedly. And when pressed to reform, they passed weak measures and called them a solution -- a cautionary tale for the Congress.
NO one is predicting the same for America -- the Japanese, for example, had no military to make up for their loss of economic influence. America's culture continues to have a uniquely potent export power. And the American model of capitalism, however flawed, still seems to beat the alternatives.
"It will be hard for the Europeans and the Japanese to argue that their systems are better at stopping these kinds of abuses," says Walter Russell Mead, author of a new book examining the spread of American ideas. "But all these events are bound to have some indirect influence on foreign policy. This is a serious crisis for the Republican Party, and the Bush administration, and that means it weakens the administration's authority a bit. And there are risks."
Perhaps none of that will happen; perhaps these past months will prove to be just another ugly blip in American capitalism. But this is the first major American downturn since the country emerged as the winner of the globalization sweepstakes. The fact remains that when global success and global influence are commodities, it hurts when the world yells "sell."

HEADLINE: The World; 
America the Invulnerable? The World Looks Again

BYLINE:  By STEVEN ERLANGER 

DATELINE: BERLIN 

 BODY:
EUROPEAN leaders, increasingly irritated by the Bush administration, feel they are coming to a moment of truth about themselves and their relationship with Washington.
 American contempt for a weak Europe is producing pressure for more unity, more outspoken independence and a clearer understanding that Europe must spend more money on its military forces if Washington is going to take it seriously. 
 Real interests are diverging, and years of talk about tensions and resentments have crystallized into a sudden perception that the relationship itself has changed.
On fundamental issues like the International Criminal Court, the Kyoto environmental treaty and the crisis in the Middle East, even strongly pro-American leaders like the British prime minister, Tony Blair, and the German foreign minister, Joschka Fischer, are openly differing with America with a public bluntness that would have been unthinkable five years ago -- or in the weeks after Sept. 11. 
There is shock over the way Washington handled the court issue at the United Nations, puzzlement over the concentration on Iraq as the Israeli-Palestinian relationship deteriorates and confusion over how to move forward in the Middle East with Yasir Arafat ruled out but no mechanism to establish another Palestinian leadership.
And there is dismay that Secretary of State Colin L. Powell, a European favorite, is losing key battles to the conservatives who seem to have won Mr. Bush's ear and who regard European criticism as the whining of weaklings. The moral leadership that President Bush was granted and exercised after Sept. 11 has been "frittered away," a senior European official said. Renewed American unilateralism is giving weight to the old French idea of the European Union as a counterbalance to Washington.
Even more striking, some Europeans are talking about finally putting their money where their mouths have been for so long on defense spending, understanding that the superpower in Washington will only take them seriously when they can project hard power to back up their foreign policies.
A more competitive relationship with Washington, some argue, would be healthier, because it would be more realistic, and it would also help respond to increasingly anti-American views among their publics.
"Solidarity has to be a two-way highway," said another senior German official. "Unless, of course, you want to strengthen those who say we must develop our own mechanisms and we can't rely on the United States in all cases."
ONE of the texts helping to define the European discussion is a long article in Policy Review, an American quarterly published by the conservative Hoover Institution (www.policyreview.org). The article, "Power and Weakness," by Robert Kagan, is circulating by e-mail and causing European elites to see themselves more as Washington sees them -- as powers who use multilateralism as a kind of weapon to restrain the superpower.
The Atlantic is fundamentally divided over attitudes to power, Mr. Kagan asserts. The Europeans, to escape their bloody history, are sharing sovereignty in the European Union, "moving beyond power into a self-contained world of laws and rules and transnational negotiation and cooperation."
The United States, as a traditional nation-state bestriding the world and seeing threats all around, is "exercising power in the anarchic Hobbesian world where international laws and rules are unreliable and where true security and the defense and promotion of a liberal order still depend on the possession and use of military might."
So, Mr. Kagan argues, behind the bitterness of the policy disputes are deep differences in values and politics, stemming from different histories and attitudes toward power and threat. The continental drift isn't a function of one administration, although the tone may change, with Mr. Bush more blunt than the ever-emollient Bill Clinton.
The resolution, Mr. Kagan believes, is in a Europe that will commit more money and resources to the military -- to the ability to project power, at least through the Balkans and perhaps the Middle East. Only then will Washington take Europe more seriously. Mr. Kagan says he would like Europe to take such steps, but doubts that it will.
While he has his critics, he has also found support from prominent Europeans.
Pascal Lamy, the European Union trade commissioner, thinks Mr. Kagan has it right: "Stop pretending that the United States and Europe share a common view of the world, recognize we have different world views and interests and then manage our relations." To Americans, he said, "Europeans seem a bunch of unprincipled wimps who complain and embrace multilateralism out of weakness, because unilateralism is out of reach." Mr. Kagan "pushes the debate to the next question: how far will Europeans go to defend their rule-based systems? Will we take risks, lose lives and pay more? That's the real question, which we Europeans have carefully organized ourselves not to ask."
Francois Heisbourg, who runs the Foundation for Strategic Research in Paris, says Mr. Kagan has lumped together the more martial French and British with those European countries who flee from power, whom the French call "les Woodstockians." Still, he says, "no academic piece in this realm has generated quite as much heat and interest since Samuel Huntington's 'Clash of Civilizations' article in 1993 or Francis Fukuyama's 'End of History' in 1989."
But he disagrees. Multilateralism is not for the weak, but also for the strong, he said. "America became a superpower through multilateralism and the Atlantic Charter in 1941. It is a superpower not by its military and economic weight but by virtue of sustaining permanent alliances, and multilateralism is at the heart of those alliances."
Americans are also not alone hunting bears in the woods, as Mr. Kagan suggests. Mr. Heisbourg argues that Al Qaeda is more like a mutating virus than a bear, and it requires a varied quiver to fight, including intelligence, counter-terrorism and financial expertise -- areas where Europe excels.
Josef Joffe, editor in chief of Die Zeit, which has excerpted Mr. Kagan's piece, says even the underfunded European defense arm -- a proposed force of 60,000 -- is designed to keep a peace, not fight a war. Still, he said, European soldiers and pilots are fighting effectively in Afghanistan. "It is also true," he said, "that multilateralism is the weapon of the weak, and that there is an unarticulated power game going on, with the Europeans trying to restrain the United States like the Lilliputians did Gulliver, through international regimes." But this is an old theme, dating to the 60's.
Jeffrey Gedmin, director of the Aspen Institute Berlin, said he is an "Atlanticist" and is troubled. Debates about the alliance have swirled since Communism collapsed, and then, he said, "suddenly Kagan writes a piece that says, in a sort of primitive way, 'Extra, extra, we're different.' And we who thought that more talk and more understanding can bridge the gap are being told, 'No, forget it, you won't, it's about history and culture,' and that's breathtaking."
"They need us less in relative terms after the cold war and in relative terms, after 9/11, we need them less, too," Mr. Gedmin said of the Americans. "And Kagan says, 'Maybe that's O.K.,' but I don't know if it's O.K. I have a real fear of decoupling."

HEADLINE: Wall St. Damage Ripples Across the Population 

BYLINE:  By LOUIS UCHITELLE 

 BODY:
Wanting a second child, Gary and Kristen Tyler, both 41, thought the best thing would be to borrow $20,000 from his 401(k) to pay for in vitro fertilization. But with the stock market plunging, taking that much out of Mr. Tyler's retirement account has suddenly become very problematic.
 In Wall Street's heyday, Mr. Tyler's 401(k) went as high as $60,000. Now it is down by at least $10,000 -- and still falling. "Just when you think it can't go down anymore, it does," he said. "It is almost abstract, unreal what is happening." 
 But with real world consequences. Like millions of working Americans, Mr. Tyler, who earns nearly $90,000 a year as a computer programmer in Manhattan, is just beginning to experience the hardships of the falling stock market. Others are already deeply hurt: retirees and those nearing retirement, for example, who count on their stocks to help pay day-to-day expenses, and day traders and stockbrokers who make their living from the market. 
The Dow Jones industrial average has fallen more than 1,360 points, or 14.5 percent, in the last two weeks, with one-third of the loss coming on Friday alone. It was the worst two weeks for the Dow since October 1987, when the market crashed.
And now the damage is spreading across the population, helping to dampen the optimism that the economic recovery will soon gain strength. But even in the current debacle, many Americans are hanging on to their faith that stocks remain the best place for their money over the longer run. That faith is giving way only gradually.
Having paid little attention to the market, Andrea G. Eisenberg, the 52-year-old manager of an outplacement firm in Manhattan, is finally alarmed that a decade might pass before her savings -- still above $1 million and three-quarters in stocks -- make up the 35 percent loss in her portfolio over the last two years.
Still, she resists selling. "I don't want to lock in my losses," she said.
Nor is Mr. Tyler shifting his 401(k) out of stocks, not even his new contributions. During Friday's drop, he considered purchasing AOL Time Warner stock, figuring it will rise smartly when the market rebound comes, long before he retires. Meanwhile, as prices fall, the cost of buying additional shares for his 401(k) will be low enough, he hopes, to make up eventually for all his losses.
"You are in effect buying more shares that will be worth more when stocks recover," Mr. Tyler said, reflecting an optimism about the resilience of stocks that showed up frequently in interviews last week.
To some experts, investors are only deluding themselves. "Consumers bet the ranch on the bull market, and they are in denial now," said Stephen S. Roach, chief economist at Morgan Stanley.
More than 50 percent of the population owns some stock, a percentage that swelled in the 1990's. But most Americans still see themselves more as "spectators" of the plunging markets and their diminished wealth than as seriously damaged parties, says Andrew Kohut, director of the Pew Research Center, a polling organization. Paid employment is a powerful insulator; while the unemployment rate has been rising, it remains at a moderate 5.9 percent.
"People do not feel the floor has dropped out from under them, but they do have anxiety about the future," Mr. Kohut said. Their anxiety "can have political consequences if it turns into real belt-tightening; that has not happened yet."
There are other safety valves. For all the popularity of stocks as an investment and the market's influence on confidence and consumer behavior, corporate shares represent, on average, less than one-fifth of the total wealth of the vast middle of the population, with accumulated net worth of less than $250,000, Federal Reserve data indicates. Homes, by contrast, are far and away the major investment of these households, and home prices are rising.
That is certainly true for the Tylers. They sold some shares in 1998 to raise $18,000 as a down payment for a $179,000 house in South Orange, N.J., a home now worth much more. "We have seen similar houses selling for the high $200,000's," said Ms. Tyler, an art therapist who gave up her job to raise the couple's 4-year-old daughter, Daisy.
The wealthiest fifth of all households, with net worth in excess of $250,000, have the biggest stock portfolios and are suffering the biggest dollar losses. But they, too, have a substantial fallback. Nearly one-third of their wealth is in stocks, on average, but double that amount is invested in private businesses, including their own, and in real estate, other than their own homes.
"My world does not revolve around my stocks, and that is critical," said Gordon Andrus, a 55-year-old Houston lawyer and oilman who calculates that his portfolio, now down to $2 million, has lost about 12 percent of its value since Sept. 11. He is counting on income from more than $10 million in oil and gas investments for his retirement. 
"I haven't sold any stock," he said, "although at 3 o'clock in the morning I occasionally think about what is going on."
The upshot of his thinking, he said, is a decision to tell his broker to start buying soon, in anticipation of a rebound. Whatever happens, his intention is to pass along his shares to his heirs. "For me," he said, "stocks are a safety net."
Like the Tylers and Mr. Andrus, Trina Visceglia in Cincinnati is similarly confident that a rebound will come. When her father died in 1996, while she was a freshman at Vanderbilt University, he left her more than $175,000, which she turned over to a financial adviser who invested the entire inheritance in stocks. They went straight up, reaching a high of well over $500,000 in 1999, even after Ms. Visceglia withdrew more than $75,000 to pay for college. 
And then the fall began. On the way down, she took $60,000 out as a down payment on a three-bedroom town house, now rising in value. Otherwise she has stuck with stocks, ignoring her mother's pleas to put more into cash. Today her portfolio has fallen in value to the original inheritance from her father.
Yet she still uses the same financial adviser, whom she describes as a trusted if less optimistic friend. She is 24 now, earning more than $35,000 a year as a community relations specialist for Toyota North America. Despite her roller coaster market experience, her 401(k) contributions still go into stock funds.
"I have to stay optimistic," Ms. Visceglia said, expressing a reluctance to sell or shift out of stocks and thus lock in her losses. Meanwhile, she tries to live much more within her salary than she had earlier. "I certainly think twice about making big purchases and I don't feel as comfortably off," she said. "But I don't feel cheated; the stock market is a gamble. You kind of sign up for that when you get into it."
Ms. Eisenberg, on the other hand, finally feels the pain. As managing principal of the New York operation of Right Management Consultants, an outplacement service for laid-off workers, she has a six-figure income, she says, and a net worth that had grown through the late 1990's.
At 52, she is counting on many years of work before falling back on her stocks in retirement -- but unmarried and childless, her stock portfolio will be a vital source of income once she stops working. The 35 percent loss in her portfolio, she said, "is pretty significant for me."
Still, she was not feeling bad until last week. Now she sees the rebound in her net worth taking much longer, perhaps stretching close to retirement. "The news seems to be that it will take 8 to 10 years for the market to recover and it will continue to slide for a while longer," she said. "I did not care if it was 3 to 5 years until the rebound. I was fine with that. But 10 years?"
The stock market's steady decline is just beginning to catch the attention of Cindy Shaw, 48, a nurse and instructor of nurses at Methodist General Hospital in Memphis. She has nearly $100,000 in a 401(k) and two I.R.A. accounts, but does not pay much attention to her statements.
"It is just my little nest egg to retire, and I am too young to retire anytime soon," she said, explaining that much of her energy away from work goes into completing the last course for a master's degree in nursing, and writing her thesis.
What also helps to shield Ms. Shaw from concern is a $48,000 salary. Her husband, John, 56, a gasoline equipment salesman, earns a similar amount. They own a three-bedroom house on two acres of land, a property that is rising in value, and she holds a trust fund set up by her parents.
"Until I get a statement that says the I.R.A.'s and the 401(k) are worth a lot less, say $50,000 less, then I'll get panicky," Ms. Shaw said. "I guess I should be paying attention all along, so that if I need to make changes I can, before I lose everything."

HEADLINE: Midair Crash Opens Debate On Air Safety Over Europe 

BYLINE:  By MARK LANDLER 

DATELINE: FRANKFURT, July 20 

 BODY:
Europeans can drive from Stockholm to Seville without stopping at a border post or showing a passport. But if they fly across the Continent, their pilot must deal with a long succession of national air traffic authorities, some calling on different radio frequencies, as the plane streaks across the borders that divide the skies of one country from the next.
 Aviation experts have complained for years that this fragmentation of airspace contributes to the chronic delays in European flights, since pilots take longer plotting their routes. 
 Now, in the wake of the recent midair crash of a Russian passenger jet and a Boeing 757 cargo plane over southern Germany, some say Europe's patchwork of air traffic control systems is also a safety threat. 
"Many of these countries are way, way too small to have their own air traffic control centers," said Jim Eckes, the managing director of Indoswiss Aviation, an airline consulting company. "The Swiss airspace should be merged into the German zone. If the Germans were running it, this accident probably wouldn't have happened."
Such assertions are predictably controversial in Europe, where sovereignty and pride often clash with growing economic and political integration.
But officials here acknowledge that among the baffling chain of missteps that led to the midair collision on July 1 was a breakdown in communication between controllers in Karlsruhe, Germany, who had been tracking the planes, and the controller on duty in Zurich, who picked up the planes as they flew close to Lake Constance, in southern Germany near the Swiss border.
Investigators say the German controller tried desperately to call his counterpart in Zurich, after noticing that the planes were on a collision course two minutes before the crash. But the line was busy.
"Normally a controller should have a hot line to call his colleague," said George Paulson, the director of safety, airspace and airports at the European Organization for the Safety of Air Navigation, which provides technical advice on air traffic control issues to 31 European countries.
Mr. Paulson said his organization, known as Eurocontrol, had set up a high-level committee after the crash to draft new safety recommendations. It expects to issue the guidelines in November.
Among the possible recommendations, he said, could be emergency phone lines, or a computer link, between air traffic control centers in different countries. It may also suggest ways to improve communication between pilots and controllers.
On the fateful night of July 1, the Swiss controller ordered the pilot of the Russian Tupolev Tu-154, to descend to avoid the Boeing, operated by the overnight courier service DHL Worldwide Express. Later, the collision warning system on the Russian plane instructed the pilot to climb. He obeyed the Swiss controller, with tragic results.
"It's an accident that never should have happened," Mr. Paulson said.
Despite that, he said Europe's safety record compared favorably to that of the United States, which has a unified air traffic control system. Midair crashes are rare on both sides of the Atlantic.
The difference is that American controllers handle double the volume of traffic, on average, of their European counterparts. As traffic in Europe becomes more congested, experts worry that its fragmented system -- which uses 73 control centers, compared with 22 in the United States -- will not be able to cope.
Defenders of the European system point out that in most countries the private companies that provide air traffic control services use newer, more advanced technology than that used in the United States.
Still, Europe's airlines are pushing for a uniform airspace, which would be regulated by the European Commission. Their motivation is mainly economic: eliminating national boundaries would allow Europe to consolidate its 73 centers into a few megacenters.
Not surprisingly, the chief opponents of the idea are the controllers themselves. They fear that streamlining Europe's air traffic system will lead to a loss of jobs. And they argue that the commercial pressure will increase, not reduce, the likelihood of future crashes.
"There's nothing wrong with harmonizing the system," said Marc Baumgartner, a controller in Geneva who is president of the International Federation of Air Traffic Controllers. "But the way the E.C. is doing it is through economic incentives, and that has a direct impact on training." He acknowledged, however, that the crash had thrown many long-held assumptions into question.
"It took away a bit of our religion," he said. "We had all the safety nets in place to prevent this, and still it happened."

HEADLINE: BackTalk; 
A Season With an N.F.L. Salary-Cap Analyst

BYLINE:  By RUSSELL ADAMS; Russell Adams, a recent graduate of Columbia's journalism school, is an intern at Street & Smith's SportsBusiness Journal.

 BODY:
Last January, the Jets organization was reeling from a crushing first-round playoff loss and the knowledge that it had to cut $20 million from its payroll by March. In the ensuing weeks, the club not only accomplished the payroll purge, but also did so without stripping the team of a chance to compete. Six months later, the Jets are poised for another run at the postseason.
 One of the architects of that feat was Dawn Aponte, an accountant who in eight years has gone from being a summer intern in the club's three-person accounting department to the National Football League's only female salary-cap analyst. 
 As the N.F.L.'s 32 clubs open training camps next week, Major League Baseball's negotiators and players union will most likely be locked in desperate negotiations to save their game from a catastrophic work stoppage. The intersection of the opening of the football season with the possible shutdown of baseball highlights the gap between one sport whose popularity is soaring and another whose economic model has it on the brink of collapse. 
At the heart of the N.F.L.'s economic model is the salary cap, which the players union conceded in exchange for unrestricted free agency in the 1993 N.F.L. Collective Bargaining Agreement. The agreement simultaneously invoked a free market on player salaries and a controlled market on team payroll, and teams have come to rely heavily on "capologists" to reconcile the two opposing economic forces. In the process, these number crunchers have emerged as vital cogs in the machinery that determines who wins and who loses in the N.F.L. 
Last fall, I began tracking Aponte through her first full season as the Jets' salary-cap analyst and pro personnel assistant. She grew up wanting to be an accountant, and while she was a standout athlete at Notre Dame Academy on Staten Island, her only connection with football was a boyfriend who was a Giants fan. Then, she got a summer internship in the Jets' accounting department while at the University of Delaware. She was hooked.
"I thought it would be so much cooler to be a bean counter for a professional football team," said Aponte, who joined the full-time staff in 1994, the year the cap was implemented. "Here, you saw how people could be creative. Everyone started out with the same salary-cap number, and each year, progressively, everyone was in a different situation. I enjoyed figuring out why they were where they were, as far as the way they structured the contracts, the way they paid the contracts, who they were giving the money to, how long the deals were."
Although I was aware of the various methods teams employ to manage the cap, until my time with Aponte I did not understand how the ability to backload a contract and hide money in bonuses and incentives justified a full-time position and high praise from peers. 
Aponte's days are long, her season year-round, and the closest she gets to the field is the press box at a home game. A pile of spreadsheets characterizes her road to the playoffs. But few in the organization would dispute that the Jets are entering the 2002-03 season with a chance to compete largely because of the work of the 31-year-old mother of two, Madison, 2, and Matthew, 5, a Jets fanatic.
To fully grasp the depths of a capologist's work, one must have a general understanding of the basics. The amount a player counts against the cap is the sum of his base salary and his guaranteed signing bonus, and any guaranteed money can be prorated over the life of a deal. To re-sign valuable players who command big money, clubs generally offer them large signing bonuses that are paid upfront but counted against the cap in increments over the life of the deal and weighed most heavily in the final years.
If the club wants to keep the player when those big-money years arrive, it can add money and years to the deal and push more of the bonus money toward the back end of the restructured contract. That's largely how the 49ers won the Super Bowl in 1994, and it is how the Cowboys took the title in 1995.
But when a team ties large bonus money into the contracts of a few elite players, it gets short-term cap relief at a long-term cost. Sooner or later, the player can no longer perform at a level that justifies his contract and spot on the roster. 
When the club trades or releases the player, or he retires, his bonuses for the remaining years are accelerated to count against the following year's cap. It is not uncommon for teams to pay millions a year in "dead money" -- cap space allotted for players no longer with the team.
Needless to say, teams must reserve such contract manipulation for a few elite players, or else find themselves in a similar spot as the 2001 Cowboys -- six years removed from their last Super Bowl but paying $23 million (34 percent of that year's $67 million cap) to players long since departed from the club.
The key to sustained success in the new system is to exercise fiscal responsibility when it comes to surrounding a club's stars with a quality group of players. That's not easy in the era of unrestricted free agency. It takes only one team to consider an average player its savior to push the scale in a way that has negative implications for all clubs. Agents and players use such contracts, however outrageous, as leverage in their negotiations. It is up to the club to recognize the true value of a player and not to succumb to market forces.
Aponte's primary purpose is to assess a player's value and then determine the ways the Jets can structure the player's contract based on his value. Her work, in theory, means that by the time the player and his agent meet with the club after the season, the Jets negotiators are armed with statistics establishing the player's value on the open market, as well as with options for adapting that value to the player's demands. 
During the season, Aponte creates files for all of the players whose contracts are ending or who will need to be restructured at season's end. Last season, we talked about Jason Fabini, and the discussion illustrated the nature of Aponte's research and the process that led to the five-year, $18 million contract he signed with the Jets in February.
The centerpiece of Fabini's file was a chart listing the contracts of 15-25 players of comparable value. The chart contained detailed financial and performance statistics for each player, including every injury sustained since college, statistics and scouting reports, as well as the terms and structure of each player's latest contract and the conditions under which he signed.
It's important, for example, for clubs entering negotiations to know such details as when players of comparable ability signed with their respective teams. A player who signed during the season, when there was no urgency for either side to close a deal, likely has a contract that better reflects his value than a player signed up against a deadline.
Also on file is the "Negotiation Overview," which lists every imaginable reason in favor or against re-signing the player, from his effect on team chemistry to run-ins with the law. Under that sub-heading are the "good" and "bad" comparisons. Agents typically have in mind certain players to whom they attempt to compare their client, and the club must be prepared to point out how and why certain comparisons are valid while others are unwarranted.
Once Aponte compiles the statistics that establish where the player fits into the market, she and Mike Tannenbaum, the club's director of pro personnel, structure preliminary contract proposals based on the different possible demands of the player and his agent. 
The files are comprehensive and meticulously done, and one exists for about half of the players on the roster at any given time. "There are 20 different guys and 50 different scenarios as to what the implications of doing different things are," Aponte said. 
Pro football's so-called purists argue that the game should be determined on the field, not at the desk of an accountant. Furthermore, they rue the absence of consistently dominant teams, saying that free agency and the cap have stripped the league of any models of excellence. 
But for all the criticism, the system has worked well enough for players and clubs to extend the agreement four times. The most recent extension ensured labor peace through 2007. Come September, the N.F.L. might be the only game in town, which makes a little purity seem like a small price to pay.

3 Bedrooms, a Big Backyard, and Now, No Poison Arrows

BYLINE:  By MATTHEW PURDY 

DATELINE: EDISON, N.J. 

 BODY:
THE people at Hovnanian Enterprises, a leading suburban homebuilder, figured they had heard every possible objection to a house. Too cramped. Not enough bathrooms. Too close to in-laws. Too far from in-laws.
 Then, a couple of years ago, a couple said their house must face south. Another said they couldn't live in a house where the interior staircase was aligned with the front door. One customer loved a house, but the unlucky numeral 4 in the address was a deal-breaker. 
 Corinne Hoffman, a Hovnanian executive, had a two-word question: "What's that?"
The two-word answer: Feng shui.
Even an incomprehensible customer is always right, so Ms. Hoffman began studying and instructing salespeople in feng shui (pronounced fung shway), the ancient Chinese practice that seeks harmony between people and living spaces.
The history of suburban design is littered with wonders like shag carpeting, veneer paneling, recessed fluorescent lighting, the mud room, the great room, the rec room and, last but not tackiest, the plastic slip cover. So it is no mystery why a spiritual approach to interior space, long-rooted in California and elsewhere, would arrive last in mainstream suburbia.
Hovnanian has not reconfigured houses, but in its design gallery here Ms. Hoffman pointed to features favored by the feng shui-savvy. Rounded counter edges are preferable. "Sharp angles are considered poison arrows, which emit negative energy," she said. Ms. Hoffman declared one kitchen overwhelmed by the color white, representing metal, and suggested a crystal vase, representing water, for balance.
An unbalanced house reflects an unbalanced life, she said. Clutter traps energy. A staircase aligned with a front door allows energy to come "down the stairs and go out the front door," she said. A plant at the base of the stairs could help. The standard pile of sneakers will probably not.
Toilets, while practical, are problematic. Water represents wealth, she said, so do everything to minimize "flushing away of that wealth." (Gents, lower the seat and the lid!)
Cy Thannikary, an economist and Hovnanian buyer, said he and his wife learned tips about maximizing the flow of chi, or energy, at a talk by Ms. Hoffman. They re-thought furniture placement and unloaded unwanted possessions -- like a painting of swans. "My wife said, I don't have any chi with that painting," he said. No chi, no swans.
Linking environment to attitude made sense, he said, but when Ms. Hoffman suggested hanging a coin at home to promote wealth, "I didn't buy that."
Many people buy that, and more.
ILEEN NELSON, director of the Long Island Feng Shui Institute, estimates that 100 feng shui consultants work on Long Island. When she lists what it has done for her, you wonder why there aren't 1,000.
She said she improved her daughter's behavior by moving her bedroom out of a "controlling position" in the back of the house and moving the master bedroom in. Feng shui correlates areas of space with areas of life, so when her husband's career stalled she moved a swing set from the "wealth corner" of the backyard. "He became the national sales manager for his company," she said. "You begin to say, 'Is this coincidence or is this feng shui?' "
There is no market for coincidence consultants. But Gregg Nodelman, a veteran feng shui adviser in Connecticut, notes a troubling explosion of inexperienced feng shui practitioners and of people seeking quick fixes for finances and relationships. He has mopped up more than a few messes.
One man, advised to paint his front door red, had unwittingly introduced the fire symbol into his home's career area, Mr. Nodelman said. He lost his job, but on Mr. Nodelman's advice "he painted it blue and within a month he got a job."
Feng shui can't always help. Karen Post, a New Jersey writer, had a feng shui horror house. It sat at an intersection where energy "just pounded the house," she said. A river behind it flushed away her money.
She installed wind chimes and a mirror to dissipate the frontal energy assault, and put a mirror in back to create a sense of circular water flow. She still "felt crushed by the house" and couldn't save money.
The old Chinese practice had fallen short. So she resorted to an old American practice. She removed the mirror out front, put up a "for sale" sign and sold the house. She even made a small profit, the river notwithstanding.

HEADLINE: Despite Recent Floods, Texans Fight Over Rights to Precious Water of the Guadalupe River 

BYLINE:  By JIM YARDLEY 

DATELINE: NEW BRAUNFELS, Tex., July 19 

 BODY:
The Guadalupe River has receded here, its fury abated. The devastating flooding this month washed away riverfront homes like bobbing corks and left this central Texas city's tourist economy so crippled that officials have begun an emergency advertising campaign.
 "New Braunfels," a proposed advertisement says. "It's still there." 
 Yet the breadth and power of the flooding, the spectacle of that roiling brown water, have temporarily obscured a problem: in normal times, the Guadalupe may not have enough water to meet the demands of one of the nation's fastest-growing regions.
This finite supply has prompted one of the most unusual water wars in the country. While cities, farmers and industry routinely file applications to pump water from rivers like the Guadalupe, a small Texas environmental group is seeking a permit to ensure that hundreds of billions of gallons of water are allowed to flow untouched to the Gulf of Mexico.
Environmentalists say the step is necessary to maintain the health of the Guadalupe and the estuary at its mouth. They cite problems that poor planning and poor management have wrought on the Everglades and on the Rio Grande. But others say the proposal would wreak havoc on a region desperate for drinking water by eliminating a vital source that is not threatened.
"It's a very interesting, very classic water battle," said W. E. West Jr., general manager of the Guadalupe-Blanco River Authority, which opposes the permit.
The Guadalupe meanders about 300 miles, from the Hill Country to the San Antonio Bay at the Gulf of Mexico. The Hill Country is semi-arid and susceptible to drought, but the rocky terrain makes the region vulnerable to flash flooding in rare downpours. After heavy rains this month, the normally placid Guadalupe turned into a violent waterway.
Here in New Braunfels, Michael Meek, president of the chamber of commerce, was fretting on July 3 that the drought might threaten the peak season of the city's $200 million tourist industry. Thousands were expected for Fourth of July inner-tube rides down the Guadalupe. Mr. Meek got so many calls that he issued a news release promising that the Guadalupe would be "toobable."
Little did he know. "It's either feast or famine," he said of the recent flood-or-drought existence along the Guadalupe. A 1998 flood followed similar spasms of flash flooding.
The longer dry periods drive the dispute over the Guadalupe. New Braunfels, San Marcos and Victoria draw drinking water from the river.
A regional water plan calls for pumping billions of gallons of water from the mouth of the Guadalupe to San Antonio. Yet many environmentalists worry that such stress on the river will reduce its flow and irreversibly damage the estuary.
The estuary, the breeding ground for shrimp, oysters and red snapper, as well as the winter home for the endangered whooping crane, depends on an influx of fresh water.
"We could see water rights being handed out right and left," said Dianne Wassenich, executive director of the San Marcos River Foundation, the group seeking the water permit. "We were concerned that there wouldn't be any water left."
Ms. Wassenich's group applied in July 2000 for a water right on the Guadalupe. Its application asked that 1.15 million acre feet of water be left in the river, a figure based on a state wildlife study to determine how much water was needed to maintain the estuary. An acre foot of water is the amount needed to cover an acre to a depth of a foot, or 325,851 gallons. The timing of the application was significant. In Texas, water rights are assigned in chronological order, meaning that during droughts, those with the oldest permits are first. The San Marcos application preceded the Guadalupe-Blanco River Authority's proposal to pump water to San Antonio.
The San Marcos application quickly attracted national attention. This year, the American Rivers Foundation named the Guadalupe one of the 10 most endangered rivers in the nation because of potential pumping demands. Western environmental groups have increasingly sought water rights as a way to protect rivers.
Mr. West, of the Guadalupe-Blanco River Authority, portrayed the application as an effort to stop growth and development in central Texas. Population in the region is expected to double by 2050, and the water supply, particularly in San Antonio, is a leading political issue. Mr. West said the San Marcos application would undercut a water plan approved by the State Legislature.
"It's a classic situation of growth versus nongrowth," he said. He contends that the San Marcos application seeks to keep too much water "in stream," leaving little for other uses. "That magnitude of water for bays and estuaries will simply prevent moving water to San Antonio."
A decision on the permit application will be made by the Texas Natural Resource Conservation Commission. Cities like New Braunfels oppose the San Marcos application, saying it does not fairly share the resource. Several wildlife and sportsmen groups and some residents of tiny fishing villages on the estuary support the application. The Legislature, which will meet in 2003, will probably address the issue.
Dr. Larry McKinney, senior director of aquatic resources for the Texas Department of Parks and Wildlife, said the San Marcos application had focused public attention on the long-term health of the river. A disputed question is how much water is available on the Guadalupe. Dr. McKinney pointed to a study that suggested there might be enough for all.
"My question to both sides is, What are we fighting about?" he said. "Why can't we figure out some plan to preserve enough water for the ecological health of the river and the bay and meet the growing needs of cities like San Antonio?"

HEADLINE: More May Not Mean Better In Health Care, Studies Find 

BYLINE:  By GINA KOLATA 

 BODY:
A growing body of research is leading many medical experts to ask whether more is really better when it comes to health care.
 Some medical specialties and geographical areas are suffering from a glut of doctors and hospitals, these experts say. Supply seems to drive demand. More hospitals in an area mean many more days spent in hospitals with no discernible improvements in health. More medical specialists mean many more specialist visits and procedures. 
 "If there are twice as many physicians, patients will come in for twice as many visits," said Dr. John E. Wennberg of Dartmouth Medical School, where much of the new work is being done. 
The Dartmouth researchers acknowledge that their findings are unexpected, and some experts say more work is needed to sort out cause from effect.
"These relationships are very difficult to disentangle," said Dr. Rodney Hayward, professor of health policy and management at the University of Michigan. Patients in some regions may be demanding more care, either because they are sicker or because they have come to expect it, Dr. Hayward said; doctors cluster in areas where there is more demand.
Still, Dr. Wennberg and his colleagues say the disparities are too stark to be explained entirely by such factors. In a paper published in February in the journal Health Affairs, they wrote that Medicare's typical lifetime spending for a 65-year-old in Miami is more than $50,000 higher than for a 65-year-old in Minneapolis. In a further analysis, they found that in Miami, where medical services are particularly abundant, the federal Medicare program pays more than twice as much per person per year as it does in Minneapolis: $7,847 in Miami, $3,663 in Minneapolis. 
Nor can the gap be explained by regional differences in medical costs, said Dr. Elliott S. Fisher, an author of the paper who is co-director of the Outcomes Group at the Veterans Affairs Medical Center in White River Junction, Vt., and a professor of medicine at Dartmouth. Older Miamians simply went to doctors and hospitals more often. In their last six months of life, they had more than six times as many visits to medical specialists as those in Minneapolis, spent twice as much time in the hospital and were admitted to intensive care units more than twice as often.
Life expectancy is no greater in regions that have more intensive medical care, the researchers find, and Medicare surveys find that their quality of care is no better. 
"What increased spending buys you is generally unpleasant interventions like intensive care units and feeding tubes," Dr. Wennberg said. 
Another recent study, on the distribution of newborn intensive-care specialists and the death rate among infants, reached a similar conclusion. A tripling of the numbers of these specialists did not result in any improvement in infant mortality. 
The Dartmouth findings are controversial, coming when much of the national conversation is about Americans who are receiving too little care -- not too much -- either because they lack insurance or because they cannot afford prescription drugs. Still, the research is attracting attention from mainstream medical groups, even those who say it is too preliminary to draw any firm conclusions.
"They are excellent scientists," said Dr. Yank D. Coble, president of the American Medical Association. But he added that many factors other than supply might be driving demand for medical services, including the cultural preferences in an area and the underlying health of its population.
Carmela Coyle, the senior vice president for policy at the American Hospital Association, acknowledged that more doctors and more hospitals led to more care, but she asked: "The question is, what level of care is the right level of care? We should ask the questions, have the conversation, but not jump to the conclusion that more is better or less is better."
But other doctors not connected with the Dartmouth research say that the body of evidence pointing to overuse is compelling.
"If you want to predict the amount of use, all you have to know is the supply," said Dr. Donald M. Berwick, president of the Institute for Healthcare Improvement, a nonprofit group in Boston. He says he regards the Dartmouth research as the most important in this area in the past quarter-century. 
"When all is said and done," Dr. Berwick said, "the people who have been most serious about it rarely think we are underresourced. The evidence to my mind is so strong. More is not better, and it often is very, very much worse."
Dr. Wennberg is the director of Dartmouth's Center for Evaluative Clinical Sciences. A 68-year-old professor who specializes in family and community medicine and in public health, he has spent his career studying variations in medical care across the country.
But nothing, Dr. Wennberg says, is so counterintuitive as the peculiarities that keep cropping up in the use of medical services. Whether it is the frequency of visits to a doctor or how often people have diagnostic tests or how much time people with chronic diseases spend in intensive care units or how often they are hospitalized, the data are consistent, he says: the greater the supply, the greater the use.
If medical care were just another commodity, the opposite would happen, he notes. "In areas where there are too many doctors it would be like areas where there are too many McDonald's," Dr. Wennberg said. Offices would be half-empty, doctors would see fewer patients.
Instead, without even realizing it, doctors in such areas simply see their patients twice as often, monitoring their conditions ever more closely, Dr. Wennberg said. Yet he and others say there is no evidence that patients in these regions are healthier. His colleague Dr. Fisher noted that four large studies of Medicare patients, by the Dartmouth group and three others, found no improvement in mortality in areas that spend more.
Dr. John Skinner, an economist who is part of the Dartmouth research team, says the researchers focused on medical care at the end of life to control for any regional differences in the underlying health of the population -- the possibility that people in Miami might need more medical services because they are sicker than those in Minneapolis.
"People in their last six months of life tend to be pretty sick no matter where they live," Dr. Skinner said. "This is what I use to effectively split the country into different quintiles of intensity and test whether the higher-intensity regions enjoy better life expectancy, since they certainly spend more over all on health care."
"Why do some regions spend more?" Dr. Skinner asked. "I don't think there's very good scientific evidence on when to stop. In some areas they just keep working until the very last minute." 
The Dartmouth group recently asked the same questions about medical care at the start of life, in its study on the relationship between supplies of newborn intensive care specialists and the death rate among infants in the United States. 
The reason for focusing on high-risk newborns, Dr. Fisher said, is that an infant's birth weight is an excellent indicator of the baby's risk of death. That allowed the researchers to compare outcomes for similar babies in regions with more, or fewer, newborn intensive care beds.
The result, they reported in May in The New England Journal of Medicine, was that the specialists were not distributed according to need. Regions with more low-birth-weight babies actually had fewer specialists.
But even though babies in areas with more neonatologists and more neonatal intensive care beds were more likely to spend time in the care of those specialists and to be admitted to those hospital units, their mortality rates were no better than those in any but the lowest 20 percent in terms of supply. 
From the second to the fifth quintile, there was a fourfold increase in the numbers of newborn intensive care beds and newborn intensive care specialists, Dr. Fisher said. The more beds available, he said, the more likely it was that babies of low to moderate risk spent time in one of these hospital units, he said.
"But we didn't see any benefit," he added.
Commenting in an editorial that accompanied the researchers' article in the journal, Dr. Kevin Grumbach of the University of California at San Francisco wrote: "The saga of neonatology is emblematic of how a market-driven health care system with inadequate public planning produces too much of a good thing."
The question of how much medical care is enough "is a major issue that we need to start addressing head on," Dr. Grumbach said in a recent interview.
The accumulating data, he said, "makes you question what we're getting for this phenomenal investment in health care."

Proposals for Downtown Draw Array of Opinions

 BODY:
 More than 4,000 people concerned about the future of the World Trade Center site attended "Listening to the City" at the Jacob K. Javits Convention Center, where there were, said Renee Nalitt, a participant, "as many opinions as there were people."

Jeff Galloway
Lives near trade center with family.
"I like bits of all the designs, but what is missing is active recreation space, places for kids to play ball. I believe a memorial is appropriate, but I don't want to live in a cemetery, where you have no choice but to cry. I want something triumphant, showing how we took a direct hit and survived, that they didn't beat us. The people that I knew who died, they wouldn't want us to mope."

Steve Krakower
Firefighter at Ladder Company 15 in Lower Manhattan.
"It should be built back as the eighth wonder of the world. . . . A memorial needs to be put in place. But we need to rebuild. Firemen are not quitters. I think to honor the fallen, and not cave in to terrorism, we need to rebuild."

Brian Arcuri
Customer service representative for Newsday.
"I don't think they should build on the footprints. That's where people lost their lives. It's sacred ground, like Gettysburg or Pearl Harbor."

John Farioli
Protested development of the trade center in the 1970's.
"I'd like to see the street grid restored and the traffic flow put back. . . . Governor's Island is a wonderful off-site location for the memorial. The site should be mostly office buildings, but also residential. It should be a 24-hour community, which the World Trade Center never was. It was a ghost town after 6 o'clock."

Renee Nalitt
Battery Park City resident.
"When I close my eyes, I can still walk through the trade center. . . . I want to see less memorial and more building for the future. An overbearing memorial will rip open those wounds again. We should have business, culture, retail, the things that made our city great on Sept. 10 and will make it great again."

Louis Epstein
Internet provider.
"We should retain the spirit of aspiring to the skies and not retreat. The new building should be at least as tall as the twin towers, and none of these plans even come close. I think anything less would be an insult to those that died."

Liam Strain
United States park ranger on Staten Island.
"Silverstein should be bought out and the land taken from the Port Authority and given to another public corporation. This Port Authority's stepping off point is the need to match the money-making capacity of the former World Trade Center, and I don't think that's where we should start from. We should be concerned with a memorial first, and cultural and open space for the downtown residents."

Jeffrey Quaid
Worked near trade center.
"I want the United Nations to be moved to the World Trade Center site, as a commitment to peace. Where the U.N. is now, I'd like a developer like Trump to build a large office tower to replace the twin towers."

Joy Tolliver
Psychology student at Fordham.
"What can be done is really limited. I mean, when you think about it, the lease is for 99 years. There isn't much we can do about it."

Marina Arevalo
Son died at trade center.
"I don't like the plans because of the buildings -- they are too tall, they're not safe, they're not secure. I want to see a museum showing the trade center before and after the attack, a green open area, and a quiet place for families to go."

Herminia Colon
Computer teacher.
"Whatever they build, I want to see jobs for minorities on the Lower East Side who are looking for work, and I want gardens to take my kids to visit."

Paul Fitzpatrick
Unemployed architect.
"I don't really care for any of the proposals. . . . A wide variety of design professionals from around the world should come forward with their ideas so we can have a beautiful memorial."

Craig Konyk
Architect and City College professor.
"I think everyone has such high expectations, and I hate to say this, but I think that we need to lower our expectations, because no matter what we come up with here today and whatever is eventually built, it is not going to please everyone."

OFFICIALS RETHINK BUILDING PROPOSAL FOR GROUND ZERO

BYLINE:  By EDWARD WYATT with CHARLES V. BAGLI 

 BODY:
Officials charged with rebuilding Lower Manhattan in the wake of the Sept. 11 terrorist attack on the World Trade Center said yesterday that they would consider new options for the site, including scaling back the amount of commercial space and extending the timeline for completing a final plan.
 The changes, the officials said, were in response to a broad array of criticism of the six initial designs for rebuilding the trade center site, including unfavorable appraisals at a town hall meeting in Manhattan yesterday. 
 The president of the Lower Manhattan Development Corporation, Louis R. Tomson, said in an interview during the meeting at the Jacob K. Javits Convention Center that the timeline to narrow the current six designs to three by the end of September would need to be extended by one to three months to allow officials to take into account the comments heard over the last week.
The executive director of the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey, Joseph J. Seymour, said that agency would re-examine its requirement that plans under development provide for the replacement of all the 11 million square feet of office space on the site before the attacks.
The comments by the two officials followed intense criticism of the six plans, which were released Tuesday, by architects, urban planners, politicians and, yesterday, a diverse group of citizens from the metropolitan region. 
More than 4,000 people attended the "Listening to the City" town hall meeting, and their appraisals, combined with repeated vows by officials overseeing the rebuilding to take into account the views of the group, appeared to leave the people in charge of the effort with few options but to consider new alternatives.
For example, in each of the six site designs, the setting for a memorial to the attack victims was rated "poor" by a majority or a plurality of those who attended. The participants -- who discussed the plans in groups of about 10 people and fed their comments to a central database, where they were compiled into overall themes -- said they wanted bolder, more innovative designs and asked the planners to seek other ways to fulfill the lease requirements for commercial and retail space.
"I want to see something that doesn't fulfill the stereotypes of who the terrorists think we are and what they were destroying," said Diane Dolan-Soto, 37, a Brooklyn resident. Those stereotypes, she said, include the thought "that capitalism is the only thing that matters."
Not all the commentary was negative. The participants said that they appreciated the attempts by designers to provide for buildings with an interesting visual impact on the skyline, and that they thought at least a portion of West Street should be moved underground to reconnect neighborhoods and provide easier access to the waterfront, a feature included in several of the plans.
When the six designs were first shown to the public on Tuesday, the chairman of the Lower Manhattan Development Corporation, John C. Whitehead, said the public could consider a seventh possibility, a new design without some of the requirements for office and retail space of the first six.
But participants at yesterday's meeting expressed some doubt that officials would take their desires into account. Asked how confident they were that their voices would be heard, only one-third said they were very confident or confident, with 45 percent saying they were somewhat confident and 22 percent saying they had little faith that would happen.
Moreover, those who registered their vote as "somewhat confident" made clear that doubt was a strong element of their response. When Robert D. Yaro, president of the Regional Plan Association and an organizer of the event, tried to summarize the result as saying that more than 80 percent believed they would be listened to, he was shouted down.
"I think we got a resounding sense that the Port Authority program has to go," he said, referring to the agency's requirement that all of the site plans provide for 11 million square feet of office space, 600,000 feet of retail space and a 600,000-square-foot hotel. "I understand that they've got a lease, but we've got to work with them to renegotiate that lease."
Mr. Seymour, the Port Authority official, said the agency will re-examine its agreement with Larry A. Silverstein, the developer who holds the commercial lease to the trade center site.
"Larry Silverstein has a leasehold interest on the site that requires him to build what was there," Mr. Seymour said. "We all know that's impractical for many reasons. It means there has to be a negotiation, but now is not the time to do that." 
That re-examination will take time, Mr. Tomson said. The six current plans were scheduled to be culled to three by the end of September, and to one by December. 
"We have to see if that next phase of the timeline is realistic," Mr. Tomson said. "We have to make this work, and if it takes a month or two in a different direction, then it takes a month more, or two or three."
Asked which of the designs' features displeased them most, the participants said that the designs were not ambitious enough, that they should include more nonoffice uses and that the grouping of buildings on the site was too dense.
In voting on each design's setting for a memorial, the participants rated the Memorial Promenade most highly, with 41 percent calling it "excellent" or "good." The design features a grand promenade to Battery Park and representations of the twin towers' footprints slightly east of the actual sites.
Some responses were clearly contradictory. Participants asked planners to preserve the footprints of the towers as a symbol of the tragedy, but they gave negative reviews to the plans that preserved those spaces. 
Other comments favored the larger scale of commercial development outlined in the plans, particularly for the impact it would have on the city's economy. "The commercial part of the rebuilding will create more job opportunities for the city," said Xinyu Li, 29, an Upper West Side resident and a software company executive who works in an office near the Javits Center.
The event, sponsored by the Civic Alliance to Rebuild Downtown New York, a coalition of community groups, had the curious feel of a meeting in a small town, but one held in a cavernous space on the western edge of Manhattan. Sitting in small groups, those attending appeared to relish the chance to talk with people whom they might rarely encounter in normal work and family life.
Most participants volunteered for the event, but many were recruited so that those in attendance would reflect the demographic and ethnic composition of the city and the region. About 46 percent of those attending were Manhattan residents and 32 percent lived in the city's four other boroughs. 
Many also reported they were close to or directly affected by the events of Sept. 11. In surveys conducted on wireless electronic keypads, 41 percent said they now worked or had worked in Lower Manhattan, and a third said they were at or near ground zero on Sept. 11. One in five said they had lost their jobs or a significant source of income as a result of the attack. 
And the effects of Sept. 11 clearly continue to resonate. During a video presentation on various memorials around the world, many participants wiped away tears.
The memorial was foremost in the minds of many. "Whatever they build is not a problem for me, as long as they leave space for a memorial," said Neta Smith, 60, a Brooklyn resident who was a maintenance worker at the trade center. She was on the 44th floor of the north tower when the first plane hit it.
Even those who were supposed to be impassive observers found themselves overcome at times. John Stansfield, 59, a resident of Southbury, Conn., volunteered to serve as one of the small-group leaders, sitting at a table and helping to guide the participants' discussion and summarize their thoughts.
"I'm supposed to be neutral and nonemotional," said Mr. Stansfield, who lost a friend when the twin towers collapsed. As tears welled in his eyes, he said, "I'm not off to a good start."

The Incredible Shrinking Stock Market

BYLINE:  By SETH W. FEASTER 

 BODY:
BY now we ought to be accustomed to sagging, downward-sloping fever lines and jittery market sell-offs. After all, that now-infamous bubble popped more than two years ago, and the market has been struggling with a sluggish economy, myriad accounting scandals, and understandably weak-kneed investors ever since. 
 But last week's nosedive reminded everyone that the bottom has not yet made itself known. It also brought into stark relief just how far the market has fallen since those heady days in 2000, when nearly every index was hitting its peak. The Dow Jones Industrials index hit its summit on January 14, 2000. The Nasdaq Composite maxed out a bit later, on March 10, 2000. 
 But a third and perhaps lesser known index -- the Wilshire 5000 -- provides one of the most comprehensive snapshots of the market, aiming as it does to track every publicly traded, U.S.-based company. The Wilshire hit its ceiling on March 24, 2000. Since then, the market has lost $7 trillion in value and shed more than 1,000 companies.
"The market lost perspective," said Dennis Tito, the founder of Wilshire Associates. "It's not that the country or the economy is doing that badly, it's just that the market is coming back to sensible levels."
 What follows are various ways of looking at the market's continuing contraction. SETH W. FEASTER

HEADLINE: Power Failure May Be Sign Of More Dark Days Ahead 

BYLINE:  By JAYSON BLAIR 

 BODY:
Although Consolidated Edison was able to restore electricity to tens of thousands of customers in Lower Manhattan yesterday in less than eight hours, utility and city officials warned that the New York region could face even more trying power failures before summer's end.
 "We were lucky that this happened on a Saturday," Eugene R. McGrath, the chairman of Con Ed, said yesterday, a day of the week when large power consumers like offices and factories tend to be closed down. 
 Con Ed officials said the loss of power after an explosion at 12:39 p.m. -- the third major blackout of the week in the city -- served as another reminder of the vulnerability of the region, which for a time had appeared to have escaped an approaching electricity crisis when demand fell off as the economy slowed and after the World Trade Center was destroyed. Con Ed officials said last night that more than 1,000 employees were able to bring back the power to all of its customers, who were affected across a large western section of Lower Manhattan in the worst blackout the city had suffered since Washington Heights and Inwood went dark in 1999. The officials said their crews managed to isolate the problems after a transformer caught fire at the East River Generation Station at 14th Street and the Franklin D. Roosevelt Drive, and reroute power to the area through other substations. 
Con Ed is concerned about tomorrow, when the work week begins and power demand is expected to increase by 20 percent.
"In my business, you learn never to be comfortable," Lou Rana, Con Ed's vice president for Manhattan, said in a telephone interview last night. "But I feel we are in good shape for tonight and for Sunday, but we do not have enough extra lines for Monday morning."
He added: "We are lucky it happened on a weekend; the loads were lower, that's how we were able to restore using a minimal amount of power. But we would have needed a lot more supply to have fixed the problem during the week."
The substations were transmitting 260 megawatts of electrical power at the time of the accident. The stations have a capacity of 560 megawatts.
More than 200 Con Ed employees are working on plans to make sure that there is enough power for Lower Manhattan tomorrow, officials said. Until that is done, the officials added,the city is not out of the woods.
It was a surprise to many Con Ed officials, who were careful not to sound optimistic yesterday afternoon, that they were able to restore power so quickly.
Mr. McGrath intially said it would take hours for officials to even enter the generation plant and determine how much damage had been done. When they did enter the plant, engineers and other workers in air packs found the transformer destroyed, melted metal beams and severely damaged control wiring.
The failures themselves were caused by the damage to the transformer and the tripping of emergency sensors, known as relays, that automatically shut down systems that transmit power to two substations on the Lower West Side.
The sensors also shut down feeds to and from the burning transformer, which is used to increase the voltage of electrical power, and other systems at the generation plant, an important hub in the city's power network.
On Sept. 11, residents of Battery Park City and parts of TriBeCa lost power when a Con Ed substation in 7 World Trade Center was destroyed. Afterward, those residents were switched to the Lower West Side substations, which failed yesterday.
The control wiring, essentially nerve endings in the power transmission process, had to be repaired or isolated, like the transformer was, before Con Ed officials could begin working on a solution. The officials were able to use other transformers in the area to supply -- at much reduced power -- the Lower West Side substations and get the 63,510 affected customers back by 8:12 p.m. Con Ed officials said it was still unclear last night what caused the fires. But the officials said it was another example of why the company needs to keep on increasing redundancy in a network that has been battered over the last year.
"To supply New York City, you really need a lot of redundancy because components fail and that is what we have here, we have extra redundancy," Mr. Rana said. A shutdown on Thursday night and Friday morning knocked out power at Spring Street and Sixith Avenue, distrupting rush hour subway service on the A, C and E. On Tuesday night, transit and Con Ed officials struggled to deal with a similar power failure that knocked out service during the evening rush, along the A and C lines between Bedford-Stuyvesant and Lower Manhattan for about two and half hours.

 How could you possibly go on strike now? Look around you. We have corporate America stealing pensions, the economy is weak, people are losing their jobs, our politicians are fighting like cats and dogs, and it appears that you "boys of summer" have forgotten that we are at war. 
 Most Americans supported baseball and your careers through your good times and bad. I am a fan for 44 years now, I am 51 years old, I'd say that shows loyalty. How about some loyalty from you?
I know you have a right to strike, but is it right to strike? You'll be striking against us, not your fat-cat owners. The fans in the stands, the old-timer who spends his days and nights watching you on television; our military personnel whose connection to home is sports; the child who puts on his favorite cap and jersey with your name on it when he watches a game: they are going to suffer. 
You owe us something now. We need to cheer a home run, marvel at a great play at shortstop, discuss a manager's pitching change.

HEADLINE: It's All Timing 

 BODY:
To the Sports Editor:
 The approach of baseball owners to labor relations is typified by the announcement by Commissioner Bud Selig shortly after last year's World Series that two teams would be eliminated. Consider an alternative: The commissioner discusses the issue with the union, trying to move the two teams to geographical areas where the teams would be financially viable. It is hoped that no jobs would be lost as a result, no loss of consumer welfare, no angered lawmakers and increased franchise value of the struggling teams. 
 Even if one assumes baseball's current confrontational approach to labor relations is wise, its implementation has been misguided. At present, both economic and legal factors point to a work stoppage at a time of great owner vulnerability. 
First, the players have been paid a substantial part of their annual salaries and can sustain the cost of a stoppage with relative ease. The owners, on the other hand, are faced with the loss of critical revenue from the postseason, the playoffs and the World Series. They will also experience pressure for interest payments from banks which hold teams' debt.
Second, the legal framework makes a strike soon appear attractive from the players' perspective. Under labor law, an owner may not unilaterally alter terms of employment while a collective bargaining agreement is in effect; that is the present situation. But when an agreement expires, as it will at the end of the season, an owner may legally alter employment terms unilaterally once bargaining has reached an impasse. 
Thus, all things being equal, the players would prefer to force a resolution using their economic strength rather than wait until a point at which owners can, without committing an unfair labor practice, unilaterally implement their desired changes.

 MUSSOLINI
By R. J. B. Bosworth.
Illustrated. 584 pp. New York:
Oxford University Press. $35.
 Americans have tended to think of Benito Mussolini as a cross between a gangster and a buffoon, a "Sawdust Caesar" who hijacked Italian democracy and led his country to disaster as Hitler's junior partner. But in recent decades a number of Italian historians have disputed this view. They ask how this clownish figure could have won and held power in a major European country for 20 years or helped to create what was, for better or worse, one of the 20th century's leading political movements: Fascism. 
This historical debate has acquired new urgency now that "post-Fascists" (as yesterday's neo-Fascists call themselves today) are an important part of Italy's center-right government led by Silvio Berlusconi. The post-Fascists have argued that there was a good and a bad Fascism. The good part, in this view, occurred during the early years following Fascism's rise to power in 1922, when it put an end to partisan political strife and the threat of left-wing revolution, drained the country's malarial swamps and made the trains run on time. The bad part essentially began in 1937, when Mussolini threw in his lot with Hitler.
R. J. B. Bosworth, a professor of history at the University of Western Australia, announces at the beginning of his "Mussolini" that he intends to steer something of a middle course, agreeing that Mussolini did not govern merely by coercion but enjoyed widespread support, while retaining the fundamentally negative assessment of his time in power. The result is a fresh, intelligent and judicious re-examination of Mussolini and the Fascist period.
These days it is easy to forget that belief in the superiority of free-market democracy was far from universally shared in the first half of the 20th century. Many, on the left as on the right, regarded it as a highly inefficient, unsatisfactory system, prone to influence peddling, corruption and demagoguery. A pure political vision -- whether of a socialist revolution or of national greatness -- required either a vanguard of committed revolutionaries or a single leader, acting without the clumsy machinery of representative democracy. 
Given this context, it is hardly surprising that Mussolini started out on one end of the spectrum only to finish up on the other. Born in 1883, the son of a Socialist from Emilia-Romagna, Italy's "red" region, Mussolini grew into a young firebrand of the party's radical left wing. He showed a talent for debate, catchy phrasing and newspaper work, sharpening his pen by excoriating the Socialists' moderate wing and insisting on the need for violent revolution. When the radicals took over the party in 1912, Mussolini became the editor of the party's national newspaper. As Bosworth notes, he was skillful at the job, quadrupling circulation in just two years.
But the advent of World War I divided Italy's Socialists, as it did the rest of the country, into those who favored intervention and those who opposed it. Mussolini, although he had criticized capitalist warmongering in the past, suddenly and loudly jumped into the interventionist camp. Forging the ideology that became known as Fascism, he gave voice to the considerable number who tried to combine socialism and nationalism. Bosworth goes to pains to show that this was not entirely new. Nationalists were accustomed to using Marxist rhetoric for their cause, referring to Italy as a "proletarian nation." Much of Mussolini's language -- the exultation of war, the yearning for a Duce to lead the masses -- echoed that of Filippo Marinetti, the author of "The Futurist Manifesto" and the soldier-poet Gabriele D'Annunzio, both of whom were early rivals of Mussolini for control of the new Fascist movement.
The war effort, in many ways, became the model for Fascist organization, proving what the nation could do when individual self-interest was put aside for a great cause. Some five million Italians -- about as many as voted in the 1913 elections -- performed military service in the war, and half a million lost their lives. The high expectations of returning veterans were disappointed by the relatively modest territorial concessions that the Italian government achieved with the Versailles treaty. At the same time, the Socialists, inspired by the example of the Bolsheviks in Russia, threatened revolution and made the colossal blunder of refusing to admit veterans into their ranks. This army of millions became a new, difficult-to-control political force, and various veterans' associations sprouted up around the country. Many of them used the term "fascio," meaning union or association but referring as well to the bundle of rods that was a symbol of authority in ancient Rome. Mussolini, with his undeniable charisma and skill as a public speaker, was able to give these people leadership and a plan of action. 
Initially, Fascism's program retained many socialistic elements: land reform, workers' rights, resolutions to abolish the monarchy and limit the influence of the Catholic Church. But as Mussolini maneuvered to take power, he gradually dropped these more radical demands in order to win over conservative nationalists, monarchists, army officials and big business. The continual strikes staged by the Socialists and Communists in 1919 and 1920 paved the way for the Fascists. Italy's terrified establishment stood by quite happily as Mussolini's henchmen burned down Socialist headquarters, broke up political rallies and killed Socialist leaders. 
When Mussolini and his Black Shirts threatened to march on Rome unless they were allowed to run the government, Italy's power elite simply acquiesced. Italy had always been governed by a small minority, so it was not hard to convince many Italians that servicemen who had risked their lives for the country deserved to govern it more than the flabby old liberals, who had stayed home, or the Socialists, who had betrayed the country and opposed the war.
Bosworth goes on to argue that Mussolini remained in power by abandoning much of the originality of Fascism, leaving most of Italian life remarkably unchanged. Mussolini liked to distinguish himself from his German imitator, Hitler, by pointing out that Italian Fascism respected religion and the family. While this did mean that there was considerably more breathing room in Fascist Italy, it also meant that Il Duce's claim to have established what he called totalitarian rule was more rhetorical than real.
All in all, Bosworth gives Mussolini rather low marks as a leader, pointing out that the country's economy grew more slowly under Fascism than before. Wages fell. Agricultural production stalled. Mussolini was assiduous in stamping out political dissent; as a former newspaper editor, he paid particular attention to controlling the press. 
Bosworth's thesis -- that Fascism was more the expression of collective social forces than the work of one man -- is a helpful way of thinking about the early history of Fascism. It works less well, I think, for the 1930's, when Mussolini arrogated more and more power to himself and began to turn his attention to foreign affairs. Not much evidence exists to show that there was a great push in Italian society or even in military circles for the invasion of Ethiopia in 1935 or for the Fascists' involvement in the Spanish Civil War. 
Mussolini came to believe in his own cult of personality, and insisted on taking over several cabinet positions at the same time. He listened less and less to the advice of others; the Fascist Grand Council, the only deliberative body under Fascism, virtually stopped meeting. Mussolini ordered the invasion of Albania largely out of pique at not being informed in advance about Germany's invasion of Czechoslovakia. Similarly, the disastrous invasion of Greece appears to have been the result of Mussolini's personal whim. 
Bosworth argues that Mussolini entered World War II reluctantly, and at the last possible minute, much as Italy had entered World War I. But the analogy is a very imperfect one: there was substantial public enthusiasm for the first war and almost none for the second. The decision was unquestionably Mussolini's. 
Because the lack of dissent and consultation in the Fascist system allowed Mussolini to follow his personal caprice, the distinction now being made in Italy between a good and a bad Fascism is untenable. With no checks on his power, as Bosworth himself writes, Mussolini "was a prisoner both of his myth and of the fact that every little matter had to pass his scrutiny." Ultimately, Mussolini's story demonstrates the limits of his personal power, but also the extent to which he was able to do great harm. It is a credit to Bosworth's biography that he fully gives us both of these sides.

 IRIS ORIGO
Marchesa of Val d'Orcia.
By Caroline Moorehead.
Illustrated. 373 pp. Boston:
David R. Godine. $35.
 A TRULY international existence offers rich, terrifying possibilities. It mitigates xenophobia, invites diverse experience and induces an inevitable lack of ease. Caroline Moorehead's fascinating biography of Iris Origo charts such a glamorous, loaded, unsettled life.
An Anglo-American heiress who lived in Italy, married an Italian, had English lovers and wrote eloquently about subjects ranging from Byron's daughter to everyday events in the Italian countryside under Mussolini's Fascism, Origo was a true cosmopolite of vast energy and stunning intelligence. Moorehead, whose previous books include a biography of Bertrand Russell and a history of the Red Cross, describes the colorful childhood of the rich little girl who became the Marchesa of Val d'Orcia and gives detailed information on her writing and her complex private life. She also reveals Origo's splendid and anonymous philanthropy; Origo was the rare person of privilege who used her position for the real betterment of the world.
In 1909, when the father of the 7-year-old Iris Cutting was on his deathbed, he wrote his wife, "All this national feeling makes people so unhappy." About their only child, he instructed: "Bring her up somewhere where she does not belong, then she can't have it. . . . She should really be cosmopolitan, from deep down. . . . When she grows up she really will be free to love or marry anyone she likes, of any country, without it being difficult." His daughter would, indeed, transcend boundaries. 
Iris Margaret Cutting -- the "Margaret" appeared after relatives insisted that "Iris Cutting" was "too botanical" -- was raised in Fiesole, overlooking Florence, in a villa that had been built for Cosimo de' Medici. Vasari called it "a magnificent palace," and Lorenzo the Magnificent discussed poetry there. The clothing worn centuries later by Iris and Sybil, her widowed mother, embodied the airy elegance of Iris's childhood. As a little girl, she wore "long white muslin dresses and floppy muslin hats" while picking wild strawberries in the Apennines; Sybil was typically clad in "scarlet silk cloaks, heavy pleated silk Fortuny gowns, gossamer chiffon dresses and cashmere shawls." Bernard Berenson had the villa next door and distinguished visitors streamed into the sumptuous villa (Moorehead provides a fine account of the deeply established English community in Florence). But Iris suffered a lot. The hypochondriac Sybil was often bed-ridden, yet managed to remarry twice, making Iris feel like a complete outsider. Iris was one of those women who flourished in maturity after agonizing in adolescence; as a debutante, she felt as awkward among Italian nobility as with her wealthy relatives back in the United States. Her existence, Origo herself noted, alternated "between caviar and bread and milk" -- contrasts Iris chose later in life.
Moorehead's presentation is succinct and informative. With cool objectivity, she outlines the rise of Fascism in Italy and provides thumbnail sketches of various people, among them Mussolini. We learn that when Iris met Antonio Origo -- the illegitimate son of a marchese who was both a cavalry officer and artist, and of the Russian wife of an Italian duke, with whom she had two sons -- and Antonio subsequently proposed marriage, Iris's mother so disapproved of this man (who was 10 years Iris's elder, Roman Catholic and too handsome) that she persuaded the couple not to communicate for six months to test their devotion. The day the time period lapsed, Origo repeated his proposal, and the match was permitted, although Sybil never emerged from her bed to attend the large and festive wedding.
The couple opted for hard work and rugged country life. They acquired La Foce, a rural estate Iris called "a lunar landscape, pale and inhuman." Iris and Antonio learned to reap by hand, plow with oxen, build dikes and make roads. They worked longer days than the 25 families they employed. At the age of 22, Iris initially had a hard time -- she broke the syringe the first time she tried to give an injection to an elderly woman suffering from asthma -- but she soon started a school for the 50 or so children on the estate, taught these members of illiterate families to read and provided for every aspect of their well-being. It was a lovely, unusual existence.
Back at the villa in Fiesole, Iris nursed her newborn son while listening to the fountains outside, and Antonio read to her from D'Annunzio. When she came down with flu in Davos, the doctor had her sleep late, ice skate for an hour, linger on the hotel balcony and play solitaire. At La Foce, Iris commandeered the planting and irrigating of those arid grounds to create a splendid landscape, devoting herself to gardening because she liked "its continuity, and its cruelty, and its hopefulness." And during World War II the Origos were among the few aristocrats who helped everyone escaping Fascism, Moorehead writes, whether they were "prisoners, partisans or deserters." Quietly, sometimes secretly (and certainly without a tax deduction) Iris paid for the higher education of needy children, covered mortgage payments, provided funds for medical care, financed training programs and gave moral support. 
What is startling is that Antonio wore black shirts in support of Fascism, and Iris called Mussolini "a very great man." But then, as Moorehead sagely explains, praise was also accorded Mussolini by, among others, Winston Churchill, Neville Chamberlain and Otto Kahn.
Iris Origo was also a fine writer and competent biographer. She discovered a cache of love letters between Byron and the Countess Teresa Guiccioli and wrote "The Last Attachment," a colorful book about their relationship. After gaining access to an obscure archive of medieval documents, she wrote "The Merchant of Prato," about everyday 14th-century life. Moorehead provides copious and interesting details on the publishing, editing and reviewing of these and Origo's other books. But unfortunately she fails to bring them to life, either through good excerpts or trenchant commentary. 
The same dryness applies to Moorehead's depiction of people and workmanlike detailing of love affairs. The facts are interesting, but the reader cannot adequately feel or see the charm of the characters. Yet the text is salvaged by judicious quotations. Consider Antonio after he has taken off from the villa to avoid the exiled Queen of Greece when she came to tea: "They are unbearable, these unemployed queens." And there is Kenneth Clark hearing Berenson declare, on the day Hitler came to power, "This will turn into something that will make Mussolini look like a fairy tale."
In her afterword, Moorehead recalls the one occasion when she met Iris Origo, in 1980, eight years before her subject's death. Having gone to La Foce to write a profile for The Times of London, she found the Marchese "elegant and beautifully dressed, her features more delicate now in old age. Because slightly ill at ease, she was also rather formidable." The description is surely accurate, but lacks the dash or sharpness of Origo's own writing. 
For that we must turn to R. W. B. Lewis's 1975 biography of Edith Wharton. Wharton was a friend of Origo's father. In three brief paragraphs, we thrill to the flare of Iris Origo as we never do in Moorehead's 373 pages. Lewis describes Origo as a woman "with a deep quiet intelligence and a love both of literature and of the men and women who made it," and as someone who wrote "with delicate acuteness." He demonstrates that superb concurrence of traits by quoting Origo on Edith Wharton's visit to the Cutting family estate on Long Island. "I caught a glimpse of the other Edith, elegant, formidable, as hard and dry as porcelain. Then, as she looked down on her old friends, the face softened, even the erectness of her spine relaxed a little. She was no longer the trim, hard European hostess, but a nice old American lady. Edith had come home."
In that stunning account, we encounter Iris Origo as a sublime wordsmith and an astute and passionate observer of human behavior. We also see the clarity with which Origo recognized contrasting cultures vying for supremacy over Edith Wharton's life as they did over her own. 
Caroline Moorehead supplies, diligently, the details of the life of this enchanting person. With Iris Origo's verve and insight and humor also evident, we glimpse a spectacular human being.

Pedaling, if Not in the Tour de France

BYLINE:  By JULIA MEURLING 

 BODY:
High-end racing bicycles can be expensive, with the lightweight, aerodynamic road models like those used by Lance Armstrong in the Tour de France costing around $3,000.
 But most of the 43 million bicyle owners in the United States spin their wheels for fitness and leisure. 
For these cyclists, a bike will cost much less, averaging $455 for a mountain bike and $337 for a comfort bike -- a modified mountain bike, designed for easier riding, with softer seats and a more upright riding position. 
 The number of bicycles sold each year has hovered around 11 million. But total spending on bicycles, parts and accessories grew to $5.9 billion in 2000 from $5.5 billion in 1999, according to the National Bicycle Dealers Association. JULIA MEURLING

HEADLINE: The Relevance Of 'Sex' in a City That's Changed 

BYLINE:  By JULIE SALAMON 

 BODY:
"SEX and the City" sashayed into public consciousness in the summer of 1998, when sex had become, if not the national pastime, the reigning political story. Monica Lewinsky had just been featured on the cover of Vanity Fair, and her name was regularly mentioned on the front pages of major newspapers. The Clinton-Lewinsky affair had made lewd gossip an acceptable form of political commentary, and "Sex and the City" quickly became part of the pundit glossary.
 The show, a smart and frisky comedy, became an instant hit, and not just in New York, though the city became an essential character, an otherworldly backdrop of glamorous hedonism and larger-than-life yearning. This was New York rarefied, the glittering city of after-hours parties, where models and Wall Streeters mingle with the almost-beautiful and the not-quite-rich, and a crucial component of social I.Q. is the ability to spot a Birkin bag across a crowded room. 
 After Sept. 11, however, Manhattan acquired a terrible new symbolism, and economic uncertainty has taken a toll on hedonism, at least of the expense-account kind. Osama bin Laden has outpaced Monica Lewinsky by 17 to 1 in the pages of The New York Times over the last year. Sarah Jessica Parker, who plays Carrie Bradshaw, the newspaper writer whose column tracks her adventures in dating, is pregnant in real life. Kim Cattrall, who plays the public relations vamp, Samantha, published a sex manual with her husband this year -- in which she confessed that she didn't enjoy her 20 years of sex before meeting him. And earlier this month, Candace Bushnell, the sleek blonde writer whose libidinous columns in The New York Observer and subsequent book spawned "Sex and the City," got married, at 43 (to a man 10 years younger than she, but still, married).
Tonight "Sex and the City" begins its fifth season on HBO in a world solemnized by terrorism and, apparently, newly appreciative of the joys of marriage. What does this mean for a show that has relied on an unending sense of youth and blitheness? Has "Sex" become irrelevant?
Not at all. It's a different show than it was, not as lighthearted, but it's still involving and inventive. Chastity hasn't replaced promiscuity. There's still plenty of sex and plenty of talk about sex. But judging from the poignant first two episodes, the real subject of the new season -- absurd though it may seem -- could be loss of innocence, personal and global (recognizing that in New York, it's become difficult to distinguish one from the other).
Longtime viewers noticed in January, when new episodes that had been filmed before Sept. 11 were first shown, that the title sequence had been altered. Ms. Parker still tiptoed through the city landscape in a tutu-like skirt, and got splashed by a bus, but the twin towers -- previously prominent -- had been edited out. It seemed a wan effort, as though the producers, by reflecting the new skyline but leaving the rest unchanged, were trying to pretend that everything was the same. The premiere of the new season, filmed after the attack, dispels those fears.
Without mentioning the destruction of the World Trade Center, the opening episode alludes to it. "If you want to do your patriotic duty as New York women, you come shopping with me right now and throw some much-needed money downtown," Carrie says to her friends. When Samantha describes her unfaithful lover as toxic, Carrie replies: "Manthrax?" Beyond the jokes, however, is the sense that life has changed irrevocably, that the perpetual childhood is over. "Maybe you have to let go of who you were to become who you will be," Carrie muses after another disillusioning night on the town.
The show's producers and writers -- led by Darren Star, its creator, and the executive producer Michael Patrick King -- have had a palpable affection for the city, though the sentiment was often distilled through martini-dry observations. "Manhattan, for millions of our forefathers the gateway to hope, opportunity and happiness beyond their wildest dreams," Carrie wrote in one of her columns in the second season. "Today that hope is still alive. It's called the first date." Ms. Parker's voiceover was accompanied by dreamlike images of immigrants melding into visions of glossy contemporary New Yorkers, dining and partying. "On Saturday nights, every restaurant in Lower Manhattan resembles its own little Ellis Island. Hordes of single women crowded into a hot, cramped space, hoping to make it to their final destination. The state of matrimony -- or at least to get a hot meal in transit."
The show's allure has always relied on the juxtaposition of frivolity with serious concerns. The four women, all financially self-sufficient, have tempered their flip cynicism with hope, and their man-obsession with a desire for independence, legal and spiritual. In past episodes, Miranda the lawyer (Cynthia Nixon), on buying her first apartment, discovered that her mortgage agreement assumed she was dependent on a father or husband. In another, Carrie admitted that the main attraction of baseball for her was the opportunity to drink and smoke publicly in the afternoon without reproach. While the four women -- especially Ms. Parker's shoe-obsessed Carrie -- represent a fashion-conscious breed, they can also look realistically bedraggled in the wake of too much socializing, emotionalizing or, yes, even too much sex.
With all its frankness, "Sex and the City" almost never leers as it chronicles the brutality and absurdity of upscale mating rituals. In its funny and provocative debut four years ago, Carrie posed a question that was emblematic of the show's style, insouciant, yet not. "Can women have sex like men?" It wasn't a matter of positions -- though the show capitalized on HBO's laissez-faire attitude toward demonstrating them -- but of emotions. Could women engage in casual sex without the aftershock of attachment, longing, obsession? It was also a matter of language. Carrie and her friends talked about sex and men and body parts bluntly and vulgarly. But they were just as candid about their fears of growing old alone. These narcissistic tough cookies, played by a wonderful ensemble cast, had a surprising, wistful core.
They've always known the party couldn't go on forever. The show's producers haven't kept them locked in time, like sitcom characters, but allowed them to change -- to grow up, like it or not. Rather than pretend that the actresses were ageless, the series has had them confront unsexy issues like menopause. In the most recent season, under Mr. King's guidance, "Sex and the City" had already become more sober, the humor less carefree. Miranda, the hard-edged lawyer, became pregnant accidentally and then decided to have the baby after considering abortion. Samantha, too, let her guard down and fell in love. Charlotte (Kristin Davis) dropped her career for marriage and motherhood, only to find out she was infertile. Carrie became engaged to a nice but dull man and then, ever ambivalent, broke it off.
These characters may be confounded by their decisions -- and indecision -- but they won't be doomed to the fate of Lily Bart, their literary ancestor, a single woman navigating the New York social scene a century ago. Edith Wharton describes the dilemma that would eventually lead to Lily's suicide in "The House of Mirth":
"She had been bored all the afternoon by Percy Gryce -- the mere thought seemed to waken an echo of his droning voice -- but she could not ignore him on the morrow, she must follow up her success, must submit to more boredom, must be ready with fresh compliances and adaptabilities, and all on the bare chance that he might ultimately decide to do her the honor of boring her for life.
"It was a hateful fate -- but how escape from it? What choice had she?"
As the new season opens, Carrie considers her choices, including the prospect that she may always be on her own. Her bravado has been shaken, especially after a lunchtime encounter with a worst-case portent of the future. A crazy old woman in a beret (Sylvia Miles), with scraggly bottle-blonde hair, begins chatting about how she used to look like Carrie until she broke up with a man -- in 1982 -- because she thought something better would come along. "Never happened," she says. Then there's another confrontation, this one with her friend's new maternal breasts, as Miranda flips down her nursing bra and tries to carry on a conversation while her baby tries to latch onto her nipple. Cynthia Nixon beautifully captures Miranda's frustration as Carrie tries to reassure her with a joke: "You're still one of us, only now you're the one with the biggest boobs." It doesn't reassure either of them, now that function as well as form has been altered.
Yet the show hasn't lost its charm or its sense of hopefulness. When a man offers to take Carrie home from a dance, he says, "It's rough out there."
"It's not so bad," she says, heading into the Manhattan night alone. Both she and the city seem more fragile, yet still willing to believe in possibility. At this moment, that sense of optimism is almost as seductive as sex.

Retail Space Being Filled at New Kennedy Terminal

BYLINE:  By RACHELLE GARBARINE 

 BODY:
HERMES, Ferragamo and Hugo Boss are names usually linked with shopping on Fifth and Madison Avenues or at an upscale regional mall. By next spring they will also have stores at the 100,000-square-foot retail corridor at Terminal 4 at Kennedy International Airport. 
 The three stores are part of a group of 13 retailers that will take a total of nearly 13,000 square feet in the corridor and complete its leasing, albeit more than a year after it was completed, as part of the $1.4 billion construction of the new terminal, which is mainly for international carriers. The corridor is positioned before the airline security checkpoints and is designed to resemble a suburban mall. 
 The commitment, industry professionals say, reflect a move toward higher-end stores at airports, long associated with tacky and overpriced souvenirs. 
It comes at a time when retailing at airports is still feeling aftershocks from the economic downturn and the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks. These effects include a drop in the number of air travelers and a growing focus on security, which in most cases has resulted in stretching the time passengers spend at airports.
Nationally, most passengers are arriving two hours before departure, nearly double the previous wait, according to the Center for Airport Management, a retail leasing and consulting firm in Portland, Ore., and the number of travelers, though increasing, is still 10 percent lower than it was last year. 
For the region's major airports -- J.F.K., La Guardia and Newark -- as of May the number of travelers was down 17 percent from last year, according to the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey. At J.F.K.'s Terminal 4, with a projected six million passengers this year, the count was down 15 percent.
Projections nationally and in the region are that the gaps will continue to close this year and hardly exist by next year.
Meanwhile, passengers' longer stays in airports could mean "a growing opportunity for retail, which is moving toward more luxury goods," said Stephen Yalof, president of Robert K. Futterman & Associates, a retail consulting group in Manhattan. In recent years food offerings have gone from cafeteria-style outlets to national fast-food chains and sit-down restaurants, he said, adding that a similar upgrade is in order for the retail space. 
It is the next logical step, added Shelly Klapper, president of the Center for Airport Management, which works with JFK IAT, the consortium that manages Terminal 4.
The trend is evident at other airports, including Terminal C at Newark International Airport, run by Continental Airlines. Kenneth Cole, offering men and women's shoes and apparel; Johnston & Murphy, a men's footwear and apparel store; and L'Occitane, which sells upscale personal care products and cosmetics, are among the retailers opening shops at that newly renovated and enlarged terminal. The shopping area at Newark's Continental terminal grew by 38 stores, to 97, according to Westfield America, the Australian shopping center developer that manages the retail space there.
At J.F.K.'s Terminal 4, the retail concept since planning began in 1996 has been "to give travelers the same mix of retailing and pricing they would find on New York City streets," said David Sigman, executive committee member at JFK IAT. The consortium is made up of Schipol USA, the United States subsidiary of a Dutch company that manages airports in the Netherlands and in several other countries; LCOR, a national real estate company; and Lehman Brothers, the investment bank.
The consortium signed a seven-year lease for all 13 stores left in the corridor, as well as two small ones in the arrival hall, with an Austrian company, Saveria JFK, which brought in the tenants and will manage the outlets as their franchisee. Other tenants include Swatch and Tie Rack as well as a gift shop offering Mont Blanc pens and Swarovski crystal, said Rakesh Sardana, president of Saveria. His company, based in Vienna, operates stores in downtown Vienna and at Vienna International Airport. 
The latest arrivals will join 25 existing tenants and food outlets, including DKNY apparel and Sylvia's of Harlem, a carry-out soul food store. The Metropolitan Museum of Art will open a 1,300-square-foot store in November, said Sally Pearson, the museum's vice president and general manager of merchandising and retail.
"We are in high-traffic, high-tourist places," so airports make sense, Ms. Pearson said.
Earlier attempts to market the site that Saveria has leased fell through. First Nuance, an affiliate of Swissair, had negotiated a lease for the space, but was unable to complete the deal after the airline filed for bankruptcy last fall. (A new airline, Swiss, has since replaced Swissair and is one of 44 carriers that fly out of the terminal.) There was also interest from retailers to lease one store at a time, but JFK IAT preferred to lease all the space to one management firm, which then would be responsible for filling the individual stores. 
Mr. Sardana said he proceeded because "seeing into the future and beyond the cyclical nature of air travel, it made business and economic sense to be in a new and truly international terminal." It also seemed right to support New York, he added.
Nationwide, airport retailers have benefited from the fact that while there are fewer passengers, they are staying in terminals longer, said Mr. Klapper of the Center for Airport Management. Compared with a year earlier, he said, business is up 14 percent at food-oriented concerns and 6.5 percent at newsstands. Though business at specialty retailers has fallen 3 to 5 percent, the drop has been lower at airports than at traditional shopping malls, where business has declined by 6 percent.
Accommodating bomb detection machines -- some the size of minivans -- could result in a store or two being eliminated in some airports. In some cases, heightened security also has resulted in long lines and travelers too frazzled to shop in stores located before the security check points.
Even before Sept. 11, Mr. Klapper said, the airline industry was seeking to improve retailing at airports to capitalize on travelers' spending power, in part by making their waiting time "less stressful." 
THE retail corridor at Terminal 4, designed by Communication Arts of Boulder, Colo., attempts to meet those goals by offering diverse shops and a pleasant environment. Of the 100,000 square feet of total space in the retail corridor, only 60,000 feet is for the stores and restaurants themselves, and the rest is dedicated to seating and landscaped areas. 
Carol Fish, commercial director for JFK IAT, said Saveria's payments to her company this year would approach $1 million. These payments are made up of a base rent and a percentage of sales. The entire corridor will generate $15 million this year in revenue to JFK IAT. Based on those numbers, payments in the corridor average $250 a square foot. 
The terminal, Mr. Sigman said, was designed with room for the updated security equipment, eliminating the need to take space away from the retail corridor. It also has 12 check-in positions at each of its two security checkpoints, cutting down on lines and limiting the processing time to about 12 minutes, he said. 
As for the rest of the time, Ms. Fish said, the focus "is to keep people in the retail corridor, so all departing passengers must pass through it on their way to the two departing concourses." It is also open to nonpassengers and airport employees.
Still, not all retailers were successful in the terminal's first year. Three stores -- a gourmet food purveyor, a Southwestern apparel shop and a food outlet -- have closed or plan to move out because "they weren't the right concept," Ms. Fish said, noting that such turnover is not uncommon. She said a redesign is being considered to add stores beyond the security points to capture more shoppers. 
Mr. Sardana of Saveria said the retail environment and layout at Terminal 4 appeal to him. So does the chance to operate 15 stores rather than one or two, lowering the usually high operating costs at airports, he said, adding that the stores will start to open in November and continue through next spring.

HEADLINE: NEIGHBORHOOD REPORT: NEW YORK TRANSIT; 
Articulated Buses Keep Rumbling, Despite a Litany of Complaints

BYLINE:  By ERIKA KINETZ 

 BODY:
To some riders, articulated buses are big, bad bulls wreaking havoc in the quiet china shop of the Upper East Side. To the Metropolitan Transportation Authority, they are a cost-effective answer to the city's increasing load of mass transit users. Two years of hearings, meetings, petitions and studies have failed to resolve that difference of opinion. 
 In 2000, the authority introduced articulated buses, which are 20 feet longer than normal buses and can hold 50 percent more passengers, on the crosstown routes at 79th, 86th and 23rd Streets. From the first, the newcomers were greeted by a steady drumbeat of complaints about safety, accessibility, noise, and the frequency of service. 
 But despite the vocal opposition of many residents, along with Community Boards 6 and 8, the New York City Transit Riders Council and a cadre of local politicians, it seems the buses are here to stay, a decision that strikes many people as utterly baffling.
"With the amount of opposition from riders and the long list of criticisms and safety concerns, the M.T.A.'s response so far is just mystifying," said Representative Carolyn B. Maloney, who represents portions of Manhattan and Queens and recently helped the city obtain $5 million in federal funds to build the Second Avenue subway. "Despite significant public dissatisfaction and a clear deterioration in service, the M.T.A. has not only refused to back off on the use of articulated buses, but has ordered more."
Indeed, 240 new articulated buses, destined for service on First, Second and Lexington Avenues, will rumble in later this year. 
"The transit authority is a creature unto itself," said Gifford Miller, the speaker of the City Council, who has steadily but unsuccessfully pushed to have the buses removed from crosstown routes. "I would like to see them be more responsive." 
New York City Transit, which operates the authority's subways and buses, maintains that bigger buses are better. 
"We are able to provide service to more customers with fewer buses on an economical basis," said Millard Seay, senior vice president for buses. Last year, four articulated buses were used for every five regular buses during off-peak times, providing a 17 percent increase in capacity. Fewer buses mean fewer bus drivers, a major cost savings.
Furthermore, Mr. Seay said, the agency has studied every complaint. Those studies, he said, showed that the buses are safe, efficient and well liked. "Based on our results, the highest rated routes in Manhattan were the articulated routes," he said.
The agency cites increased ridership as the ultimate indication of the buses' success. However, according to their records, while ridership on the 23rd Street crosstown bus increased 9.5 percent from 1999 to 2001, on the 86th Street route it increased 7.4 percent, the average increase for Manhattan.

HEADLINE: It's Still a Man's, Man's, Man's World 

BYLINE:  By ALEX KUCZYNSKI 

 BODY:
FOR all the talk about golf's having become a sport of inclusion, events last week exposed some rents in the theory.
 Asked whether women should be allowed to join the Augusta National Golf Club in Georgia, home of the Masters tournament, whose 300 members include top executives of I.B.M., Citigroup and other big companies, Tiger Woods offered a noncommittal answer. "They're entitled to set up their own rules the way they want them," he said. 
 From a player who 15 years ago would not have been allowed at numerous private clubs because of his race, the response reflected a lingering contradiction in golf: it is still not all right for women to be members of some of the most exclusive golf clubs in the world. Of the four major men's tournaments this year, two -- the Masters, which Mr. Woods won in April, and the British Open, which began Thursday at Muirfield in Scotland -- are at clubs that do not accept women as members. The course that will be host to the British Open in 2003, Royal St. George's, has only in the last five years taken down its sign prohibiting "dogs and women." But there are some things you don't have to spell out: the club still excludes women from membership. 
Mr. Woods spoke at a press conference in Scotland, where he was trying to win his third consecutive major tournament of 2002 on the way to golf's Grand Slam. His comments focused instant attention on a dispute between the chairwoman of the National Council of Women's Organizations, Dr. Martha Burk, and the chairman of Augusta National, William W. Johnson, known as Hootie. In June, Dr. Burk had sent a letter to Mr. Johnson urging him to invite a woman for membership before the 2003 Masters.
Mr. Johnson's reply, in a statement released to the public, was defiant. He said that the club's membership policies were its own business, adding: "We will not be bullied, threatened or intimidated." There may come a day when women will be invited to join Augusta National, he said, "but that timetable will be ours and not at the point of a bayonet."
Now it turns out that the dispute may have been counterproductive, delaying what might have been Mr. Johnson's steps to invite a woman to join. The 71-year-old Mr. Johnson, who has unusual sway over who is asked to join, had told members he was hoping to retire "on a more open note" by inviting a woman in, according to one club member who spoke on the condition of anonymity last week because Augusta's bylaws forbid members to discuss club matters. But now Mr. Johnson is less likely to do so, the member said, since it will appear that he has caved to outside pressure.
"We do not intend to become a trophy in their display case," Mr. Johnson said in his statement, referring to Dr. Burk's organization, which comprises 160 women's groups. The Augusta member said he did not know which women Mr. Johnson had considered.
Dr. Burk said she has not neared the end of her confrontation with Augusta, which does allow women to play as guests. "We will not take the view that some have: 'Tiger has spoken and now it's over,' " she said. "It is not over. For all my respect for him, Tiger is naive when it comes to changing course."
One likely strategy for women's groups -- hinted at by Dr. Burk -- is to turn the spotlight on corporate sponsors of competitions at clubs that bar women as members. Very few do, but among them, Augusta and Muirfield are two of the most prominent in the world.
Gabrielle Reece, the former volleyball star who is now training to become a professional golfer, said in an interview that she was surprised that Carleton S. Fiorina, the chairwoman of Hewlett-Packard, a sponsor of the British Open, would want her company associated with a club that doesn't let women join. "She couldn't even play there," Ms. Reece said -- not as a member, anyway. Telephone calls on Thursday and Friday seeking comment from Hewlett-Packard representatives were not returned.
Of the more than 17,000 golf courses in the United States, 72 percent are open to the public in some way, according to the National Golf Foundation. Mike Tinkey, the deputy commissioner of the National Golf Club Owners Association, said that to his knowledge no study had been conducted about what percentage do not allow women as members. "Thank goodness it's pretty much an archaic animal," he said.
Laws regarding private clubs are balanced on one side by the First Amendment right to free association (under which a club can discriminate against any group), and on the other by state and federal antidiscrimination statutes (under which, in certain cases, a club cannot). In some states, if a private club behaves like a "public accommodation," it can be forced to abide by antidiscrimination laws -- for example, if it has a public liquor license or makes itself available for lease for public events.
The sport of golf, as played at private clubs, has been forced to open its doors at least a crack in the past dozen years. In 1990, the Shoal Creek Country Club, near Birmingham, Ala., gave a black man an honorary membership as part of an agreement to head off picketing of the Professional Golfers Association Championship by civil rights groups.
Since then, race has become less of a public issue, with many clubs that had previously denied membership to blacks admitting them, even though their numbers are small. The expense of playing golf at a private club, where an initiation fee of tens of thousands of dollars and annual dues in the thousands, is a exclusionary factor all by itself. There are about six black men among the estimated 300 members of Augusta National, including Lloyd Ward, the chief executive of the United States Olympic Committee, who said before the Masters this year that he would lobby the club to invite women in as members but has not made any public statement on the subject since.
In more recent years, it is women who have applied the most pressure to golf clubs to end practices that favor the old guard. In 1995, a group of women who were members of the Haverhill Golf and Country Club, outside Boston, sued the club, saying it had denied them full membership privileges by, for instance, giving men more desirable tee times. In an unprecedented decision in 2000, the women won their case and a state judge put Haverhill under the court's supervision, overseeing new guidelines about membership, tournament participation and tee times.
The real pressure on high-profile clubs like Augusta may come from corporate sponsors responding to public opinion.
Donna E. Shalala, who served as secretary of health and human services in the Clinton administration and is now president of the University of Miami, urges corporations involved in tournaments held at men-only clubs to use their economic clout to help change the rules.
"These are public companies that advertise themselves as good places to work for women," she said. "But they would never think of holding these tournaments at clubs that discriminated against blacks."
Jim Andrews, the editorial director of The IEG Sponsorship Report, which describes itself as a watchdog of corporate underwriting of public events, said that corporations may find that the risk of angering the public may outweigh the commercial advantages of sponsoring golf's most-watched events. "They take a calculated risk," he said. "There are certainly the positive benefits in terms of exposure, but they are keeping their fingers crossed. There is certainly a reason for people to shine a light on the subject."
Last week, three sponsors of the Masters -- Coca-Cola and I.B.M., which advertised on the CBS television broadcast, and Cadillac, the official car -- sidestepped the debate. Spokesmen for all three emphasized that they sponsored the one-week Masters tournament, but not Augusta National Golf Club.
The policies of Augusta, which owns and administers the Masters, violate the guidelines of all of golf's domestic governing bodies: the Professional Golfers Association Tour, the P.G.A. of America, the Ladies Professional Golf Association and the United States Golf Association. None of those groups will hold a tournament at a course that excludes people from membership on the basis of religion, race or sex.
Not all women agree that Augusta should be open to women. Lee Heffernan, a co-author of "Gentlemen Only: An Insider's View of Golf in Augusta, Georgia, and What She Found at the End of Magnolia Lane," whose father, Henry Heffernan, was a club member, supports the current policy. "They don't just discriminate against anybody," Ms. Heffernan said. "They discriminate against everyone. Even Bill Gates hasn't been asked to join."
No matter how Tiger Woods fares at Muirfield -- or at the remaining major men's tournament of the year, the P.G.A. Championship next month, at Hazeltine National, outside Minneapolis, which admits women as members -- the issue will continue to simmer.
Jane Smith, the chief executive of Business and Professional Women USA, a member of Dr. Burk's council, said her organization supported membership for women at all golf clubs. "Our legacy is built on supporting women's rights and civil rights," Ms. Smith said. "While we are pleased that this club opened its doors to men of color some years ago, we do hope that the same aggressive steps of inclusion are taken by the Augusta National Golf Club as it prepares for the Masters."

HEADLINE: MARKET WATCH; 
With Stocks in Crisis, Greenspan's Nostrums Fall Short

BYLINE:  By GRETCHEN MORGENSON 

 BODY:
WHEN Alan Greenspan spoke on Capitol Hill last week, Washington politicians were as worshipful as ever. Back on Wall Street and Main Street, however, it is becoming painfully clear that Mr. Greenspan's ability to revive the economy has lost its punch. Look no further than the almost 400-point drop in the Dow industrials on Friday.
 Mr. Greenspan's aggressive interest rate cuts were supposed to buoy the economy. Unfortunately, the sickly stock market is acting as a counterweight to any buoyancy. 
 Using history as a guide, the stock market should be higher now than it was a year ago. Since 1948, six months after a recession's trough, stocks have jumped an average of 24 percent from the previous year. But at the end of June, six months from the recession's probable end, stocks were down 18 percent from last year. That means the market has underperformed its typical post-recessionary move by 40 percentage points.
Jan Hatzius, the senior economist at Goldman, Sachs who provided these data points, has concluded that Mr. Greenspan's aggressive rate cuts have already been "spent" in the economy, especially in housing. Unfortunately, the effect of the stock market's sorry performance has yet to be felt. As a result, Mr. Hatzius thinks that economic growth will be stuck between 2 and 3 percent well into 2003.
While rate cuts work fast to help the economy, the effects of the stock market typically lag behind. This time, Mr. Hatzius expects a longer lag. "Normally when you get a big stock market setback, consumers have a harder time getting credit," he said. "But there are more alternative sources of credit for consumers now and the Fed is very eager to keep access to credit good."
As a result, consumers are still spending and remain in denial about what the stock market has done to their net worth. Anecdotally, this denial can be seen in the refusal of investors even to open their brokerage and mutual fund account statements. More quantitatively, it is evident in the personal savings rate, which remains at a rock-bottom 3.1 percent. The rate normally rises as household wealth drops.
Mr. Hatzius said the current saving rate indicates that consumers are still counting on capital gains to augment what they are socking away in the bank or the mattress. They are not alone; companies that should know better -- I.B.M., for example -- are assuming 9.5 percent returns in their pension plans this year.
Once consumers realize that the stock market will no longer bolster their savings, they will rein in spending and start setting aside more income. That will be a big negative for consumer spending, the only area of the economy that has been strong.
Stephen S. Roach, chief economist at Morgan Stanley, believes that further job cuts and softening home prices will force consumers to face reality. "Consumers who are savings-short and overly indebted are going to have to pull back and it's going to be a multiyear retrenchment," he said.
Household debt is now at 75 percent of gross domestic product, a record. And debt service as a ratio of disposable income stands at 14 percent, just below the all-time high of 14.3 percent recorded late last year. 
With consumer debt off the charts, Mr. Roach said he was "pretty appalled" by Mr. Greenspan's recent testimony. "He said that we can keep the consumer afloat by helping him extract equity from his home to finance expenditures," Mr. Roach said. "With the real economic reverberations of the popped equity bubble just starting to sink in, the Fed seems more than willing to risk inflating another bubble in order to temper the distress."
Perhaps the housing bubble has helped consumers take the stock market's carnage so stoically. If so, what bubble will emerge to calm them when housing prices fall?

Far From Wall St., Martha Stewart Is Thriving

BYLINE:  By JAMES BROOKE 

DATELINE: TOKYO 

 BODY:
MARTHA STEWART's poster visage beckons Japanese shoppers into her new boutique off the Ginza, and a steady flow of women enter to explore a world of glue guns, towels in 24 colors and gardening tools stamped MS.
 A world away from an investigation into accusations of insider trading, the voice of Ms. Stewart booms from a video monitor in the store. Ms. Stewart, the one-woman brand of American home fashion, gently if somewhat hypnotically commands shoppers in English (with Japanese subtitles): "Coordinate the bedroom, coordinate the bathroom, coordinate the kitchen." 
 Judging by the flashing digital cash registers of Japan, American business scandals, like political fights, can stop at water's edge. 
In its first overseas expansion, Martha Stewart Living Omnimedia has entered 226 Seiyu department stores with Ms. Stewart's brand-name products, and sales are on target to meet the first-year goal of $11 million a month, double the rate of the first six months of sales, through March. The 164-page August issue of "Martha," a glossy, nine-month-old magazine in Japanese, is full of advertisements and is nearly as thick as its 11-year-old American parent magazine. Completing the link of media and merchandise, the Shop Channel, a cable network, sells "Martha by Mail" bath and kitchen products, and the "Martha Stewart Living" program, dubbed in Japanese, appears four times daily on other television channels.
Japan is proving so welcoming to Martha Stewart and her homemaking makeovers that she is now studying expansion to South Korea and Australia, said Sharon Patrick, president and chief operating officer of Martha Stewart Living Omnimedia, in a telephone interview.
Business was not dented by tiny articles in Japanese newspapers about accusations that Ms. Stewart had benefited from insider knowledge to unload shares of ImClone Systems just before they tumbled last December. Ms. Stewart has denied wrongdoing.
In Japan, Ms. Patrick said, "sales are where they are expected." Addressing the stock trading, she added, "In an odd way, it brings more of the subject of Martha and the products into the limelight."
The Japanese may be indifferent to the scandal because Ms. Stewart is not a household name here -- at least not yet. She may also be benefiting from Japanese society's elevation of domesticity to a high art form. And insider trading does not carry the same stigma in Japan that it does in the United States. Many Japanese equate any type of investing in stocks with gambling.
"I was disappointed a little, but then I was not so surprised," Yuko Watanabe, 48, a homemaker and bead artist, said after buying three towels -- one light blue, one cream and one white -- at a Martha Stewart store here. "She is such an aggressive businesswoman, and that kind of people have many sides to life. But that does not affect whether or not I buy Martha Stewart goods."
KUMI SATO, founder of the Web site Womenjapan.com, said "Women who are Martha Stewart shoppers could not care less about the scandal." Referring to Ms. Stewart's earlier Wall Street career, Ms. Sato added: "Either they don't understand it or they chalk it up to, 'she was a stockbroker.' "
The insider-trading accusations have not gone completely unnoticed. To some, they portray Ms. Stewart as an overreacher, a potentially fatal flaw in a society where modesty and harmony are prized by men and women alike.
"It ruins her appeal because you feel that she is a corporate executive, and what she is doing is making a profit, and that is leading her to the insider trading," said Ikuko Narusaka, 45, a homemaker and piano teacher. "It gives you the impression that she could do anything for profit."
In Japan, the basic question for Ms. Stewart is whether she can establish a lasting beachhead. Japan is a notoriously difficult retail environment, littered with the bones of larger foreign whales than her company.
Two discount retailers, the Carrefour Japan Company and Costco, are widely seen as struggling here. Recent foreign departures from Japan's retail scene include the Boots Company, a British drugstore operator, and Sephora, the French cosmetics chain owned by LVMH Moet Hennessy Louis Vuitton. There are a few successes: Toys "R" Us Japan, which opened its first store here 13 years ago, now has 120 stores and is Japan's largest toy retailer.
Wal-Mart Stores, the world's largest retailer, has long studied Japan, the world's second-largest economy. This spring, Wal-Mart finally made its move, also picking Seiyu, Japan's seventh-largest retailer, as its partner. Wal-Mart will open some stores with Seiyu, a supermarket chain that also sells housewares, appliances and general merchandise. The name of the joint-venture stores will still be Seiyu.
Sales at Seiyu have declined for three years, partly because many Japanese consumers consider its range of goods too diffuse and opt to shop elsewhere. Wal-Mart is investing $46 million in the company and has an option to buy a controlling stake.
"General merchandise is weak in a supermarket like Seiyu," said Kazunori Tsuda, a retail analyst at the Daiwa Research Institute. "So they picked up Martha to recover the weakest part of the store."
The Martha Stewart stores are actually sections inside Seiyu stores, except for the Ginza store, which is in the same building as Muji, a retailer that is a Seiyu affiliate.
Executives of Seiyu declined to be interviewed, but Ms. Patrick called the company a conscientious "brand steward" for the 1,500 MS products it now carries. Noting that the Martha Stewart magazine already has a circulation of 100,000 in Japan, she said that "Seiyu thinks we are on target" to hit a merchandise sales goal of $135 million this year.
Royalty and licensing fees make Japan profitable for Martha Stewart, Ms. Patrick said, though she declined to say by how much. Seiyu is taking "the inventory risk," she said, so "we do not have a high risk profile for this venture."
The retail marriage of Ms. Stewart and Japan is working partly because Ms. Stewart, 60, has long had a genuine fascination with Japan and its food, gardens and home furnishings. Over the last two decades, she has traveled to Japan at least 20 times, acquaintances say. A frequent visitor to the huge Tsukiji fish market in Tokyo, she has filmed culinary television programs there with Nobuyuki Matsuhisa, the celebrity chef-owner of the Nobu restaurant chain.
Momoko Sano, the Martha Stewart brand manager here, said, "In her house, she has a Japanese teapot, Japanese plates, Japanese fabrics, Japanese lacquerware -- she loves Japanese lacquerware." Ms. Sano got to know Ms. Stewart in the late 1980's, helping her edit and translate her book on weddings into Japanese. Before starting her businesses in Japan, Ms. Stewart had several best-selling books here.
On Sept. 11, Ms. Stewart was in Tokyo. After inaugurating the Ginza store and holding a party to introduce her magazine, she returned that night to her hotel.
"Martha turned on the television in her hotel room, and I heard her scream," Ms. Patrick recalled. "I was across the hall and I ran out, and there it was on CNN -- the twin towers."
Stranded because trans-Pacific flights were suspended, Ms. Stewart retreated to her favorite Japanese city, Kyoto, where she visited temples and gardens. Four months ago, she was back in the Kyoto area. "We visited the Miho Museum outside of Kyoto, where we walked through a most fragrant grove of Ume trees, blossoming in white and pink and red blossoms," she recounted in her April magazine column, "A Letter from Martha." "On Friday, I started my day very early, visiting my favorite store, Aritsugu Knife Shop in Nishiki."
She concluded: "I could have stayed weeks longer, traveling, looking, investigating. I long to understand more about Japanese ways and Japanese lifestyle."
This sensitivity to Japan contributes to the appeal of her products here. About 90 percent of those on sale through Seiyu have been "Japanized," either by adjusting for color preferences or by reducing their size to fit Japanese bodies and houses, which are generally smaller than Americans'.
But Ms. Stewart's products also come in colors not often seen in Japan, where tones of burgundy and blue dominate. "That is not us," Ms. Patrick said. "We are warmer and lighter, more toward pastels."
ON a recent afternoon, Toshiko Otani paused outside the Ginza store, holding a pastel-green Martha Stewart shopping bag. "I like the variety and colors of the towels," said Mrs. Otani, opening her bag to show three hand towels, one a blush of pink, one light yellow and the other lime green. "The prices were appropriate, too."
Economic growth in Japan pretty much stopped about a decade ago. An increase in unemployment has weakened consumer demand and made shoppers more price-conscious. According to Seiyu, Martha Stewart's best-selling products in Japan include fleece bedroom slippers at 557 yen, or about $4.64, a decorative toilet mat at $15.04 and a bath towel at $7.84. Other towels go for $3.20 and glasses for $5.70.
Societal changes may also help Ms. Stewart make the trans-Pacific leap permanent.
"Young people are interested in interior decoration, so the timing is right," said Kyoko Michisita, a book translator who visited the Ginza store out of curiosity after having translated two of Ms. Stewart's columns. "There is a strong trend among young couples toward choosing a table they like, choosing a dish they like."
Ms. Watanabe, the bead artist, said Ms. Stewart's expansion here coincided with a trend toward increasingly Westernized homes among affluent Japanese.
"Martha Stewart goods can be easily accepted into Japanese households because many Japanese homes, including mine, are not so Japanese in taste anymore," Ms. Watanabe said. She followed Ms. Stewart's television-show advice, she said, about how to coordinate the colors of her flowers and how to paint leaves on ceramic tableware.
"We remodeled tatami mat rooms into Western-style rooms," she said, referring to rooms covered with traditional straw mats. "We have Spanish furniture. When I make some Japanese traditional ornaments at New Year's or some seasonal occasions, my son says: 'It does not match our house.' "

HEADLINE: Stocks Are Only Part of the Story 

BYLINE:  By Alan S. Blinder; Alan S. Blinder, former vice chairman of the Federal Reserve, is a professor of economics at Princeton.

DATELINE: PRINCETON, N.J. 

 BODY:
King Canute could not command the tides, and apparently neither George W. Bush nor Alan Greenspan can command the stock market. In recent days, both the M.B.A. president and the oracular Federal Reserve chairman have tried to calm the markets with reassuring words about the economy. But the stock market has kept on falling: on Friday it had one of its worst days ever, losing 390 points. Since President Bush addressed Wall Street July 9, the Dow Jones industrial average has declined more than 10 percent, to its lowest level in almost four years.
 Those who get their economic news from television may come away with the impression that the economy and the stock market are two sides of the same coin. If the market is heading south, then the economy must be, too. But it's not true. 
 The United States economy is most emphatically not falling right now. The stock market may be the TV star. But it is the economy that generates the jobs and puts the food on our tables. And fortunately, the economy is doing much better than the market. If you want to bolster your confidence, turn off your TV and drive to the mall.
Normally, the economy and the market move consistently, though certainly not in lock step. The reasons are clear. A strong economy generates high and rising corporate profits, which is the traditional basis for high stock values. A rising stock market also gives the economy a boost by creating wealth for consumers and by making it easier for firms to raise capital, both of which were major factors in the boom of the 1990's. When things turn downward, all these mechanisms get reversed: a sagging economy drags profits and stock prices down, and a sagging stock market slows the economy.
Finally, because investors are supposed to look forward, the stock market should be a leading indicator of where the economy is going. And it is -- to a limited extent.
But while it is normal for the economy and the markets to move together, the two sometimes go their separate ways. For example, the Dow fell almost as much, in percentage terms, on a single day in October 1987 than it has in the entire recent bear market. But the economy kept growing strongly. It was such behavior that led to the economist Paul Samuelson's famous quip that the stock market has forecast nine of the last five recessions.
So it would be a mistake to interpret the stock market's current woes as a forecast of a double-dip recession -- a mistake that Alan Greenspan is certainly not making.
Consumers are spending, the housing market remains buoyant, and even business investment is coming back. The economic indicators are simply not signaling a sick economy. The gross domestic product grew at a 6.1 percent annual rate in the first quarter of this year, and something like 2.5 percent is expected for the second quarter. (The Commerce Department will announce the final figures at the end of the month.) That would clock the average growth for the first half at 4.3 percent -- not bad. The Federal Reserve expects growth of about 3 percent in the second half of this year, and the consensus among private forecasters is a bit higher.
It is true that economic forecasting is an imprecise science, to say the least. But it is far more accurate than market forecasting, which is basically impossible. And economic forecasts like this, coming from a wide variety of sources inside and outside government, should give us some comfort that the economy is heading uphill.
So why, then, is the stock market in shambles? While the market never tells you why it does what it does, it's unlikely that worries about the economy are weighing it down. Instead, the best guess is that the stream of scandalous corporate revelations is taking a heavy toll on stock prices, and investors fear there is more to come. Confidence in the earnings reports of American companies, not to mention the ratings of the analysts who follow them, has been damaged if not destroyed.
The key question is whether this illness will be confined to the stock market or spread to the larger economy. If the stock market destroys enough wealth, or if the depressive psychology infects the credit markets, the financial turmoil could become severe enough to damage the economy. The tail could drag down the dog. That is why we must stop the market's downward spiral.
But how? Words, if chosen artfully, may help a bit. But talk is cheap -- which may be why the markets shrugged off even the reassuring words of Mr. Greenspan, their most trusted guru. This just may be one of those moments when both the markets and the body politic are calling for action, some of which must be government action.
Can it be true that financial markets want the government to regulate them more? Paradoxically, the answer is yes. The markets have long had an ambivalent attitude toward government intervention. When things go well, they want to be left alone. But when things start to fall apart, they want Washington's help.
The reaction to President Bush's recent speeches was instructive. If Wall Street were truly opposed to government help, one might have thought that market participants would have breathed a sigh of relief: the president spoke loudly but carried a small stick. Instead, stock prices tanked.
There is a message here. Congress hears it, and even Mr. Greenspan -- who is not normally a proponent of government regulation -- hears it. But does President Bush hear it? The message is this: While changes in private-sector behavior will eventually fix many of today's accounting and corporate governance problems, the markets are clamoring for decisive government actions now.
Speeches have not worked. It is time to see if actions will speak louder than words.

HEADLINE: The Confidence Crisis 

 BODY:
Wall Street's alarming dive in recent weeks, capped by the 390-point drop in the Dow on Friday, may just be another example of the irrationality that can sometimes grip the markets. The recovery, after all, has been progressing fairly well, and Alan Greenspan advised Congress last week that the economic outlook was reasonably promising. But economic fundamentals are being overrun by a host of uncertainties, which begin with doubt about America's corporate elite and end with concern about shaky leadership in Washington.
 Although investors, watching their assets and retirement funds vanish, may wish that the Bush administration could end the market slide with a snap of the finger, everyone knows capitalism does not work that way. The president cannot simply add Wall Street bears to his list of evildoers and declare war on plunging equity prices. Still, it's hard to imagine an administration in a worse position to deal with the crisis of confidence in American business. Mr. Bush himself is a product of the cowboy end of the Sunbelt economy, and if Americans look at him and see the shadow of Enron ethics and WorldCom accounting, his effectiveness as chief executive will be undermined. 
 Yet so far, Mr. Bush has done little to separate himself from the excesses of some of his friends and campaign contributors. Vice President Dick Cheney continues to be mum about his role as chief executive of Halliburton. The secretary of the Army continues to be a former Enron executive whose attempts to vindicate his behavior as a businessman have been more embarrassing than convincing. The Securities and Exchange Commission continues to be run by the former lawyer for the accounting industry. Mr. Bush is a man who believes strongly in loyalty, and who as a result is able to run a White House that benefits from an extremely low level of public squabbling. But his current intransigence is not good for his administration or the nation.
The markets will not right themselves just because Army Secretary Thomas White is tossed to the dogs or the vice president finally agrees to discuss his business career. But Wall Street would certainly be soothed by some sign that Mr. Bush is firmly in control. The most chilling result in last week's New York Times/CBS News Poll was that 45 percent of the respondents said they thought "other people are really running the government" -- exactly the same percentage as said the president was in charge. That is no way to run a White House when the nation's worst domestic problem is a lack of confidence in its economic and political leaders.
It has been repeatedly noted that Mr. Bush's economics team, led by Treasury Secretary Paul O'Neill and the chief economic adviser Lawrence Lindsey, does not have the stature that his foreign affairs advisers enjoy, or that Robert Rubin had when he held Mr. O'Neill's job. The very fact that everybody keeps saying it is one of the problems. When the public believes that an administration's underlings are really in charge, that administration is the last one that can afford to have lightweights in those positions.
Mr. Bush continues to enjoy the good will of the American people, but that will never be enough to stabilize the markets, especially if good will seems based in part on the perception that he is not really running the store. It is time for him to show that he's in control -- by directing Mr. Cheney to talk about his financial past, by getting rid of obvious sore thumbs like Mr. White and by replacing appointees like Harvey Pitt at the S.E.C. with strong figures who have the confidence of the business community.

HEADLINE: Word for Word/'Greenspan Shrugged'; 
When Greed Was a Virtue And Regulation the Enemy

BYLINE:  By BILL GOLDSTEIN 

 BODY:
IN 1996, he questioned the "irrational exuberance" of the American investor. Last Tuesday, Alan Greenspan, chairman of the Federal Reserve, brought that era to a definitive end with his diagnosis that "an infectious greed seemed to grip much of our business community." Acknowledging he was wrong in his long-held belief that the government should not regulate the accounting industry, Mr. Greenspan also said: "It is not that humans have become any more greedy than in generations past. It is that the avenues to express greed had grown so enormously."
 Mr. Greenspan's embrace of greater regulation is a remarkable turnaround for an economist who for many years was a close friend and colleague of Ayn Rand, the high priestess of unfettered capitalism, who fulminated against the ideas Mr. Greenspan now espouses. In the early 1950's, while in his 20's, Mr. Greenspan was a member of Rand's inner circle (they called themselves the Collective), and was among those who read her influential 1957 novel, "Atlas Shrugged," in manuscript. It was written, Rand once said, "to glorify the real kind of productive, free-enterprise businessman in a way he has never been glorified before." But, she added, "I make mincemeat out of the kind of businessman . . . that runs to government for assistance, subsidies, legislation and regulation." 
 Forty-five years after the publication of her magnum opus, which Rand herself compared to the Bible, greed apparently represents a greater danger to capitalism than government bureaucrats. But back then neither Mr. Greenspan nor Rand seemed to have envisioned the unethical behavior of some of today's captains of industry. Excerpts follow from Rand's work and from a 1963 essay written by Mr. Greenspan for The Objectivist Newsletter, which was devoted to Rand's philosophy. BILL GOLDSTEIN
In Mr. Greenspan's essay, titled "The Assault on Integrity," he wrote at length about the functioning of a healthy free-enterprise system and the perils of regulation. (Years later, however, in a profile in The New Yorker, a colleague recounted his warning "to distinguish carefully between what he believes personally and how he acts as chairman of the Fed.")
Protection of the consumer against "dishonest and so-called unscrupulous business practices" has become a cardinal ingredient of welfare statism. Left to their own devices, it is alleged, businessmen would attempt to sell unsafe food and drugs, fraudulent securities, and shoddy buildings. Thus, it is argued, the Pure Food and Drug Administration, the Securities and Exchange Commission and the numerous building regulatory agencies are indispensable if the consumer is to be protected from the "greed" of the businessman.
But it is precisely the "greed" of the businessman or, more appropriately, his profit-seeking, which is the unexcelled protector of the consumer. . . .
What collectivists refuse to recognize is that it is in the self-interest of every businessman to have a reputation for honest dealings and a quality product. . . . Thus the incentive to scrupulous performance operates on all levels of a given field of production. It is a built-in safeguard of a free enterprise system and the only real protection of consumers against business dishonesty.
Actually, Mr. Greenspan wrote, a greater threat to a free-market economy with no barriers to ambition or achievement was posed by the government. 
Government regulation is not an alternative means of protecting the consumer. It does not build quality into goods, or accuracy into information. Its sole "contribution" is to substitute force and fear for incentive as the "protector" of the consumer. The euphemism of government press releases to the contrary notwithstanding, the basis of regulation is armed force. At the bottom of the endless pile of paper work which characterizes all regulation lies a gun. . . .
Protective legislation falls into the category of preventive law. Businessmen are being subjected to governmental coercion prior to the commission of any crime. In a free economy, the government may step in only when a fraud has been perpetrated, or a demonstrable damage has been done to a consumer; in such cases the only protection required is that of criminal law.
Mr. Greenspan's essay was reprinted in 1966 in "Capitalism: The Unknown Ideal," together with Rand's operatic articulation of some of her views, titled "America's Persecuted Minority: Big Business":
If a small group of men were always regarded as guilty, in any clash with any other group, regardless of the issues or circumstances involved, would you call it persecution? If this group were always made to pay for the sins, errors, or failures of any other group, would you call that persecution? If this group had to live under a silent reign of terror, under special laws, from which all other people were immune, laws which the accused could not grasp or define in advance and which the accuser could interpret in any way he pleased -- would you call that persecution? If this group were penalized, not for its faults, but for its virtues, not for its incompetence, but for its ability, not for its failures, but for its achievements, and the greater the achievement, the greater the penalty -- would you call that persecution?
If your answer is "yes" -- then ask yourself what sort of monstrous injustice you are condoning, supporting, or perpetuating. That group is the American businessman. . . .
Every movement that seeks to enslave a country, every dictatorship or potential dictatorship, needs some minority group as a scapegoat which it can blame for the nation's troubles and use as a justification of its own demands for dictatorial powers. In Soviet Russia, the scapegoat was the bourgeoisie; in Nazi Germany, it was the Jewish people; in America, it is the businessman. 
The hero of "Atlas Shrugged," John Galt, maintained that executives who commit fraud betray their own highest values:
Honesty is the recognition of the fact that the unreal is unreal and can have no value, that neither love nor fame nor cash is a value if obtained by fraud -- that an attempt to gain a value by deceiving the mind of others is an act of raising your victim to a position higher than reality, where you become a pawn of their blindness, a slave of their nonthinking and their evasions, while their intelligence, their rationality, their perceptiveness become the enemies you have to dread and flee.
For his part, Mr. Greenspan argued in 1963 that moral values "are the motive power of capitalism":
Capitalism is based on self-interest and self-esteem; it holds integrity and trustworthiness as cardinal virtues and makes them pay off in the marketplace, thus demanding that men survive by means of virtues, not of vices. It is this superlatively moral system that the welfare statists propose to improve upon by means of preventative law, snooping bureaucrats, and the chronic goad of fear.
Rand, of course, also had plenty to say about virtue and integrity, as in this 1944 letter to a friend who asked for advice on how to meet "a worthwhile woman":
One finds worthwhile men and women among people who work. Follow me here very carefully, forgetting the cheap generalities which all our modern minds have been stuffed with. I do not mean LABOR. I do not mean people who have to earn their living. I do not mean proletarians. . . . I mean what you and I understand by the term "competent people." People who love to work, who are good at it, serious about it and concerned primarily with it. Bright, creative, productive, ambitious people. People who get money for their work, but who do not work primarily for the money -- whether it's a weekly pay envelope or a thousand dollar bonus. People who are ambitious -- not to climb socially, not to get wealth and titles -- but ambitious to do more and more work of a better and better kind. . . .
In a general way, that is the advice I'd give you: look for places where sincere people are working hard -- and go there. Choose by the nature of the work. Going incognito into a convention of ditch diggers would do you as little good as going to the swankiest Wall Street party.

HEADLINE: Wary Eye on Wall St. and Washington 

BYLINE:  By GRETCHEN MORGENSON 

 BODY:
Not long ago, United States investors were true believers. They trusted corporate executives to be truthful about their companies' performance and prospects. They felt sure that the stock market was the only path to a prosperous future. And they trusted Alan Greenspan to steer the economy through any storm.
 But by the end of last week, the investor trust on which the bull market of the 1990's had been founded seemed to have almost entirely vanished. As the Dow Jones industrial average careened to a loss of almost 400 points by the close of trading on Friday, it became clear that many investors may have finally stopped believing. 
 Thanks to Enron, WorldCom, Global Crossing and Tyco, confidence in corporate executives and the validity of their companies' earnings is gone.
And with trillions of dollars in lost stock market wealth, so is the trust in company shares as the way to a comfortable retirement.
After Mr. Greenspan's testimony in Congress last week, investors' faith in him suffered some severe slippage.
This, market strategists say, is what a stock bubble looks like after it has popped. Unfortunately, economists add, the stock decline is so bad that it now threatens to weaken the economy's last pillar of strength: consumer spending. If consumers shut their wallets, hope for an economic recovery goes out the window.
"I don't think we've got an awful lot of problems in the economy," said Alan Kral, portfolio manager at Trevor Stewart Burton & Jacobsen in New York. "But we could if we totally undermine consumer confidence by knocking down the market."
A good hard knock is certainly what the market took on Friday. The Dow Jones industrial average lost almost 5 percent for the day and fell 7.7 percent for the week.
According to Thomas McManus, chief United States strategist at Banc of America Securities in New York, $6.7 trillion has been lost in stocks since the peak in March 2000. 
This wealth destruction has finally begun to register with investors who, until recently, were holding onto their falling stock positions with an admirable stoicism. "Confidence has been pretty beat up," Mr. McManus said. "I think it's pretty clear there are going to be more ugly revelations at companies. I think there's a chance that there will be some investors who have such a bad experience that they will never want to touch stocks again. The pressure is going to be greatest for the people who got in late because they are the ones who are looking at this as a really disastrous move."
What economists fear most is that investor losses will translate to a slowdown, or worse, in consumer spending. While corporate spending has been nonexistent for months, consumers have kept their wallets open. Low interest rates and surging home prices have encouraged them. 
But as consumers recognize the extent to which the falling stock market has decimated their retirement accounts or their children's college savings plans, their spending may come to a halt. If corporations make additional rounds of job cuts, this possibility may become a reality. 
"The really big risk is that consumers will reawaken to the timeless truth that the best way to save money is to stop spending," said Richard Hastings, chief economist at Cyber Business Credit, a retail advisory firm in New York. "And I think that will impact aggregate demand in a way that has not been seen since the 1930's."
Economists at Goldman, Sachs, for example, say that weakness in consumer spending will curb economic growth not only for the remainder of this year, but well into 2003. As a result, the firm recently lowered its estimates for gross domestic product growth to 2.5 percent this year and 2.8 percent in the next.
"My feeling is the stock market is telling us something about the economy," said James Paulsen, chief investment officer at Wells Capital Management in Minneapolis. "That the economy is going to be really bad for the rest of the year. I also think what it's telling us is the consumer is going to get close to capitulation in the second half."
It wasn't supposed to be this way. After a year and a half of interest rate cuts, the economy was supposed to be chugging along. Investors were told over and over again that six months after the Federal Reserve began cutting rates, stock prices were always higher. Instead, corporations are struggling with profits, the stock market is making new lows and the economic data are weak.
Apart from doubts about whether corporate financial statements are reliable, many investors still believe that the broad market is overvalued in relation to actual profits. Many of them are staying on the sidelines until they see a turnaround in profits, which remain under pressure. 
With economic weakness still weighing on the market, investors are beginning to doubt Mr. Greenspan and his control over the economy. Indeed, one of the biggest shifts that market strategists sensed last week among investors was a diminished trust in the Fed chairman.
Throughout the two years since the stock market peaked, investors have viewed Mr. Greenspan with something approaching awe. Now they are wondering if he can do anything to stop the market's slide. 
"Greenspan did not have his typical calming moments in front of Congress," Mr. Kral, the portfolio manager, said of his testimony last week. "He came away looking like a follower in the marketplace, not a leader. And that undermined some people's conviction with regard to the market's direction."
As they begin to wonder about Mr. Greenspan's power, investors' fears can only escalate. "Behind this downward move is a Fed impotency panic," said Mr. Paulsen. "What's the catalyst that can turn the market around? Usually it's the Fed." But he added that investors seem to be so anxious these days that if the Fed moved, it might scare investors even more, if temporarily.
Many investment strategists think that investors are spending the weekend sorting through their fears of what the coming weeks might bring. These ruminations may results in further selling on Monday. As Mr. McManus pointed out, markets rarely hit their lows on Fridays.

U.S. Errors in Attacks Killed Hundreds of Afghans
The American air campaign in Afghanistan, based on a high-tech, out-of-harm's way strategy, has produced a pattern of mistakes that has killed hundreds of Afghan civilians. On-site reviews of 11 airstrikes that left as many as 400 civilians dead suggests that American commanders have sometimes relied on mistaken information from local Afghans. Also, the Americans' preference for airstrikes instead of riskier ground operations has made it harder to discover when intelligence is wrong. 1

HEADLINE: No Strong Voice Is Heard On Bush's Economic Team 

BYLINE:  By DAVID E. ROSENBAUM 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, July 20 

 BODY:
With the stock market plunging the other day and surveys depicting Americans as increasingly worried about the way the Bush administration is dealing with the economy and corporate fraud, Treasury Secretary Paul H. O'Neill, the administration's main voice on economic issues, was in Kyrgyzstan.
 Mr. O'Neill's absence -- after a trip to Africa in late May and before a trip to South America late this month -- reinforced the view on Wall Street and in political circles here that President Bush's economic team was not responding sufficiently to growing economic and political pressures. 
 "I'm constantly amazed that anybody cares what I do," Mr. O'Neill declared on Thursday, according to a report from Bloomberg News. 
Another top official on economic matters, Mitchell E. Daniels Jr., the budget director, has aroused such animosity in Congress among lawmakers from both parties that his utility as a budget negotiator has been compromised.
Political insiders say a third official, Lawrence Lindsey, the president's chief economic adviser, does not have the presence or the political skills needed to be the principal public spokesman on the economy. 
As Americans see their life savings diminished daily by falling stock prices and an election approaches that will determine which party controls Congress and the Bush legislative agenda for the next two years, President Bush may have a hard time getting his message heard because no prominent member of his economic team is regularly reassuring the public that the government's policies are sound.
In a series of interviews, supporters and opponents of the president alike criticized administration officials' failure to deal deftly with economic policy. They contrasted that failure with the confident way Secretary of State Colin L. Powell and Defense Secretary Donald H. Rumsfeld have handled foreign and military policy and the aggressive stance Attorney General John Ashcroft and Tom Ridge, the president's adviser, have taken on domestic security issues.
"We desperately need someone the business community, the financial community, the press and the public can look to as the lead economic spokesman," said Robert D. Hormats, vice chairman of Goldman Sachs International. 
"We need someone who is out there day after day explaining the issues the economy is facing and explaining what the administration's policy is to address them," Mr. Hormats continued. "It's worked so well for Rumsfeld, they should have learned the lesson."
Stephen Moore, president of the Club for Growth, a political action committee that supports conservative Republican candidates, said that if the stock market did not turn around and the administration seemed to be sitting on its hands, "Republicans will be wiped out in the House and the Senate" in the November elections.
On all Republicans' minds, Mr. Moore said, is the recollection that the first President George Bush lost the 1992 election to Bill Clinton in part because of the public perception that he had not paid enough attention to the economy.
Mr. O'Neill takes issue with the notion that he is AWOL. In Bucharest, Romania, on Thursday, on his way home from his weeklong trip to Ukraine, Uzbekistan, Kyrgyzstan and Georgia, he told reporters his travels gave him a better perspective on the global economy. 
In Addis Ababa, Ethiopia, at the end of his Africa trip in May, Mr. O'Neill bridled at questions about his effectiveness. "If people don't like what I'm doing, I don't give a damn," he asserted. "I could be sailing around on a yacht or driving around the country." He added that the president had praised him for his original way of thinking. "As long as he gives me that leash, I'm going to use it," Mr. O'Neill said.
A senior White House official who usually reflects the president's view said the criticism of Mr. O'Neill was "absolutely off base."
"He has everybody's strong confidence," the official said. "The fact that he's traveling in a difficult week in the markets is unexceptional. He needs to perform all the duties of the secretary of the treasury, not just sit at his desk focusing on the markets on his screen."
Mr. Daniels, the budget director, asserted that Washington was "in another of those periods of collective solipsism" and should not overestimate its importance in the financial markets. To deal with the economy, Mr. Daniels said, "This president assembled a tremendous team both in terms of their fitness for their jobs and the way they work together."
Mr. Daniels has been pilloried on Capitol Hill for the spending restrictions he has demanded. Representative C. W. Bill Young, Republican of Florida, the chairman of the House Appropriations Committee, said Mr. Daniels was "only concerned about numbers" and "not concerned about what those numbers do for the country." Senator Ted Stevens of Alaska, the top Republican on the Senate Appropriations Committee, said Mr. Bush was "ill served" by his budget director.
Mr. Daniels says he sees himself as a lightning rod for criticism and his duty as protecting the president. Mr. Bush has nicknamed him Blade -- possibly because of his wiry build or because of a sword hanging on his office wall, or perhaps because his job is to make cuts. Mr. Daniels suggested recently that his handle should probably be changed to Pinata, "because I think some folks think if they can knock my head off, all the goodies in town will fall out."
Mr. Lindsey, who briefs the president two or three times a week on economic matters, said the president's staff focused on long-term issues, not "one week or whatever." 
"With the advice of his economics team," Mr. Lindsey said, "the president has been out in front leading consistently since he took office." 
Republican lobbyists and consultants who are in close touch with the White House say Mr. Lindsey's influence has waned since the early days of the Bush presidency and the deputy chief of staff, Josh Bolten, a former investment banker who carefully stays in the background, has become a more important adviser on economic issues. 
Mr. Bolten said that was not the case. Mr. Lindsey said, "The president continues to have confidence in me as far as I know."
At the outset of the Bush presidency, the economic team was strikingly successful. Barely four months after Mr. Bush moved into the White House, Congress, then controlled by Republicans, approved his highest priority, the largest tax cut in 20 years.
But since then, his economic agenda has stalled. With the Senate now under Democratic control, Congress has refused to make the tax cuts permanent, to give the president authority to negotiate trade agreements, to permit drilling for oil and gas in the Arctic National Wildlife Reserve or to allow private investment accounts under Social Security.
Within the administration, the economic advisers clearly lost out to the political staff this year on two important matters. In March, the administration decided to impose tariffs on imported steel. In May, the president signed a bill with vast new subsidies for farmers. Both steps violated cardinal conservative Republican free-market economic principles.
Mr. O'Neill even said publicly, in ostensibly off-the-record remarks to 200 members of the Council on Foreign Relations in March, that he opposed the tariffs on steel because the United States should be the world's leader in promoting free trade. It was an unusual indiscretion in an administration that prides itself on loyalty.
"When an administration is driven by politics, there's a sense in the markets you'll get bad policy out of it," said David Hale, chief global economist for Zurich Financial Services.
In every administration, said Bruce Bartlett, a conservative economist who worked in the administrations of Ronald Reagan and first President Bush, there is competition between policy and politics. In this administration, Mr. Bartlett said, "the nonfunctioning economic operation is causing the political implications of decisions to have an undue amount of influence."
The problem, Mr. Bartlett and many others say, is that there is no dominant figure on government economic policy like Robert E. Rubin in the Clinton administration, Richard G. Darman in the first Bush administration and Donald T. Regan and James A. Baker III in the Reagan years.
Kevin A. Hassett, a Republican economist who worked for Senator John McCain of Arizona in the 2000 presidential campaign, said: "There's an internal vacuum. People don't know who's in charge."
In part because of this, the economic officials have rarely appeared on the Sunday interview programs on network television, a prime platform for a president's message.
Adam Levine, an assistant White House press secretary who coordinates requests for those appearances, said the main reason was that the networks were more interested in foreign affairs than in economic policy. But last week, the networks asked for Mr. O'Neill and had to take Commerce Secretary Donald L. Evans instead, because Mr. O'Neill was overseas.
In other circumstances, said a Republican lobbyist close to the White House, Vice President Dick Cheney could become the top voice on the economy and offer assurances that the administration had matters firmly in hand. But Mr. Cheney must stay in the background on this issue, the lobbyist said, because he has been tarnished by the Securities and Exchange Commission investigation of accounting practices at the Halliburton Company, the oil services giant where he was chief executive.
Republican lobbyists and consultants who are in close touch with the White House say they expect changes in the economic team after the elections this fall. "They can't make any changes before then," one Republican said, "because it would look as if they were accepting the blame for a bad economy."

HEADLINE: The Binge Mentality in the Federal Budget 

BYLINE:  By Janet Yellen; Janet Yellen, a professor of economics and business at the University of California at Berkeley, is a former chairwoman of the Council of Economic Advisers in the Clinton administration.

DATELINE: BERKELEY, Calif. 

 BODY:
We read in the news of the plight of older Americans as their nest eggs, invested in the stock market, have dwindled. Some can no longer afford to retire as planned; others are going back to work.
 The stock market binge of the late 1990's, with its dreams of double-digit gains as far as the eye could see, was based on illusion, not reality. Now we know it. Irrational exuberance fed the bubble. Accounting tricks that inflated reported corporate earnings reinforced investor optimism. Insiders reaped huge gains; investors and employees saw their savings tank. 
 Another equally pernicious set of illusions -- created by the same binge mentality -- surrounds the federal budget, but has so far received less public notice because the negative effects have not yet surfaced. The budget binge is supported by the same kinds of unrealistic projections of future revenues, low-balling of spending and obfuscatory accounting that are now the focus of the Wall Street scandals. But the impact in this arena could prove even more enduring than the current problems on Wall Street. Those counting on Social Security for their retirement, along with future taxpayers, in due course will be left high and dry. 
The perpetrators of the budget binge -- President Bush and Congress -- are sacrificing the public's long-term welfare for their own short-term political gains. In the case of Enron, the company's long-run stability was sacrificed for inflated stock prices in the short run. In the case of the federal budget, the health of Social Security and other programs is being sacrificed for unaffordable tax cuts. The motivation is the same: the decision makers don't believe they should be accountable for the long-run problems. Kenneth Lay walked away from Enron with millions. And the president and most lawmakers in Congress will be gone from office before the effects of the budget policies are fully felt.
Americans are told that we can have it all: more defense and more education; more homeland security and more agricultural subsidies; and a Medicare prescription drug benefit, in addition to last year's multi-trillion dollar tax cut. On top of all this, we're told that it's possible to fix Social Security -- which is expected to exhaust its trust fund in 2041 if no action is taken. 
These promises, of course, did not add up even in official budget projections, which unrealistically assumed no growth at all in inflation-adjusted discretionary spending, no relief for the 33 million taxpayers who, in the absence of a remedy, will unexpectedly face an alternative minimum tax, and the expiration without renewal of popular business tax incentives like the research tax credit. None of this could be sustained in reality. But the problem is even worse than merely having too little in federal revenues to do what politicians promised voters. The deeper problem is that the wayward budget takes off the table the resources that are needed to reform Social Security if we are to avoid politically unacceptable benefit cuts.
In his campaign, George W. Bush promised that Social Security could be repaired painlessly, by allowing younger workers to divert a portion of their Social Security payroll tax into individual accounts. Since the stock market has historically offered higher returns than government bonds and substantially higher returns than Social Security, he suggested that such new-found investment freedom would repair the finances of the retirement system. With the fall in the stock market we now see that a secure, defined-benefit pension has its merits after all. Imagine the political pressures for bailouts in the face of the current stock market decline if Social Security included individual accounts! 
Even absent the falling stock market, privatization of Social Security has a fatal flaw: it can only be achieved at huge budgetary cost. Under the current system, the younger generation's payroll taxes pay the older generation's benefits. If Social Security is privatized, so that the younger generation diverts part of its taxes into individual accounts, then the government must finance (at enormous cost) the retirement of the older generation. It's like a family that hands down its clothes from one brother to the next: if somewhere along the way a brother gets to keep his clothes, the family has to head to the mall. 
The price tag for the missing generation of clothes was disclosed in December, but without the emphasis it deserved, in the report of the President's Commission to Strengthen Social Security. This commission was supposed to devise a scheme of individual accounts without jeopardizing the benefits of current or near-term retirees. Two plans proposed by the commission would eliminate the long-term deficit in Social Security. Both plans entail large benefit reductions for future retirees while still requiring substantial infusions of cash into the Social Security system. 
This is the bottom line: there is no silver bullet to fix Social Security. Any realistic plan is likely to require a lot of cash to make it politically viable. Yet Mr. Bush allocates trillions of dollars to permanent tax cuts (mainly for the rich) and not a single additional dime to Social Security. Forgoing parts of the president's tax cut that will take effect over the next decade could provide the funds necessary to address the Social Security gap. 
We can't afford this budget binge of irresponsible tax policies based on unrealistic accounting. Earnings projections that sounded far too good to be true on Wall Street have turned out to be illusions, even though the public desperately wanted to believe in those numbers. The same is true with bad numbers in the federal budget -- the principles of arithmetic can't be denied. If the tax cuts are left in place, high-income individuals, including billionaires exempted from estate taxes, stand to gain while future retirees and taxpayers will lose. 
President Bush has called for honest accounting in corporate America. The administration could set an example with an honest budget that ensures that retirees will have the nest egg they depend on most, their Social Security benefits. And to make that a reality, Congress should repeal the tax cuts that have not yet been phased in.

HEADLINE: New Economy; 
In the tech meccas, masses of people, or 'smart mobs,' are keeping in touch through wireless devices.

BYLINE:  By John Schwartz 

 BODY:
"SMART MOBS." The odd phrase might bring to mind rowdies partying after the Harvard-Yale football game. But, in fact, it has been coined by the author Howard Rheingold to describe groups of people equipped with high-tech communications devices that allow them to act in concert -- whether they know each other or not.
 This phenomenon is showing up among teens in tech meccas like Tokyo, where wireless text messages have caught on in a big way. American hip-hop fans, using two-way pagers, spontaneously appear for parties. And in Finland, members of a local cooperative mix the virtual and the physical by communicating via pagers and cellphones to meet at their club. 
 It's not all fun and games. Smart mobs in Manila contributed to the overthrow of President Joseph Estrada in 2001 by organizing demonstrations via forwarded cellphone text messages. Protesters at the World Trade Organization gathering in Seattle in 1999 were able to check into a sprawling electronic network to see which way the tear gas was blowing. Or they could use the network to determine their preferred level of involvement: nonviolent demonstrations, civil disobedience or mass arrests. The Sept. 11 terrorists used such devices to plan and coordinate their attack, and the victims used them to convey information -- and, in the case of United Airlines flight 93, learned of the other attacks and took action that may have prevented even more devastation.
To Mr. Rheingold, this all looks like a something very big -- which is why he calls the book on the subject that is planned for release this fall "Smart Mobs: The Next Social Revolution" (Perseus Publishing). 
Mr. Rheingold can recognize a revolution. He published "The Virtual Community" in 1993, long before corporate America realized that the killer app of the Internet would be the connections that the Net allows between people. He sees a similar shift with smart mobs and what he calls swarming.
"It took me eight years to find something that seemed that significant to me," Mr. Rheingold said. He has run around the world for the last two years watching young people in Tokyo and Scandinavia form "thumb tribes," and he has observed the ways that instant communications reshaped citizen revolts on the streets of Seattle, Manila and Caracas.
His feelings about all this are decidedly mixed. A world in which everyone is available online at any time can become a world without privacy, he warns, and the notion of smart mobs implies both potential for new benefits and menace. "I think it's important to signal that this technology has advantages and disadvantages, dangers as well as opportunities," he said.
Swarming behavior in itself is not new, nor does it require high technology. During my college days in the late 1970's, when dinosaurs roamed the earth, hundreds of people could spontaneously appear at my house for a party -- with the benefit of no technology more advanced than the waves of attractive force emanating from kegs of free beer.
But Mr. Rheingold argues that the convergence of wireless communications technologies and widely distributed networks allow swarming on a scale that has never existed before. He envisions shifts along the lines of those that began to occur when people first settled into villages and formed nation-states. "We are on the verge of a major series of social changes that are closely tied into emerging technologies," he said.
This blossoming of smart mobs will probably happen despite the interests of business, Mr. Rheingold said, not because of any plan. He points to other technologies, like Napster, that have emerged into broad acceptance to the horror of larger business interests, and said that smart mobs could be setting the stage for the next big fight of the new economy -- over control of personal information and of the technologies that connect people.
Other certified smart guys who gaze toward the future say Mr. Rheingold is on to something, but perhaps not as much as he thinks. "What he's talking about is real," said John Seely Brown, the former director of Xerox PARC. "The thing that surprises me is that he is casting this as so new." The ideas behind what the folks at PARC called "ubiquitous computing" have been around for a while -- and Mr. Rheingold describes the early PARC work extensively.
But to Mr. Brown, the most interesting social changes are not taking place with handheld and wearable devices so much as with the vast communities that are growing up around complex online games like EverQuest and Lineage, and which flourish because of high-speed Internet connections.
Jyri Engestrom, however, would not agree. He is a founder of Aula, a three-year-old cooperative in Finland that provides a physical meeting place to augment the virtual community. The city already had Internet cafes when the group started, he said. "What was missing was not a new Internet cafe," he said, "but a community, or network" where artists, business people and geeks could meet, talk, share ideas and have fun. Mr. Engestrom said the group planned to expand to other places as well, including a local cafe. Aula now has nearly 500 members, he said, with radio frequency ID tags that let them into the Aula meeting space and let others know they are there. "We're using digital technology in our case to enhance community-building in the wild, in the physical world," he said.
The revolution is on hold in this country, at least until text messaging catches on to a greater extent than the well-heeled Blackberry users and scattered communities that use two-way pagers. With the telecommunications industry in the dumps, that could take a while.
But if the change comes, yet another digital divide could emerge between the old and the young. Me, I can't type with my thumbs, and have no interest in learning. Even Mr. Rheingold said that he had the equipment but lacked the desire -- and a network of friends -- to send text messages to.
"We may not be interested," he said, "but today's 17-year-olds are."

HEADLINE: Hip-Hop Transforms Radio As Stations Seek Ad Dollars 

BYLINE:  By LYNETTE HOLLOWAY 

 BODY:
A year ago, WWPR-FM (105.1) was one of New York City's leading rhythm and blues stations, offering listeners a range of oldies from Diana Ross and the Supremes to the Spinners to Earth Wind and Fire, the music of the baby boom generation.
 But in March, the station, one of 1,200 stations owned by Clear Channel Communications, abruptly altered its format to hip-hop, offering edgier tones of artists like Nas, Cam'ron and Ja Rule and, in the process, showing how the appetite for R.& B. oldies has dwindled with the rise of a younger generation. 
 WWPR is not alone in making the switch. In Baton Rouge, La., WJNH-FM (107.3) changed formats from R.& B. oldies to hip-hop and contemporary R.& B. a year ago. In Chicago, WPWX-FM (92.3) also left its R.& B. oldies format for hip-hop last year. 
The shifts are largely propelled by economics. Hip-hop has great appeal among a group of listeners that advertisers increasingly covet: People between the ages of 18 and 34 who have demonstrated significant spending power on disposable items like liquor, soda, cellphones and electronics.
"Young people rule right now," said Taft Harris, general manager of WPWX, one of 38 stations owned by Crawford Broadcasting. "They have great spending power. They can't go out and buy big homes like older groups, but they can match them pound for pound on clothing, electronics and liquor purchases."
Today, 150 stations around the nation play mostly hip-hop and contemporary R.& B., said Sean Ross, group editor of Airplay Monitor magazine. Nine years ago, six were using that format, according to research by Mr. Ross and Tony Sanders, a senior analyst at Duncan's American Radio, another trade publication.
Sharply defined hip-hop stations began to emerge in the mid-1990's, as rap and hip-hop became a solid part of the musical mainstream. Still, only a handful of stations dared to call themselves rap or hip-hop because of the unwillingness of media buyers and advertisers to spend money on what they perceived to be "gangsta rap," Mr. Sanders said.
Now, the changes have added a second hip-hop station to some urban areas. Twenty-three cities have two competing hip-hop stations, including New York, Chicago, Dallas and Los Angeles, Mr. Sanders said, adding that Baton Rouge has three. Several conglomerates own competing hip-hop stations, he said.
But the changes have sparked battles between new hip-hop stations and longtime hip-hop stations, which are fighting to maintain their turf. Some battles are being played out like street ball, with radio personalities and their supporters talking as much trash as the rappers they play.
In New York, the conflict became personal between WQHT-FM (97.1), also known as Hot 97, and WWPR, whose ratings have soared in the four months since it changed format. WWPR, now called Power 105, hired the former hosts of Hot 97's morning show -- Ed Lover, Dr. Dre and Lisa G. -- and put them against WQHT's Star and Buc Wild, who have the No. 1-rated morning drive show among the 18-to-34 age group. The rub is that Star once wrote for Ed Lover at Hot 97, which is owned by Emmis Communications. 
"I can't even call them clowns because clowns have talent," Star, known for his in-your-face style, said of Ed Lover and Dr. Dre.
Ed Lover, the voluble part of the morning team on the new Power 105, did not resort to name calling but said of Star in an interview: "You're scared. You know what I can come into this market and do to you."
The early results of Power 105's makeover are impressive. The station has leaped to 3rd-ranked, from 13th, in New York radio. Hot 97 slipped in overall ratings but held its 2nd-ranked position.
"If you were to figure that Jammin' 105's rhythmic oldies format wasn't going to grow anymore, you had to go after someone who had the market all to themselves," Mr. Sanders said. "The life span of the hip-hop format has grown. It's more of the contemporary popular music."
Contemporary R.& B. is difficult to define, but it ranges from hot new talent like Jaheim and Ashanti to Brandy and Mary J. Blige, who have been around awhile. Hip-hop and contemporary R.& B. stations are not likely to play new songs by Babyface, Luther Vandross or Gladys Knight that fall in the category of adult contemporary R.& B., Mr. Ross said.
WJNH in Baton Rouge began playing contemporary R.& B. and hip-hop tunes like "Happy" by Ashanti and "Hot in Here" by Nelly about a year ago and stopped playing oldies like "Mickey's Monkey" by Smokey Robinson and the Miracles and "Shotgun" by Jr. Walker and the All Stars. WJNH became the third hip-hop radio station in the Baton Rouge market, joining WFMF-FM (102.5) and WEMX-FM (94.1), said Randy Chase, director of operations at WJNH, which is owned by the Guaranty Broadcasting Company. 
In making the change, WJNH rose to 5th-ranked from 12th in its targeted demographic of 18- to 34-year-olds, Mr. Chase said.
"There is room enough in this market to accommodate three stations," Mr. Chase said. "Hip-hop is not a niche. It is mainstream. Our incentive for switching over was for ratings, which in turn generates advertising dollars. We've achieved that."
In Chicago, when WPWX switched from oldies to hip-hop, officials at WGCI-FM (107.5), the old-time hip-hop station, became nervous. What ensued was a battle that lived up to Chicago's reputation as a feisty city.
"We went all out," said Elroy Smith, a spokesman for WGCI, which is owned by Clear Channel. 'We gave out free gasoline. We had Brian McKnight sing at a women-only dinner. At Christmas, when people wrote in asking for socks and to have their light bills paid, we did it and talked about it on the air. We were the first station in the world to play R. Kelly's new release, 'Heaven I Need a Hug.' "
Though WPWX does not have as many resources as WGCI, it is holding its own, said Mr. Harris, general manager of WPWX, which operated as an oldies R.& B. station for less than a year. Before that, it had been a gospel station for 39 years but changed its format because of new competition, Mr. Harris said.
WPWX experienced immediate results after making the switch. It became the 8th-ranked station in the overall market, up from the 31st rank. WGCI is the 3rd-ranked station in the overall market in Chicago.
"When I tell you it's an ugly war that we're engaged in, you had better believe it," Mr. Harris said. "It's about how we go after our advertising clients, like who's charging what rates, and booking artists. When artists come to town, they come either exclusively for WPWX or for WGCI. It has gotten so bad that some artists will not come for either station, just neutral events, because they don't want us or WGCI to be angry at them."
Mr. Harris laments the passing of R.& B. oldies as a cultural mainstream. "I'm old school," he said of his musical taste. "I'm not a lover of hip-hop. But the record companies have begun to court and market young talent. There is more of a market and following for that."

CORRECTION-DATE: July 23, 2002

 CORRECTION:
A picture caption in Business Day yesterday with an article about the growth of the hip-hop format among radio stations that previously emphasized rhythm and blues misstated the surname of a program host at WWPR-FM in New York City, which switched its format in March. He is Curt Flirt, not Flint. The caption also rendered the name of another host incorrectly. He is Doctor Dre -- not to be confused with the rap musician Dr. Dre.

For Sale: Mountains Entwined in the Scottish Soul

BYLINE:  By ALAN COWELL 

DATELINE: DUNVEGAN, Scotland, July 19 

 BODY:
The problem stalking John MacLeod, chief of his clan, master of his castle, is one most people would hardly expect to confront. So is the solution he has devised to solve it.
 Essentially, his family's 800-year-old fortress, rearing from dark waters at this northwestern tip of the Isle of Skye, needs fixing. Its flat, copper roof leaks so that, he has said, guests need umbrellas in the bedrooms. Its walls are crumbling. To raise money for repairs, Mr. MacLeod, the 29th in a line of chiefs each known as MacLeod of MacLeod, has resolved to sell another part of his estate: an entire 22,300-acre mountain range. 
 The price tag is $15 million, a fitting sum, some might say, for this is not just any mountain range.
These peaks and buttresses of dark, gabbro rock are called the Black Cuillin, arguably Britain's most challenging theater for mountaineers. The saw-toothed silhouette offers one of the nation's most celebrated Alp-like vistas, a scenic leitmotif that catches the eye from most parts of the island, at least when Skye is not obscured by rain or mist. Until Mr. MacLeod put the mountains up for sale, most people assumed that the peaks were publicly owned.
"It is the same as saying you would sell off Mount McKinley or Yosemite," said Dave Morris, a director of the Scottish Ramblers Association. "It caused outrage among people who would never believe that you could sell Cuillins on the world property market."
The sale has become a topic of public debate just as Scotland's new Parliament prepares to reform 12th-century feudal laws that give just 350 big landowners like Mr. MacLeod title to half of the privately owned land. Some people worry that he plans to use proceeds from the sale to build a glitzy hotel or that a new owner might try to sell concessions on the Cuillins (pronounced COOL-ins) to professional mountain guides, ending free access.
Just to mix in the fashionably evil spirit of greedy, global Wall Street capital, there are whispers that a would-be buyer is an American, a shadowy figure whose intentions remain shrouded in mystery. Mr. MacLeod declined to discuss that aspect in an interview here.
It is not even beyond dispute, say some campaigners against the sale, that the mountains are unequivocally Mr. MacLeod's to sell or, indeed, that a sale will proceed in this time of tumbling economies.
"It's not yet been sold," said Mr. MacLeod, 66. "I'm very optimistic that the Cuillins will be sold, but the economies of the world have slightly changed since six months ago."
The story, of course, is not as simple as that.
Talk of the sale, first raised in March 2000, has stirred a brew of resentment, mixed with deeper thoughts about the rightful ownership of wilderness.
"These mountains are bigger than one person, bigger even than one nation," said Bill Birkett, an author on mountaineering issues. "Their spirit and soul lie within all the people that love and respect the freedom of wild places," he wrote in a letter to the weekly West Highland Free Press. 
Mr. MacLeod sees another perspective. Dunvegan Castle, his family seat, is one of Skye's prime tourist attractions, offering work to 20 people year-round and 80 in the summer tourist season, and drawing tens of thousands of visitors to this far-flung outpost of 9,000 souls in the lea of the Outer Hebrides.
The castle needs a lot of rebuilding, Mr. MacLeod said, because its entire fabric has been weakened over the years. Surveyors estimated the cost at $9 million, and his sale price of $15 million would include taxes likely to accrue from the transaction.
To that extent, the decision is just business. "You have to sell one asset in order to cope with another," he said in the interview, for which he appeared clad nattily in a tweed jacket and a kilt of the MacLeod tartan of green and blue crisscrossed with red and yellow. But it has not been easy. "The Cuillins are part of my heritage as much as the castle." 
The debate swirling around the sale of the Black Cuillin, about 25 miles south of here, has raised legal questions too. By September 2001, Mr. MacLeod said, lawyers acting for a buyer had drawn up 66 questions relating to the purchase. Then, after Sept. 11, the negotiations seemed to slow, he said, but he declined to speculate on whether economic turmoil since then had left even mysterious millionaires short of cash for a range of mountains that are not the most transferable of assets.
"It's not as if they could be towed away like London Bridge and taken to Arizona," said Nigel Hawkins, the director of the John Muir Trust, a conservancy body named for the Scottish-born patron of national parks like Yellowstone and Yosemite in the United States. Since the 1990's, the trust has owned another part of the Cuillins.
While Mr. MacLeod says the mystery buyer loves the Cuillins and will maintain free access to them, bodies like the Mountaineering Council of Scotland remain troubled by the commercialization of this natural wonder. "The idea is: if the checkbook is big enough, you can have it," said Mike Dales, a spokesman for the council. 
Other opponents contend it is not entirely clear that Mr. MacLeod has title to the mountains.
The Scottish authorities have ruled that Mr. MacLeod's ownership of the Cuillins would be difficult to challenge in court in light of documents dating to the 15th and 17th centuries and the hundreds of years of unchallenged MacLeod domain over the mountains.
But Alan Blackshaw, a historical researcher, has more recently discovered evidence from mortgage deeds and redrawn parish boundaries in the 19th century suggesting that the MacLeod writ did not include the jagged mountaintops that give the Cuillins their special character.
To which Mr. MacLeod replied somewhat sharply that his family's claim rested on 800 years of ownership and a variety of royal decrees attesting to it. "We have been here since history began," he said.

HEADLINE: Report Cites Blacks' Gains, and Gaps 

BYLINE:  By The Associated Press 

 BODY:
In areas as diverse as jobs, home ownership and politics, blacks are continuing to make gains, but equality with whites remains a distant goal, the National Urban League says in its annual report on the state of black America.
 "When you look at the data, yes, we have made substantial headway," said Hugh Price, the league's president. "But there are still, without a shadow of a doubt, substantial gaps in every category, every vital sign. We're making steady progress but we're not in the end zone yet." 
 The report, to be released on Wednesday, is a collection of eight essays written by experts in fields that include labor, home ownership and civil rights. It is intended to be a snapshot of blacks in America. The first one was published in 1976.
The authors highlight several areas where blacks have made gains, yet disparity persists.
In the 1990's, for example, black unemployment fell to its lowest level in 30 years. The rate of poverty among black families fell to 26 percent, the lowest on record.
Yet the recession has hit black workers harder than it has hit others, the report said. In June, the unemployment rate for whites was 5.2 percent; for blacks it was more than twice that, 10.7 percent.
In the workplace, the report said, blacks are about twice as likely to hold lower-paying, less prestigious service jobs. About 20 percent of blacks hold professional or managerial jobs, while more than 30 percent of whites do. Fewer than 1 percent of certified public accountants, for example, are black, Theresa Young, associate professor of accounting at Boston College, wrote in one essay.
When it comes to owning homes, the league reported, blacks are stuck in the pre-civil rights era. For whites, the home ownership rate is 74 percent. For blacks, it is 48 percent, the same as in the 1940's.
More than 9,000 blacks held elected office in 2000, more than ever before in the nation's history, the report said, drawing on data from the Joint Center for Political and Economic Studies. The Republican Party, the report contends, has demonstrated a "lack of commitment to include blacks among its ranks of elected officeholders."
Pamela Mantis, a spokeswoman for the Republican National Committee, responded that black Republicans held elected offices across the country and that black Republicans were also candidates.
The report also noted that 38 percent of all AIDS cases reported in the United States were among blacks.

HEADLINE: Auto Emission Rules in California Are Forcing Changes 

BYLINE:  By DANNY HAKIM 

DATELINE: DETROIT, July 21 

 BODY:
While automakers rail against landmark California legislation that would force them to cut greenhouse gas emissions by the end of the decade, they face a much more immediate challenge from the state.
 On Monday, Gov. Gray Davis of California will sign a bill requiring automakers to cut carbon dioxide emissions by the 2008 model year. The bill directs the California Air Resources Board to decide how much to reduce emissions over all and how to do it. 
 But of more immediate concern for automakers is one of California's last big initiatives on air pollution -- a decade-old mandate to create zero-emission vehicles that could soon force them to sell more than 100,000 electric cars and other fuel-efficient vehicles in the state each year. 
Although the zero-emission standard, which was scheduled to take effect with the 2003 model year, has been delayed by a court injunction, it has prompted automakers to spend billions of dollars developing technologies to cut harmful tailpipe emissions and has led them to start promoting and selling electric vehicles. In addition, New York and Massachusetts plan versions of the Z.E.V. mandate, as it is known, meaning the zero-emissions requirement could cover almost one-fifth of the American auto market. Other states could follow suit. 
The mandate, set in motion in 1990, aims to cut emissions of nitrogen oxide and hydrocarbons, large contributors to smog, and particulates, which lead to respiratory ailments. But the mandate has been delayed by a legal challenge from General Motors and DaimlerChrysler, which won an injunction in federal court last month.
State regulators have appealed and insist they will be able to tweak the regulation, if necessary, to mollify legal objections.
The rule requires large automakers to derive 10 percent of sales from vehicles that produce nearly zero emissions, including at least 2 percent from vehicles with no emissions. Auto executives say that 2 percent requirement has forced them to keep alive a technology they would just as soon give up on: the battery-powered automobile, the only pure zero-emission vehicle now made.
To comply, carmakers are already selling everything from armies of beefed-up golf carts to a few electric versions of sport utility vehicles to highly efficient versions of gas vehicles. Nissan is equipping most Sentra sedans sold in California with an extra catalytic converter. Toyota is advertising an electric version of its RAV4 sport utility vehicle on a billboard in Berkeley, at nearly double the normal price.
Some executives worry that they will have to take additional steps to meet the mandate, like subsidizing sales of costly electric vehicles and spending thousands of dollars a vehicle to convert gas cars to electrics.
"I remember I had a meeting in Tokyo where they showed me all the cost of this stuff. I said, 'Oh my God, the others have to do this too?' " Carlos Ghosn, the chief executive of Nissan, said.
"Nobody believes in it, but you have to do it," Mr. Ghosn said. "It's a huge cost, but it's part of the cost of doing business."
California regulators, as well as environmental groups, counter that the rule has forced automakers to accelerate the development of cleaner technologies with sound prospects. These include hybrid engines, which run on both gasoline and electricity, as well as hydrogen fuel cells, a zero-emission technology widely considered as the power source of the future. 
"They wouldn't have been topics of discussion if not for Z.E.V.," said Jerry Martin, a spokesman for the California Air Resources Board, the regulatory body that established the mandate. "The standard fare for drivers around the world would be 8,500-pound S.U.V.'s, probably half of them powered by diesel." The air resources board has also modified the regulation several times to give automakers credit for cars with low emissions.
Many zero-emission vehicles in California are more golf cart than car and meant for gated communities, city-sponsored car sharing programs and corporate and government fleets. The Think division of Ford sells a beefed-up golf cart called the Neighbor for $6,500, which needs six to eight hours to recharge after traveling 30 miles. Ford is also considering bringing an electric subcompact sold in Europe, the Think City, to California.
For a Think Neighbor "we had a man trade in his Cadillac," said H. L. Fletcher, fleet manager of Fritts Ford in Riverside, Calif., who sells 40 to 50 Neighbors a month. 
Mr. Fletcher said the man, in his mid-80s, was "too old to drive a big car and bought a Think to drive back and forth from the grocery store and get himself around."
But many car executives say the development of realistic technologies is being sacrificed for the money-losing, obsolete idea of electric cars.
California has shown some flexibility, though. Nissan, for instance, has a varied compliance plan. It makes an electric station wagon, the Altra, that can travel 100 miles between charges and is being leased to power companies like Southern California Edison. It also makes a big golf cart, the Hypermini, that is being used in Pasadena and Palm Springs for parking enforcement. And Nissan will get credits for its modified Sentra.
The most familiar vehicle is the electric version of Toyota's RAV4, which can go up to 78 miles an hour and travel up to 126 miles before it requires a recharge. The RAV4 EV sells for $42,510, versus a $17,000 starting price for a gasoline version, although it is eligible for $13,000 in state and federal rebates. Toyota has sold 120 since February. "We lose large amounts of money on every EV we sell," said Mike Love, Toyota's national regulatory affairs manager. "They cost us in excess of $100,000 apiece to build."
New York and Massachusetts have plans to adopt mandates that would give automakers until the 2006 model year before they have to produce any pure zero-emission vehicles. Until then, car companies could comply by selling hybrids, efficient gas cars or cars that use alternative fuels.
"The small neighborhood-type vehicles really aren't as marketable here in the Northeast," said Gina McCarthy, assistant secretary for the environment in the Massachusetts executive office of environmental affairs. "Residents in Massachusetts are really looking to get access to hybrids. They're buying them now, and they're on waiting lists. We want more hybrids."
Erin M. Crotty, the commissioner of the New York State Department of Environmental Conservation, said earlier this year that the state's Z.E.V. mandate will be a strong incentive for automakers. 
For the moment, though, both states are awaiting the outcome of the legal challenge in California.
In 1990, when California's zero-emission mandate was formulated, there were hopes that the electric vehicle would be viable for the mass market by the end of the decade. But technology has still not solved the crucial drawbacks: short range and long charging time.
G.M., now the most outspoken opponent of the Z.E.V. mandate, was a pioneer in electric vehicle development in the 1990's with its EV-1 sedan, spending more than $1 billion before abandoning it. 
G.M. plans to use credits from sales of the EV-1 to help meet the requirement, though it is not clear how it will comply if its legal challenge fails. Part of its plan, which has angered competitors, is to give away electric vehicles it has purchased from Club Car, a golf cart maker. 
"You don't mandate markets," said Chris Preuss, a G.M. spokesman. The Z.E.V. mandate, he added, was "completely unworkable both in California and anywhere else."
The suit in federal court filed by G.M. and DaimlerChrysler, along with some state dealers, contends the mandate is superseded by federal fuel economy standards. Though reducing gas mileage is one way to cut harmful emissions, direct action on that is reserved for the federal government. A federal judge in Fresno granted the plaintiffs an injunction last month, saying the automakers had a strong case because of a 2001 amendment that gave credits for high-mileage vehicles.
The air quality board, which at first threatened to enforce an older version of the regulation, has since appealed and says it will rewrite the mandate if necessary.
Environmental groups say they have little choice but to turn California into a battleground. The auto industry has successfully lobbied since the 1980's to prevent significant increases in federal gas mileage standards, and the Bush administration rejected the Kyoto protocol, the international treaty to reduce global warming emissions. 
Since California's air quality regulations predate the federal Clean Air Act, it has its own, tougher rules, and other states can choose whether to follow them. The Z.E.V. rule was set in motion before global warming was a hot-button issue and was aimed at pollutants that lead to smog and other environmental hazards. Whether carbon dioxide, linked to global climate change, is itself a pollutant is a matter of much debate, but the Z.E.V. mandate will have the practical effect of curbing such emissions as well.
"It forced the auto industry to evaluate and use technologies they never wanted to even look at," said Daniel Becker, director of global warming strategies at the Sierra Club, adding, "As a direct result of that, we have hybrid electric vehicles on sale today."

HEADLINE: Where the Slaughterhouse Ruled, a Recall and a Shift in the Wind 

BYLINE:  By MICHAEL JANOFSKY 

DATELINE: GREELEY, Colo., July 21 

 BODY:
For years, this agricultural community 60 miles from Denver was defined by the sprawling meatpacking plant at its northern edge, Weld County's largest employer, looming large by its considerable size and unmistakable odor. At any given time, up to 200,000 cattle stood in nearby pens, awaiting their fate on the killing floors inside.
 More recently, the plant's prominence has faded a bit as Greeley has diversified and grown. Several big companies, including Allstate Insurance and Kodak, have opened large offices here, and new subdivisions are turning the west side of town into sprawling suburbia. Even the smell has abated to a degree. The primary holding pens have been moved well out of town, and only on the windiest days are people who live here chased inside, windows closed. 
 But now, a different odor is wafting about, the scent of trouble. It follows reports that E. coli bacteria from animals processed here sickened 19 people in six states. Prompted by the Agriculture Department, the plant owner, the ConAgra Beef Company, recalled 354,200 pounds of beef on June 30 and an additional 18.7 million pounds on Friday. The meat was recalled "as a cautionary measure," said Agriculture Secretary Ann M. Veneman. 
So far, no illnesses have been reported from beef in the second recall, but the total amount of beef involved amounts to the second-largest meat recall in history, behind Hudson Foods' 25 million pounds in 1997 -- and a scary one, for the presumed cause. The pathogen, E. coli 0157:H7, contaminates meat by contact with an animal's intestines or fecal material and can cause a variety of illnesses and even death.
"Bottom line, this will stigmatize the plant," said Ron Bush, president of Local 990 of the United Food and Commercial Workers Union, which has 2,400 members working in the plant. "But it remains to be seen what the long-term effect will be."
Greeley has always had ambivalent feelings about its meatpacking plant, which a local family, the Monforts, opened in 1960 and sold to ConAgra in 1987. Employing more than 3,000 people -- including 600 management personnel who work in a new building on Greeley's west side -- ConAgra acts as a major economic engine for the city and county, processing thousands of pounds of beef a day and selling products that millions of consumers buy.
A 1999 study by Colorado State University found that ConAgra generated $2.5 billion in annual economic benefits for Weld County.
"It has helped the city grow," said Leonard Wiest, the city manager of Greeley, whose population has grown 45 percent over the last two decades, to 76,930 in 2000 from 53,006 in 1980. 
"This year, we will grant anywhere from 900 to 1,000 new building permits," Mr. Wiest said. "Those are record numbers."
At the same time, periodic labor unrest at the plant, injuries, safety-code violations and the slaughterhouse smell have always added a "yeah, but" to any local discussion of the plant's civic contributions. Now there is much more to worry about.
Long before the recalls, ConAgra announced that it was selling a majority interest in its fresh beef and pork processing operations to Hicks, Muse, Tate & Furst, an investment group based in Dallas, for a price announced in May as $1.4 billion. The deal, which includes the Greeley plant, one of six ConAgra owns, is expected to close in a few weeks.
ConAgra officials are promising that nothing will change at ground level here other than the name, to Swift & Company. But as epilogue to the sale, a series of problems -- the huge recall, fears that more consumers might fall ill and ConAgra's unstable stock price -- are raising questions over what the future holds for the plant and for Greeley.
For now, it may be too soon to tell. Mayor Jerry Wones predicted "a short-term nightmare" for the company but minimal impact, if any, on the city. "People don't associate the two," Mr. Wones said of bad beef and Greeley. "When you recall cars, people don't start blasting Detroit. I imagine the whole industry will come under some scrutiny, but not the town or the state of Colorado."
Kay Norton, president of the University of Northern Colorado, who was legal counsel for ConAgra for 16 years through 1998, said the recall could affect the company financially if it loses several big customers. "But that takes a while to demonstrate," Ms. Norton said, expressing doubt that much would come of it.
Plant workers say they are not sure what to make of things. So many animals come in; so much meat goes out. Federal inspectors are working inside the plant every day. "I assume they're watching," said Mr. Bush, the union president, who holds the inspectors more accountable than ConAgra for the E. coli outbreak. "That's why they're there, right?"
Yet things happen, and now the authorities are trying to figure out why. Joe Antuna, who has worked at the plant for 35 years, first as a cutter and now as a water treatment specialist, said layoffs or other changes "could hurt the plant, but it might help, too, you know, slow things down for a short time, clean things up. I think that would be a good idea."
Jesse Barboza, 31, a meat cutter from Texas who has worked at the plant for 10 years, said he has always taken pride in his job, which made it possible for him to own a home and raise four children.
"You make it there that long, it has to be worth something," Mr. Barboza said. "Yeah, the pride, it's kind of there. But not the way it was in the past."
Mr. Bush said that in general, union workers were happy in the plant. He credited the management with sincere efforts to help Latino workers, who make up 90 percent of the plant employees, by improving working conditions and setting up programs like English classes. Much of the satisfaction flows from a four-year labor agreement signed two years ago that gave workers a 14 percent raise and new benefits.
That meant a lot to Mr. Barboza, who said it was less common now for supervisors to mistreat workers. He recalled a supervisor denying his request to visit a restroom, saying, "You already went today." That does not happen much anymore.
Mario Hernandez, a spokesman for the Mexican consulate in Denver, said his office had received no complaints in recent years about conditions in the plant.
Still, there are problems, Mr. Bush said. Despite more workers staying at the plant longer -- now an average of 18 months, an improvement over recent years, when low pay and poor conditions drove many people out after a week or two -- the company cannot find enough workers.
"They hire, on average, 30 to 50 a week, and they're lucky to keep half of them," Mr. Bush said. "Why? That's the $64,000 question. If I knew the answer, I'd be a well-paid consultant."
Supervisors still speak abusively to workers, Mr. Bush said. "But now," he said, "the company will act against them more quickly."
Around town, ConAgra's profile seems less pronounced than it was decades ago. Many people just shrugged when asked about the recalls, saying the plant had withstood other problems, like the 1980 strike that shut it down for 73 days and led the Monforts to close it for two years.
"You hear about things like that," Austin Debrito, a supervisor at Pete's Old Town Diner and a marketing major at the university, said of the recall. "But it's mad cow disease from this beef, E. coli from that beef. I haven't heard one question about beef since it happened, and we're serving quite a few T-bones."

HEADLINE: Slowing Down, at a Cost 

BYLINE:  By EDWARD WYATT 

 BODY:
Officials charged with overseeing the rebuilding of Lower Manhattan said this weekend that the public's call for a slower planning process and less commercial space on the World Trade Center site could delay plans for an expanded transportation center connecting the subway and commuter rail lines downtown.
 That, combined with other recommendations about the rebuilding process that came out of a town hall meeting on Saturday, leaves the Lower Manhattan Development Corporation, the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey and Gov. George E. Pataki with some tough decisions in the weeks and months ahead. 
 Hundreds, if not thousands, of construction and other jobs would be affected by significant delays in the rebuilding process, and the more time that passes before commercial construction begins on the site, the greater the effect on the Lower Manhattan economy, particularly on foot traffic for businesses there. 
The call from among the more than 4,000 people who attended the "Listening to the City" meeting on Saturday for cuts in the number and size of office buildings on the site -- combined with the vow by political officials to heed the public's views -- could also affect the revenue that the Port Authority generates to pay for other transportation projects in New York and New Jersey. 
For better or worse, the developments of the last week have turned the process of deciding what will replace the World Trade Center into an old-fashioned New York brawl, pitting outspoken community groups against developers in a fight that is refreshingly reminiscent of life in the city prior to Sept. 11.
Some of that spirit was on display during the town hall meeting at the Javits Convention Center. When participants voted on whether the first of six site plans provided an appropriate setting for a memorial, loud cheers erupted as the mostly negative results were projected on giant screens. The cheers got louder as several plans got successively lower ratings. 
Several officials said it would take a couple of weeks to sort out all the ideas discussed and comments made on Saturday. But they were also quick to salute the messiness of democracy in action.
"If people didn't have some faith in us and the plans, nobody would be here," Louis R. Tomson, the president of the development corporation, said on Saturday. "Now we have to go back and consider this information, and it may take some time."
That extra time is likely to move the next deadline in the design process -- the distilling of six site plans to three, which was to have been completed in September -- until after the election in November. That would relieve Mr. Pataki of the prospect of having any more unpopular site plans unveiled as voters are weighing his future.
But in saying that they would re-examine the requirement for maintaining 11 million square feet of office space on the site, Port Authority officials admitted that they did not know what the reaction would be from Larry A. Silverstein, the developer who holds the lease to the site. 
Rebuilding officials said last week that they hoped to reach an agreement with him by offering other development rights away from the trade center site, lower lease payments or some other consideration.
A spokesman for Mr. Silverstein, Howard J. Rubenstein, would not comment yesterday about the possibility of a renegotiated lease with less office space, saying "that would be up to their future discussions." 
He said Mr. Silverstein "anticipated that this would be the beginning of the consideration of the configuration of the site."
Mr. Rubenstein also said that his client "has always been sensitive to the needs and desires of families who lost people in the trade center, and he's always welcomed their ideas." 
An agreement for less commercial development could mean that Mr. Pataki and Gov. James E. McGreevey of New Jersey, who control the Port Authority jointly, will have to grapple with how much revenue loss will be borne by each state -- a significant discussion, in light of current budget woes.
A spokesman for Mr. Pataki, Michael McKeon, declined to comment on the potential effects of less commercial space. But he said that the governor's goal has been "to get as many ideas as possible and incorporate the best ideas into the process."
In recent weeks, Mr. Pataki and the Port Authority, which required the architects designing the site plans to replace all of the office, retail and hotel space that was destroyed, seemed to be wielding most of the power in the planning process for rebuilding. Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg, despite controlling half the board seats at the development corporation, seemed to be on the margins.
But Mr. Bloomberg was among the first people to criticize the original six plans publicly, which galvanized the growing discontent among many civic groups; the subsequent public opposition to the initial plans has enhanced the mayor's stature. 
Mr. Bloomberg has called specifically for more housing as part of the plans, something that Mr. Tomson, the development corporation's president, said his agency "will have to respond to."
Knowing where the memorial will be, and therefore what space is left for buildings, remains one of the most important decisions to be made.
At a news briefing following Saturday's meeting, the chairman of the development corporation, John C. Whitehead, pointed out that the speed of the work going on below ground level depended greatly on knowing what would eventually happen above ground.
"I'm not sure people realize that the transportation facility, which is now being reconstructed underground, has to depend on where the buildings will be and their location on the site," Mr. Whitehead said.
The process is unlikely to affect repair of the 1 and 9 subway lines or the construction of a temporary PATH station, which is scheduled to open in 2004. That work is part of plans for a large transportation hub that planners have likened to a downtown Grand Central Terminal.
But reconsidering locations for a memorial "would hold up the completion of the transportation facility," Mr. Whitehead said. "We have to look at that and see whether it's worth the lull."

HEADLINE: In New York Tickets, Ghana Sees Orderly City 

BYLINE:  By ROBERT F. WORTH 

 BODY:
If you are caught playing your radio too loudly in Times Square, selling ice cream while parked in a Harlem crosswalk or dumping your kitchen trash in Prospect Park, your ticket does not just go to City Hall to be processed.
 It goes to Ghana. 
 Just days after the tickets are written out on New York City streets, they are scanned and sent as digital photographs to computers in a small office in downtown Accra, Ghana's hot and crowded capital. 
There, workers try to make out the unfamiliar street names (Dyckman, Flatbush, Hudson) while transcribing the handwritten scrawl of New York police officers into searchable databases.
And through the alchemy of globalization, the tickets that bring only aggravation on this side of the Atlantic become snapshots that fire imaginations more than 5,000 miles away.
The Ghanaians can see that the city is orderly, at least in its grid. "It's easy to look at New York and see where you are going," said Christine Mensah, 35, a manager. "It's not like Ghana. With a map you can go anywhere." 
And they imagine that the city is sparkling clean. Why else would people be given tickets for not cleaning up after their dogs? "I know that New York is beautiful: the streets, the flowers, and the people too," said Susuana Okine, 26, whose only ties to the city are the maps she consults daily at work. "I can also testify that it must smell better than Accra." 
Ms. Okine and her 40-odd co-workers spend their days typing out the contents of the city's environmental violation tickets for their employer, Data Management Internationale, a Delaware-based firm that has been digitizing information for New York City since March. Before that, the work was done in India and Mexico for a Michigan-based company called Lason. 
Charles Sturcken, chief of staff for the city's Department of Environmental Protection, which signed a two-year, $910,000 contract with Data Management, said he had no idea that the work was being done in Ghana. Although many United States corporations and some other cities rely on similar back offices to input data in distant countries, several current and former city officials said they were unaware that any city contract had ever been handled abroad.
It may not last much longer. Once a reporter started asking about the Ghana contract, Data Management said it planned to start handling New York City's business domestically and have the Accra office work on other accounts. The company worries that it will be perceived in New York as taking jobs from American workers, said William Swezey, a manager at Data Management.
From New York's perspective, it hardly matters whether the work is done in Africa or Delaware: the contract is simply a way to process the half-million environmental tickets the city hands out every year. And either way, the Ghanaians are not likely to lose their jobs. The company is planning to expand its operation there, said Mark Davies, an American who leases the Accra office space to Data Management.
It is good work, by Ghanaian standards. The typists earn 500,000 cedis a month (almost $70 -- three times the Ghanaian minimum wage and more than twice the average per capita income) to type the offender's name, address, fine and offense location into a searchable database that is sent back to New York. It can then be stored electronically and used to generate payment notices, Mr. Sturcken said.
The greatest challenge, several employees said, is accurately deciphering the hasty scrawl of the ticket writers, who are employees of various city agencies as well as police officers. The company's contract requires it to return the transcribed information with an error rate of no more than 1 percent and within 48 hours of pickup.
Several employees said they were happy with the job, and especially the office's air-conditioning. "It's very hard, but to do well, you have to work very hard," said Ms. Okine, who was hired in March. Asked what she would say if she ever met a New York City police officer, Ms. Okine said without hesitating, "I would tell him to improve on his handwriting."
Although Ghana was a British colony and English is the official language, the workers initially found New York's addresses difficult to figure out, since terms like "avenue" were completely unfamiliar to many of them. Accra's streets are a baffling maze of roundabouts, circles, dirt paths and unmarked alleys, where goats wander freely. Many streets do not have names and most people don't know the names of the ones that do.
The employees work in revolving eight-hour shifts that run 24 hours a day. They are immaculately dressed and sit silently at computer terminals, typing as fast as they can in a plain office. The workers get one 30-minute and two 10-minute breaks per shift to use the bathroom, eat and call friends. Their computers have no e-mail because it could be a distraction. Soon, workers will be paid by the keystroke, with deductions for errors, a company official said.
The office is in a two-story Internet center called BusyInternet that was founded by Mr. Davies, a former dot-com executive who fell in love with Africa on a backpacking trip several years ago. "Busy," as the locals call it, is the largest Internet center in West Africa.
Visitors at the Internet center downstairs jokingly call Data Management an "electronic sweatshop." But the jobs are so popular that dozens of people apply for each opening, even when the company does not advertise. 
And to many people in this city of open sewers and vast unemployment, the data entry operation represents a beacon of hope. It is one of West Africa's first ventures in information technology outsourcing, which has become a business worth more than $7.5 billion a year in India. As in some other third world countries, the Internet has been embraced ardently in Ghana. Five years ago, there were no Internet cafes in Ghana; now there are at least 250 in Accra, Mr. Davies said.
"You can go down an alley that's not paved, and where women are selling rice on the corner, and there's an Internet cafe," said Anthony Swezey, the brother of William Swezey and manager of the Accra office. He said the company chose Ghana because it is safe and the government is democratic and has been stable for 20 years. And, of course, because labor in Ghana is far cheaper than in the United States.
Data Management workers said they were surprised -- but grateful -- for New Yorkers' apparent willingness to break the law.
"They know the rules and they still are always violating them," Ms. Mensah said. "Maybe they don't understand simple instructions. But they have to keep doing it, because it's how we make our money."
Ms. Mensah and others also expressed a passionate curiosity about the places and names they see so many times on tickets every day. They seemed particularly intrigued by Queens, because of its royal name and large size.
Some even said they wanted to move to New York.
"I am very used to the rules and regulations of New York now," said Nora Kraku, 28, during a break. "So I think I can live there."

HEADLINE: Hurry Up and Wait in Congress 

 BODY:
People who have been following Congressional debates and votes on big issues like energy, trade and prescription drugs might be excused for presuming that something was passed into law. But on all these issues Congress is stuck -- as it is on election reform, a patients' bill of rights, welfare reform and important budgetary issues.
 Four months before the election, two Congresses are at work in Washington. One is energetically tackling corporate responsibility and the creation of a new Homeland Security Department. The other, immobilized by partisan bickering, seems happier when the Democrats and the Republicans can each pass conflicting legislation, giving them the bragging rights without actually doing anything. 
 In some cases, doing nothing might be fine. No bill would be better than the House energy plan, which would open a wilderness area in Alaska to oil drilling and bestow excessive subsidies on the industries that contribute most heavily to global warming. The Senate bill, which offers more generous incentives for renewable fuels and energy efficiency, is also flawed. But with help from President Bush, who so far has been content to criticize the Democrats, there is still time to reach constructive compromises on other issues.
On Thursday, Congressional negotiators finally approved a supplementary appropriations bill containing emergency spending for the military and domestic security. But a broader budget resolution remains elusive, largely because Republicans insist on linking it to permanent extensions of previously enacted tax cuts. Given the daily disclosures about malfeasance among top corporate executives, the idea of rewarding the richest Americans with more tax breaks is more ludicrous than ever.
The trade bill is stuck in a conference committee that is seeking to reconcile Senate and House versions. When the bill was stalled in the Senate, Mr. Bush hammered the Democrats for blocking it. He should now use his influence to move it along by overcoming Republican resistance to certain health benefits it gives the unemployed. He should also throw his weight behind election reform, which is stalemated over the issue of mandatory national standards for voter registration and balloting. 
Congress was supposed to renew the six-year-old welfare reform bill, but the Senate has bogged down over debates about how much to provide for day care and other services to meet the tough new work requirements that most lawmakers favor. A bill that softened the punitive work requirements favored by the House and provided adequate financing for day care would be a real step forward for reform.
Prescription drug benefits, another elusive goal, will be debated this week on the Senate floor, although right now no single proposal seems to have enough support for passage. Meanwhile, the two chambers are still at odds on whether patients should have the right to sue their insurance companies. Mr. Bush favored protecting that right during the presidential campaign but has since retreated. If he wants a bill, and not just a campaign issue, he could make it happen.

HEADLINE: WORLDCOM'S COLLAPSE: THE FUTURE; 
Bankruptcy's Taut Wiring

BYLINE:  By SIMON ROMERO and JONATHAN D. GLATER 

 BODY:
The crisis in the telecommunications industry just became worse.
 Even though WorldCom's bankruptcy filing had been expected for weeks, its reality has created a cascade of problems in the interdependent industry of local and long-distance phone carriers, as well as their equipment suppliers. The two-year slump in telecommunications has been a major factor behind the limping economy and the falling stock market, with telecommunications stocks having lost about $2 trillion of value in the last two years. So, continued turmoil for the industry could have broader negative repercussions. 
 "People can no longer ignore that telecom is cratering and is a major drag on the economy," said Scott Cleland, chief executive of the Precursor Group, a consulting firm in Washington.
WorldCom's bankruptcy filing is unlikely to have much direct effect on its business customers or on residential callers, which include about 20 million people who have monthly long-distance service from the company's MCI unit. Creditors and regulators are likely to ensure that the company's network operations remain relatively intact in the months ahead. 
If anything, long-distance customers may benefit from further price breaks, as WorldCom will be under less pressure to maintain its revenue to meet payments to creditors. But because price wars have contributed to the telecommunications industry's problems, further pressure on that front would add to the challenges facing other carriers, particularly the big long-distance companies AT&T and Sprint. 
Of more immediate concern to the other carriers, though, is the prospect of not being paid by WorldCom, which typically gives them tens of millions of dollars a month in the complex give-and-take by which carriers connect one another's customers in a vast communications web.
The industry's largest trade group sent a letter over the weekend to the Federal Communications Commission, asking for permission to pass along the costs to their own customers if WorldCom falls behind on its network-connection payments.
Nearly every telecommunications company -- whether it is a carrier of phone calls like Verizon Communications or an equipment producer like Lucent Technologies -- is owed money by WorldCom, and will have difficulty collecting these debts as WorldCom shields itself from creditors under bankruptcy court rules.
Among the large regional phone companies, it is estimated that Verizon and SBC Communications are each owed more than $200 million by WorldCom, some of which they have already had difficulty collecting. It is unclear how much these companies can collect on such debts or whether they can hope to collect on the $100 million of fees WorldCom pays them every month to connect its customers to their networks.
"We're disappointed that they have taken this step," said Peter Thonis, a spokesman for Verizon. "We plan to follow the situation closely to do what it takes to protect the interests of our shareholders."
Another huge regional phone company, BellSouth, plans to hold on to some of the money it collects as the billing agent for WorldCom customers if WorldCom fails to pay its connection fees, according to a spokesman, Jeff Battcher. He said WorldCom typically paid BellSouth about $80 million a month.
WorldCom's bankruptcy filing is also likely to weigh on revamping efforts already under way among other telecommunications companies, like Global Crossing and 360networks, themselves operating under bankruptcy protection. Creditors for those companies have had trouble finding buyers for their networks, or even parts of them. Now, as WorldCom looks to sell some of its assets, the glut of distressed properties will grow larger.
The glut of capacity in communications networks, a result of overzealous investment during the telecommunications boom in the late 1990's, is a big factor in the industry's current slump.
The huge run-up in stock prices allowed upstart companies, most notably WorldCom, to grow rapidly through acquisitions and inexpensive financing. The rising popularity of the Internet in that period helped stoke the network building frenzy. Executives at UUNet, an Internet "backbone" company that WorldCom acquired in 1996, were quoted as saying that Internet traffic would double every 100 days.
As WorldCom's accounting scandal has illustrated, the failure of Internet traffic to grow at anything near the predicted pace contributed to the pressure on its executives to create a facade of financial normalcy. 
But even if WorldCom took extreme measures in trying to cope with the industry's mounting problems, the company's difficulties demonstrate that telecommunications is not a zero-sum game in which one company's losses necessarily translates into another's gains.
For example, WorldCom suffered a decline in its long-distance revenue in recent years as wireless callers began using cellphones to place more and more nationwide calls -- lured by rates as low as 2 cents a minute, compared with WorldCom's 10 cents a minute.
But this does not mean that wireless carriers have been profiting from those customers they have won away from WorldCom and other long-distance carriers. Any such advantage has been reduced by intense price competition in the wireless industry, which had its own overbuilding boom in the 90's.
For WorldCom, the bankruptcy filing buys time, but does not magically solve its problems. The shrinking telecommunications industry will pose significant problems for WorldCom as it chooses which contracts to back out of and which ones to honor, said Sandra E. Mayerson, head of the bankruptcy practice in New York at Holland & Knight, a law firm. 
Because in many cases the company's suppliers are also customers, choosing to dump a supply contract to save money might result in losing a sales contract that would generate as much or more revenue, she said.
"You cannot reject a contract that is unprofitable for you without thinking of the consequences for the party on the other side," Ms. Mayerson said.
Also to be determined is the value of WorldCom's assets, which includes hundreds of thousands of miles of fiber optic cable in North America and Europe, the largest Internet data carrier in the world, and far-flung subsidiaries like Embratel, the dominant long-distance carrier in Brazil. Analysts says some of those assets may now be worth only pennies on the dollar.
"The basic rule in telecom cases is that the assets are worth somewhere between a dime and 3 cents on what it cost you to build the thing," said John D. Fiero, a bankruptcy lawyer at Pachulski, Stang, Ziehl, Young & Jones in San Francisco.

HEADLINE: Con Edison Braces For Hot Workday After Fire at Plant 

BYLINE:  By SARAH KERSHAW 

 BODY:
New York City officials are urging Con Ed customers across a large section of Lower Manhattan to use electricity sparingly today in an effort to prevent a power failure in the wake of Saturday's major explosion and fire at an electrical transformer on the East River.
 Consolidated Edison officials said yesterday that its East River Generation Station, on 14th Street and Avenue C, was prepared to deliver enough power to its roughly 63,000 customers in the affected area, from 14th Street to the Battery, west of Broadway. 
 Most workers are returning to the area today for the first time since an explosion rocked the power plant shortly after noon on Saturday, spewing acrid black smoke, sending orange flames 30 to 40 feet in the air, and cutting power to 63,500 customers south of 14th Street for eight hours. Temperatures today are expected to be in the 90's in New York, with high humidity, a combination that can strain the power grid even when it is not compromised. 
Con Ed officials said the fire was sparked by an arc of electricity created by a short-circuit in the East River plant. But the cause of the short-circuit was not known. 
"It's going to be some time before we can really piece together the specific scenario of what happened, what failed first, what wires were damaged," said Louis L. Rana, vice president for Con Ed's electrical operations in Manhattan. "It's actually a very complex issue."
Mr. Rana described the damage to the plant as "massive." The transformer and the surrounding steel electrical connections -- some of which grew so hot during the fire that they melted and "vaporized" -- were severely damaged.
City officials said they had not yet estimated the economic losses that businesses in Battery Park City, TriBeCa, SoHo and the West Village -- already reeling from the effects of the Sept. 11 terrorist attack -- suffered from the blackout.
The three-alarm fire, one of the most serious electrical blazes in city history, also disrupted subway service in Manhattan. The fire was brought under control within several hours, and most electrical and subway service was restored by Saturday evening, although some Con Ed customers reported sporadic power failures yesterday.
Mr. Rana said that by yesterday afternoon, Con Ed workers had repaired or replaced six of the seven underground cables that run electricity from the 69,000-volt plant to two substations on the Lower West Side.
"I'm confident the day will go smoothly for downtown Manhattan," he said when asked if power failures related to the transformer fire were expected today. "But we are still asking customers to use energy wisely and to conserve."
The city also has in place a set of contingency plans should another power failure occur, said Michael Dendekkera, a spokesman for the city's Office of Emergency Management. The plans include using mobile electricity generators, setting up "cooling centers" outside the area of a blackout, and monitoring hospitals and buildings taller than six stories, many of which rely on electricity to pump water from tanks into the upper floors of apartments.
The Office of Emergency Management urged residents and businesses to limit their use of "nonessential" appliances and electronic equipment. Con Ed, which has posted energy-saving tips on its Web Site, www.coned.com, encourages customers to set their air-conditioners and thermostats at 78 degrees and notes that fans use much less electricity than air-conditioners.
After initial fears that a terrorist attack might be to blame for Saturday's transformer explosion, city and Con Ed officials quickly ruled that it was an accident. They said the plant was not under especially heavy strain because Saturday was not particularly hot for mid-July and the weekend demand for power is 20 percent less than that of weekdays. 
Saturday's power failure was the third in a week in the city and was by far the most serious -- not counting Sept. 11, when a substation in 7 World Trade Center was destroyed -- since a 1999 blackout in Washington Heights and Inwood.
And it came at a time when utilities in the New York region are bracing for the specter of serious power failures because demand is higher than anticipated. 
The owners of Aquagrill, a trendy restaurant on Spring Street in SoHo, said yesterday that they were still without Con Ed power and were using a mobile generator, which they were renting for $2,000 a day, to power the refrigerators, lights and air-conditioners at their establishment.
The owners, Jennifer and Jeremy Marshall, said that they first lost power on Thursday night, when the second electrical failure of last week knocked out power to the Avenue of the Americas and Spring Street, causing subway service disruptions that lasted into Friday morning. (The first failure occurred Tuesday night, when power along the A and C subway lines, between Bedford-Stuyvesant, Brooklyn, and Lower Manhattan, was out for about two and a half hours.) 
Their power was restored Saturday morning, the Marshalls said, only to be lost later in the day after the explosion at the East River plant. 
After the blackout that crippled Upper Manhattan in July 1999, the city sued Con Ed, saying that the utility had failed to properly design and maintain the network of cables that distributed electricity to the area.
Rudolph W. Giuliani, who as mayor often criticized Con Ed, said at the time that the company had cost the city millions of dollars for the extra police officers, firefighters and other city employees working during the 18-hour blackout. 
But a spokesman for Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg said yesterday that Mr. Bloomberg, who went to a command center near the East River plant on Saturday but made no public appearances yesterday, was "pleased" with the utility's response to the latest problem.

HEADLINE: WORLDCOM'S COLLAPSE: THE OVERVIEW; 
WORLDCOM FILES FOR BANKRUPTCY; LARGEST U.S. CASE

BYLINE:  By SIMON ROMERO and RIVA D. ATLAS 

 BODY:
WorldCom, plagued by the rapid erosion of its profits and an accounting scandal that created billions in illusory earnings, last night submitted the largest bankruptcy filing in United States history.
 The bankruptcy is expected to shake an already wobbling telecommunications industry, but is unlikely to have an immediate impact on customers, including the 20 million users of its MCI long-distance service. 
 The WorldCom filing listed more than $107 billion in assets, far surpassing those of Enron, which filed for bankruptcy last December. The WorldCom filing had been anticipated since the company disclosed in late June that it had improperly accounted for more than $3.8 billion of expenses. 
Few experts or officials expect WorldCom's service to deteriorate noticeably, at least in the near term. "I want to assure the public that we do not believe this bankruptcy filing will lead to an immediate disruption of service to consumers," Michael K. Powell, chairman of the Federal Communciations Commission, said last night.
But industry consultants said they could not imagine how the belt-tightening expected in bankruptcy would improve service that is already, in some respects, sloppy. Page A12. 
WorldCom's collapse has already reverberated through jittery financial markets, and is likely to be felt in the wider economy, with banks, suppliers and other telephone companies devising strategies to contain their exposure.
WorldCom, built through rapid acquisitions, accumulated $41 billion in debts. Founded in 1983 as LDDS Communications, it became the nation's second-largest long-distance company and the largest handler of Internet data.
Company executives said they intended to remain in business, and have been promised new financing from banks to do so. "We are going to aggressively go forward and restructure our operations," John W. Sidgmore, WorldCom's chief executive, said in an interview last night. "I think ultimately we will emerge as a stronger company."
While WorldCom has already cut its work force significantly, Mr. Sidgmore said last night that he did not expect further layoffs for the time being. He said he would remain WorldCom's chief but would be joined by a chief restructuring officer brought in by creditors.
Some creditors, however, have questioned whether Mr. Sidgmore, who has served on WorldCom's board for years, should remain in charge. Mr. Sidgmore took over as chief executive in late April after the board ousted Bernard J. Ebbers, one of the company's founders.
Shareholders, who owned what was once one of the world's most valuable companies, worth more than $100 billion at its peak, are expected to be virtually wiped out. With the bankruptcy filing, control passes instead to the banks and bondholders who financed WorldCom's growth.
Besides its own overambitious strategies and flawed accounting, WorldCom also fell victim to a glut of telecommunications capacity. 
Cheap and plentiful financing allowed companies rapidly to build transcontinental and transoceanic fiber optic networks in the 1990's. The additional capacity resulted in lower prices for WorldCom's services, which include basic phone service and the transmission of Internet data for large companies.
Mr. Sidgmore said last night that he was opposed to breaking up WorldCom and selling its pieces, aside from an effort already under way to part with peripheral units like businesses in Latin America and some other operations. This approach would rule out selling UUNet, a large Internet backbone operation, or MCI.
But once the company reorganizes, and investors gain a better understanding of its twisted finances, WorldCom could become an attractive acquisition target, analysts say.
WorldCom's crisis deepened last month when it disclosed that Scott D. Sullivan, the chief financial officer, had devised a strategy that improperly accounted for $3.85 billion of expenses. Mr. Sullivan was fired by the board and David F. Myers, the financial controller, resigned.
The Securities and Exchange Commission has charged WorldCom with fraud and the Justice Department has begun a criminal investigation of its business practices. 
In an attempt to regain its credibility, WorldCom's board elected two new members to replace Mr. Sullivan and Mr. Ebbers: Nicholas deB. Katzenbach, a private attorney who was attorney general in the Johnson administration; and Dennis R. Beresford, a former head of the Financial Accounting Standards Board and a professor of accounting at the Terry College of Business at the University of Georgia.
The two were also appointed to a special committee to oversee the internal investigation being led by William R. McLucas, the former chief of the enforcement division of the S.E.C. 
WorldCom filed for bankruptcy shortly before 9 last night in Federal District Court in Manhattan.
Its international operations, which include companies in Brazil and Mexico, were not included. 
The filing will relieve WorldCom of about $2 billion of interest payments in the coming year. Lower debt costs could allow WorldCom to compete on a stronger footing with its rivals, involving a potential price-cutting strategy that has analysts concerned about the wider strength of the telecommunications industry.
"WorldCom probably won't get any new big contracts from its current customers, but it probably won't lose any either, because of the difficulty and complexity involved in switching carriers," said Glen Macdonald, a vice president with Adventis, a consulting firm in Boston. 
WorldCom, based in Clinton, Miss., scrambled in recent days to secure new financing from its banks after its cash dwindled to less than $300 million from more than $2 billion in May. WorldCom said last night that it had received commitments for up to $2 billion in additional bank financing. Such new loans to companies in bankruptcy receive top priority in repayment. 
WorldCom must now deal with holders of $28 billion in bonds as well as 27 banks that loaned the company $2.65 billion last May.
But in contrast with other companies that have recently filed for bankruptcy, including Enron, WorldCom has many more tangible assets, generating actual revenues, lawyers said -- improving the odds that the company could emerge from bankruptcy as a going concern.
The creditors first in line to be repaid will be the three institutions -- Citigroup, J. P. Morgan and General Electric Capital -- that have pledged to arrange a loan of up to $2 billion, known as debtor in possession financing, to WorldCom. The lenders were comfortable pledging the funds in part because of the company's stream of customer payments, such as phone bills, one executive close to the company said last week. Citigroup is leading the new financing in part to protect what it is already owed by WorldCom.
WorldCom's bankruptcy filing, like Enron's last December, came on a Sunday. Companies often prefer to file over the weekend, because the status of any business transactions in process at the time of a filing would be open to question in court. 
WorldCom's lenders and its bondholders were taking steps, even before the bankruptcy filing, to protect their claims. Just over a week ago, the banks that participated in the earlier $2.65 billion loan tried, unsuccessfully, to get a court order limiting WorldCom's access to the loan. The banks ultimately reached a settlement with WorldCom that placed few restrictions on the company's ability to use the cash.

HEADLINE: Talk of Rules for Accountants Is Matched by Campaign Gifts 

BYLINE:  By SHAILA K. DEWAN

 BODY:
As accounting scandals roil the stock market and stimulate a wave of regulatory bills in Congress, New York State lawmakers have also begun to ponder ways to tighten oversight of accounting firms and eliminate potential conflicts of interest.
 At the same time, campaign finance reports filed last week show that the nation's biggest accounting firms began pouring more money than ever into the state's political races. The four firms left of what was once the Big Five -- Deloitte & Touche, Ernst & Young, PricewaterhouseCoopers and KPMG -- have given more than $350,000 to candidates and legislative fund-raising committees so far, up from $150,000 in the same period before the last governor's race, in 1998. 
 Of that $350,000, nearly half, $160,000, was contributed since Arthur Andersen went on trial in May for shredding documents. After WorldCom admitted a $3.8 billion overstatement of its cash flow in June, $73,500 streamed into state campaign chests in three days. 
"Their real concern, and indeed ours, is that New York not move out ahead of Washington," said Louis Grumet, the executive director of the New York State Society of Certified Public Accountants. Only New York and California are considering passing their own laws instead of waiting for reforms to wend their way through Congress.
The firms would not say if the New York proposals had motivated the contributions. None of the measures had moved beyond the incubation stage when the legislative session ended earlier this summer.
"We just don't discuss these matters," said Robert Zeitlinger, a spokesman for KPMG, which gave $50,000, less than the other three. A spokesman for PricewaterhouseCoopers referred questions to another executive, who did not return several calls. Neither did a spokesman for Deloitte & Touche. A spokesman for Ernst & Young, which along with its political action committee gave the most, $150,000, said he could not immediately explain the increase in donations. The lobbyist for the four firms, Kenneth L. Shapiro, did not return calls to his Albany office on Thursday and Friday.
Assemblyman Richard L. Brodsky said that the donations were clearly an attempt to head off regulation. Mr. Brodsky is sponsoring two bills that are intended to prohibit accounting firms from practices like auditing companies that also hire them to do consulting.
"They are willing to go to any length to protect themselves no matter what the cost is," he said. "They didn't get civic-minded in June of 2002."
The biggest beneficiary of the new largess was Gov. George E. Pataki, a Republican who is running for a third term. He has received nearly $100,000 from the four firms, most of it this year. In 1998, he received $35,000 before the election.
Asked about the contributions, the governor's campaign spokeswoman, Mollie Fullington, repeated what has become the campaign's stock response to questions about fund-raising: "We're pleased that the governor's proud, strong record of accomplishment for all New Yorkers has resonated with people of all walks of life."
The firms gave far less to Mr. Pataki's Democratic opponents. One of those men, Andrew M. Cuomo, received $10,000 from Ernst & Young. Another, H. Carl McCall, the state comptroller, received nothing from the firms, but his running mate, Dennis Mehiel, who is running for lieutenant governor, netted $15,000 from Deloitte & Touche.
Mr. McCall's fund-raising policy does not prohibit such contributions, said a spokesman, Steven Greenberg. "But, in light of what's going on, we have certainly not been seeking them, and we would scrutinize them very carefully," he said.
"As the accounting industry takes on a more and more negative presence," Mr. Greenberg added, "Governor Pataki takes more and more money from them." 
The firms took special note of Eliot L. Spitzer, the Democratic attorney general who has thrust himself into the Wall Street scandals with his investigation of Merrill Lynch and other investment banking firms. Each accounting firm paid $5,000 to attend a fund-raiser for Mr. Spitzer's re-election campaign where the United States Senate majority leader, Tom Daschle, was the host, said a spokesman for Mr. Spitzer, Darren Dopp.
"It's new money," Mr. Dopp said. "They had not donated to Mr. Spitzer before."
Mr. Dopp said that Mr. Spitzer was investigating investment firms because one responsibility of his office was to protect private investors, but that responsibility did not extend to oversight of accountants.
Much of the rest of the firms' donations have gone to committees that finance legislative races.
Mr. Brodsky, Democrat of Westchester, and State Senator Kenneth P. LaValle, Republican of Long Island, who has also introduced accounting oversight bills, said New York should lead the nation in accounting oversight because the state's economy depended so much on Wall Street. 
"I have no problem with New York law being tougher than federal law, because we're talking about restoring faith with the investing community," Senator LaValle said.
Both legislators said that an overhaul of the law was long overdue. Although the accounting profession has evolved considerably, the state regulates only accountants that work on financial statements, not those that provide tax preparations, consulting, financial planning or management advice.
The laws defining practices that are regulated have not been updated substantially since 1947, said Daniel Dustin, the executive secretary of the state board that oversees the profession.

HEADLINE: Investors Brace ForOpening Of New Week On Wall Street 

BYLINE:  By ALEX BERENSON 

 BODY:
Even for investors who lived through the bear market of the 1970's, the relentless slide of stocks since March has been deeply disturbing. When the markets open today, Wall Street will be on edge. 
 Markets rarely move in one direction, whether straight down or straight up. Yet for the last four months, stocks have plunged day after day, and week after week, climaxing with Friday's 390-point drop in the Dow Jones industrial average. 
 Optimistic comments about the economy from Alan Greenspan, chairman of the Federal Reserve, and better-than-expected profit reports from some companies have not stopped the skid. Speeches by President Bush meant to reassure investors have instead seemed to frighten them.
But if history offers one certainty, it is that the slide will not go on forever, and investors who have the fortitude to step in just when the market looks its worst will probably be rewarded.
So what might stop the skid? Here are five possibilities: Stock buybacks, the Federal Reserve, the Bush administration, small investors and the market itself. 
After the crash of 1987, many companies announced plans to buy back their own stock, providing a strong signal that they thought that their shares were cheap. But in this downturn, the effect of buybacks has been more muted. Many companies already buy back shares regularly to offset the additional shares issued as a result of stock option grants they give employees, so announcements of buyback programs do not send as strong a message as they did 15 years ago.
To compensate, companies could expand their buyback plans. But buybacks eat up corporate cash, and when the debt markets are unsettled and the economy uncertain, many chief executives are wary of spending money if they do not have to do so.
Still, if stock prices continue to fall, expect to see more announcements of expanded buybacks and more executives buying their companies' stock in the market, rather than through options programs. Insider buying, if it happens, would be a strongly bullish signal.
The Federal Reserve can also help. When the Dow gained 400 points in the last 90 minutes of trading last Tuesday, the tight-knit community of hedge fund managers was filled with rumors that the Fed had somehow intervened to prop up stocks. The idea that the Fed had directly bought stocks is far-fetched, to say the least.
But the Fed does have at least three ways to support stocks indirectly. It can buy Treasury bonds and notes from banks, an action that puts more cash into the banking system. It can also lower short-term interest rates, a step that should help the economy by decreasing the cost of borrowing.
Lower rates might also encourage investors to take some of their savings out of money market funds and put them into stocks.
With the support of the Treasury Department, the Fed can also step into the currency markets to support the dollar, whose recent fall has been a burden on stocks.
But it is far from clear that the Fed thinks it needs to intervene. The sell-off has been orderly until now, and stocks are hardly trading at bargain levels. Mr. Greenspan may well view the downturn as painful but necessary to correct the speculative excesses of the bubble, and refrain from action as long as the plunge does not seem to be hurting the real economy.
The Bush administration -- including the president and his economic team -- have had little success so far in their efforts to restore confidence. Despite the federal government's rising budget deficit, the president's main economic priority appears to be making permanent a tax cut that was conceived during a surplus and would favor the richest Americans.
Paul H. O'Neill, the Treasury secretary, carries relatively little weight on Wall Street or in Washington.
Meanwhile, Harvey L. Pitt, the chairman of the Securities and Exchange Commission, has become the focus of scorn among many investors for his ties to the accounting industry at a time when corporate accounting is in its worst shape since before the S.E.C. was created. To many investors, Mr. Pitt appears to have been slow to grasp the seriousness of the problem, and some of them say his proposed reforms have been weak.
Wall Street might greet a change at the top of the S.E.C. or the Treasury Department as a sign of the president's great concern about the market's slide.
A wave of buying from small investors, either directly or through mutual funds, would also provide important short-term support.
But individuals appear increasingly panicked by the plunge. After buying funds almost every week between October and May, investors have sold shares for each of the last six weeks, and the redemptions are accelerating, said Thomas McManus of Banc of America Securities. For the week ending last Wednesday, investors sold $11 billion in stock funds.
As a result, instead of propping up the market, small investors appear to be worsening its slide, at least for the time being. 
In the short run, the best reason to expect a strong rally is the market itself. Stocks do not move one way forever. Most technical indicators, like the ratio of stocks falling to stocks rising, show the market is overdue for a sharp turn. 
The gains could be prompted by an unexpected piece of corporate or economic news, or they could simply come from investors who think that stocks have fallen too far, too fast, and that they are ready to turn.

HEADLINE: Europeans Split With U.S. on Need for Iraq Attack, Citing Mideast as Priority 

BYLINE:  By PATRICK E. TYLER 

DATELINE: LONDON, July 21 

 BODY:
The last thing Europe wants is to be accused of going wobbly on Iraq. 
 But the American talk of overthrowing Saddam Hussein by military force is raising alarms in European governments. 
 They are saying that any American miscalculation could undermine the international coalition that is fighting against terrorism, and the broad-based diplomacy needed to solve the crisis between Israel and the Palestinians. Also, they fear that a drive against Iraq would drive a wedge between Britain and the rest of Europe.
An exasperated French official said in an interview in Paris on Friday that some of President Bush's conservative aides have become "obsessed about Iraq, while we are obsessed about achieving peace" between Israelis and Palestinians. "The important thing is to build a coalition for peace in the Middle East, not to build a coalition for war in Iraq," he said. 
Washington's increasing talk of "regime change" is hindering diplomatic strategies to press Mr. Hussein to open his country again to United Nations inspectors searching for weapons of mass destruction, this official said. 
Those reports continued with a British newspaper report on Friday that Prime Minister Tony Blair is preparing for a significant call-up of military reserves in the fall and that he has pulled an armored division out of training exercises so it could be made available for special deployment later this year.
In the House of Commons, Mr. Blair said that Britain has gathered extensive evidence that "Saddam Hussein is still trying to develop weapons of mass destruction" and that Britain will publish the evidence "at the appropriate time." Last fall, the British government published the first detailed report that Osama bin Laden was directly linked to the Sept. 11 attacks on the United States, thus laying down an important predicate for the war in Afghanistan. 
There is a striking agreement in European capitals that Mr. Hussein's government is dangerous and may need to be confronted one day. But any agreement breaks down over strategic priorities in the Middle East, which Europeans consider neighboring territory for trade and security. With America the lone superpower, they are ever prickly over any hint that the United States is ignoring their views or assuming, as one German official said, "that we are Euro wimps" when it comes to the use of force.
The European Union's top security official, Javier Solana, warned in an interview of a "self-fulfilling prophecy" of war against Iraq. "If Saddam Hussein thinks that this option is inexorable, why would he yield to inspectors?" Mr. Solana said.
He said it would be "very, very difficult" to sustain allied support for an assault against Iraq unless progress is first made toward creating a Palestinian state.
The debate with Washington reminded The Economist magazine of Churchill's confidence that, "You can always rely on America to do the right thing, once it has exhausted the alternatives." The right thing, for Europe, is to concentrate first on getting Israelis and Palestinians to desist in a conflict that is roiling emotions and shaking governments across the Arab world.
One European leader said King Abdullah II of Jordan came to him "in tears" over recent reports that the Americans were thinking of attacking Iraq from Jordanian air bases at a time when Arab frustration with the lack of progress on the peace front is soaring. 
Besides the Middle East, Europeans point out that it is critical to achieve some stability in Afghanistan, where Western intervention has destroyed the Taliban, but has not assured that the interim government of Hamid Karzai will succeed as a stable replacement. 
"There is a lot of understanding of U.S. impatience vis a vis Iraq," said an adviser to Chancellor Gerhard Schroder of Germany. "At the same time there is a tremendous amount of concern about anything that would destabilize the situation in the Middle East. Things are bad enough now and we don't need to worsen them." 
European leaders, as well as most Arab states, welcomed the meetings just held by Arab foreign ministers and Western governments on how to improve security for Israel against suicide bombers while at the same time moving toward negotiations that would realize the vision of a Palestinian state within three years. Yet this American-backed initiative is barely a first step and will require months of intensive diplomacy to generate real progress, officials said. 
"The timing is very narrow to get something going that changes the attitudes of Arab leaders and public opinion in the region," said Mr. Solana, especially if the United States wants to consider a military campaign in Iraq this winter. There is also the question of the Palestinian elections in January, he said. Would they take place during a buildup for war in Iraq and under Israeli occupation? 
"It's going to be very difficult to have elections under these conditions," he said. 
Interviews with officials in London, Paris and Berlin revealed striking agreement that the Israeli-Palestinian conflict represents the highest priority for Western governments, not only to end the carnage, but also to strengthen Western credibility in the face of the appeal of militant Muslims, who are exploiting the plight of the Palestinians to increase support for violence. 
Mr. Blair's government, the United States' closest ally, surprisingly distanced itself from Mr. Bush's call for the removal of the Palestinian leader, Yasir Arafat, saying that it would do business with whomever the Palestinians elect. A senior British official suggested that the United States should push harder for a peace agreement between Israel and the Palestinians because otherwise "it may not be possible" to build support for action in Iraq. 
"We need to get the show back on the road," he said, adding that "American energy" was essential to create the basis for new negotiations between Israelis and Palestinians. 
Britain, too, has distinguished its position on a change of government in Iraq from the Bush administration's. "We believe that regime change is desirable, but ending the threat of weapons of mass destruction is our objective -- getting the inspectors back in," the British official said. 
As for a possible military campaign, the official said that, "Obviously, planning is going on" and that European criticism of Britain's support for American military intervention would not affect British policy. 
"Nobody wants to go into a war, but sometimes you can't avoid it," the official said. "We'll look after our own interests and if others are not as a resolute as us, then they're not, but we are not going to change our position because of it." 
Britain's determination to remain shoulder to shoulder with the United States still leaves major questions hanging over the prospect of any campaign in Iraq.
In London, Paris and Berlin, the fundamental questions posed to Washington have been the same. Who would guarantee the territorial integrity of Iraq after a war? What government would replace Saddam Hussein's? Is America prepared to invade and occupy Iraq for a decade or more to protect a successor government from subversion and attack from Iraq's neighbors, Iran and Syria? Who would pay for the war? 
"The questions have been asked, but the answers have not been given," a French official said.
"We will be directly hurt if there would be a miscalculation," said the German foreign minister, Joschka Fischer, in an interview in Berlin.
He expressed doubt that Mr. Hussein represented a strategic threat to Western security and indicated that he was more concerned about the threat to European security from a new war in the region that might further inflame the passions of Arabs who want to see an end to the Israeli occupation of Palestinian territories. 
"Our people were hurt badly, wounded or burned to death, in Djerba," he said, referring to the German tourists who were victims of a truck bomb attack on a Tunisian island this spring.
"Millions of Germans," he added, "go to the Mediterranean summer and winter," and "we have millions of Muslim immigrants from the region." 
In the end, he said: "It is a decision of the United States. I mean this will have results for all of us, but first of all it is a debate in the United States. It is not a debate here, not a decision here." But there was also a palpable strain of disappointment in Berlin over the failure of the United States to include its allies in that debate. 
"After Sept. 11, we had the feeling there would be a more multilateral approach" to international affairs by the Bush administration, said the adviser to Mr. Schroder. But more recently, "We have been seeing a very assertive administration on the move in so many areas that people on this side of the Atlantic come to the question whether really there is a new approach."

HEADLINE: Turkey Warns U.S. of Difficulties in an Assault on Baghdad 

BYLINE:  By DANIEL SIMPSON 

DATELINE: ISTANBUL, July 21 

 BODY:
Reiterating Turkey's concerns about military action against Iraq, Prime Minister Bulent Ecevit warned the United States today that it faced a long war if it decided to topple President Saddam Hussein of Iraq by force.
 Turkey, a NATO ally whose support would be vital for any operation in neighboring Iraq, has made it clear in recent weeks that it publicly opposes American military intervention. 
But diplomats say Turkey has been pressing the United States in private for economic support in the event of a strike that is increasingly viewed as inevitable here. 
 Mr. Ecevit said in a television interview that he did not know when an attack on Iraq might come, but he warned that Mr. Hussein retained the technological and economic ability to put up a long fight, despite sanctions imposed after the 1991 Persian Gulf war.
"It will not be possible to get out of there that easily," Mr. Ecevit said. "President Bush is a friend of Turkey. We do not want to hurt his feelings, but it is our duty to make our concerns known."
Turkey, a predominantly Muslim country from which American warplanes continue to enforce a no-flight zone over northern Iraq, feels aggrieved about the consequences of the gulf war, which it believes cost it billions of dollars in lost trade. In addition to asking the United States to write off more than $4 billion of debt, Turkish officials want to secure postwar development contracts in Iraq if Mr. Hussein is ousted, Western diplomats say.
Turkey also fears that a prolonged conflict could encourage Kurds in northern Iraq to demand an independent state, possibly inducing Turkish Kurds to renew a separatist guerrilla struggle that claimed 30,000 lives before a cease-fire in 1999.

HEADLINE: Sri Lankan Says U.S. Drive on Terror Helps Peace Effort 

BYLINE:  By BARBARA CROSSETTE 

 BODY:
The first Sri Lankan leader to visit Washington in nearly two decades said yesterday that the American-led campaign against terrorism had helped his government's chances of ending a long civil war -- even though Sri Lanka has never figured in the search for Al Qaeda.
 The Sri Lankan, Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe, said in an interview that he would ask President Bush and other officials in meetings on Monday and Tuesday to expand diplomatic support for his government and to consider a trade and investment agreement to help rebuild the country's economy. 
 He said he hoped peace talks would start in August to end the war, which has killed tens of thousands of people and uprooted many more. A cease-fire is already in effect. 
Both a higher awareness worldwide about the destructiveness of terrorism and a new resolve among Sri Lankans to stop the war are traceable to the attacks on the United States and the response to them, he said. 
"After last September, we have benefited, because the world has been looking around and they've been more concerned," said Mr. Wickremesinghe, speaking by telephone from Washington. "That's also led to the fact that in places like Sri Lanka, where a political solution can be found, we should go for it."
Since the early 1980's, the Sri Lankan government, dominated by the country's ethnic Sinhalese majority, has confronted a Tamil rebellion in the island's northeast that also sent suicide bombers into the capital, Colombo. 
A reclusive and ruthless Tamil rebel, Vellupillai Prabakharan, and his Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam, were responsible not only for assaults on Sinhalese targets but also for the harsh subjugation of Tamils and Muslims (a separate ethnic group largely descended from Arab traders) in areas under rebel control. The Tigers raised money from a Tamil diaspora in North America, Europe and Southeast Asia. 
The Sinhalese political establishment and a generation of moderate Tamil leaders were devastated by assassinations. Hundreds of ordinary people died in bus bombings and other attacks.
Well before the attacks last September, the United States, Britain and Malaysia had listed the Tigers as a terrorist organization. After Sept. 11, funds linked to the organization were frozen. 
India had also banned the organization and charged Mr. Prabakharan with planning the assassination of Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi in 1991. Mr. Gandhi had tried to reverse years of training and financing of the Tigers by Indian intelligence officials -- an operation similar to what India now says Pakistan conducts in Kashmir.
After Sept. 11, Canada and Australia also curtailed the activities of groups linked to the Tigers in those countries.
Sri Lankan officials say the cumulative effect was almost immediate. Short on cash, the Tigers sued for peace, if only to buy time. 
Mr. Wickremesinghe, whose right-of-center United National Party won a national election in December on a peace platform, moved quickly into the vacuum.
He was welcomed enthusiastically by Tamils when he visited Jaffna, the center of Tamil culture, in March, the first prime minister to go there in more than 20 years.
Christina B. Rocca, the American assistant secretary of state for South Asia, and Brig. Gen. Tmothy Gormley of the Marines stood beside him there. It was one of the strongest gestures of support the United States had ever made to the embattled Sri Lankan government.
"I think the support they have given us has been very helpful, and that will continue," Mr. Wickremesinghe said. "What we will do now is discuss the next options."
Cease-fire monitors from several Nordic countries, led by a retired Norwegian officer, are on the ground in disputed areas. But peace talks have been delayed because serious issues remain unresolved.
Mr. Wickremesinghe said he was not worried by the delay because, day by day, Sri Lankans themselves are bringing the country together through commerce along recently reopened roads and in restored air services.
"The people-to-people process is taking hold very fast, and that's what counts most," he said. 
Among the troublesome issues remaining are the forced recruitment of child soldiers by the Tigers and extortion of money by the rebels in Tamil neighborhoods. 
Muslim Sir Lankans also fear they will be singled out for abuse by Mr. Prabakharan's agents if the Tigers gain control over an interim administration in the northeast, where the Muslim presence is significant. Mr. Wickremesinghe said he would appoint a Muslim leader, Rauf Hakeem, to his negotiating team to safeguard Muslim rights in coming talks.
"The interim administration must operate within a democratic framework and respect for human rights," the prime minister said. "The court system of Sri Lanka will operate, so human rights can be safeguarded and it can be transparent. It will be difficult for the interim administration to operate otherwise. The whole world will be watching them."
The Tigers want to have a ban on their organization in Sri Lanka lifted before talks begin. The government has said it is prepared to do that within perhaps 10 days of talks so the organization can take on political functions.
"What you're seeing in the country is that the people do want peace -- sometimes ahead of the government, ahead of the L.T.T.E., ahead of other political forces," Mr. Wickremesinghe said, using the rebel group's initials. "After a long time, there is one country functioning as one economic unit. We are gradually, I would say, limping back to normal."

 CORRECTION:
An article on Monday about comments by Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe of Sri Lanka on world terrorism referred imprecisely to his visit to Washington. While it was the first official visit in two decades by a government leader from his country, President Chandrika Kumaratunga made a private trip in 1999.

HEADLINE: Lawmakers Court Business While Deploring Its Misdeeds 

BYLINE:  By CARL HULSE 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, July 21 

 BODY:
Richard A. Gephardt, the House Democratic leader who has been putting a new emphasis on cleaning up corporate America, celebrated 25 years in Congress on Thursday with a $500,000 fund-raising reception at a downtown hotel. Among those paying up to $5,000 to attend were dozens of Washington representatives of that very same corporate America.
 One night earlier, centrist House Democrats of the Blue Dog Coalition took a break between votes to travel six blocks from the Capitol to an elegant private home, where representatives of software giants Microsoft and Intuit joined other high-tech lobbyists at a $1,000-a-person reception for the group. Envelopes containing donations were stacked neatly on a table at the front door. 
 This weekend at the Greenbrier Resort in West Virginia, business representatives whose political action committees paid $15,000 for the privilege spent quality casual time with a half-dozen senators, courtesy of the National Republican Senatorial Committee.
While Congress is putting the spotlight on business practices in response to a spate of corporate malfeasance that has shaken the markets and shrunk the retirement accounts of constituents, both parties continue to rely on the corporate sector as a steady font of campaign cash -- even as they jockey for supremacy on the subject of who is going to reform Wall Street.
With just a few days remaining before the August recess, lawmakers looking to bolster their campaign bank accounts have ignited a midsummer fund-raising frenzy. Capitol Hill town houses and association offices that serve as regular reception sites are booked solid, as are the Democratic and Republican clubs.
Fund-raising parties that insiders refer to politely as "events" take place morning, noon and night. Business representatives are being asked to do their share -- to the point where they report feeling besieged.
"I get e-mails, I get faxes, I get phone calls from members and from their staffs," said a lobbyist who said he fields up to a dozen pleas a day. "It is annoying."
Lawmakers make no apologies for the fund-raising activity or their reliance on business interests. 
"This is the political season, and people need to raise resources to get their message out," said John Feehery, a spokesman for House Speaker J. Dennis Hastert, Republican of Illinois, who was scheduled for one of his regular, $1,500 per guest breakfasts this week. "It is the nature of the business." 
Members of both parties say the conduct of a few corporate outlaws does not put businesses off limits as a source of campaign money. They also say that business leaders who follow the rules are eager to see corporate abuse end, because it tarnishes them all.
"I get support and have always gotten support from business," said Representative Mike Thompson, Democrat of California, who attended the Blue Dog reception. "There are good businesses run by good ethical business people from my hometown in St. Helena to St. Louis. There are just a few bad apples who have created a problem."
Tom Ochs, political director for the New Democrat Coalition, said his organization intended to draw on the resources of well-run businesses to back candidates who support sensible changes in donation laws.
"Because of what Enron did, does that mean you will not take any money from anybody who had anything to do with the utility business, the energy business?" asked Mr. Ochs, whose group will use its members, like Senators Joseph I. Lieberman of Connecticut and John B. Breaux of Louisiana, to star at a string of events for Democratic Senate candidates. "Of course not."
Critics say the financial ties between corporations and Congress have played a role in the current economic turmoil. But they say lawmakers refuse to curb their appetite for corporate backing.
"What you have in Washington these days is a total disconnect between the very tough rhetoric from our elected leaders on corporate accountability and their continued chase of huge sums of corporate and business contributions," said Fred Wertheimer of Democracy 21, a group advocating overhaul of campaign financing regulations. A recent report by the group said corporations and business leaders gave $1 billion in large soft money contributions to the two parties over the last decade, $636 million to Republicans and $449 million to Democrats.
Mr. Gephardt, of Missouri, who has much at stake in the next election because a swing of a few seats could make him speaker, has been working overtime on fund-raising, including the reception on Thursday at the Mayflower Hotel and a luncheon earlier that day. "Your resources will help us win races all over the country," he told a wine-sipping audience of 100 or so at the hotel.
Guests included representatives of the airline, high-tech and automotive industries, and Washington lobbyists with many corporate clients. Mr. Gephardt's office declined to provide a list of people who attended, but his campaign finance report as of June 30 showed recent contributions from communications, banking and finance, construction and real estate interests, among others. Aides said many of those gifts reflected money for the reception.
Aides also said Mr. Gephardt spent a total of about 24 hours near the end of June raising soft money for the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee, much of it from business executives. Earlier this month, aides said, Robert W. Pittman, the AOL-Time Warner executive who resigned on Thursday, held a fund-raiser at his Manhattan apartment for Mr. Gephardt.
Advisers to Mr. Gephardt reject any suggestion that his push for new business regulations should disqualify him from raising corporate donations. They say his agenda has drawn strong support from corporate officers. "What Mr. Gephardt and Democrats are saying is not anti-business, it is anticriminal behavior," said Erik Smith, his spokesman.
Signs suggest lawmakers are becoming increasingly concerned about their corporate connections. Some have returned or given to charity donations from companies like Enron and WorldCom that are at the center of the current maelstrom.
Democratic senators were stung recently when The Washington Post reported that shortly after voting on new corporate accounting standards, about a dozen senators flew on corporate jets to a Nantucket retreat for large contributors. The party said that it paid the companies $43,000 for the flights and that Republicans take corporate jets as well.
Representative Charles W. Pickering Jr., a Mississippi Republican who is in a tough race against a Democratic incumbent after redistricting, last week decided to cancel a fund-raising reception aboard a yacht after the campaign of his opponent, Representative Ronnie Shows, said it showed Mr. Pickering was out of touch with working people in Mississippi, where the collapse of corporate citizen WorldCom has taken a toll.
"It was a stupid idea from a hired fund-raiser," said Henry Barbour, a spokesman for Mr. Pickering.

HEADLINE: Rematch Produces Spirited Primary Race for Assembly Seat in Brooklyn 

BYLINE:  By JONATHAN P. HICKS

 BODY:
On any given morning, Hakeem S. Jeffries can be found at the entrance to one subway station or another in Brooklyn, handing out campaign literature and passionately explaining to anyone who will listen to what he considers the deficiencies of Assemblyman Roger L. Green, a 22-year incumbent whom Mr. Jeffries hopes to unseat.
 If Mr. Jeffries's portrayal of Mr. Green's record in the 57th Assembly District, which includes Fort Greene and Clinton Hill, seems well rehearsed, it is because he has spent the last two years relentlessly preparing for a rematch in a Democratic primary that is widely viewed as one of the most contentious contests of this year's legislative elections. 
 Two years ago, Mr. Green survived a strong challenge from Mr. Jeffries, a lawyer, who managed to win 41 percent of the vote in the primary, an unusually impressive showing for a political novice running against one of the Assembly's long-serving and most influential members. In the two years since that race, Mr. Jeffries, 31, has devoted a great deal of energy to organizing and preparing for this year's primary.
By all appearances, Mr. Green, 53, is taking nothing for granted this time around. He has enlisted the support of everyone from young people well known in the hip-hop world to the Brooklyn political establishment, which was very much on his side two years ago. And he has brought to his campaign Bill Lynch, the political strategist who managed both mayoral campaigns of David N. Dinkins.
As chairman of the state Black and Hispanic Legislative Caucus, Mr. Green is viewed as an eloquent spokesman for the concerns of residents of the state's urban areas. And he won praise in some quarters -- and condemnation in others -- for having taken a lead role in stymieing Rudolph W. Giuliani's efforts to get legislative approval to run for a third term as mayor.
In many respects, the themes highlighted by the two candidates are virtually unchanged from two years ago. Mr. Jeffries portrays Mr. Green as well intentioned, but insists that he has become a comfortable, ineffective career politician whose constituent service has become so lax that his staff members rarely return telephone calls.
"He is a man with absolutely no plan to address the some of the most pressing issues in the community, said Mr. Jeffries, who is on leave from the law firm of Paul, Weiss, Rifkind, Wharton & Garrison. "For example, he has no plan to address the inadequate performance of the public schools and the crisis of people being unable to afford housing. And there has been an utter lack of economic development in his 22 years in office."
Moreover, Mr. Jeffries asserts, Mr. Green's "office is legendary for a string of broken promises to constituents, missed meetings and un-returned phone calls that have piled up on top of each other during the last 22 years."
Mr. Green, meanwhile, who is also the chairman of the Assembly's Children and Families Committee, talks proudly of his education-related work, saying that his most significant achievements have been in that area, including development of the Benjamin Banneker Academy, a charter school on Clinton Avenue in Brooklyn that specializes in math, science and technology. His office proposed and designed the academy, Mr. Green said.
"The bottom line is that I have focused on those issues that I feel strongly about," Mr. Green said. "And those are education services and children and families."
At Banneker, he said, "98 percent of the students passed the language arts Regents exam, 100 percent passed the math and science exam."
"That's the school I started and wrote the proposal for with my own hands," he said. "I'm the only elected official that has ever built a school from the ground up."
Mr. Jeffries, Mr. Green said, has chosen to ignore the accomplishments of his 22 years of incumbency. "It's not his time yet," Mr. Green said of his opponent. "Because of the positions I have in the Assembly, we're now poised to do some serious things for the district, and we're already doing some important things."
More pointed barbs have already started flying in what promises to be hard-fought campaign. For example, Mr. Jeffries blames Mr. Green for redistricting changes that placed Mr. Jeffries's home one block outside the borders of the 57th Assembly District. "It was a desperate act by a career politician trying to save his government job," Mr. Jeffries said.
Mr. Green, meanwhile, insists that the district lines were shifted as part of an effort to remove some sections of the more affluent neighborhoods of Park Slope and Prospect Heights, where Mr. Jeffries lives, and make room for public housing complexes that would increase the number of black and Hispanic residents, thereby insuring that the district was protected under the federal Voting Rights Act. "I didn't even know where Hakeem lived," Mr. Green said.
As in 2000, Mr. Jeffries has marshaled a large group of young volunteers. And since then, he has become better known in the district and was involved in starting a political club, the Brooklyn Freedom Democratic Association.
With seven weeks left before the primary, Mr. Jeffries has raised about $55,000, roughly the total amount he spent in the 2000 campaign. Mr. Green said he has raised $40,000 and vowed to "raise and spend whatever it takes" to withstand this latest challenge.
"I plan to demonstrate that there is no truth to the notion that I'm vulnerable," Mr. Green said. "We're getting a lot of support. It would be different if I were really ineffective and feeble. But I'm in a position to be of real assistance to my constituents."

Iran Link and a Cover-Up Charged in 1994 Bombing
A witness in the case involving the bombing of the Argentine Jewish Mutual Aid Association in 1994 has said the Iranian government organized and carried out the attack and then paid Argentina's president at the time, Carlos Saul Menem, $10 million to cover it up. A1

Americans Shun Overseas Jobs
The State Department is having difficulty filling hardship posts overseas, as Americans shun jobs over security and lifestyle concerns. Sixty percent of American embassies and consulates are designated hardship posts for reasons ranging from security threats to poor hospitals to oppressive weather, and those missions report a vacancy rate 50 percent higher than in richer nations. A1

Israel Backs Off Deportations
Israel appears to be backing off from its plan to deport relatives of West Bank Palestinians accused of suicide bombings to the Gaza Strip. Prime Minister Ariel Sharon said the government would abide by the legal finding that only relatives found to be directly involved in supporting suicide bombers could be deported. A3

Turkey Warns Against Iraq War
Prime Minister Bulent Ecevit of Turkey warned that President Saddam Hussein of Iraq has the capability to put up a long fight. Turkey, a NATO ally whose support would be vital in any operation in Iraq, opposes American military intervention there. A5

U.N. Anti-Tobacco Plan

The View From the Vatican
Pope John Paul II will visit Canada for the Roman Catholic Church's World Youth Day. He has no plans to stop in the United States and address the concerns about sexual abuse by priests. To some American Catholics, that is bitterly disappointing and confusing. A3

Sri Lanka to Seek Support
Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe of Sri Lanka said the new awareness that the American-led campaign against terrorism has brought worldwide and new resolve in his own country may help end the civil war. Mr. Wickremesinghe said he would ask the Bush administration to consider an agreement to help rebuild the country's economy. A6

Plan for Security Agency Enters the Details Phase
The drive to create a Homeland Security Department is racing quickly through the legislative process. The bill closely mirrors President Bush's original proposal to merge 22 federal agencies into a single department. Now the most contentious issues will come to the forefront. A10

An Ideological Battle
President Bush wants to fill a federal appeals court seat with Priscilla Owen, a conservative judge from Texas with a strong record of opposing abortion rights. Senate Democrats and their liberal allies are certain to challenge Justice Owen's nomination, the latest in the continuing battles between Mr. Bush and the Democrats over the ideological shape of the federal courts. A10

Priests and Religious Orders
Leaders of the nation's 125 Roman Catholic religious orders will meet next month and confront the issue of what to do with sexually abusive priests who belong to religious orders, like the Jesuits, Franciscans and Benedictines. A9

More Money for Superfund
The Environmental Protection Agency has restored money to clean up 11 toxic dump sites under its Superfund program, after having previously told local officials that they would not receive any money this year, agency officials said. Still, many other sites may not receive money that regional officials have requested. A8

Child Care Gap
A new study says only one in seven parents is able to find a preschool or center-based care in California, even though spending for child care in the state has nearly quadrupled to $12 billion since 1996. A9

Tire Safety Concerns
Tire makers want the federal government to revisit a rule that requires tire-pressure warning lights in some new vehicles. The makers say the lights might fail to provide adequate warnings even when tire pressure is dangerously low. A13

Weekday Test Begins For Strained Power Grid
City officials are urging Con Ed customers across a large section of Lower Manhattan to use electricity sparingly today in an effort to prevent a power failure in the wake of Saturday's major explosion and fire at an electrical transformer on the East River. A1

The Passaic Comeback
The Passaic River, once considered the finest rowing river in the Northeast, is poised for a rebirth. With most offending industries gone, the water quality is improving. Up and down the river, cities and suburban towns that used to treat the Passaic like a toilet are planning waterfront promenades and parks. B1

Caught Here and in Ghana
Data Management Internationale, a Delaware firm that has been digitizing information for New York City since March, sends some of its work to a back office in Ghana. That means just days after tickets have been written out on New York streets, they are sent as digital photographs to computers in downtown Accra, Ghana's capital, where workers try to transcribe the handwritten scrawl of New York police officers into searchable databases.

The Push for Clean Cars
California's push for zero-emission vehicles could soon force automakers to sell more than 100,000 electric cars and other highly fuel-efficient vehicles in the state each year. That immediate concern has overshadowed a bill requiring automakers to cut carbon dioxide emissions by 2008 and has prompted them to spend billions of dollars developing new technologies. A1

HEADLINE: Ulster Catholics' Clout 

 BODY:
To the Editor:
 For an American who has visited Belfast frequently, there are striking parallels between the conflict in Northern Ireland and the American civil rights movement. 
 You report on Northern Irish Protestants' "growing feeling of precariousness in the land they once dominated" (front page, July 18). 
This is similar to the resentment of some whites in the United States as blacks first made political gains.
What Northern Irish Protestants resent is the the success of Catholic community organizing. Thirty years of struggle have trained Catholics in the democratic skills necessary to promote their equality and economic development. Protestants, long the beneficiaries of sectarianism, never had to do this. Now they feel powerless because Catholics are active citizens.

HEADLINE: ON THE GROUND: In Phoenix; 
Technology and Rapid Growth in the Valley of the Sun

BYLINE:  By MARK A. STEIN 

 BODY:
Phoenix is the leading contender to become the home of the International Genomics Center, a collaborative effort by industry and universities to use the human genome to find cures for specific cancers. City leaders say that winning the nationwide contest to be the host of the center will make Phoenix a major locus for genetic research.
 That, in turn, could accelerate the city's rapid growth. In the last decade, Phoenix passed Dallas, Detroit and San Diego to become the nation's sixth-largest city, and is closing in on Philadelphia. The metropolitan area, 15th largest in the United States, includes 5 of the country's 20 fastest-growing cities: Glendale, Scottsdale, Chandler, Gilbert and Peoria. 
 The Valley of the Sun, as the area is known, is the third-largest semiconductor manufacturing area in the country and has the biggest concentration of call centers -- 173 and counting, according to the Greater Phoenix Economic Council. It is also home to four Fortune 500 companies: Avnet, Allied Waste Industries, Pinnacle West and Phelps Dodge.
A car is the easiest way around. For people who do not drive, try ExecuCar, a business-class car service (888-473-9227)

HOTELS
Many business travelers recommend the BILTMORE (602-955-6600, $175 to $1,425) as much for its Frank Lloyd Wright-inspired architecture as for the 24-hour business center and other services. "If I was coming to Phoenix, knowing what I know, I'd only stay at the Biltmore," said Allen Maag, chief communications officer for Avnet. Like all hotels here, the price of rooms moves inversely to the temperature.
Phoenix and Scottsdale have long been tourist destinations with outdoor activities like golf and indoor luxuries like spas, and many hotels compete to outpamper guests. The CAMELBACK INN (480-948-1700, $149 to $470), a Marriott hotel, has data ports in every room for work -- and several suites with private swimming pools for relaxation. It also has two 18-hole golf courses. "It's like a summer camp for adults," said Maureen E. O'Toole, vice president of Salomon Smith Barney in New York who often travels to Phoenix.
In the same league is the PHOENICIAN (480-941-8200, $179 to $729), a Starwood property with 654 rooms (each with a data port), golf, tennis and nine swimming pools. Among its seven restaurants is Mary Elaine's, one of the best in the city. "It has great service and wonderful amenities," said Armando Flores, executive vice president for business services at Pinnacle West.
Smaller and a bit more intimate is the ROYAL PALMS (602-840-3610, $99 to $505). "Some of our regulars -- employees who come back and back and back on business -- prefer the Royal Palms because it's got that smaller elegance that makes them feel more at home," said David Birk, senior vice president and general counsel for Avnet.

RESTAURANTS
GREGORY'S WORLD BISTRO (480-946-8700, $110 for dinner for two with wine) has the most inventive menu -- with dishes that have included salmon ceviche with white-bean hummus; apple-crusted, pan-roasted sturgeon; and a wild-mushroom pierogi in a caviar cream sauce -- and attentive service. It is open only for dinner in the summer, and is closed on Sundays.
DON & CHARLIE'S AMERICAN RIB AND CHOP HOUSE (480-990-0900, $60) has a name that sums up its Southwestern barbecue menu but gives no hint of its extraordinary sports-themed decor, a favorite of major league ballplayers during spring training. "The most sports memorabilia in any one place west of Cooperstown," Mr. Maag said.
Near the Arizona State University campus in Tempe is HOUSE OF TRICKS (480-968-1114, $70), where fresh fish and chops are served to the sound of a gurgling fountain in the landscaped courtyard of a 1920's cottage. Closed on Sundays.

ENTERTAINMENT
The best place for casual conversation is the lobby bar of the Royal Palms, a lovely and comfortable room with generous cocktails. For a good view, there is plenty of competition, from the TOP OF THE ROCK (602-431-2370) at the Wyndham Buttes Resort to the revolving COMPASS restaurant (602-440-3166) atop the Hyatt Regency downtown. But the best may be the WRIGLEY MANSION CLUB (602-955-4079) on Camelback Mountain; it operates as a private club to conform to zoning regulations but anyone can join on the spot for $10 a year.
For music, try the RHYTHM ROOM (602-265-4842), which offers a regular schedule of live blues, jazz and country music. For a taste of the Old West, there is RAWHIDE (480-502-1880), a kitschy but entertaining reconstruction of a frontier town circa 1885.

ON YOUR OWN
Of several museums of Native American culture, the best known is the HEARD MUSEUM (602-252-8848), which recently added 50,000 square feet of exhibition space. It is now showing paintings and sculpture by leading artists of the Native American Fine Art Movement.
The DESERT BOTANICAL GARDEN (480-941-1225) has one of the world's largest and most diverse collection of desert plants. The garden stays open late and is lighted to allow cool nighttime strolls in the summer.
The Grand Canyon is too distant for a day trip, but OAK CREEK CANYON near Sedona (the local tourist bureau is at 928-282-7722) is only about two hours away, straight up Interstate 17. The best hike is along the heavily wooded west fork of Oak Creek, cool in summer and bursting with color in the fall.
For the best buys on turquoise jewelry: the shops of OLD TOWN in Scottsdale.

LOCAL LORE
Don't be alarmed by the sight of an armed man outside a bank. Arizona law lets people carry firearms, and many choose to do so in a holster strapped to their hip, Old West-style.
Phoenix is a diverse city in a uniquely Southwestern way. Not only are about a third of the residents of Hispanic descent, but Phoenix has the largest population of Native Americans of any big city.

HEADLINE: Back to the Drawing Board 

BYLINE:  By Susan S. Szenasy; Susan S. Szenasy, editor in chief of Metropolis magazine, is a co-founder of R.Dot (Rebuild Downtown Our Town) and a teacher of design history and ethics at Parsons School of Design.

 BODY:
The six plans proposed for rebuilding the World Trade Center site in Lower Manhattan go on display tomorrow in Federal Hall at Wall and Nassau Streets. In this historic place, where George Washington took the oath as our first president, visitors can study the proposals drawn up by the Lower Manhattan Development Corporation and the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey. Both these organizations -- having been treated to worldwide editorial derision since the plans became available last week, plus a day of public contempt (live at the Javits Center) on the weekend -- have decided to rethink their efforts. It isn't hard to see why.
 Each of the six schemes is dominated by an office park that could be anywhere --tall buildings arrayed in either L or U shapes. Each plan has similarly massive retail spaces, calling to mind the suburban shopping malls along any highway service road. And each scheme offers up some space for a memorial to the victims of Sept. 11. The word memorial is on all the plans, showing that the planners see the need to remember our day of great loss and destruction. Or perhaps they're putting this word out front because all their plans are dedicated mainly to the financial obligations of the current lease holders for 11 million square feet of office space, 600,000 square feet of retail space and a 600,000-square-foot hotel. 
 Those who visit Federal Hall or log on to www.renewnyc.org will get an opportunity to study the plans in some detail, including bird's-eye views of Lower Manhattan spinning around. It's easy to be seduced by the technology. But you'll get over it quickly, as did the more than 4,000 people, mostly area residents and workers, who attended the town hall meeting at the Javits Center on Saturday. We were seated 10 to a table, forming a skeptical and wary crowd. Those in charge assured us they wanted our feedback. That's what the wireless keypads were for. By the end of the long day, there were signs that the "decision makers," as the men in charge of rebuilding were called, realized that the original program needed some reassessment. Probably the two most common comments were "timid" and "boring."
For those of us who believe in the power of informed planning and inspired architecture, what we saw was especially disturbing. Is it possible that our city's robust architecture offices -- the firms who worked on the plans were Beyer Blinder Belle, Architects and Planners; Peterson/Littenberg Architects; Skidmore, Owings & Merrill; and Cooper, Robertson & Partners -- can only come up with such anemic proposals?
Ever since I first saw the plans at the Lower Manhattan Development Corporation office last week, and again as I walked away from the Javits Center on Saturday, one thought kept going through my head. It had to do with ethical professional behavior, with how architects and planners view their obligations and responsibilities. The Lower Manhattan and Port Authority planners understood their obligation in the narrow sense: to serve their clients, forgetting their larger obligation to the people of New York. While they made much of designing for the millions who are expected to visit the memorial, they neglected the men, women and children who live and work and go to school and play in the area now and will do so in the future.
Most significantly, the planners left out residential buildings from the site. Housing, the lifeblood of any city neighborhood, was not requested by the clients. But these planners and architects are professionals who understand the facts of urban life very well. They're learned people who know that it is many individuals, going about their daily lives, who animate the streets and create the vitality that cities like New York exude. By keeping a narrow focus, they designed a place that would almost have to seem desolate.
Ultimately, would their clients be happy with such sterility? Will such a space attract the tenants they want? Will there be enough jobs to fill all those millions of square feet as computerization continues to change the places and the ways of work?
Thinking about these six tentative plans and the surprisingly loud and consistent cries of disappointment that greeted them, I wondered if we have lost our knack for bringing together big bucks with big ideas. In earlier generations, planners had the gumption and the vision to build grand and memorable public projects like the Brooklyn Bridge, the Lincoln Tunnel and Rockefeller Center. Are we at the end of our creative run? Have we reached a moment when we are capable of designing only bland office parks and lightly nostalgic shopping malls? If so, we better snap out of it and fast. We can start in lower Manhattan.
New Yorkers expect a 21st century city to rise from the ashes of the twin towers and connect with the historic city. We need a "high-tech Machu Picchu," someone said at our table in the Javits Center.
Our culture has so many talented architects and planners, both within the large, established companies and at younger firms. When will we start asking them to help us imagine our future? We need designs that will truly revive and support our economy and satisfy our dreams for a world-class metropolis. These architects and designers need planners who are skilled at analyzing demographic and economic trends and who can use this information to create a realistic plan on which to build.
There are many ways to honor those who turned to dust, and those who were forever scarred, on that horrible day last September. While we must build a memorial for them -- and a burial ground for those whose remains were never found -- the most respectful memorial to the future our lost New Yorkers might have had will be a beautiful new city rising from that 16-acre hole in the ground. This architectural masterpiece will become the hopeful place that people are so desperately asking for, a place worthy of being a pilgrimage site.

HEADLINE: Turkish Party Balks at Call From Premier To Delay Vote 

BYLINE:  By DANIEL SIMPSON 

DATELINE: ISTANBUL, July 22 

 BODY:
The biggest party in Turkey's fragile governing coalition threatened today to bring down the government unless Prime Minister Bulent Ecevit stuck to an agreement to hold early elections in November.
 Mr. Ecevit, who is 77 and in poor health, was forced last week to agree to call the elections after defections by half his party's lawmakers caused the government to lose its majority in Parliament. But he said over the weekend that he might change his mind. 
 He urged political rivals, including former supporters who have quit to form a new party, to back him for the sake of Turkey's stability -- an issue that is also of concern to the United States as it considers whether to attack neighboring Iraq.
But Mr. Ecevit's coalition partners gave short shrift to his appeal to postpone elections until next spring at the earliest.
Devlet Bahceli, the deputy prime minister, said he would pull his Nationalist Action Party out of Mr. Ecevit's government if he tried to remain in power beyond Nov. 3, the date tentatively set for the election.
"A development like this would invite a crisis situation," Mr. Bahceli said. He warned that political uncertainty could have a destabilizing effect on financial markets because it could jeopardize a $16 billion International Monetary Fund bailout for Turkey's troubled economy.
"If elections are postponed or if conditions emerge that would make it impossible for them to be held, it will be impossible for us to carry on in the government," he said.
His threat increases pressure on Mr. Ecevit, but would mean little in practice at this stage unless lawmakers from other parties agree to recall Parliament from its summer recess.
An attempt by opposition parties to summon members for a vote on the election date failed today because too few showed up for the motion to be debated.
Although most parties favor an early election, many politicians believe it is even more important to enact the civil rights reforms that are needed to make Turkey eligible for European Union membership by the time the group holds a summit meeting in December.
Ismail Cem, the former foreign minister, is among those focusing on the rights issues. He has grouped fellow defectors from Mr. Ecevit's camp under the umbrella of his New Turkey Party, which he formally introduced today.
Mr. Bahceli's party, which has replaced Mr. Ecevit's as the largest in a three-way coalition, opposes moves to expand the civil rights of Turkey's Kurdish population and to abolish the death penalty.
Politicians are now scrambling to form new alliances that would allow the legislation to be passed, along with economic reforms required by the International Monetary Fund.
A new parliamentary session to debate the election date and some of these new laws is scheduled for Monday, but political analysts question whether it will take place unless a new consensus emerges.
"Everything is still up in the air," said Ilter Turan, a political scientist at Bilgi University in Istanbul.

HEADLINE: Population-Control Politics 

 BODY:
There is a mind-bending illogic behind the Bush administration's decision yesterday to withhold $34 million from the United Nations Population Fund, which is working in China despite continued practices there of coerced abortion and sterilization. It is precisely because of China's reprehensible policies that the U.N. presence is important. Cutting off funds to the agency is an inexcusable sop to right-wing anti-abortion activists in an election year. It will increase the number of abortions worldwide by depriving poor women of the education and help they need and that the U.N. agency provides. 
 The U.N. Population Fund is the world's biggest agency focused on women's reproductive health and the only serious external force in China trying to change the way local officials hold down population growth. Last year Secretary of State Colin Powell praised its "invaluable work." Faced with accusations that the agency was complicit in Chinese misdeeds, the administration sent in a study team in May. It found no evidence that the fund knowingly supports or participates in any Chinese program that coerces abortion or sterilization. It recommended that the $34 million requested by Congress for the agency last year be released. 
 Instead, the administration refused yesterday to do so because of China's continuing birth-control practices. This means that some 12.5 percent of the agency's budget is now wiped out and that vital and worthy programs like midwife training in Algeria and a new AIDS center in Haiti are suddenly without funding they need.
The administration says it will give the $34 million instead to the Child Survival and Health Program Fund, part of the State Department's Agency for International Development. The problem is that that agency cannot duplicate the work of the U.N., which operates in dozens of countries where the United States has no aid presence. Reproductive health and freedom of women are central to the improvement of poor societies. The U.N. Population Fund is one of the most important forces at work today helping poor women. The United States should be supporting it, not undermining it.

HEADLINE: Washington Mayor's Campaign Is Its Own Worst Enemy 

BYLINE:  By FRANCIS X. CLINES 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, July 22 

 BODY:
Mayor Anthony A. Williams, the supposedly nonpolitical, definitely nonflamboyant technocrat who delivered the capital city from the chronic embarrassment of the Marion Barry years, is suddenly learning harsh lessons about the political nuts and bolts of re-election. 
 The mayor is considered a shoo-in for a second term with no opponent daring to step forward, but hapless political aides have botched the ritual task of gathering 2,000 signatures to certify his unchallenged position on the Democratic line in this overwhelmingly Democratic city. 
 Thus, Mr. Williams -- a tight-laced management specialist who replaced the Barry flair for partying with his own C.E.O. bow tie of civic probity -- faces the possibility of being ruled off the Democratic line as city election officials begin looking into accusations of forgeries in his petition drive. 
If the city's Board of Elections and Ethics rejects enough signatures, the mayor could be left in the position of running as a Democratic write-in or independent candidate and fighting for the $1.4 million in financing he has collected as a Democratic candidate.
Even as they concede the mayor is still unlikely to lose, his critics are chortling as they pore over a flood of curious signatures of supposed district Democrats. These include nonresidents and non-Democrats ranging from Billy Joel, the far-off New York singer, to Donald H. Rumsfeld, the Republican secretary of defense. 
Some petition gatherers have already admitted they did not witness the signatures, as the law requires. Newspaper inquiries found pages of signatures in suspiciously similar handwriting with such eye-catching standouts as a name signed in backward fashion, "Kimsey, James," at 1700 Pennsylvania Avenue. 
Mr. Kimsey, a founder of America Online, has a foundation at that address but is a Virginia resident who did not sign a Williams petition. 
"We found Tony Blair, Martha Stewart, Kofi Annan of the U.N., Kelsey Grammer from 'Frazier,' people like that," said Betsy W. Werronen, the city's Republican leader.
Ms. Werronen prompted the inquiry in a sleepy electoral year in which her party, like the Democrats themselves, had not been able to produce a challenger to the mayor.
Ms. Werronen normally goes unnoticed in this city, which has 77 percent Democratic party registration. But she bothered to check into the fine print of the mayor's petition papers after his campaign filed 10,240 signatures, more than five times the necessary number -- gathered at the fee of $1 a name. 
"That's huge for this city; the enormity rang a bell," said Ms. Werronen, a former Republican staff member with the Senate and the Reagan administration.
"We started flipping through the petitions and found page after page filled out in the same handwriting. It's amazing," she said, contending that one-party rule had produced an "arrogance of power" at City Hall.
Mayor Williams pronounced himself "nauseated" by the petition flap and vowed to fire those responsible. At the same time, he hired a brace of lawyers to challenge the constitutionality of the city's election law and the fairness of the petition checking process.
"Voting rights fundamental to the core of our democracy have greater weight than mistakes or wrongful acts of a few," the mayor declared as his office said he would concede that perhaps 4,000 signatures were invalid but expected to prevail with 6,000 valid ones.
But Dorothy Brizill, executive director of DC Watch, a nonpolitical watchdog group, maintained that the mayor, rather than rooting out the problem, had compounded it by blaming others and mounting a legal fight.
"This is very, very serious election fraud that goes to the heart of what a democracy is," said Ms. Brizill, a longtime critic of Mr. Williams. "Unfortunately the mayor is reacting with the same high-handedness and arrogance he shows in running the district government. He's a man in denial."
The mayor's spokesman, Tony Bullock, said Mr. Williams trusted the petition task to "some people who failed him miserably." No major incumbent can see to each line of the petition process, Mr. Bullock said, noting that the mayor would name a new campaign director this week.
"Arrogance is just not the case," Mr. Bullock insisted. "If anything the mayor is a man of a thousand mea culpas." 
In Mr. Williams's first months in office, the biggest complaint from his critics was that his style was boring. Some residents spoke of missing the caperings of Mayor Barry, whose political downfall came in a headlined drug scandal.
But Mr. Williams's steadfast executive style since he took office in 1999 has impressed large parts of the city, particularly in the predominantly white northwest quarter. He also built strong support in the business community during a period of economic growth. 
"He was elected because he's not Marion Barry," complained Mark Plotkin, a political commentator for WTOP radio who is one of Mr. Williams's most relentless critics.
"But it turns out he can't even manage a campaign. The guy's Chauncey Gardiner," Mr. Plotkin said, alluding to the film "Being There" and its simple-minded hero who stumbles to popularity.
The petition inquiry may be most interesting in the fact that not even the mayor's worst critic is predicting that Mayor Williams can lose.
"At the end of the day, this is an embarrassment," said Mr. Bullock, the mayoral spokesman. "But it has a shelf life that's pretty well over. It's a bump in the road." 
Ms. Werronen disagreed. "The mayor could win re-election running on stickers," she said. "But that's not the point."

CORRECTION-DATE: July 26, 2002

 CORRECTION:
An article on Tuesday about accusations of forgeries in the petition drive for the re-election of Anthony A. Williams as mayor of Washington misspelled the name of the television show that stars Kelsey Grammer, whose name was among those that drew scrutiny to the signatures. It is "Frasier," not "Frazier."

HEADLINE: THE MARKETS; 
Demand Up for Treasury Bonds

BYLINE:  By Bloomberg News 

 BODY:
Treasury prices rose for a third day yesterday as a decline in stocks fueled demand for government securities. 
 "A 4.5 percent yield on the 10-year Treasury is a heck of a lot better than minus 20 to 30 percent for stocks," said Steven Bohlin, who helps manage $1.8 billion at Thornburg Investment Management in Santa Fe, N.M. 
 Investors have added money to bond mutual funds at the fastest pace since 1986.
They added a record $18 billion to bond mutual funds in June, with most of the money going into government and investment-grade corporate bond funds, according to Lipper Inc., a fund-tracking firm. 
The yield on the Treasury's 10-year note dropped yesterday to 4.45 percent, from 4.52 percent Friday, as the price rose 20/32, to 103 10/32.
Yield on the 30-year note dropped to 5.28 percent, from 5.32 percent Friday, as the price rose 21/32, to 101 14/32.
Following are the results of yesterday's Treasury auction of three- and six-month bills:

HEADLINE: SPORTS BUSINESS; 
About 3.6 Million to Be Taken Out to Ballgames in the Bronx

BYLINE:  By Richard Sandomir 

 BODY:
For those who believe the Yankees have too much of everything, consider this exasperating news: they are on a pace to attract nearly 3.6 million fans to the Bronx, more than any other team in major league baseball.
 This is happening during a recession, amid the fear of a work stoppage and in the face of a 5.7 percent drop in attendance throughout baseball. 
 Lately, Yankees fans have been flooding Yankee Stadium as if there were no other place to visit in New York City. For the last five games (two against Detroit, three against Boston), attendance has averaged 54,091. An average of 51,056 fans have attended the last 20 games. The average is more than the capacity for all those newfangled ballparks in Cleveland, Baltimore, Seattle, Detroit, Texas, Pittsburgh or Denver. 
Through 50 home games, the Yankees have drawn 2.19 million fans, which is 161,520, or 7.9 percent, more than last season at the same time.
Only Arizona (up 312,484), which is benefiting from winning the World Series, and the Dodgers (up 166,688), have had bigger increases.
For the Yankees, 3.6 million fans would eclipse a team record of 3.29 million set in 1999. That level seemed to form a plateau: in 2000, attendance dropped to 3.22 million; last season, it rose a bit to 3.26 million.
Of course, reaching three million for the first time in 1999 seemed like a miracle. The Yankees had never done it, but the Mets had, in 1987 and 1988. In the mid-1990's, George Steinbrenner simultaneously scorned (and overstated) the dangerous and unsanitary conditions in the Bronx while wondering why the Seattle Mariners continuously beat the Yankees at the gate.
The Yankees now lead the American League in attendance -- a distinction they have not reached during their current dynastic era -- and lead Seattle by an average of 745 fans a game. The team has climbed from seventh place in A.L. attendance in 1996 to third from 1998 to 2000 to second last year.
Still, why is attendance up nearly 8 percent this year? Is this team that much more alluring than last year's or the ones before that? It is partly a cumulative effect: winning begets fans, and winning as often as the Yankees do spawns more fans. 
"The key point is that George Steinbrenner continues to reinvest in his product, and fans identify with his commitment to winning," Randy Levine, the team's president, said. "We lost the World Series and he went out and signed Jason Giambi."
Levine said the team had also worked to improve security and cleanliness at the stadium and did not raise ticket or concession prices this season.
Mike Lane, the managing editor of Team Marketing Report, an industry publication, added: "Sometimes the reason is very simple: they're putting out a great product, in a great stadium with a great team."
Here are some other possible explanations: 
*A marquee player like Giambi provides a box-office lift to a team that has not been known for slugging but now leads baseball in home runs. The astonishing maturation of Alfonso Soriano, especially as a power hitter, has changed the image of a team to more suitably fit its Bronx Bombers moniker.
*Interleague play this year brought an attendance jolt. The nine home games averaged 52,621, 18 percent better than the 44,615 last year. The sole reason was that one of the three series was against San Francisco, which drew 165,602 fans, and not against Montreal, which drew 88,300 last year. The series against the Mets this year drew only 400 more than last year's, while this season's Arizona series attracted nearly 6,000 fewer fans than the Atlanta series last year.
*Fans do not want to miss out on the Yankee experience, as if the team were a not-to-be-missed ride at a fabulous theme park. Deborah Tymon, the team's vice president for marketing, said fans frustrated by their inability to buy tickets for games that sell out quickly against the strongest teams like Boston are more willing than ever to trade down to a lesser team like Detroit (which drew 54,725 for last Wednesday's day game, and 49,116 the next night).
*Strategic placement of promotional giveaways. The team has maintained standard promotions like bat and cap days, joined in the bobblehead doll craze and became part of the growing Celebriduck trend last Wednesday night against Detroit when 18,000 pinstriped, floatable, soft nylon, beaked Giambi bathtub waterfowl were given away.
"It's like the table was set for us by Beanie Babies and bobbleheads," said Craig Wolfe, the president of Celebriducks, which will return to the Bronx on Sept. 23 for the Tampa Bay-Yankees game with Babe Ruth bath ducks. "This kind of promotion has to be responsible for an increased attendance because I can't fathom a full house for a midweek against against the Tigers."
Last Thursday afternoon, the Giambi ducks were followed by Bernie Williams bobbleheads. 
How many extra fans are drawn by such promotions is uncertain, but Tymon said: "People want to choose a game to attend. They want a family outing where children can get something they might not be able to get anyplace else, so they can get the most bang from their buck."

HEADLINE: WORLDCOM'S COLLAPSE: THE OVERVIEW; 
Extra Level of Scrutiny in WorldCom Bankruptcy

BYLINE:  By SIMON ROMERO with RIVA D. ATLAS 

 BODY:
The Justice Department asked the federal judge overseeing the WorldCom bankruptcy proceeding yesterday to appoint an independent examiner to investigate the company, a move that would increase scrutiny of its business practices.
 Because it is unusual for such examiners to be appointed, bankruptcy experts said that the request could signal that the government wanted to widen the investigations already under way into WorldCom's accounting practices. 
 The Justice Department is already conducting its own investigation, as is the Securities and Exchange Commission, the House Energy and Commerce Committee and WorldCom's board. Those inquiries were set off by WorldCom's disclosure late in June that it had improperly accounted for more than $3.8 billion of expenses, masking losses as profits. The disclosure had brought WorldCom to the brink of financial collapse before the company filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection on Sunday night. 
Judge Arthur J. Gonzalez of United States Bankruptcy Court in Manhattan, who is overseeing the WorldCom case, agreed to the idea of an examiner yesterday during a hearing for the company and its creditors. An examiner will be nominated by Carolyn Schwartz, the United States trustee who is representing the government in the WorldCom proceedings. The nominee would then require the approval of Judge Gonzalez.
The examiner would have wide discretion to investigate transactions at WorldCom. Compared with the Justice Department's investigators, he or she would have more leeway in sidestepping attorney-client privilege, allowing questions to WorldCom's own lawyers, and on directors' discussions with lawyers, according to bankruptcy experts.
"This could signal a real lack of confidence in current management," said John C. Siemers, a lawyer at Burr, Pease & Kurtz in Anchorage, who has served as an examiner in other bankruptcy proceedings. "Appointing an examiner is an expensive move that means there is a lot of suspicion about dealings that may have gone on or may still be going on at the company."
The fees for an examiner would be paid from the assets of WorldCom, which agreed with the Justice Department's request for an examiner. WorldCom's lead bankruptcy lawyer, Marcia L. Goldstein, a partner at Weil, Gotshal & Manges, said the company welcomed the opportunity to work with an examiner. "The company didn't object because the company has been cooperating with a number of investigations," Ms. Goldstein said. 
According to court papers, the examiner could hand over findings from its inquiry to the S.E.C. or the Justice Department if asked to do so. The examiner has 90 days after his or her appointment, which is expected in about a week, to report any findings to the bankruptcy judge.
While the request for an examiner was unusual, it was not unexpected, given that WorldCom's bankruptcy filing is the largest in United States history and stems from what may have been one of the largest fraudulent accounting maneuvers. WorldCom listed $107 billion of assets and $41 billion of debt in its filing, far outstripping big recent bankruptcies of companies like Enron and Global Crossing.
What did come as a surprise to some experts was the Justice Department's moving so quickly to seek an examiner after the WorldCom filing on Sunday night. After Enron filed for bankruptcy protection last fall, for example, officials waited five months to seek an examiner.
The quicker action here could signal that federal officials now want to appear more assertive in containing accounting irregularities like those at WorldCom, according to William J. Rochelle III, a bankruptcy expert at the law firm of Fulbright & Jaworski in New York. 
Certainly that was the impression the Justice Department sought to convey. "This action will provide transparency to the process and enhance accountability," Attorney General John Ashcroft said yesterday. "In turn, this should increase public confidence in the conduct of the case and help preserve value and protect the creditors and shareholders, including small creditors and those whose pension funds are invested in WorldCom."
At yesterday's hearing, WorldCom's lawyer, Ms. Goldstein, said the company had only $200 million in cash as of the close of business last Friday. She said that unless the court quickly approved the plan for so-called debtor-in-possession financing from WorldCom's lenders, "the company could not continue to operate" because it and its United States subsidiaries had an estimated $200 million in weekly payments they must make to other telecommunications companies.
Under debtor-in-possession financing, the lenders who provide the money for continuing operations are first in line among creditors with claims on the company's assets.
In a feebly air-conditioned courtroom, Judge Gonzalez gave preliminary approval for financing of up to $2 billion. The room was packed with lawyers, creditors and reporters, as well as some of WorldCom's senior executives. Its chief executive, John W. Sidgmore, sat with Michael H. Salsbury, the general counsel, and Susan Mayer, WorldCom's treasurer, in the rear. 
"I don't know much about these things," Mr. Sidgmore said during a brief recess. He said the company had asked him to be present, possibly at the request of the judge. 
One investor attending the hearing said before it started that it was highly unusual for a chief executive to show up at a bankruptcy court hearing. "C.E.O.'s usually don't want to be photographed in bankruptcy court," he remarked. 
The small amount of cash remaining on WorldCom's balance sheet could be partly explained by the difficulties the company had obtaining financing in the days leading up to the bankruptcy filing. 
"Vendors tightened credit or declined to extend terms" after WorldCom disclosed its accounting problems last month, Ms. Goldstein said. WorldCom had also used cash to provide additional funds to its 200 foreign subsidiaries, which did not file for bankruptcy, she said.
Yesterday morning, Mr. Sidgmore, who took over as chief executive late in April after the resignation of Bernard J. Ebbers, said at a news conference that he hoped for WorldCom to emerge from bankruptcy by the first quarter of next year. He repeated his preference for not breaking up the company or selling its core assets, including the long-distance carrier MCI and the Internet backbone company UUNet, during the bankruptcy proceedings. 
Separately, Michael K. Powell, chairman of the Federal Communications Commission, repeated his concern that WorldCom avert service disruptions during its bankruptcy proceedings. In a letter yesterday to Mr. Sidgmore, Mr. Powell said, "We will intervene in bankruptcy proceedings to advise the court if WorldCom or any other party to the proceedings takes or threatens to take steps that would result in an unnoticed termination of service."
Mr. Powell also reminded Mr. Sidgmore that if WorldCom's bankruptcy filing resulted in a restructuring or sale of its assets, such moves required F.C.C. approval.

11 Die in Israeli Airstrike On House of Hamas Leader
An Israeli warplane fired a missile into the home of a top leader of the militant group in Gaza City, killing at least 11 people, including several children, and wounding more than 100, Hamas and hospital officials in Gaza said. Israel said it had killed the leader, Sheik Salah Shehada, a founder of the military wing of Hamas and one of Israel's most wanted men, but a senior Hamas political leader said the sheik had survived.

Israeli security officials reached a deal with a leading Palestinian moderate, Sari Nusseibeh, to allow him to reopen his office in Jerusalem. A8

G.I.'s to Guard Afghan Leader
American soldiers, including Special Forces, will move into the presidential palace in Kabul and take over responsibility for President Hamid Karzai's security. A vice president was assassinated this month. A1

HEADLINE: Even Critics Say Some Designs For Downtown Aren't So Bad 

BYLINE:  By EDWARD WYATT 

 BODY:
Even as the six initial designs for the rebuilding of the World Trade Center site have come under fire in the past week as unimaginative, certain design elements appear to have captured the imagination of a diverse public audience.
 The idea of a memorial promenade stretching to Battery Park, providing impressive views throughout its length of those other American landmarks, the Statue of Liberty and Ellis Island, was widely admired. It added memorial space away from the actual trade center site, and so was seen as an innovative response to the recognized need to include some large commercial buildings on the site. 
 The designers' clear priority to keep intact the footprints of the twin towers as open spaces within the site itself has also won significant favor among citizens and planners. 
One of the very clear messages also being sent to officials in charge of the rebuilding was a call for an impressive addition to the skyline, something that recaptures the outsized voice with which the World Trade Center shouted, "This is New York."
These ideas came into focus in town-hall-style meetings Saturday and yesterday attended by a wide range of participants, a total of more than 4,000 people, including citizens who rarely if ever give a thought to urban planning, as well as the architects, design professionals and others who have worked for months on ideas for the repair and rebuilding of Lower Manhattan.
As a result, "what emerged was the possibility of using open space as a starting point for a discussion of how everything, both above ground and below, ties together," said Fredric M. Bell, the executive director of the New York chapter of the American Institute of Architects.
Rather than being discouraged by the rather negative reaction that the six initial plans received, the architects and planners said they appreciated the intensity of the discussion about subjects that are normally far removed from public scrutiny.
"People are talking about design, and they're doing it thoughtfully and unselfishly," John Beyer, a principal at Beyer Blinder Belle, the architecture and planning firm that had overall responsibility for the six designs, said at Saturday's meeting. 
"This is an affirmation that people want to do the best job possible," he said. "This expression of creative ideas, though many of them are contradictory, is likely to have a strong influence on what may happen."
Planning officials noted with pleasure that relatively few people have talked about keeping the entire 16-acre site free of commercial development. 
In the months soon after the Sept. 11 attacks, that idea was expressed rather often. 
On Saturday and again yesterday, New Yorkers and others attending the meetings at the Jacob K. Javits Convention Center in Manhattan told planners that the development of the site must serve more than the commercial interests that have a stake in the 16-acre site.
Among the most widely supported recommendations were establishing a more diverse array of businesses downtown, providing housing for people with a broader range of incomes, and creating more cultural opportunities that will attract both new residents and tourism.
To a significant extent, the priorities set out over the last week by the public echoed the design principles in the blueprint released in April by the Lower Manhattan Development Corporation.
"The plans are meant to show what were previously abstract concepts in some type of context," Matthew Higgins, a spokesman for the development corporation, said yesterday. 
Those general concepts, like the restoration of the street grid, or the burying of West Street, are included in models of the six designs in an exhibit at Federal Hall on Wall Street that is to open this week.
Design professionals as well as citizens also said that site planners must step back and rethink the foundations of their plans.
"Looking at these plans made me dizzy," said Mark Rothman, 39, a Los Angeles resident who traveled to New York to participate in yesterday's meeting, which was attended by about 200 people who could not attend the Saturday session. "There really isn't sufficient diversity between the six plans." 
Mr. Rothman and others at the meetings were clearly drawn to the plan titled "Memorial Promenade." In addition to models of ground zero buildings, it included a grand boulevard stretching from a teardrop-shaped park at the trade center site southward to Battery Park.
The plan creates a large amount of new open space by putting express lanes of West Street underground at Vesey Street. 
Local traffic continues above ground, but at the sides of a broad green space that, like the Washington Mall, has plenty of room for benches and quiet conversation. 
Michael Alicia, 42, a resident of Chelsea, said at yesterday's meeting that when most of West Street was removed, "even though the new area was just the width of the highway, the whole space got bigger."
"You need that," he added, "particularly if you're going to go ahead with tall buildings there."
The Memorial Promenade plan contains two one-acre green spaces that represent the sites of the towers but are actually slightly removed from the precise footprints. Reaction over the last week, however, clearly favors keeping exact footprints clear.
Restoring some or all of the street grid through the remainder of the 16-acre site -- another favorite design element at both public meetings as well as among design professionals -- would also accomplish another public priority, by opening up more space throughout the area rather than creating one large open parcel of land.
On Saturday, rebuilding officials tried to make it clear that they intended to take the public's suggestions into account. 
"Everyone seemed to fear that the real meeting was going on in some other room," said Roland Betts, a Lower Manhattan Development Corporation director. "Let me tell you something. This is the real meeting."

HEADLINE: Auto Insurance Rates Decrease for Drivers, but Insurers Warn of Some Trouble Ahead 

BYLINE:  By JOSEPH B. TREASTER 

 BODY:
For the first time in at least six years, the average cost of insuring a car in New Jersey has dropped below $1,000, the nation's insurance regulators said yesterday.
 The average annual cost of coverage dropped to $977.07 in 2000, down from $1,034 in 1999, according to the regulators' latest compilation of spending on auto insurance around the country. 
 The decline followed a mandatory 15 percent rollback in rates in 1999 imposed by legislators and Gov. Christie Whitman. Insurers had warned at the time that the action would force them to stop doing business in New Jersey. 
Yesterday, insurers said the news that rates had gone down was no reason to jump for joy. John Tiene, president of the Insurance Council of New Jersey, a trade group, said that some insurers, unable to make a profit, were in fact leaving the state, making it harder for drivers to find coverage.
The New Jersey Department of Banking and Insurance did not return a call seeking comment.
New Jersey remained the most expensive state for coverage, the regulators found. But for the first time in years, it ranked behind the District of Columbia. Coverage in the district, which is much smaller than New Jersey and other states but has no rural areas, rose to $996.39, up from $988.02 in the previous year.
Costs for auto coverage have been rising sharply in the last year in most states, along with the cost of home insurance and most business coverages. But the National Association of Insurance Commissioners, the main organization of state insurance regulators, does not track current prices. Insurers say auto and home insurance costs are rising because insurance companies' expenses are increasing. And commercial coverage is going up partly because the industry lost an estimated $50 billion in the World Trade Center attack. Insurers' earnings have suffered as the stock markets have declined, hurting the industry's investments.
In 1995, the average cost of car insurance in New Jersey was $1,013, according to the association of regulators. The figure peaked in 1998 at $1,138.
One surprise in the annual rankings was New York. Insurance experts said earlier in the year that New York was rivaling New Jersey for the dubious honor of most expensive state for auto insurance because fraud was on the rise. But according to the regulators' group, costs for coverage in New York in 2000 fell $7.32 to $935.64. That put New York in third place among the states, after Massachusetts at $945.61, and fourth behind the District of Columbia.
Robert Hartwig, the chief economist at the Insurance Information Institute, a trade group in New York, said that costs for coverage in New York had been rising since late 2000. But he said the increases did not begin to take effect until late 2000 and that the trend was not reflected in the regulators' statistics.
"There's no doubt that insurers have raised their rates and there is no doubt that the fraud issue will begin to show up in subsequent years of data," Mr. Hartwig said.
Joanna Rose, a spokeswoman for Greg Serio, the superintendent of insurance and an appointee of Gov. George E. Pataki, said that officials were "pleased that New York was one of the states showing improvement." But she added: "We won't be satisfied until the Assembly Democrats enact the sweeping reforms proposed by the governor to combat fraud and reduce costs for consumers."
The Democrats accuse the governor, a Republican, of blocking reform legislation by refusing to accept their proposals for a change in ratemaking procedures and the creation of a consumer advocate for insurance. Both sides were in a standoff when the Legislature recessed in June. The Democrats, who control the Assembly, and the Republicans were unable to reach a compromise on antifraud legislation, and the Legislature adjourned this summer without taking action.
The governor has succeeded in muting auto insurance costs as an issue in his campaign for re-election in the fall. But there are signs that, in some ways, the insurance situation is worsening. Most of the new costs due to fraud involve liability coverages that pay for injuries in auto accidents. While coverage costs for liability dropped $10.66 in New York, to $613.27 in 2000, costs for the same kind of coverage dropped $55.57 to $586.74 in New Jersey, making New York the most expensive state in that category. New Jersey became third, after Massachusetts at $596.58.
Mr. Tiene said that while New Jersey was an expensive state for auto insurance, the regulators' rankings failed to reflect that New Jersey has a higher than average percentage of affluent drivers than other states and that such drivers choose more costly coverage. "If you figured it on a unit of coverage," he said, "you would find New Jersey's units of coverage were actually cheaper."
In any case, Mr. Tiene said, it was unlikely that average costs in New Jersey would stay below $1,000. "We don't believe that costs have been sufficiently cut to maintain and justify that rate," he said.
For insurance companies, New Jersey "is not a desirable place to do business," he said. "It is a very stringent regulatory environment that doesn't allow companies to manage their business on a day-to-day basis."

HEADLINE: THE MEDIA BUSINESS: ADVERTISING; 
AT&T and Sprint try to lure business from MCI customers by emphasizing their longevity.

BYLINE:  By Allison Fass 

 BODY:
AS MCI remains mum about future campaigns to reassure customers that service will not be affected by the bankruptcy filing of its parent, WorldCom, competitors are already making subtle marketing moves to snatch away some of that business.
 Today, the AT&T Corporation -- the country's No. 1 long-distance service provider (WorldCom is No. 2) -- is running full-page ads in national and local newspapers that seek to convey an image of a long-lasting and familiar company. The ads, which do not mention MCI by name, carry the tag line "Yesterday. Today. Tomorrow." 
 The Sprint Corporation, the No. 3 long-distance provider, is, meanwhile, tweaking its current campaign titled "symbols" to reflect a message of long-term stability. "In light of what's going on, we think there's market share to be taken," said Rondi Furgason, director for corporate brand management for Sprint in Overland Park, Kan. 
Julie Moore, a spokeswoman for WorldCom, declined to discuss specific marketing or advertising plans for WorldCom or its MCI brand unit in the wake of its filing for protection from creditors under Chapter 11 of the bankruptcy code Sunday night.
"It is business as usual but it is too early to speculate on how our current financial situation may affect advertising spending," Ms. Moore said. She added: "One of the many ways we are communicating with our customers and reassuring them their service will indeed continue unaffected is through advertising."
Officials at the agencies that handle advertising for WorldCom and MCI also declined to comment. Deutsch in New York, part of the Partnership division of the Interpublic Group of Companies, handles consumer advertising for the campaign that began in April with the theme "The neighborhood. Built by MCI."
Euro RSCG MVBMS in New York, part of the Euro RSCG MVBMS Partners unit of Havas, handles advertising for WorldCom business-to-business as well as its unbranded services like 1-800-Collect and 10-10-220.
WorldCom, coping with the fallout from the scandals that have battered its market value, has been scaling back its advertising spending this year, according to CMR, a division of Taylor Nelson Sofres. Ad spending for the first three months of the year dropped more than 40 percent, to $61 million from $103 million in the first three months of last year.
"They've got to start moving pretty quickly," said John V. Allen, a senior partner at Lippincott & Margulies in New York, a brand strategy agency owned by the Mercer Consulting Group unit of the Marsh & McLennan Companies. "They don't have a lot of time here," he added. "If I was in the competition, I would be going after these people right now."
It seems AT&T and Sprint, at least, are taking the advice of branding experts. "We know that communication means a lot to people," said Gary Morgenstern, a spokesman for AT&T in Basking Ridge, N.J. "We're taking the opportunity to let them know they can call AT&T and we'll help them find the plan that's right for them."
A similar AT&T ad ran July 1 in response to the general turmoil in the telecommunications industry, which has affected not just WorldCom but also Global Crossing and Qwest Communications, Mr. Morgenstern said. "We wanted to communicate to our customers AT&T's stability and our strengths to underscore the long history we have with consumers and businesses alike," he added.
Today's AT&T ad goes after the consumer long-distance business with a new line: "So contact us today and let us find the plan that's right for you."
Some branding and telecommunications experts said MCI was not in imminent danger of losing substantial business. Hayes Roth, vice president for marketing for Landor Associates, in New York, part of the Young & Rubicam division of the WPP Group, said the MCI name and brand had not been highlighted in the controversies as much as WorldCom, and therefore could emerge from the situation untarnished.
"I wouldn't be writing the obituary yet for MCI," he said. "It's a very viable brand. Up until a few weeks ago, there wasn't any problem with it as far as consumers were concerned."
MCI's Web site, MCI.com, tried to explain the situation. It added a link entitled "Important message to customers," which said: "Chapter 11 is a legal process allowing the corporation to continue day-to-day operations and provide for a court-supervised resolution to the company's debts." The Web site message goes on to boast about the 800,000 customers who have joined MCI since April.

HEADLINE: Camden Recovery Bill Signed, But School Board Challenges It 

BYLINE:  By The New York Times 

DATELINE: TRENTON, July 22 

 BODY:
As Gov. James E. McGreevey signed into law today a $175 million bill to revitalize Camden, New Jersey's poorest city, the Camden Board of Education filed a lawsuit to block parts of the recovery package that it considers unconstitutional.
 The measure would allocate money over the next three years to rebuild various elements of infrastructure, including sewer and water lines, and to improve public safety and increase fiscal and government accountability. 
 Under the plan, the school board of nine elected members would be replaced by one with with three elected members, three members appointed immediately by Mr. McGreevey, and three who must be appointed by next spring by Mayor Gwendolyn A. Faison of Camden. The governor would also have the power to veto school board actions like hiring and spending.
During the signing ceremony, the governor and other lawmakers played down the Camden school board's rising discontent and its threats in recent months to file a lawsuit. The officials cited a study released last week by a group of financial and educational professionals, the Fiscal Improvement Team, saying the city's schools were failing and were in need of reform.
"When we're rebuilding the fundamental infrastructure of Camden and attracting private investment," Mr. McGreevey said, "we must make sure Camden city schools work and work better."
A lawyer for the Camden Board of Education, Darryl Caplan, filed a suit against the governor and the state in Trenton, arguing that the package contradicted the state Constitution by giving the state and city governments control over the local school board's activities.
Sara T. Davis, the president of the board, advocated filing the suit to prevent the appointment of six members of the board and keep the governor from controlling school board funds. "We are filing this lawsuit today to prevent the total disenfranchisement of the Camden community," Ms. Davis said at a news conference in Camden this afternoon.
Legislators who supported the revitalization bill say it is partly intended to improve university facilities in the city and encourage business development in South Jersey. About $73 million has been allotted to help businesses develop, including $47 million to convert the RCA Victor building into apartments and $800,000 for a new-business incubation program that would be used by the Camden campus of Rutgers University and by Drexel University in Philadelphia.
Ms. Faison praised the legislation today, saying it provides the resources needed to rebuild and revitalize Camden and to improve residents' quality of life. She had been opposed to a similar bill that failed to pass the State Legislature in January, because it would have limited some of her powers. The new package allows her to retain oversight in most of the city's day-to-day affairs.

HEADLINE: In the Beginning... 

BYLINE:  By DENNIS OVERBYE 

 BODY:
It has always been easy to make fun of cosmologists, confined to a dust mote lost in space, pronouncing judgment on the fate of the universe or the behavior of galaxies billions of light-years away, with only a few scraps of light as evidence. 
 "Cosmologists are often wrong," the Russian physicist Lev Landau put it, "but never in doubt." 
 For most of the 20th century, cosmology seemed less a science than a religious war over, say, whether the universe had a beginning, in a fiery Big Bang billions of years ago, or whether it exists eternally in the so-called Steady State.
 In the last few years, however, a funny thing has happened. Cosmologists are beginning to agree with one another. Blessed with new instruments like the Hubble Space Telescope and other space-based observatories, a new generation of their giant cousins on the ground and ever-faster computer networks, cosmology is entering "a golden age" in which data are finally outrunning speculation. 
"The rate at which we are learning and discovering new things is just extraordinary," said Dr. Charles Bennett, an astronomer at the Goddard Space Flight Center in Greenbelt, Md.
As a result, cosmologists are beginning to converge on what they call a "standard model" of the universe that is towering in its ambition. It purports to trace, at least in broad strokes, cosmic history from the millisecond after time began, when the universe was a boiling stew of energy and subatomic particles, through the formation of atoms, stars, galaxies and planets to the vast, dilute, dark future in which all of these will have died.
The universe, the cosmologists say, was born 14 billion years ago in the Big Bang. Most of its material remains resides in huge clouds of invisible so-called dark matter, perhaps elementary particles left over from the primordial explosion and not yet identified.
Within these invisible clouds, the glittery lights in the sky that have defined creation for generations of humans are swamped, like flecks of foam on a rolling sea. A good case can be made, scientists now agree, that the universe will go on expanding forever. 
In fact, recent observations have suggested that the expansion of the universe is speeding up over cosmic time, under the influence of a "dark energy" even more mysterious than dark matter.
Recently, a group of astronomers led by Dr. William Percival at the University of Edinburgh combined data from a variety of observations to compile, based on the simplest theoretical model, what they say is the most precise enumeration yet of the parameters that cosmologists have been fighting about for all these decades. 
The universe, they calculated, is 13.89 billion years old, plus or minus half a billion years. Only 4.8 percent of it is made of ordinary matter. Matter of all types, known and unknown, luminous and dark, accounts for just 27.5 percent. The rest of creation, 72.5 percent, is the mysterious dark energy, they reported in a paper submitted last month to The Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society.
It is a picture that in some ways is surprisingly simple, satisfying long-held theoretical prejudices about how the universe should be designed. Continued agreement with coming experiments may mean that science is approaching the end of a "great program" of cosmological tests that began in the 1930's, Dr. P. J. E. Peebles of Princeton and Dr. Bharat Ratra of Kansas State University said in the draft of a coming article for The Reviews of Modern Physics. 
In other ways this new dark universe is utterly baffling, a road map to new mysteries. Dr. Marc Davis, a cosmologist at the University of California at Berkeley, called it "a universe chock full of exotics that don't make sense to anybody."
Moreover there are some questions that scientists still do not know how to ask, let alone answer, scientifically. Was there anything before the Big Bang? Is there a role for life in the cosmos? Why is there something rather than nothing at all? Will we ever know?
"We know much, but we still understand very little," said Dr. Michael Turner, a cosmologist at the University of Chicago.

The Big Question
Expanding Forever, Or Big Crunch?
The dim caves of Lascaux, the plains of Stonehenge and the dreamtime tales of Australian aborigines all testify to the need to explain the world and existence. This quest took its present form in 1917. That was when Albert Einstein took his new general theory of relativity, which explained how matter and energy warp space-time to produce gravity, and applied it to the universe.
Einstein discovered that the cosmos as his theory described it would be unstable, prone to collapse under its own gravity. Astronomers, however, were sure that the universe was stable. So Einstein added a fudge factor that he called the cosmological constant to his equations. It acted as a long-range repulsive force to counterbalance gravity.
In 1929, the astronomer Edwin Hubble discovered that the universe was expanding. The sky was full of distant galaxies all rushing away from us and one another, as if propelled by what the British astronomer Dr. Fred Hoyle later called derisively a "big bang." The universe was not stable and, thus, did not require counterbalancing. Einstein abandoned his constant, referring to it as his biggest blunder. But it would return to haunt cosmologists, and the universe.
Hoyle's term stuck, and the notion of an explosive genesis became orthodoxy in 1965, when Dr. Arno Penzias and Dr. Robert Wilson, radio astronomers at Bell Laboratories, discovered a faint uniform radio glow that pervaded the sky. It was, cosmologists concluded, the fading remnant of the primordial fireball itself.
Relieved of their fudge factor, the equations describing Einstein's universe were simple. Dr. Allan Sandage, the Carnegie Observatories astronomer, once called cosmology "the search for two numbers" -- one, the Hubble constant, telling how fast the universe is expanding, and the other telling how fast the expansion is slowing, and thus whether the universe will expand forever or not.
The second number, known as the deceleration parameter, indicated how much the cosmos had been warped by the density of its contents. In a high-density universe, space would be curved around on itself like a ball. Such a universe would eventually stop expanding and fall back together in a big crunch that would extinguish space and time, as well as the galaxies and stars that inhabit them. A low-density universe, on the other hand, would have an opposite or "open" curvature like a saddle, harder to envision, and would expand forever.
In between with no overall warpage at all was a "Goldilocks" universe with just the right density to expand forever but more and more slowly, so that after an infinite time it would coast to a stop. This was a "flat" universe in the cosmological parlance, and to many theorists the simplest and most mathematically beautiful solution of all.
But the sky did not yield those cosmic numbers easily, even with the help of the 200-inch Hale telescope on Palomar Mountain in Southern California, dedicated in 1948, which had been built largely for that task. Dr. Hubble wrote of measuring shadows and searching "among ghostly errors of measurement for landmarks that are scarcely more substantial."

The Dark Side
Invisible Matter Molds Galaxies
It was not till the mid-70's, a quarter-century after the Palomar giant began operating, that groups of astronomers reached the tentative conclusion that the universe they could see -- stars, gas, planets and galaxies -- did not have nearly enough gravitational oomph to stop the cosmic expansion. 
"So the universe will continue to expand forever and galaxies will get farther and farther apart, and things will just die," Dr. Sandage said at the time.
But the Great Argument was just beginning. Apparently there was a lot of the universe that astronomers could not see. The stars and galaxies, were moving as if immersed in the gravity of giant invisible clouds of so-called dark matter -- "missing matter" the Swiss astronomer Dr. Fritz Zwicky labeled it in the 1930's. 
Many galaxies, for example, are rotating so fast that they would fly apart unless they were being reined in by the gravity of halos of dark matter, according to pioneering observations by Dr. Vera Rubin of the Carnegie Institution of Washington and her colleagues. Her measurements indicated that these dark halos outweighed the visible galaxies themselves from 5 to 10 times. But there could be even more dark matter farther out in space, perhaps enough to stop the expansion of the universe, eventually, some theorists suggested. Luminous matter, the Darth Vaders of the sky said, is like the snow on mountaintops. 
But what is the dark matter? While some of it is gas or dark dim objects like stars and planets, cosmologists speculate that most of it is subatomic particles left over from the Big Bang. 
Many varieties of these particles are predicted by theories of high-energy physics. But their existence has not been confirmed or detected in particle accelerators. 
"We theorists can invent all sorts of garbage to fill the universe," Dr. Sheldon Glashow, a Harvard physicist and Nobel laureate, told a gathering on dark matter in 1981.
Collectively known as WIMP's, for weakly interacting massive particles, such particles would not respond to electromagnetism, the force responsible for light, and thus would be unable to radiate or reflect light. They would also be relatively slow-moving, or "cold" in physics jargon, and thus also go by the name of cold dark matter.
As Earth in its travels passed through the dark-matter cloud that presumably envelops the Milky Way, the particles would shoot through our bodies, rarely leaving a trace, like moonlight through a window.
But the collective gravity of such particles, cosmologists say, would shape the cosmos and its contents.
Gathering along the fault lines laid down by random perturbations of density in the early universe, dark matter would congeal into clouds with about the mass of 100,000 Suns. The ordinary matter that was mixed in with it would cool and fall to the centers of the clouds and light up as stars. 
The clouds would then attract other clouds. Through a series of mergers over billions of years, smaller clouds would assemble into galaxies, and the galaxies would then assemble themselves into clusters of thousands of galaxies, and so forth.
Using the Hubble and other telescopes as time machines -- light travels at a finite speed, so the farther out astronomers look the farther back in time they see -- cosmologists have begun to confirm that the universe did assemble itself from the "bottom up," as the dark matter model predicts.
Last year, two teams of astronomers reported seeing the first stars burning their way out of the cloudy aftermath of the Big Bang, when the universe was only 900 million years old. The bulk of galaxy formation occurred when the universe was a half to a quarter its present age, cosmologists say.
"The big news in the last decade is that even half a universe ago the universe looked pretty different," said Dr. Alan Dressler of the Carnegie Observatories in Pasadena. Galaxies before then were small and irregular, with no sign of the majestic spiral spider webs that decorate the sky today.
We would barely recognize our own Milky Way galaxy, if we could see it five billion years ago when the Sun formed, he said.
"By eight billion years back, it would be unrecognizable," said Dr. Dressler.
Yet there are still many questions that the cold dark matter model does not answer. Astronomers still do not know, for example, how the first stars formed or why the models of dark matter distribution don't quite fit in the cores of some kinds of galaxies. Nor have the dark matter particles themselves been unambiguously detected or identified, despite continuing experiments.
Some astronomers suggest that the discrepancies stem from the inability of simple mathematical models to deal with messy details of the real world. 
"It's a huge mystery exactly how stars form," Dr. Richard Bond of the Canadian Institute for Theoretical Astrophysics said. "We can't solve it now. So it's even harder to try to solve them back then." 
But others, notably Dr. Mordehai Milgrom, a theorist at the Weizmann Institute in Israel, have suggested that modifying the gravitational laws by which dark matter was deduced in the first place would alleviate the need for dark matter altogether.

The Bang's Fuel
Inflating One Ounce To a Whole Universe
Clues to what had actually exploded in the Big Bang emerged as an unexpected gift from another great scientific quest: physicists' pursuit for a so-called theory of everything that would unite all physical phenomena in a single equation. Unable to build machines powerful enough to test their most ambitious notions on Earth, some theorists turned to the sky. 
"The Big Bang is the poor man's particle accelerator," Dr. Jakob Zeldovich, an influential Russian cosmologist, said.
Physicists recognize four forces at work in the world today -- gravity, electromagnetism, and the strong and weak nuclear forces. But they suspect, based on data from particle accelerators and high-powered theory, that those are simply different manifestations of a single unified force that ruled the universe in its earliest, hottest moments.
As the universe cooled, according to this theory, there was a fall from grace, and the laws of physics evolved, with one force after another "freezing out," or splitting away.
In 1979, Dr. Alan Guth, now at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, realized that a hypothesized glitch in this process would have had drastic consequences for the universe. Under some circumstances, a glass of water can stay liquid as the temperature falls below 32 degrees, until it is disturbed, at which point it will rapidly freeze, releasing latent heat in the process. Similarly, the universe could "supercool" and stay in a unified state too long. In that case, space itself would become temporarily imbued with a mysterious kind of latent heat, or energy. 
Inserted into Einstein's equations, the latent energy would act as a kind of antigravity, and the universe would blow itself apart, Dr. Guth discovered in a calculation in 1979.
In far less than the blink of an eye, 10-37 second, a speck much smaller than a proton would have swollen to the size of a grapefruit and then resumed its more stately expansion, with all of normal cosmic history before it, resulting in today's observable universe -- a patch of sky and stars 14 billion light-years across. All, by the magical-seeming logic of Einstein's equations, from about an ounce of primordial stuff.
"The universe," Dr. Guth liked to say, "might be the ultimate free lunch."
Dr. Guth called his theory inflation. Inflation, as Dr. Guth pointed out, explains why the universe is expanding. Dr. Turner of the University of Chicago referred to it as "the dynamite behind the Big Bang."
As modified and improved by Dr. Andrei Linde, now at Stanford, and by Dr. Paul Steinhardt, now at Princeton and Dr. Andreas Albrecht now at the University of California at Davis, inflation has been the workhorse of cosmology ever since. One of its great virtues, cosmologists say, is that inflation explains the origin of galaxies, the main citizens of the cosmos. The answer comes from the paradoxical-sounding quantum rules that govern subatomic affairs. On the smallest scales, according to quantum theory, nature is lumpy, emitting even energy in little bits and subject to an irreducible randomness. As a result, so-called quantum fluctuations would leave faint lumps in the early universe. These would serve as the gravitational seeds for future galaxies and other cosmic structures.
As a result of such successes, cosmologists have stuck with the idea of inflation, even though, lacking the ability to test their theories at the high energies of the Big Bang, they have no precise theory about what might have actually caused it. "Inflation is actually a class of theories," said Dr. Guth.
In the latest version, called "chaotic inflation," Dr. Linde has argued that quantum fluctuations in a myriad of theorized force fields could have done the trick.
Indeed, he and others now say they believe that inflation can occur over and over, spawning an endless chain of universes out of one another, like bubbles within bubbles.
"The universe inflates on top of itself," Dr. Linde told a physics conference this spring in Princeton. "It's happening right now."

The Golden Age
New Devices Detect Primordial Glow
If the inflationary theorists are right, the universe we see, the 14 billion light-years, is just a tiny piece of a much vaster universe, or even a whole ensemble of them, forever out of our view.
According to the theory, therefore, our own little patch of the cosmos should appear geometrically "flat," the way a section of a balloon looks flat when viewed close up. This was the universe long thought to be the most beautiful and simple.
But it required, by the logic of Einstein's general relativity, that there be much more dark matter, or something, to the universe, enough to "flatten" space-time, than astronomers had found.
In fact, this prescription was so hard to reconcile with other observations, of galaxies and their evolutions, that by 1991 some astronomers and press reports suggested that the entire theoretical edifice of inflation to blow up the universe and cold dark matter to fill it, not to say the Big Bang itself, might have to be junked. 
So it was with a sigh of relief that cosmologists greeted the announcement in April 1992 that NASA's Cosmic Background Explorer, or COBE, satellite had succeeded in discerning faint blotches in the primordial cosmic radio glow.
These were the seeds from which, inflation predicted, large cosmic structures would eventually grow.
"If you're religious, it's like seeing God," said Dr. George Smoot, a physicist from the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory who led the COBE team.
Astronomers say COBE signaled a transition in which heroic ideas about the universe began to be replaced by heroic data, as long-planned new telescopes and other instruments went into operation. 
A year later, skywalking astronauts corrected the Hubble telescope's myopic vision. The cosmic background radiation has come in for particular scrutiny from new radio telescopes mounted in balloons and on mountaintops. The news has been good, though not decisive, for inflation.
For three years, a series of increasingly high-resolution observations has confirmed that the pattern of blotches stippling the remnant of the primordial fireball is consistent with the predictions from inflation and cold dark matter. The instruments have now mapped details small enough to have been the seeds of modern clusters of galaxies.
"I'm completely snowed by the cosmic background radiation," Dr. Guth said. "The signal was so weak it wasn't even detected until 1965, and now they're measuring fluctuations of one part in 100,000."
Perhaps most important, the analysis of the fluctuations indicates that the universe has a "flat" geometry, as predicted by inflation. That was a triumph. Although observations could not prove that inflation was right, a nonflat universe would have been a blow to the theory, and to cosmological orthodoxy.
"Inflation, our boldest and most promising theory of the earliest moments of creation, passed its first very important test," Dr. Turner said at the time.
The most precise measurements of the cosmic background, at least in the near future, are generally expected to come late this year from NASA's Microwave Anisotropy Project, or MAP, satellite, which was launched into space last year on June 30. MAP will be followed by the European Space Agency's Planck satellite, in 2006.
It is highly unlikely that MAP or Planck will be able to detect what Dr. Turner calls "the smoking gun signature of inflation." The violent stretching of the universe should roil space-time with so-called gravitational waves that would leave a faint imprint on the cosmic fireball.
Detecting those waves would not only confirm inflation, but also might help scientists establish what caused the inflation in the first place, giving science its first look at the strange physics that prevailed when creation was only about a trillionth of a trillionth of a trillionth of a second old. 

The Universe's Fate
Bleak Implications Of 'Dark Energy'
In 1998, two competing teams of astronomers startled the scientific world with the news that the expansion of the universe seemed to be speeding up under the influence of a mysterious antigravity that seems embedded in space itself and that is hauntingly reminiscent of Einstein's old, presumably discredited, cosmological constant.
"Dark energy," the phenomenon was quickly named. 
If dark energy is real and the acceleration continues, the galaxies will eventually speed away from one another so quickly that they couldn't see one another. The universe would become cold and empty as the continued acceleration sucked away the energy needed for life and thought. 
It would be "the worst possible universe," for the quality and quantity of life, said Dr. Lawrence Krauss, a physicist at Case Western Reserve University.
Dr. Edward Witten of the Institute for Advanced Study in Princeton, called the discovery of dark energy "the strangest experimental finding since I've been in physics."
The discovery was a surprise to the astronomers involved. Neither team had expected to find the universe accelerating. They had each set out to measure by how much the expansion of the universe was slowing because of the gravity of its contents and thus settle the question of its fate.
One team was led by Dr. Saul Perlmutter, a physicist at Lawrence Berkeley. The other team was a band of astronomers led by Dr. Brian Schmidt of Mount Stromlo and the Siding Spring Observatory in Australia.
Each group employed far-flung networks of telescopes, including the Hubble, and the Internet to find and monitor certain exploding stars, or supernovas, as cosmic beacons. Such explosions, the death rattles of massive stars, are powerful enough to be seen clear across the universe when the universe was younger and, presumably, expanding faster.
Leapfrogging each other across the universe, the two teams, propitiously for their credibility, arrived at the same answer at the same time: the cosmos was not slowing at all; it was speeding up.
Dr. Perlmutter, who had once resented the competition, conceded, "With only one group, it would have been a lot harder to get the community to buy into such a surprising result." 
"This was a very strange result," said Dr. Adam Riess, a member of Dr. Schmidt's team. "It was the opposite of what we thought we were doing." 
The results have sent Einstein's old cosmological constant to the forefront of cosmology. Despite his disavowal, the constant had never really gone away and had in fact been given new life by quantum physics. Einstein had famously rejected quantum's randomness, saying God didn't play dice. 
But it justified, in retrospect, his fudge factor.
According to the uncertainty principle, a pillar of quantum theory, empty space was not empty, but rather foaming with the energy of so-called virtual particles as they flashed in and out of existence on borrowed energy. This so-called vacuum energy could repel, just like Einstein's old cosmological constant, or attract. 
The case for dark energy got even stronger a year later, when the cosmic background observations reported evidence of a flat universe. Because astronomers had been able to find only about a third as much matter, both dark and luminous, as was needed by Einstein's laws to create a flat geometry, something else had to be adding to it.
The discovery of dark energy exemplified Dr. Zeldovich's view of the universe as the poor man's particle accelerator, and it caught the physicists flat-footed, somewhat to the pride of the astronomers. 
"A coming of age of astronomy," Dr. Dressler called it.
What is dark energy? The question now hangs over the universe.
Is it really Einstein's old fudge factor returned to haunt his children? In that case, as the universe expands and the volume of space increases, astronomers say, the push because of dark energy will also increase, accelerating the galaxies away from one another faster and faster, leading to a dire dark future. 
Other physicists, however, have pointed out that the theories of modern physics are replete with mysterious force fields, collectively called "quintessence," that might or might not exist, but that could temporarily produce negative gravity and mimic the action of a cosmological constant. In that case, all bets on the future are off. The universe could accelerate and then decelerate, or vice versa as the dark energy fields rose or fell. 
A third possibility is that dark energy does not exist at all, in which case not just the future, but the whole carefully constructed jigsaw puzzle of cosmology, might be in doubt. The effects of cosmic acceleration could be mimicked, astronomers say, by unusual dust in the far universe or by unsuspected changes in the characteristics of supernovas over cosmic time. As a result, more groups are joining the original two teams in the hunt for new supernovas and other ways to measure the effects of dark energy on the history of the universe.
Dr. Perlmutter has proposed building a special satellite telescope, the Supernova Astronomy Project, to investigate exactly when and how abruptly the cosmic acceleration kicked in.

The Nagging Questions
A Grand Synthesis, But Hardly Complete
For all the new answers being harvested, some old questions linger, and they have now been joined by new ones.
A flat universe is the most mathematically appealing solution of Einstein's equations, cosmologists agree. But they are puzzled by the specific recipe, large helpings of dark matter and dark energy, that nature has chosen. Dr. Turner called it "a preposterous universe."
But Dr. Martin Rees, a Cambridge University cosmologist, said that the discovery of a deeper principle governing the universe and, perhaps, life, may alter our view of what is fundamental. Some features of the universe that are now considered fundamental -- like the exact mixture of dark matter, dark energy and regular stuff in the cosmos -- may turn out to be mere accidents of evolution in one out of the many, many universes allowed by eternal inflation.
"If we had a theory, then we would know whether there were many big bangs or one," Dr. Rees said. The answers to these and other questions, many scientists suspect, have to await the final unification of physics, a theory that reconciles Einstein's relativity, which describes the shape of the universe, to the quantum chaos that lives inside it. 
Such a theory, quantum gravity, is needed to describe the first few moments of the universe, when it was so small that even space and time should become fuzzy and discontinuous.
For two decades, many physicists have placed their bets for quantum gravity on string theory, which posits that elementary particles are tiny strings vibrating in a 10- or 11-dimensional space. Each kind of particle, in a sense, corresponds to a different note on the string.
In principle, string theory can explain all the forces of nature. But even its adherents concede that their equations are just approximations to an unknown theory that they call M-theory, with "M" standing for matrix, magic, mystery or even mother, as in "mother of all theories." Moreover, the effects of "stringy physics" are only evident at energies forever beyond the limits of particle accelerators.
Some string theorists have ventured into cosmology, hoping, to discover some effect that would show up in the poor man's particle accelerator, the sky.
In addition to strings, the theory also includes membranes, or "branes," of various dimensions. Our universe can be envisioned as such a brane floating in higher-dimensional space like a leaf in a fish tank, perhaps with other brane universes nearby. These branes could interact gravitationally or even collide, setting off the Big Bang.
In one version suggested last year by four cosmologists led by Dr. Steinhardt of Princeton, another brane would repeatedly collide with our own. They pass back and forth through each other, causing our universe to undergo an eternal chain of big bangs.
Such notions are probably the future for those who are paid to wonder about the universe.
And the fruits of this work could yet cause cosmologists to reconsider their new consensus, warned Dr. Peebles of Princeton, who has often acted as the conscience of the cosmological community, trying to put the brakes on faddish trends.
He wonders whether the situation today can be compared to another historical era, around 1900, when many people thought that physics was essentially finished and when the English physicist Lord Kelvin said that just a couple of "clouds" remained to be dealt with.
"A few annoying tidbits, which turned out to be relativity and quantum theory," the twin revolutions of 20th-century science, Dr. Peebles said.
Likewise, there are a few clouds today like what he called "the dark sector," which could have more complicated physics than cosmologists think.
"I'm not convinced these clouds herald revolutions as deep as relativity and quantum mechanics," Dr. Peebles said. "I'm not arguing that they won't." 
As for the fate of the universe, we will never have a firm answer, said Dr. Sandage, who was Hubble's protege and has seen it all.
"It's like asking, 'Does God exist?' " he said. 
Predicting the future, he pointed out, requires faith that simple mathematical models really work to describe the universe.
"I don't think we really know how things work," he said.
Although Dr. Sandage does not buy into all aspects of the emerging orthodoxy, he said it was a fantastic time to be alive.
"It's all working toward a much grander synthesis than we could have imagined 100 years ago," he said. "I think this is the most exciting life I could have had."

HEADLINE: FIGURE SKATING; 
Olympic Fame Proves Fleeting

BYLINE:  By AMY ROSEWATER 

 BODY:
For nearly a month before, during and after the Salt Lake Olympics, their faces were everywhere.
 Five months later, Jamie Sale and David Pelletier are simply remembered as "the Canadians," the skating pairs co-gold medalists who were at the center of an Olympic-sized brouhaha and then suddenly disappeared in yet another saga of confusion. 
 Sale and Pelletier have performed in only one major skating show since the Olympics -- a homecoming event in March in Edmonton, Alberta, which was televised in Canada.
While figure skating heroes like Sarah Hughes, Michelle Kwan and Yelena Berezhnaya and Anton Sikharulidze, with whom Sale and Pelletier shared the gold medal, were crisscrossing the continent, Sale and Pelletier were at home grappling with the trappings of instant fame. They were hiring and firing agents, attempting to create their own tour and ultimately scrapping those plans. 
The one thing they were not doing was what they do best -- skating. 
"We just had an unfortunate time," Sale said in an interview last week from the home she and Pelletier recently moved into in Edmonton. "We were led in a direction that we did not want to be led in. We know our reputation isn't ruined. We do miss skating and we did miss being on tour this summer.
"It's weird not being on tour. But it's almost a blessing in disguise. We have a great manager now and we've gotten to do so many other things. It hasn't been a waste of time."
That, of course, depends on whom you ask. 
Had they joined Tom Collins's tour, Champions on Ice, they could have earned close to $1 million this summer. Not only did they lose financially, but Collins said they also lost precious visibility.
"They're out of the loop completely now," he said. "They've disappeared. They could have done very, very well, but now it's too late. The Olympics are a very short-lived thing. After six months, if a skater or skaters don't promote themselves, it's very difficult. I don't think they can ever recoup what they've lost."
After months of unsuccessful negotiations with the Stars on Ice tour and Collins's Champions on Ice, Sale and Pelletier decided in May to hire a new agent, Dr. Robert Steadward, Sale's longtime family friend and her former sports psychologist. Soon afterward, they signed a four-year deal with Stars on Ice, produced by the sports agency IMG. In doing so, the couple is no longer eligible to compete in the world championships or defend its title in the 2006 Olympics. Stars on Ice begins rehearsals in September, and the tour starts in November. 
For Sale and Pelletier, signing with Stars on Ice was one of their first steps forward in many months. "What we went through, no one really knows, " Pelletier said. "In this situation, we lost control. Now we're trying to take it back."
Their story is about the perils that accompany instant success, the web of agents and promoters and handlers who are eager to offer advice -- good and bad -- and how all of them wanted to get their hands in a strike-while-it's-hot pot. 
"They were such a hot item and so many people wanted a piece of the action," their coach, Jan Ullmark, said. "A couple of days after they got the gold medal, they came up to me and said, 'We just want to go home.' They wanted things to be normal. I just laughed. I said, 'Things aren't going to be normal for a long time.' "
Sale said: "You just can't prepare for this. It was a real test of our patience, and we learned a lot about ourselves. We were pushed to the limit and you lose your identity."
Many in the skating community sensed trouble was brewing in the Canadian camp nearly a year before the Olympics, when the couple hired the agent Craig Fenech, an outsider to the figure skating world, who had been working with the couple's choreographer, Lori Nichol. 
"I don't know anything about skating," Fenech said he had told Sale and Pelletier. "But that's O.K., because you're not hiring me to tell you how to skate."
After watching the couple win the world championships in Vancouver, British Columbia, Fenech realized he had legitimate Olympic gold medal contenders on his hands. Not only could they skate, but they also had charisma, good looks and charm. 
"I believed Americans would adopt them like they were from Minnesota," Fenech said. 
But in the months leading up to the Games, Fenech's relationships with Collins and IMG had already soured. In skating, there are only two franchises, and Fenech was quickly burning bridges with both.
Just before the Olympics, Fenech said, he turned down offers from both tours. Collins and IMG each offered Sale and Pelletier similar deals, an estimated $4,000 per show, typical for top pairs teams. In the economy of figure skating, an American female champion is considered the jackpot, garnering anywhere between $10,000 and $15,000 per night. 
"I thought they'd win over the U.S. and Canadian fans and then they would have more leverage, more market power," Fenech said. 
Sale and Pelletier not only won the gold, but they also won over the hearts and sympathies of the American public. They could not go anywhere in Salt Lake City without being photographed.
Fenech had this issue to grapple with on the spot: Exactly how does one respond to instant fame? As everyone involved found out, you can't.
"It was just too much," Ullmark, their coach, said. "It put a lot of stress on their relationship, too. We're all novices in the sense of dealing with this. When a question comes up instantly, one answers one way and the other wants to answer it another way. There's no chance to sit and discuss things. It was an explosion."
Soon after the Olympics, Fenech tried to create a new tour that Sale and Pelletier would headline. Fenech said the couple would have owned 50 percent of the tour. This would have been a major coup for skaters; most are free agents, who are hired by the tour owners. 
Collins and IMG were miffed, but at the same time neither believed that Sale and Pelletier's tour would become a reality. 
"I don't think any skater could put on their own tour, and to try to do it in just four weeks is just impossible," Collins said. 
"You have to do the scheduling, the advertising, all that stuff," said Collins, who is already planning his post-Olympic tour in 2006. "There was no thought put into this. Craig just didn't understand the business."
Sale and Pelletier said in an interview that they had not wanted to do their own tour in the first place. 
"It was never our idea to do our own tour," Pelletier said. "One day, we woke up and heard on the radio that Sale and Pelletier are looking to do a 45-city tour. That's how we first heard about it."
All the while, Fenech continued to try to negotiate deals for Sale and Pelletier to skate in the two established tours. "I read that I asked for $30,000 per show," Fenech said. "People with an ax to grind were spreading those numbers and putting pressure on Jamie and David."
Soon, Collins had to get his show started, and when no deal could be agreed to, he decided to forge ahead without Sale and Pelletier. 
Fenech said part of the problem was that he was perceived as an outsider by the tight-knit skating community. "People were self-interested and wanted them to do either Tommy's tour or Stars on Ice," Fenech said. "I think Jamie and David had a chance to transcend skating."
Fenech declined to say how much Sale and Pelletier could have earned had they been able to mount their own tour, but he said, "You can speculate as wildly as you like, but I can safely say it would have been seven figures."
Ultimately, the grand plans for Sale and Pelletier's tour collapsed. Among the reasons, Fenech said, was that the two established tours have restrictive clauses in their contracts with arenas, making it virtually impossible for him to schedule dates for Sale and Pelletier's tour.
Fenech resigned in May, but Sale and Pelletier said the parting was mutual. Fenech said there were too many "back channels," too many people who were negotiating directly with Sale and Pelletier, making his role as an intermediary meaningless. 
Back in Edmonton, Sale and Pelletier have been busy moving into their new house and visiting relatives and friends. Soon, they will begin rehearsals for the Stars on Ice tour. 
Stars on Ice also signed the Russian team of Berezhnaya and Sikharulidze, and Byron Allen, IMG's senior vice president for winter sports and the producer of Stars on Ice, hinted that the Russians and Canadians might skate in routines together. 
"We've surrounded ourselves with great people," Sale said. "We're excited about skating with Stars on Ice and developing another side of our skating."

HEADLINE: Petrobras Paying $1.1 Billion For Argentine Oil Company 

BYLINE:  Bloomberg News 

DATELINE: RIO DE JANEIRO, July 22 

 BODY:
Petroleo Brasileiro S.A., Brazil's state-controlled oil company, said today that it had agreed to acquire a controlling stake in Perez Companc, the second-largest oil company in Argentina, for about $1.1 billion.
 The Brazlian company, known as Petrobras, already owns 700 gasoline stations in Argentina, acquired last year in a swap with Repsol YPF of Spain. Today's deal would add oil exploration, production and refining operations, and expand Petrobras's total production by 12 percent. 
 The deal calls for Petrobras to pay the family that now controls Perez Companc $754.6 million in cash and $370.5 million in seven-year bonds for 58.6 percent of the company. Analysts expressed concern that Petrobras was adding debt by expanding in Argentina, where a January currency devaluation deepened a recession and caused huge losses for Perez Companc and other companies. 
Petrobras's borrowing costs have risen sharply and its stock has fallen because of the 20 percent fall in the value of the Brazilian currency, the real, since March.
"It is an interesting acquisition, as it shows Petrobras is expanding abroad, but for now investors are concerned as to how much this will cost in terms of financing," said Debora Morsch, a money manager at Solidus Brokerage.
Major foreign investment in Argentina all but halted after the country's currency and debt crisis worsened severely in January, but Brazilian companies have begun to look there for bargains. The brewer Cia. de Bebidas das Americassaid in early May that it would buy one-third of Argentina's biggest beer maker, Cerveceria y Malteria Quilmes Saica, for about $700 million.
Today's sale is the latest in a series of retreats by the Perez Companc family, which has sold banks, a phone company and huge tracts of land from Buenos Aires to Argentina's far south. The family is exiting the oil business after 42 years.
"This is a very political decision," said Gaston Danio of Capital Markets S.A. in Buenos Aires. "Since the devaluation, the government has pretty much ignored the needs of private companies and the difficulties they face. I think the family is tired with the circumstances and wants out."
Petrobras has been actively seeking acquisitions outside its home market to help Brazil become self-sufficient in oil by 2006. "With the situation in Argentina so difficult, this acquisition is probably something that Petrobras wouldn't find at any other time," said Monica Araujo, an analyst at Espirito Santo Securities in Rio de Janeiro.
Petrobras said it had no immediate plans to buy the rest of Perez Companc. American depository receipts of Petrobras fell 8.4 percent, to $14.84 today.
Some analysts expressed concern at the price Petrobras had agreed to pay, equivalent to about $4 for each barrel of proven reserves; the current market value of Petrobras itself is only about $3 a barrel, according to Emerson Leite, an energy analyst at Credit Suisse First Boston in Sao Paulo. "They are paying more for oil in Argentina than their own oil is worth," Mr. Leite said.

HEADLINE: Gephardt Is Preparing a Measure to Legalize Illegal Immigrants 

BYLINE:  By CARL HULSE 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, July 22 

 BODY:
Seeking advantage in the contest for the political allegiance of Hispanics, House Democrats are preparing legislation that would grant permanent residency status to millions of illegal immigrants.
 Representative Richard A. Gephardt of Missouri, the minority leader, told a meeting of Hispanic activists in Miami today that he would soon propose legislation to allow illegal immigrants with a work history in this country to qualify for residency. Aides said the measure would probably be introduced in September. 
 "Our proposal will bring undocumented immigrants out of the shadows and into the light of accountability and greater cooperation in our fight against terrorism," Mr. Gephardt told about 3,000 applauding people at the annual meeting of the National Council of La Raza, a Hispanic organization, The Associated Press reported. 
Given the growing importance of the Hispanic vote, both Democrats and President Bush last year talked about enabling illegal workers to qualify for permanent status, but the issue lost momentum in the aftermath of the Sept. 11 attacks and new concern about border security. Mr. Gephardt's comments show that Democrats intend to revive it before the November elections.
Dan Stein, the leader of a group that has opposed increased immigration, accused Mr. Gephardt of "pandering" for ethnic votes and said that even discussion of such proposals could stimulate illegal immigration by people who hoped to be in the country to take advantage of such a program.
"These guys just want to give away green cards for votes basically without any kind of preventative strategy," said Mr. Stein, executive director of the Federation for American Immigration Reform.
"It is irresponsible, and I don't see what is in it for the American people," he said of the proposal.
Under the Democratic plan taking shape, illegal immigrants who have been in the United States for five years and have held jobs for at least two years would be able to apply for permanent residency status.
Applicants would be subject to criminal background checks. Those who fail could be deported.
It is unclear how many of an estimated eight million illegal immigrants, including more than three million from Mexico, might be eligible for such a program.
The last major program allowing illegal immigrants to gain legitimate status came under a 1986 law signed by President Ronald Reagan. About three million people from various nations qualified, and many are now citizens.
House aides said the program of "earned legalization" would be governed by an effective date -- January 2002, for example -- that would eliminate an incentive for new immigration. People who entered the country after that date would not be eligible.
Authors are also considering a provision that would allow some current workers who have lived less than five years in the country to qualify later.
In his remarks, Mr. Gephardt said the intent was to "recognize the hard work" of immigrants who have contributed to the economy and have not run afoul of the law.
A Congressional aide said the program was not intended for someone who "has been here a year and is hanging out on the street corner."
"This is people who may have been involved in the rebuilding of the Pentagon," the aide said.
Because Republicans control the legislative agenda in the House, and many of them strongly oppose the idea on the grounds that it rewards illegal behavior, it is unlikely that any far-reaching plan would advance this year. Before Sept. 11, President Bush and President Vicente Fox of Mexico were negotiating a legalization plan, but that effort stalled with the administration's shift in priorities.
Mr. Stein said public support for tougher control over immigration, along with the uncertain economic outlook, would work against approval of any sweeping plan.
"No proposal that does not at least generate the appearance of future control has a prayer," he said, adding that Democrats risk alienating some of their own voters in pushing for a wide legalization program.

HEADLINE: Mayor Hints He May Turn To Layoffs 

BYLINE:  By MICHAEL COOPER 

 BODY:
Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg hinted yesterday that he might resort to layoffs to ease what he now calls a "budget crisis," and his administration has taken the first step by inviting city commissioners to consider layoffs to cut the city payroll.
 Mr. Bloomberg, who had repeatedly said that the city would not need to lay off workers this year unless something unforeseen happened, now appears to be weighing the possibility. 
 The mayor is looking to cut a billion dollars more from the $42.3 billion budget that took effect this month to make sure that it remains balanced, and to save for next year, when he projects a budget gap of $3.7 billion to $6 billion. 
"If you take a look at the budget crisis we have, we're going to have to find some ways to downsize," Mr. Bloomberg said at a news conference yesterday. 
The mayor made the remark as his budget director, Mark Page, sent a letter to city commissioners that opened the door to layoffs. The letter said that while early retirement programs and severance packages were the preferred ways to cut jobs, "you should not be constrained by achieving head count savings only through attrition."
All city agencies are being asked to propose ways to cut their spending by 7.5 percent. When the mayor called on agency heads last week to develop the cost-cutting plans, he indicated that he would be flexible in deciding which cuts they would have to make.
The letter from Mr. Page told the agency heads that "for the purposes of meeting your target, you should assume whatever personnel changes may be necessary."
It was still far from clear last night how seriously the administration was thinking about layoffs. The City Council, which passed the budget last month after months of wrangling over budget cuts, has played down the threat of further severe cuts recently, noting that past mayors have also asked agencies to propose cuts as an exercise.
Mayors have often threatened layoffs in times of great fiscal uncertainty, and sometimes raised the threat as a bargaining tool with unions and to reassure credit-rating agencies. Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani sought to cut thousands of jobs in the 1994 but reached agreements with the unions on reductions that averted most layoffs. But in 1991, the Dinkins administration laid off thousands of workers as the city grappled with a recession.
Christopher Policano, the Council's communications director, said that he hoped the city would weigh other options before laying off workers. And he renewed the Council's call for reinstating the commuter tax, which was levied on people who work in the city but live elsewhere.
The State Legislature rescinded the tax in 1999 over the objections of city officials, at a cost of nearly half a billion a year to the city's coffers.
"Layoffs are a drastic measure of last resort," Mr. Policano said. "We should be doing everything we can to maximize cost savings. And of course, there is the commuter tax, which, if we had this year, would make fighting the good fight easier next year."
When the mayor unveiled his preliminary budget in February, he said: "We will not have any layoffs in the fiscal year 2003 unless something were to happen that we don't know about now. And 2004, 2005, it's so far down the road I don't know."
There have been no major surprises since then, but the Bloomberg administration has started to focus on the big deficits the city faces in 2004 and 2005. The city closed a gap of almost $5 billion in the budget that went into effect on July 1 with lots of one-time measures that will not be available again, including borrowing $1.5 billion.
And a number of fiscal monitors have warned that the city could still go into the red this year if help from the federal government and pension and fringe-benefit savings from the city unions do not materialize.
The mayor made his comments about downsizing as he took a rare, pointed shot at the Council, warning it not to support providing job security for striking Queens bus drivers. The drivers work for private companies that get city subsidies.
The Council is planning to consider a nonbinding resolution on Wednesday stating that if the city opens the bus company contracts to competitive bidding, it should only consider companies that will honor the pension commitments of the current companies and negotiate with the current union. Such a measure would effectively support preserving the jobs of the current drivers.
Mr. Bloomberg denounced such a plan and took a swipe at the Council.
"I think in the case of the City Council, what they really have to understand is that this is not the 1960's, where they can just pander for votes and campaign contributions," Mr. Bloomberg said. 
Gifford Miller, the Council speaker, who was born in 1969, said that while he had received contributions from people associated with the bus companies and the unions, the Council was doing what it could to end the strike, which has inconvenienced more than 100,000 daily riders for more than a month.
"Our position is to protect the riding public, and we hope that everybody goes back to the table because the bottom line is the mayor needs to negotiate a deal with the union to get these people back to work, so the riding public can get the service they need," Mr. Miller said in an interview.

HEADLINE: Living With Bears 

BYLINE:  By PAUL KRUGMAN 

 BODY:
It looks as if the authors of "Dow 36,000" -- remember that? -- may have had one digit too many in their title. Let's just hope it was an extra 3, not an extra 0. 
 The bull market is now well and truly over. In fact, if you adjust for inflation the S.&P. 500 -- a much better measure than the overused Dow -- is now below its level in late 1996, when Alan Greenspan gave his famous "irrational exuberance" speech. 
 So what should the responsible officials -- Mr. Greenspan, George W. Bush and whatshisname, the Treasury secretary -- be doing? 
A good first step would be to stop trying to talk up the market by extolling the economy's fundamental strength. For one thing, it reeks of desperation. For another, stocks are still richly valued compared with earnings. Most important, the fundamentals aren't actually all that great. Doubts about corporate governance are growing, not fading away. State and local governments are in a desperate fiscal crisis. And even before the sudden plunge in the markets, the data were pointing not to a boom but to a "jobless recovery," in which the economy grows too slowly to make much if any dent in the unemployment rate. 
Indeed, the report prepared in support of Mr. Greenspan's recent testimony projected no significant decline in unemployment this year, and not much decline next year. And in the face of plunging markets we have to worry whether even that forecast is overly optimistic.
Given the definitely iffy economic outlook, shouldn't Mr. Greenspan be thinking seriously about another interest rate cut? True, rates are already very low. But if there's one thing we've learned from Japan's experience, it is that when you face the risk of a deflationary trap -- still not the most likely scenario, but not as unlikely as it seemed a few months ago -- it makes no sense to "save your ammunition," holding interest rate cuts in reserve. The time to fight deflation is before it has time to get built into the nation's psychology.
True, the Fed has been concerned that another cut would panic the markets. But now that the markets have panicked on their own, there's nothing to lose.
What about the rest of the government? Corporate reform is essential; if investors cannot be reassured that they are being treated fairly, they will take their money and go home. But we can't count on reform to provide an immediate boost to the economy; trust, once lost, cannot be restored in a moment. What else can the government do?
Let's ignore the politics and look at the situation objectively. On one side, thanks in part to the end of the bull market the long-run federal budget outlook has worsened to an extent that has surpassed the expectations of even the biggest pessimists (like yours truly). Realistically, we are looking at a decade of deficits, which will eventually pose serious problems for Social Security and Medicare. 
On the other hand, with the recovery still wobbly, this is no time for fiscal austerity -- if anything, right now the federal government ought to be pumping more money into the economy than it is.
The obvious answer to this seeming dilemma is to loosen the reins now, but prepare to tighten them once the economy has fully recovered. For example, the Bush administration could move quickly to aid distressed state governments, avoiding harsh (and contractionary) cuts in essential programs. Meanwhile, to assuage worries about the long-run fiscal position, it could put on hold future tax cuts that were written into law back when visions of surplus sugarplums were still dancing in our heads. 
And after the administration takes these responsible steps, thousands of pigs will fill the skies over Washington.
Look at it this way: The Bush administration's economic plans have not changed significantly since the fall of 1999, when they were introduced as a way to ward off a challenge from Steve Forbes. Back when the tax cut that eventually became law was announced, "Dow 36,000" was climbing the best-seller lists. The economic environment has changed completely; the administration's plans haven't changed a bit.
Our economic problems are real, but by no means catastrophic. What scares me is the utter inflexibility of the people who should be solving those problems.

HEADLINE: Bloomberg Sees Need for More Power Plants in the City 

BYLINE:  By JAYSON BLAIR 

 BODY:
Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg said yesterday that the city was in desperate need of more power plants after the major explosion and fire on Saturday at an electrical transformer on the East River.
 City and Consolidated Edison officials feared that the damaged power system would cause more power failures as usage increased on the first normal workday after the explosion, but no major blackouts were reported yesterday despite temperatures that reached 90. 
 Even so, officials continued their call for customers across a large section of Lower Manhattan to use electricity sparingly until the utility is able to replace a destroyed transformer and other damaged equipment inside a substation at the site of the explosion, the East River Generation Station, which stretches along 14th Street from the Franklin D. Roosevelt Drive to Avenue C. Con Ed said it was still unclear whether the plant would be able to deliver enough power to the roughly 63,000 customers in the affected area, from 14th Street to Battery Park, west of Broadway.
Even without Saturday's explosion, the city faces problems generating enough electricity. Several new plants have been approved for construction, but power generation companies have had a hard time attracting financing, which means no major source of electricity is expected to come online in the city until 2004. 
Several power generation companies have complained that Gov. George E. Pataki, the Legislature and the state's Public Service Commission, which regulates utilities, have not done enough to make the power market competitive, discouraging power companies from investing in the state.
Mayor Bloomberg is among those who see a need for more plants. "We do not have enough power generation or distribution facilities and it is very difficult to site and to build those facilities," he said yesterday at a groundbreaking for new housing in Chelsea. "But if we don't address those problems now we are going to find ourselves down the road with more blackouts and shortages."
The mayor added, "We got lucky in this case. It turned out it did not do that much damage. It turned out it was on a Saturday. It turned out it was on a day when humidity wasn't all that bad. If those combinations of things hadn't been true, it would have been much more serious."
The blackout on Saturday was the worst that the city had seen since Inwood and Washington Heights went dark in 1999. This power failure was caused by a fire in a transformer at the East River substation. That substation feeds two substations on the west side in Lower Manhattan, which serve Battery Park City, SoHo, TriBeCa, the West Village and Greenwich Village. (Before Sept. 11, Battery Park City and some parts of TriBeCa were served by two substations that were destroyed in the collapse of 7 World Trade Center).
Yesterday, Con Ed officials acknowledged that there was construction going on at the East River plant at the time of the fire, but said that the burned transformer was hundreds of feet from the work.
Louis L. Rana, Con Ed's vice president for electrical operations in Manhattan, said it still was not clear exactly what had caused the fire. He stressed that two other minor power failures last week were not connected to the problem on Saturday.
Mr. Rana said people should to conserve electricity while repairs continue.
"We have had a massive fire and we are doing extensive work at our East River station, so my message would be that people in Lower Manhattan should still conserve energy," he said.
Mr. Rana and other officials at Con Ed, which has sold most of its generating plants and is primarily in the distribution business, also echoed Mayor Bloomberg's concerns about the need for more power plants. 
"In the future, we expect the electrical demand in New York City to increase and we need generation behind it," Mr. Rana said. "We see the same shortages into the future that the mayor sees."
The Public Service Commission, whose members are appointed by the governor, and other state agencies have approved six new power plant projects, including three in New York City that would provide 1,450 additional megawatts of electrical power by the end of 2005. But at least one of those projects -- the 1,000-megawatt SCS Energy plant in Astoria, Queens -- has been stalled because of difficulties in finding financing, according to the Independent Power Producers of New York, which represents power generators.
Few of the other private generation projects presently under review have secured adequate investments to move forward. Power producers say that investors have been wary in the wake of the Enron scandal and are also concerned about existing price caps, environmental laws and other regulations in New York.
"There is a vital need for more power in New York and Long Island," said Gavin J. Donahue, executive director of the Independent Power Producers. "The New York marketplace is not anywhere near where people estimated it would be when deregulation started five years ago because of policies that were instituted on the state level, the economy, the Enron issues and Sept. 11."
David Flanagan, a Public Service Commission spokesman, defended the state's efforts. He said that approving power plants continued "to be a top priority for all of the agencies involved" and that "there continues to be a significant amount of interest in investing in these types of projects in New York."
There are 10 applications for new plants currently under review. "I think it shows itself by the number of applications that we have and I think that New York has generally been recognized as having a very solid foundation for a competitive market," Mr. Flanagan said.

HEADLINE: THE MARKETS: STOCKS; 
Stocks Tumble, And the Fallout Is Going Global

BYLINE:  By FLOYD NORRIS and DAVID E. SANGER 

 BODY:
The United States stock market fell sharply again yesterday. Investors seemed to fear a slowdown in the world economy and shrugged off President Bush's statement that "there is value in the market" now. 
 The weak American market has alarmed investors abroad as well as at home. "There is a growing disenchantment with equities globally, rather than with U.S. financial assets," said Robert Barbera, the chief economist of Hoenig & Company, as stock prices slid around the world. 
 Until recently, there had been general agreement that the economy was growing at a moderate pace, and that there was little danger of a new recession. But yesterday's market action seemed to indicate growing doubts about that, with some of the worst performances coming from stocks -- like Dow Chemical, Alcoa and United Parcel Service -- whose businesses are heavily dependent on the state of the economy. 
The Dow Jones industrial average, which was slightly up for the day as late as 2 p.m., ended down 234.68, or 2.9 percent, at 7,784.58, its lowest close since Oct. 8, 1998. Over the last 10 trading days -- beginning with the day President Bush came to Wall Street -- the Dow has fallen nearly 1,500 points, or 16 percent.
As measured by the Standard & Poor's index of 500 stocks, which yesterday fell 3.3 percent, the last 10 trading days have been the worst since 1987. That exceeds the declines seen in such previous market sell-offs as the aftermath of last September's terrorist attacks and the 1998 Asian crisis.
Mutual fund investors are doing more selling now than they did last September, some fund executives said. "Investor confidence has definitely been more shaken than it has been," said Brian Lewbart, a spokesman for the T. Rowe Price group of funds, who said some investors were moving money from stocks to bonds.
President Bush delivered a forceful defense of current stock prices, saying investors now are "buying value, as opposed to, you know, buying into a bubble." And, speaking the day after WorldCom filed the largest bankruptcy in American history, he said Congressional approval of the pending corporate responsibility legislation "will help to take some of the uncertainty out of the market."
The president also told reporters that he had "all the confidence in the world" in his much-criticized Treasury secretary, Paul H. O'Neill.
Mr. Bush's comments came during a visit to the Argonne National Laboratory in Illinois, where he reviewed new technologies for detecting and combating terrorist attacks. The comments seemed to reflect the depth of the White House concern of political fallout from the widespread criticism of Mr. Bush's economic team and the 39 percent fall in the S.& P. 500 since he took office 18 months ago.
The statements were the first instance of Mr. Bush's feeling compelled to come strongly to the defense of Mr. O'Neill, at a moment that some Republican leaders are quietly urging the administration to begin thinking about candidates who could replace Mr. O'Neill after the November elections.
"I say he's doing a fine job," Mr. Bush said yesterday. "And when the market goes up, I hope they will give him credit. If they're going to hold him accountable for a market going down, they ought to give him credit when the market goes up."
In fact, Mr. O'Neill's critics on Wall Street and in Washington have not argued that he is responsible for the market's fall. Rather, they have questioned his effectiveness in reining in the federal deficit and articulating a clear federal policy for a dollar whose value has been declining along with the stock market, and his habit of speaking his mind in ways that can rattle confidence.
Last Sept. 19, when markets were falling in the wake of the terrorist attacks, Mr. O'Neill said: "My guess is that when we look a year down the road, the people who bought today are going to be the happy people. The people who sold today will be sorry they did it." He added that he thought the Dow, which was then around 9,500, could be approaching a record high "in another 12 or 18 months." 
The criticism of Mr. O'Neill for such comments made Mr. Bush's off-the-cuff statements to reporters yesterday particularly surprising. Traditionally presidents stick to talking about the fundamentals of the economy -- as Mr. Bush has done repeatedly in recent weeks -- while steering clear of any suggestions about how markets will act.
About 18 months into his presidency, President Clinton talked at length about fluctuations in the dollar, and was warned by his chief economic adviser at the time, Robert E. Rubin, never to do it again -- because he would be blamed if the predictions went awry. Thereafter, Mr. Clinton usually heeded the suggestion. 
Mr. Bush's advisers have given him the same counsel, and he has usually steered clear of all market predictions. Only last week his press secretary, Ari Fleischer, criticizing television networks for running the stock market ticker on the screen as the president spoke about the economy, noted that the factors governing when markets rise and fall are so complex that most analysts who think they understand the process do not know what they are talking about. 
That did not stop Mr. Bush yesterday from speaking in terms usually heard from Wall Street strategists. "People will be buying the market based upon the value," he said. "And what's happening is corporate earnings are improving, so that the price-earnings ratios are improving. And I believe people are going to come back into the market."
Many on Wall Street agree with Mr. Bush that there is value in the market, but those messages recently have fallen on deaf ears among investors. Thomas McManus, a strategist at Banc of America Securities, pointed out yesterday morning that after last week's declines Dow Chemical had a dividend yield greater than that of a 10-year Treasury bond, something he said had never before happened. That did not stop Dow from falling $1.19, to $26.65. At that level, its annual dividend of $1.34 a share provides a yield of 5 percent, while the Treasury bond yields 4.45 percent.
The American market did seesaw during the day. After the president spoke, a rally pushed the Dow up more than 200 points and above Friday's close. But in the final two hours of trading the market fell sharply.
Most European markets suffered a worse day than the American market, with the leading indexes in Britain, Germany and France all down about 5 percent for the day.
Within the United States, the limited areas of strength were concentrated in companies whose businesses would suffer the least in a renewed recession -- companies that make products like razor blades, beer and soft drinks. Gillette rose $1.23, to $29; Anheuser-Busch added $1.67, to $45.67; and Coca-Cola gained 80 cents, to $45.89.
One market indicator of expectations for the worldwide economy is the price of copper. It has fallen from 78.6 cents a pound in early June to 70.2 cents yesterday, including a decline of 1.2 cents yesterday. But it remains well above 60.6 cents, the level it hit last November when economic pessimism was at a peak.
The economic concern now centers on the question of whether the American consumer, whose buying played a major role in making last year's recession a mild one, can keep spending. "There has been a lot of debt creation," Mr. McManus said. "The economy is too dependent on the consumer."
Mr. McManus said he still thought that stocks would rise, but "people should not have a high expectation of how much money they will make by December."
One benchmark of a sort was reached when the Nasdaq composite index fell below 1,300.12, the level it was at on Dec. 5, 1996, when the Federal Reserve chairman, Alan Greenspan, delivered his celebrated "irrational exuberance" speech. That index, which was the biggest beneficiary of the bubble, fell 36.50, or 2.8 percent, to 1,282.65, and is now 74.6 percent below its peak.
The Dow remains 21 percent higher than it was when Mr. Greenspan gave that speech, while the S.& P. 500 is 10 percent higher.
Many Americans say they are dedicated to the market for the long haul, and while mutual funds have been experiencing redemptions lately, they are on a much lower scale than in 1987, when that year's collapse of prices shocked investors. 
"If I was about to retire, I would be concerned," Jeff Greener, 39, a trust and estates lawyer, said yesterday as he watched the market move at a Manhattan office of Charles Schwab. "Hopefully my money will be there in 25 years." 
But the faith that the market will always come back, which grew in the years after 1987, as that crash preceded a great boom, has been shaken, and people seem less willing to "buy the dips," as the phrase went.
One measure of that is what happened yesterday, after the big sell-offs on Thursday and Friday. It was the first time since 1987 that the S.& P. 500 fell at least 2 percent a day in three consecutive sessions.
In 1987, the market fell sharply for three days at the end of a week, and then plunged on the following Monday. But since then, the market rallied on Monday every time that the Dow fell 3 percent or more on a Friday. That pattern was broken yesterday.
Jay Mueller, an economist and portfolio manager at Strong Investments, a mutual fund company, said call volume to his company was running about 20 percent above normal levels, and that over the last month there had been "some movement" away from stock funds and into bond funds. 
"It is not as if people are totally giving up on the stock market," he said, "but they are recalibrating their exposure."

HEADLINE: Downtown, An Exodus That Cash Can't Stop 

BYLINE:  By CHARLES V. BAGLI

 BODY:
No amount of money will keep some businesses downtown.
 City and state officials are finding that cheaper rents in Lower Manhattan and millions of dollars in cash grants and tax breaks from the government are not enough to keep companies like Aon, Pillsbury Winthrop, Dresdner Kleinwort Wasserstein and ABN Amro from defecting to more expensive quarters in Midtown, or to space in Brooklyn and Jersey City. 
 The New York Stock Exchange, American Express, Merrill Lynch, Goldman Sachs and others remain, but the recent trend of corporate relocations undermines the vitality of Lower Manhattan, the third-largest business district in the country, behind Midtown and Chicago. The relocations also raise questions about the effectiveness of government grants, money that could be used for transportation or electrical power projects that provide a broader benefit. 
With few prospects for filling up new skyscrapers, many urban planners and real estate executives say it would therefore be a huge mistake to replace the entire 11 million square feet of commercial space lost at the World Trade Center. Today, about one out of every five floors of downtown office space is empty, according to TenantWise.com, a real estate company.
A prominent real estate broker who has worked with many of the companies said: "Incentives don't retain people. What retains people is quality of life and transportation. That's why they should stop yakking about office buildings downtown and put the money into infrastructure and residential development."
The destruction of the trade center and the PATH train station linking New Jersey and Lower Manhattan have only exacerbated a long-running trend in which downtown banks, insurance companies and law firms have moved to Midtown. Robert D. Yaro, president of the Regional Plan Association, said it was time to fix longstanding transportation problems, which would help diversify the downtown economy.
"This is a 50-year-old problem, companies moving out of downtown," Mr. Yaro said. "Programs built around incentives don't deal with the fundamentals. The strategy downtown has to focus on making it accessible and nice. We've got to expand the residential population, create attractive public spaces and open new cultural institutions."
City and state officials have been trying to stabilize the downtown economy since the Sept. 11 attack and the decision by Lehman Brothers, Empire Blue Cross Blue Shield, Marsh & McLennan and others to move their offices to Midtown, Brooklyn and New Jersey.
The government's efforts have met with mixed success. Officials notified large employers recently that they will stop offering cash grants in September to companies that agree to keep a specific number of workers in Lower Manhattan for at least the next seven years. State and city officials, who had set aside $294 million for retention and attraction efforts, had focused on about 140 companies that employ more than 200 employees each and account for about 150,000 jobs.
In April, officials announced that Brown Brothers Harriman; Bank of Nova Scotia; Fried, Frank, Harris, Shriver & Jacobson; and 11 others had been given grants totaling $32.9 million, although they acknowledged that few, if any, had been in danger of leaving Lower Manhattan. Since then, about 10 other companies have gotten deals, and state officials hope to sign up another 20 or 30.
"We're telling companies that we'd like to wind down the retention aspect by the end of the summer, so we can turn our attention to the attraction aspect," said Andrew M. Alper, president of the city's Economic Development Corporation. "We've been pleased with the program so far. We've gotten a number of companies to make a long-term commitment to downtown."
But one-half to two-thirds of the large downtown employers are not interested in the deals. According to real estate brokers and company executives, many companies are unwilling to commit to specific job numbers at a time when layoffs are a distinct possibility, while others are waiting to see whether the state and city make good on promises to improve transit connections to New Jersey and Westchester County.
"The lack of response is telling us something: companies are unwilling to commit to a downtown location, at least for the time being," said M. Meyers Mermel, chief executive of TenantWise.
Mitchell L. Moss, director of the Taub Urban Research Center at New York University, added: "The fundamental problems facing Lower Manhattan are not solvable with handouts." More disturbing, brokers and urban planners said, was the fact that some companies have chosen to move from downtown to far more expensive space elsewhere.
"There's as much rationale for people moving out of downtown today as there is for what's happening in the stock market," said Mary Ann Tighe, president of the real estate broker CB Richard Ellis in the New York area. "One hopes it'll right itself soon."
Aon, an insurance company that lost 200 employees in the trade center attack, and some other companies are acceding to workers who do not want to return downtown, where they would be continually reminded of Sept. 11. Aon turned down a $5 million cash grant to keep all of its employees downtown, according to a top state official. Instead, the company signed a lease last week to move its executive suite and about 800 employees to Park Avenue Plaza, a tower on East 52nd Street, where real estate executives say the rent will cost $6 million a year more than at a building downtown. The tower will be renamed Aon Plaza. The company may keep a smaller contingent of workers in Lower Manhattan.
"Aon is a very cost-conscious company," said one executive who worked with Aon. "But this was a pure human resources decision. They wanted to keep people focused on their jobs and not on worrying about coming in to work every day."
The departures are continuing. Dresdner Kleinwort Wasserstein, a large financial company, is leaving 75 Wall Street and consolidating in Midtown. Barclay Bank is also considering a move uptown, several executives said.
And Pillsbury Winthrop, after more than a century downtown, is negotiating to move to a new tower in Times Square, where, brokers said, its annual rent will double. People who know the proposed terms say that the firm will pay more than $5 million a year in rent above what it would have paid downtown.
The state and the city offered Pillsbury Winthrop a $1.8 million grant to keep its 400 lawyers downtown, but the firm has not found the money enticing. The partners are willing to absorb the higher costs in order to be closer to their corporate clients and, for those who live in Westchester and Connecticut, to the commuter trains at Grand Central Terminal, according to brokers and lawyers at the firm.
Gregg Lorberbaum, a managing principal of the Staubach real estate company, said, "At the end of the day, certain tenants are going to make a lifestyle choice."

HEADLINE: San Francisco to Vote on City's Growing Medicinal Marijuana 

BYLINE:  By EVELYN NIEVES 

DATELINE: SAN FRANCISCO, July 23 

 BODY:
The city that helped create the proposition in 1996 that made California the first state to legalize medical marijuana may start growing its own.
 In a move toward making San Francisco the first city to defy openly the federal ban on growing marijuana for any reason, the Board of Supervisors approved a ballot measure on Monday that would explore growing marijuana on public property as a way around the Federal Drug Enforcement Administration's continual closing of medical marijuana clubs. 
 The measure was drafted by Supervisor Mark Leno, a Democratic candidate for the State Assembly who said he was fed up watching federal agents shut clubs that dispense marijuana for seriously ill and dying people. 
"Our clubs have been continuously intimidated and assaulted," Mr. Leno said, adding that one club had closed because of fear of federal prosecution.
If voters pass the measure on Nov. 5, the supervisors would be able to explore the hows and wheres of growing marijuana. Mr. Leno suggested that vacant city property might be used and that the program could be agricultural job training for the unemployed. 
Federal authorities were not amused. "Unless Congress changes the law and makes marijuana a legal substance, then we have to do our job and enforce the law," said a spokesman for the regional office of the Drug Enforcement Administration. 
The measure has a strong chance of passing. San Francisco has long been in the forefront of expanding medical marijuana rights. The district attorney has made the issue a chief cause. The chief of the Public Health Department has prescribed marijuana for AIDS patients to ease side effects of medications, and medical marijuana clubs have openly operated in residential neighborhoods without problems.
Last year, the city declared itself a sanctuary for the use, cultivation and distribution of medical marijuana, a symbolic defiance of an expected federal crackdown. The state attorney general, Bill Lockyer, who has supported the state's medical marijuana law, has left its use to local jurisdictions. A spokeswoman suggested that Mr. Lockyer would do the same if San Francisco began growing medicinal marijuana.

HEADLINE: U.N. Report Says New Democracies Falter 

BYLINE:  By BARBARA CROSSETTE 

DATELINE: UNITED NATIONS, July 23 

 BODY:
The United Nations is warning this week that gains made with the emergence of dozens of democracies over the past decade now risk being reversed, with authoritarian leaders manipulating elections and millions losing faith in democratic systems.
 In dozens of nations, democratic culture -- allowing room for political opposition, a free press and robust citizens' action groups -- is failing to develop or is being stifled, a report to be released on Wednesday concludes. 
 The study, "Human Development Report 2002: Deepening Democracy in a Fragmented World," also found that economic slowdowns in many countries add to a popular perception that democracies cannot deliver better lives.
"Since 1980, 81 countries have moved into the democratic column and, indeed, some 33 military governments have been replaced by civilian governments," said Mark Malloch Brown, administrator of the United Nations Development Program, which published the report. In comments to reporters last week, he added that 140 of about 200 countries have held multiparty elections. 
"The concern is that one multiparty election does not a democracy make," he said. "The international cheerleaders for democracy have underestimated what it takes to build a functioning, properly rooted democracy."
The program's annual Human Development Report was created in 1990 to measure the progress of nations not in dry economic statistics but in the lives of ordinary citizens. Over the objections of some governments, in rich as well as poor countries, the report has become increasingly pointed in its criticisms of political chicanery, corruption and human rights abuses.
The report ranks countries by quality of life, based largely on life expectancy, education and personal incomes. This year Norway ranks first, as it did last year, followed by Sweden, Canada, Belgium, Australia and the United States. 
The countries at the bottom of the index are all sub-Saharan African. Sierra Leone, where life expectancy stands at barely 39 years, is worst, followed by Niger, Burundi, Mozambique and Burkina Faso. The report will be available at www.undp.org.
Choosing democracy as its focus this year, the report concluded that although a majority of the world's people live in at least nominal democracies, in 106 countries political freedoms and civil rights are limited, and, since 1990, civil wars have cost 3.6 million lives. About 2.8 billion of the world's 6 billion people live on less than $2 a day. More than 60 countries have lower per capita incomes now than they did in 1990. 
"Democracy doesn't seem to be responding to the real agenda of the world's poor," Mr. Malloch Brown said. The report says that money politics serving special interest groups is of concern to voters in democracies as divergent as the United States, where corporate contributions rose to $1.2 billion in the 2000 election, and India, where 80 percent of funds for major political parties in a 1996 election came from large corporations.
Voter turnout seems to be declining everywhere, the report found. Polls often show a dwindling confidence in democracy and the free market, most recently in Latin America, the report said. The failure of rich nations to expand free trade rapidly enough to make a difference to struggling economies is a factor in this, United Nations officials say. 
Sometimes, the report found, new democratic hopes unmet by elected governments lead to public disgust for the system and regression to military rule. Experts often cite the example of Pakistan, where corrupt and inefficient elected governments in the 1990's were exposed and hammered by a free press. One result was little public opposition to the takeover of government by Gen. Pervez Musharraf in 1999.
More recently in Zimbabwe, a suspect election has contributed to a precipitous economic slide and laid the ground for political strife. 
Looking around the world, the 2002 Human Development report found banks, courts and government institutions under strain, often because of corruption or political pressures. It found electoral processes subverted by fraud and heavy-handed politics. 
Perhaps sensing their vulnerability, many governments are asking the United Nations Development Program for more help in handling law and order. 
The organization, which is involved in training police officers in Afghanistan, Mozambique and Haiti, will spend 60 percent of its aid budget this year on supporting what is generally called "good governance" -- the proper functioning of democratic institutions, including parliaments. Only a few decades ago, the bulk of the money went to more traditional development projects like drilling wells or aiding local public services.

HEADLINE: A Yellow House? Well, We Can't Have That 

BYLINE:  By EVELYN NIEVES 

DATELINE: EL DORADO HILLS, Calif., July 20 

 BODY:
The property values police here had just resolved a case of a flagrantly yellow house when they found themselves with another one, hiding in plain sight on Woedee Drive. 
 Two months ago, the El Dorado Hills Design Review Committee, which scrutinizes all things aesthetic in this fast-growing Sacramento suburb, had taken a homeowner to task for having a yellow house. The homeowner had applied for approval for a new roof, and the review committee, composed of five citizen volunteers, found upon inspection that the house was indeed yellow. That, like most other colors, was a no-no, they said, in the beige-tan-toned neighborhood. 
 The committee demanded that the homeowner paint her house an earth tone before it would approve a new roof. She did, but not before pointing out that her house, yellow when she bought it, was not alone in its yellowness. 
That led, ultimately, to Melinda and Joe Bula's yellow house, and to the great yellow house debate embroiling this quintessentially upwardly mobile suburb. While corporate accounting scandals are threatening the nation's economy and the stock market is dancing the limbo, the biggest issue in El Dorado Hills is whether yellow should be allowed to enter the color scheme.
The issue has prompted school children to write essays on why yellow is good and the local newspapers to write editorials asking "Since when is yellow a crime?" Color choice is even expected to become a campaign issue for members of the five-member board of the El Dorado Hills Special Services District who are up for re-election in November. 
El Dorado Hills is hardly the only community in the country to dictate what its residents can and cannot do to their property. But some here say the local situation is a glaring example of what can happen when rules go out of control.
Residents of El Dorado Hills must abide by a set of covenants, conditions and restrictions, known as CCNR's, when they buy a house. Each new development comes with a different set of rules, so that El Dorado Hills has more than 90 CCNR's for a town of 20,000 residents. Residents on one side of a street may be allowed to park a boat in their driveway -- El Dorado Hills is by Folsom Lake, and many homeowners own boats -- while residents on the other side, in another subdivision, may not.
Many of the rules are vaguely written, and subjectively interpreted, El Dorado Hills officials say. 
"Paint color is usually not a big issue," said Wayne Lowery, manager of El Dorado Hills. "But yellow can be. A lot of it is a matter of where do you draw the line? Although yellow may be an O.K. color in some neighborhoods, if you allow yellow, then when a guy comes in and says he likes purple, where do you draw the line?"
The Bulas' five-bedroom farmhouse is the white-yellow of the sun at noon on a summer day. Set back from the road by a generous lawn of crew-cut grass and coiffed perennials, it is far enough from the beige-tan-pinkish houses on either side not to stand out like a sore yellow thumb.
The house was yellow when the Bulas bought it six years ago. That yellow was close to the yellow they used to repaint most of the house, so close that a person cannot tell where the old yellow ends and the new begins. But the review committee rejected it anyway. That has set in motion a fight for yellow rights that the Bulas say they are prepared to take all the way to court.
"The only thing stupider than fighting it," said Joe Bula, a troubleshooter for Pacific Electric and Gas, "is not fighting it."
The Bulas have appealed the design review committee's rejection to the El Dorado Hills board. The board plans to rule on the appeal after a task force finishes its review of all the rules in all the subdivisions in the district. That may take another two months.
Meanwhile, the Bulas have won the public relations battle. The Sacramento Bee recently opined: "When homeowners such as Melinda Bula give our eyes a break from boring beige, they deserve three cheers and a free pass from the color cops." Neighbors and strangers routinely stop by the house to give the Bulas pep talks. Melinda Bula, a quilter and wallpaper designer who also works as a color consultant, says she is always on the phone fielding calls from supporters.
"Everyone," she said, "says the same thing: 'You've got to fight this.' "
John Loveless, a transportation engineer who heads the review committee, said the panel decided on the Bula house following the rules in its handbook. "Article 7, Section 5," Mr. Loveless said, "clearly states that no primary colors -- yellow, red, or blue -- are allowed."
The Bulas are nonetheless clearly feeling like freedom fighters. Standing outside their house the other day, Mrs. Bula pointed out their white picket fence. The review committee has flagged it as a violation because it is made of plastic.
First yellow, she said, "then the white picket fence."

One Crash Wall Street Doesn't Notice

BYLINE:  By MATTHEW PURDY

DATELINE: FAIRFIELD, Conn. 

 BODY:
AT first, Jessica Zenquis sounds like another suburbanite with a bad case of market angst.
 Her finances are precarious. The employment outlook is bleak. Her credit cards are maxed out. Looking around her home on a quiet street in this pearl of a suburb, she said: "It's nice, but I could lose it. There's no safety net." 
 Ms. Zenquis's adventure is not the boom and fizzle of the stock market. There is another economic drama that began in the wonder days of the 1990's, which, depending on your station in life, is as riveting as the stock market follies: The end of welfare as we knew it.
Ms. Zenquis, 24, escaped foster care and domestic abuse in Trenton in the mid-1990's, arriving in Bridgeport a single teenage mother of a young son. "This was as far as my money took me," she said.
Living in shelters and in decrepit housing projects, Ms. Zenquis supported herself and her son, Maney, now 7, alternately with jobs as a security guard and in retail and through welfare payments. Maney's father, who had provided some child support, recently declared bankruptcy.
More than a year ago, the state dropped Ms. Zenquis from its welfare rolls, making her another statistic in the win column of welfare reform.
Of all the states, Connecticut has among the shortest timetables for moving off welfare -- 21 months -- and among the steepest drops in those on welfare, to 22,500 today from nearly 58,000 in 1996.
In Washington, the welfare law is up for reauthorization, and with it comes debate about how former recipients have fared. Connecticut is a good place to look because some reform advocates consider it a model. A state study of a sample of recipients shows that more than 80 percent who got jobs were still working six months later and earning substantially more than they had on welfare.
But a private study by the Bridgeport Child Advocacy Coalition, using statewide data, reported last week that just 22 percent of recipients who got employment-skills training found a job and kept it for six months. The coalition, which represents 77 social service groups around Bridgeport, reported that just 37 percent were earning more than the federal poverty level for a family of three. 
Maria Sanchez, 29, a single mother of three in a litter-strewn Bridgeport housing project, said she received $1,159 a month in welfare and food assistance until two years ago. To fulfill her state job training requirements, she looked for work at local fast food restaurants, but had little luck because she spoke no English. She finally found work at a school cafeteria and as a crossing guard, for a total of $838 a month.
She says the obvious: "The money's not enough."
SUDDENLY that's everyone's complaint, from former stock market winners to former welfare recipients. On the short end of the economy, effects are more noticeable.
Connecticut's welfare rolls shrank by 28 percent in the boom year of 1998, but by just 4 percent last year. That's at least partly a result of the slow economy, as is the brisk business at Operation Hope, an agency in Fairfield that combats homelessness. "Last year we heard from 70 people a month who needed assistance," said Meghan K. Lowney, the executive director. "This year we're hearing from 140 people."
Operation Hope helped Jessica Zenquis find her federally subsidized apartment. But like President Bush trying to improve the market by saying it's better, the organization can't overcome other circumstances buffeting Ms. Zenquis.
She left high school at 14, but got an equivalency diploma and has worked toward a degree at a local community college, even though welfare workers repeatedly told her that the rules demand that she pursue work, not college.
Now, with her child support threatened, welfare gone and credit cards canceled, she's job-hunting in an unforgiving economy, and wondering when she will ever finish her last five college classes.
She understands welfare reform, coming from a dependent family. "There were abuses," Ms. Zenquis said. "But now I can't get an education because I have a messed-up family background and I'm a single mother?"
Emotionally, Ms. Zenquis is battle-scarred. Financially, she's broke. But having survived the system -- child welfare, public housing, public assistance -- she's got a better attitude than the average Wall Street investor.
"I'm an optimist," she said. "I know one day I'm going to be O.K., and there aren't going to be these worries."
