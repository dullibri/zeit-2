HEADLINE: One Man's Rotten Economy Is Another Man's Inspiration. Discuss.

BYLINE: By CHARLES ISHERWOOD

 BODY:
It sounds pretty funny today. The money manager, shiny as a new coin and oozing confidence, is making a pitch to a potential client. The fund he's urging her to invest in is a once-in-a-lifetime offer. Why, this year alone it earned 27 percent! And of course it's rock-solid stuff, all invested in real estate. 
 ''You live in a house, right?'' oily manager asks. 
 ''I live in a house,'' skeptical investor replies. 
 ''Perfect, then you understand,'' he snaps back. ''White, blue shutters, a cat purring in the window -- a house, houses. It's not some optical doo-dad or cancer-blasting light bulb. If people keep living indoors -- and why wouldn't they? -- then this thing should just keep returning. 27, 21, 24, 30.''
 Heh, heh. Yesterday's glistening financial opportunity is today's easy punch line. So it goes in the dreary days of ''The Great Recession,'' as some have called the global economic doldrums of the last year and change. The Flea Theater has borrowed this catchy sobriquet for a collection of new short plays inspired by our annus horribilis, with contributions from Will Eno, Adam Rapp, Itamar Moses and others. 
 The chipper exchange above, from Mr. Eno's ''Unum,'' directed by the Flea's artistic director, Jim Simpson, is the highlight of a mostly low-interest evening. Writing to theme can be challenging, and most of the work here feels sketchy, unfocused or simply banal. 
 Even ''Unum'' does not represent Mr. Eno, the talented author of ''Thom Paine (based on nothing),'' at his most inspired. A scattered series of scenes following the progress of a dollar bill, it only really catches fire in the exchange cited above, which grows more antic and amusing as the doggedly dubious would-be investor -- or ''Chicken Little,'' as the money manager jokingly calls her -- keeps asking pointed questions. Eventually the manager whips out a dollar bill.
 ''You know why all that stuff's in Latin?'' he asks. ''Because this is the greatest country in the world. We're not afraid to have some dead foreign language on our money. Bring it on, put some Sanskrit on there, for all we care. America. Americans. Rising tides. The sky's the limit.''
 Mr. Rapp's contribution, ''Classic Kitchen Timer,'' which opens the evening on a macabre note, explores the outer limits of the desperation of the dispossessed. A cadre of suspender-wearing, brown-shirted fellows, reminiscent of Malcolm McDowell's merry band in ''A Clockwork Orange,'' is orchestrating a ''social experiment'' to which we are witness.
 The participant is a woman who has recently lost her job and who has been offered a princely sum, $25,000, to perform a grisly act of violence. (The baby in the bassinet sort of tips you off.) The only way she can be stopped is if somebody in the audience murders her before the timer on the table rings.
 Bleak as this little morsel is, it is not nearly as doomy as ''Recess,'' by Sheila Callaghan, vaguely set in a squat of the damned, where various miserable, disturbed and desperate characters have apparently taken refuge. A limp exercise in stylized shockery reminiscent of the work of Sarah Kane, the play mostly consists of either gruesomely comic or just plain gruesome behavior.
 One woman exercises until she drops, literally. In a back corner two people have sex. Another couple is playing a silly game of footsie. The most productive fellow is killing time by making a list of ''times I wish I was drunk,'' including ''plane turbulence,'' ''talking to my mother'' and ''listening to music from college.'' 
 Oh, and there's a corpse on the floor, oozing blood from a head wound, to which nobody pays any particular attention. Eventually this unmerry band gathers for a fantasy dinner during which two hot dogs are divvied up, as the ''chef'' describes a fabulous Italian meal. 
 The title of ''Severed,'' by Erin Courtney, also evokes the work of Ms. Kane, but the play is a lighter-spirited comedy about two people sharing thoughts as they wait to be filmed for a documentary about the recession. Polka Dot (Amy Jackson) is a bohemian who makes a minor living working with children, and needs the hundred bucks she'll get for giving her spiel about the tough times. Suit (Ronald Washington) is an aspiring entrepreneur. 
 Their friendly colloquy, which culminates in an unexpected kiss, takes place against a background of testimonials from the documentary. Slight but more likable than most of the entries here, the play makes a quiet comment on the possibility for positive change -- or at least unexpected twists -- that the calamity has brought with it.
 The other two plays ring changes on the same theme to less pleasant effect. ''New York Living,'' by Thomas Bradshaw, is a putative comedy about a trust-fund actor who decides that he likes his co-star better than his girlfriend. Used to having things his way, and knowing that his girlfriend can't afford her own apartment, he suggests that she move in with his director. Uncertain in style and irksomely coarse, the play aims for Christopher Durang-style daring but misses the mark. 
 I can't share the title of the contribution from Mr. Moses, about another well-off fellow who decides that he wants to offload his girlfriend. It's a harsh past participle, but it's the only provocative thing about this mostly banal tale of a breakup. Like most of the other plays in ''The Great Recession,'' it feels like a dashed-off commission that doesn't pay much in the way of aesthetic dividends to the audience.

HEADLINE: In Bolivia, Water and Ice Tell A Story of a Changing Climate

BYLINE: By ELISABETH ROSENTHAL; Jean Friedman-Rudovsky contributed reporting from El Alto, Bolivia.

DATELINE: EL ALTO, Bolivia 

 BODY:
When the tap across from her mud-walled home dried up in September, Celia Cruz stopped making soups and scaled back washing for her family of five. She began daily pilgrimages to better-off neighborhoods, hoping to find water there. 
 Though she has lived here for a decade and her husband, a construction worker, makes a decent wage, money cannot buy water.
 ''I'm thinking of moving back to the countryside; what else can I do?'' said Ms. Cruz, 33, wearing traditional braids and a long tiered skirt as she surveyed a courtyard dotted with piglets, bags of potatoes and an ancient red Datsun. ''Two years ago this was never a problem. But if there's not water, you can't live.''
 The glaciers that have long provided water and electricity to this part of Bolivia are melting and disappearing, victims of global warming, most scientists say. 
 If the water problems are not solved, El Alto, a poor sister city of La Paz, could perhaps be the first large urban casualty of climate change. A World Bank report concluded last year that climate change would eliminate many glaciers in the Andes within 20 years, threatening the existence of nearly 100 million people. 
 For the nearly 200 nations trying to hammer out an international climate accord in Copenhagen, the question of how to address the needs of dozens of countries like Bolivia is a central focus of the negotiations and a major obstacle to a treaty.
 World leaders have long agreed that rich nations must provide money and technology to help developing nations adapt to problems that, to a large extent, have been created by smokestacks and tailpipes far away. But the specifics of that transfer -- which countries will pay, how much and for what kinds of projects -- remain contentious.
 Last week, a group of the poorest small countries debated whether they would stage a walk-out in Copenhagen if rich nations failed to provide enough money. Todd Stern, the lead negotiator for the United States, while reiterating that the United States would help pay, bridled at the idea that the money was a ''climate debt.'' And on Friday, the European Unionmade an initial pledge to pay $3.5 billion annually for three years to help poor countries cope -- though economists project the total cost to be $100 billion or more.
 An Angry Voice
 With its recent climate-induced catastrophes, Bolivia has become an angry voice for poor nations, demanding that any financing be paid out in full and rapidly. 
 ''We have a big problem and even money won't completely solve it,'' said Pablo Solon, Bolivia's ambassador to the United Nations. ''What do you do when your glacier disappears or your island is under water?'' 
 Scientists say that money and engineering could solve La Paz-El Alto's water problems, with projects including a well-designed reservoir. The glaciers that ring the cities have essentially provided natural low-maintenance storage, collecting water in the short rainy season and releasing it for water and electricity in the long dry one. With warmer temperatures and changing rainfall, they no longer do so.
 ''The effects are appearing much more rapidly than we can respond to them, and a reservoir takes five to seven years to build. I'm not sure we have that long,'' said Edson Ramirez, a Bolivian glaciologist who has documented and projected the glaciers' retreat for two decades.
 The retreat has outpaced his wildest dreams. He had predicted that one glacier, Chacaltaya, would last until 2020. It disappeared this year. . 
 But global warming alone cannot be blamed for the longstanding woes of this exotic but desperately poor landlocked country, where per capita income is around $1,000. Urban water supplies are also taxed by population growth as well as checkered management, in part because there is little money to manage anything, but also because the government nationalized the water company a few years ago, having declared water a human right. El Alto still does not employ a full-time water technician.
 Populations at the Brink
 ''These are populations at the brink of surviving anyway, and then you have the extra stress of climate change and you have huge social problems,'' said Dirk Hoffmann, head of the climate change program at the Universidad Mayor de San Andres in La Paz. ''What's at stake is conflict -- you wouldn't talk about civil war exactly. But it will be unrest.'' 
 In fact, when taps dried up in Celia Cruz's neighborhood, the Solidarity District of El Alto, rich La Paz residents still had water. In a nation that has rallied behind socialist rhetoric and indigenous rights, there were complaints. ''The sense of injustice is palpable,'' said Edwin Chuquimia Velez, an official in El Alto formerly in charge of water.
 Glaciers are part of the majestic landscape here, visible from almost everywhere in the neighboring cities of La Paz and El Alto, each with one million people. Their disappearance from certain vistas is as startling to Bolivians as the absence of the twin towers is to New Yorkers. 
 ''To see this change fills me with sadness. It fills me with pain,'' said Gonzalo Jaimes, a climbing guide from La Paz. 
 Chacaltaya, at 17,500 feet, was the world's highest ski area from 1939 until 2005, when the glacier retreated beyond the slopes. The lodge, still stocked with rental gear and decorated with ski murals, sits mostly abandoned.
 For residents, water has been the biggest issue. Though the region's electricity comes from hydroelectric plants, these depend heavily on rainfall and water from the Amazon, so power loss has so far not been a problem.
 In Khapi, a village two hours' drive from La Paz, people regard the Illimani glacier as ''our God, our great protector,'' said Mario Ariquipa Laso, 55, a wizened farmer who grows potatoes and corn on sheer slopes in the shadow of the glacier. Ten years ago, it provided a steady, gentle stream during dry months to keep crops watered. Today, with Illimani in retreat, water ''just pours'' off the glacier, a yellowish mix.
 ''A lot of us think about not having kids anymore,'' said Margarita Limachi Alvarez, 46, a blue Andean cap with ear flaps pulled over her head. ''Without water or food, how would we survive? A hundred miles away, in a middle-class neighborhood of El Alto, water has also become a gnawing concern. From September through November, the taps gave forth at best eight hours a day, often with little pressure. 
 ''Sometimes you didn't have it in the morning. Sometimes you didn't have it in the evening -- you never knew,'' said Julia Torrez, 31 and eight months pregnant, in a neat sitting room furnished with plaid couches and hung with oil paintings. When the tap started spurting, she recalled, she ran to fill an array of buckets and jugs, an incongruous routine for this family of jeans-wearing, college-educated professionals. 
 In the last few years, Bolivian lives have also been buffeted by an almost biblical array of extreme weather events, many of which scientists believe are probably linked to climate change. This year brought scorching temperatures and intense sun. A drought killed 7,000 farm animals and sickened nearly 100,000.
 Severe Storms
 Severe storms normally associated with El Nino periods, every seventh year, now occur regularly. Warmer temperatures mean new crop pests -- crickets and worms -- as well as diseases like malaria and dengue fever. 
 On a recent morning in Huaricana, a village an hour from La Paz, people used rocks and timber to repair a road bisected by a 40-foot-wide river of mud delivered by a potent storm..
 ''This has only been happening the last three years,'' said Oswaldo Vargas, 55, as he towed a public bus across the mud with his Fiat tractor. 
 Developed countries agree that they have an obligation to help relieve such stresses, but many remain hesitant to release funds, in part because poor countries have few concrete plans to address climate problems. But with little cash or expertise, it is hard to plan a giant new reservoir or a system to transfer water from one part of the country to another. Bolivia's poor, said Edwin Torrez Soria, an engineer with Aqua Sustentable, who works with villages near the Illimani glacier, ''aren't responsible for what's happening to the glacier but they suffer the most, and unfortunately the government doesn't have much of a plan.''

NEW YORK ON LESS:
 Salad Lover Starts
 A Place in Harlem
 For the decade that Milo Meed has lived in Harlem, he has been frustrated with the lack of healthy food. 
 Watching his 11-year-old son, Danny, grow up, he grew even more concerned, as he noticed far more obese children north of 96th Street.
 For a few years, he tried to convince businesses to fix this problem. As a consultant to small businesses in Harlem, he suggested that they open a restaurant specializing in salads. Then he reached out to more than a dozen healthy food chains to see whether they would expand onto 125th Street. 
 But no one was interested.
 So Mr. Meed took Harlem's need for more healthy eating options into his own hands. He opened Island Salads, a Caribbean-theme salad bar and juice cafe, cheered on by his mother, his pastor and workers from the Upper Manhattan Empowerment Zone Development Corporation, which provided him with $181,406 to help start the business.
 ''I got tired of going to 96th and 86th Streets to get a salad,'' he said at the opening last week.
 Mr. Meed said he could not have started the salad bar without help from his landlord, Nina Day, who offered him a discount on rent for the space, once occupied by a dry cleaner. But then, Ms. Day had been hankering for a local place with good tuna wraps. 
 He also thanked Ellingston Clark of the development corporation for his advice, like creating an open refrigerator where customers could see the greens.
 He said he was confident about the restaurant's future, despite the recession.
 ''I'm a big salad person,'' he said. ''It's a needed product and service. Even though there is a recession, the business should be successful, because there's a void in the market.''
 Still, Mr. Meed is preoccupied with getting local residents to even step into his shop. The grandnephew of the former Jamaican prime minister Donald Sangster, Mr. Meed tried to incorporate Caribbean themes into the restaurant's design and its salads by offering choices like the Asian Rasta and an island chicken jerk salad.
 He is planning Diabetes Mondays, when those who bring a customer with diabetes receive one salad free. He also offers free meals for children of customers who buy a salad on Tuesdays between 6 and 8 pm., and he hopes to attract more children and teachers from the Harlem Children's Zone school nearby.
 He admits that he probably could have made more money selling meals that were not so healthy.
 ''There are better ways to make a dollar,'' he said. ''It's really about the community.'' CHRISTINE HAUGHNEY

HEADLINE: With End in Sight, Issues to Watch

BYLINE: By DAVID M. HERSZENHORN

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
It's crunch time.
 As Senate Democrats await new cost projections from the Congressional Budget Office on their latest effort to settle the major internal disagreements over the health care legislation, they are also positioning themselves for a lightning-quick dash to the finish. 
 ''There's not much time left,'' said Senator Ron Wyden, Democrat of Oregon. ''Right now, you are at the crucial hour. It's the part of the game when you have got it on the line.'' 
 The big sticking point has been over a proposed government-run insurance plan, or public option. The budget office is analyzing a compromise idea to create at least two national health plans modeled after those for federal workers and members of Congress. 
 If the cost figures are on target -- and Democrats can iron out new disagreements, including those over a companion proposal to allow some people ages 55 to 64 to buy coverage through Medicare -- the majority leader, Harry Reid of Nevada, is expected to push quickly to end debate and hold final votes. 
 And the legislative process, which seemed to bog down repeatedly over the last two weeks of nonstop floor debate, could suddenly end up finished in a breathless blur. Beyond the public option, here are other unresolved issues to keep an eye on. 
 ABORTION Senate Democrats worked through the weekend to hammer out a deal over the divisive issue of insurance coverage for abortions. The goal on all sides is to remain consistent with existing law and prevent federal money from paying for abortions. 
 The House-passed health care bill includes tight restrictions, barring abortion coverage in any health plan that is even partly paid for with new federal subsidies to help people afford insurance. The Senate rejected a proposal to adopt that language. 
 Ever since, Democratic leaders have tried to chart a middle course that would satisfy opponents of abortion rights, most importantly Senator Ben Nelson, Democrat of Nebraska, without angering abortion rights supporters who oppose any new restrictions. 
 COST CONTAINMENT Democrats face a barrage of Republican criticism over the cost of the bill, and the outcry grew louder last week when the chief actuary of the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services said the bill would increase overall health spending. 
 Senators Susan Collins, Republican of Maine, Joseph I. Lieberman, independent of Connecticut, and Arlen Specter, Democrat of Pennsylvania, have put forward an amendment that would speed up the starting date of provisions aimed at lowering costs. 
 This self-proclaimed tripartisan group has proposed that new penalties on hospitals over preventable infections begin in 2013 rather than 2015 and that a new pilot program to ''bundle'' Medicare payments to hospitals begin by Jan. 1, 2012, not 2013. 
 In addition, a group of freshman Democratic senators has proposed an amendment that includes an array of changes meant to further reduce health care spending, including added authority for a new commission charged with identifying savings in Medicare. 
 SMALL BUSINESS America's small businesses have some powerful advocates: Senators Olympia J. Snowe, Republican of Maine; Mary L. Landrieu, Democrat of Louisiana; and Blanche Lincoln, Democrat of Arkansas. The White House is courting all those votes.
 On Wednesday, Mrs. Lincoln and Ms. Landrieu held a news conference to unveil a package of amendments intended to help small businesses. Ms. Snowe has had several meetings at the White House where she conveyed her views directly to President Obama. 
 While Mr. Reid has made no public statement, it is clear that the final Senate bill will include robust provisions to help small businesses afford benefits for their workers, enhanced tax breaks and reduced penalties if they fail to meet new mandates. 
 CADILLAC TAX The Senate bill includes a 40 percent excise tax on high-priced health insurance policies. The tax would apply to the price of self-only policies above $8,500 and to family policies above $23,000, in an effort to rein in runaway spending. 
 The White House has identified this proposal as a crucial component of the health legislation, and economists say it may be the one provision that takes a step toward controlling medical inflation. Mr. Reid has already weakened it and may do so again. 
 The original proposal, approved by the Senate Finance Committee, had set lower thresholds -- $8,000 for individuals and $21,000 for families. But an amendment put forward by Northern liberals seeks to raise the thresholds to $9,500 and $25,000. 
 Organized labor, an important Democratic constituency, opposes the excise tax because it will hit some generous union health plans. House Democrats did not include the tax in their health care bill, even though Mr. Obama has endorsed the idea. 
 Whether Mr. Reid holds firm will be a crucial test of his commitment to the goal of slowing the upward spiral of the nation's medical spending. 
 CHILDREN Children's health is a top priority for two important Democrats, Senators John D. Rockefeller IV of West Virginia and Bob Casey of Pennsylvania. Mr. Rockefeller is a strong voice for liberals; Mr. Casey will be central to a deal on abortion. 
 Both Mr. Casey and Mr. Rockefeller have fought to maintain the existing Children's Health Insurance Program. 
 ''I have said from the beginning of this debate, and even before the debate began many months ago, that the standard ought to be four words: no child worse off,'' Mr. Casey said in a floor speech. ''I think it is a standard we can meet.'' 
 Mr. Casey and Mr. Rockefeller have pressed for government financing for the program through 2015 -- a two-year extension from current law. Depending on the budget office analysis, the cost could prove to be prohibitive. If so, Mr. Reid may look to strike a deal. 
 CHOICE Senators Wyden and Collins and Senator Evan Bayh, Democrat of Indiana, have put forward amendments aimed at increasing health insurance choices across the board. 
 The latest Democratic compromise, to create national nonprofit plans like those offered to federal employees, moves in that direction. But Mr. Wyden wants to do more for people who struggle to afford benefits offered by their employers.

HEADLINE: Drastic Cuts Are Expected As M.T.A. Unveils Budget

BYLINE: By MICHAEL M. GRYNBAUM

 BODY:
Fewer subway trains will run in the middle of the day, late at night and on weekends. Two lines will stop running altogether. And New York City's students may soon be expected to pay a full fare to ride on the city's public transit system. 
 These are among the drastic recommendations expected to be revealed on Monday by the Metropolitan Transportation Authority, as the beleaguered agency unveils a newly austere budget meant to address a sudden financial shortfall of more than $400 million.
 The plan, which does not include a fare increase in 2010, will be presented at a meeting of the Finance Committee of the authority's board by its chairman, Jay H. Walder, who is facing a severe financial crisis just three months after assuming his post. The budget is subject to approval by the full board on Wednesday.
 The drumbeat of bad news for the authority has arrived this month in startlingly quick fashion. 
 Days after state lawmakers approved a revised budget that reduced mass transit financing by $143 million, the authority learned that another source of revenue -- a tax on some employers' payrolls -- would provide $200 million less than anticipated. 
 The problems were compounded late Friday, when a State Supreme Court judge upheld an arbitration ruling awarding 11.5 percent raises to transit workers over the next three years. The ruling was a sharp blow to the authority, which had hoped to avoid paying out an additional $300 million in labor costs through 2011. ''Last month's fragile financial picture has turned perilous,'' the authority said in a statement over the weekend.
 Under the plan, service on dozens of bus routes will be cut back or eliminated, off-peak trains will run less frequently, and the W and Z subway lines will disappear, a move that includes the overnight closing of several stations along Broadway in Lower Manhattan. 
 Those cuts were approved late last year when the authority first faced serious financial problems. The package of service reductions seemed to be off the table after a last-minute bailout from state legislators in May, but officials expect to revive nearly all of them in the new budget being presented on Monday. 
 In addition, Access-a-Ride services for disabled riders would be scaled back, and free bus and subway rides for the city's students could disappear, officials said. State and city contributions to the program have flat-lined since the 1990s, and the authority may no longer be able to afford the difference. The Daily News reported the elimination of the student discounts on Saturday.
 ''To have this situation in the most transit-dependent city in the country is a complete failure of government,'' said Andrew Albert, chairman of the New York City Transit Riders Council and a member of the authority's board.
 Mr. Walder has charged leaders at the various arms of the authority to find ways to save money on administrative costs. 
 Although Mr. Walder has pledged not to raise fares in 2010, increases of 7.5 percent are already planned for 2011 and 2013. Fares and tolls rose about 10 percent this summer.

HEADLINE: 'Smart' Electric Utility Meters, Intended to Create Savings, Instead Prompt Revolt

BYLINE: By MATTHEW L. WALD

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
Millions of households across America are taking a first step into the world of the ''smart grid,'' as their power companies install meters that can tell them how much electricity they are using hour by hour -- and sometimes, appliance by appliance. But not everyone is happy about it.
 Customers in California are in open revolt, and officials in Connecticut and Texas are questioning whether the rush to install meters benefits the public. 
 Some consumers argue that the meters are logging far more kilowatt hours than they believe they are using. And many find it unfair that they will begin to pay immediately for the new meters through higher rates, when the promised savings could be years away. 
 Power companies say the meters will allow utilities to vary the price charged to their customers by the hour to correspond to what those utilities are paying for energy in the wholesale market. This can help consumers save money, they say.
 They also say the meters will be crucial to remaking the electric system to handle intermittent power sources like wind turbines and solar cells while continuously meeting customers' needs.
 Pacific Gas & Electric, which distributes power to Northern and Central California, has so far installed four million meters in households and businesses and plans to install six million more within the next three years. The meters cost the utility roughly $220 apiece, including installation.
 Elizabeth Keogh, a retired social worker in Bakersfield, Calif., who describes herself as ''a bit chintzy,'' has created a spreadsheet with 26 years of electric bills for her modest house. She decided that her new meter was running too fast. 
 Ms. Keogh reported to the utility that the meter recorded 646 kilowatt-hours in July, for which she paid $66.50; last year it was 474 kilowatt-hours, or $43.37.
 At a hearing in October organized by her state senator, Ms. Keogh took out two rolls of toilet paper -- one new, one half used up -- and rolled them down the aisle, showing how one turned faster than the other. ''Something is wrong here,'' she said. 
 Scores of electric customers with similar complaints have turned out at similar hearings. At one in Fresno, Calif., Leo Margosian, a retired investigator, testified that the new meter logged the consumption of his two-bedroom townhouse at 791 kilowatt-hours in July, up from 236 a year earlier. And he had recently insulated his attic and installed new windows, Mr. Margosian said. 
 At the urging of the state senator, Dean Florez, Democrat of Fresno and the chamber's majority leader, and others, the California Public Utilities Commission is moving to bring in an outside auditor to determine whether the meters count usage properly.
 In response to a wave of complaints from the Bakersfield area in the Central Valley, Pacific Gas & Electric has been placing full-page advertisements in newspapers in the area promising benefits from the new meters. It says customers will save money not only by paying rates based on hourly fluctuations in the wholesale market, but also eventually by displaying real-time rates.
 To reduce their bills, customers could cut back at pricey peak times and shift some activities, like running a clothes dryer or a vacuum cleaner, to off-peak periods. Utilities will then have lower costs, the argument goes, because the grid will need fewer power plants as demand levels out. 
 Customers will become ''structural winners,'' said Andy Tang, senior director of the company's Smart Energy Web program. 
 Someday utilities hope to use the meter to control consumption by major appliances like air conditioners. But experts are still debating what technical standards the meters and appliances should use to communicate. 
 While the costs of installing the meters is substantial -- $2.2 billion in the case of PG&E -- the utility reaps some immediate benefits that eventually will be passed along to the consumer. 
 The most obvious one is that utilities can eliminate their meter readers, along with an expenditure of 50 cents to a dollar to read each meter every month. And with smart meters, utilities are alerted immediately if a customer's power is out. 
 If a utility decides to shut off a customer for nonpayment, it can do so by remote control; if the customer pays enough money to allow resumption of service, the utility can also do that from a central office without sending out a representative.
 PG&E attributes the higher bills that some consumers complain about to recent rate increases and to quirks in California's pricing system. Electricity in the state is priced in so-called tiers: consumers get the first few hundred kilowatt-hours at a low rate, but the next few units of consumption are billed at a high rate. A small increase in use can therefore result in a big increase in the bill, the utility says. It adds that an unusually high number of very hot days were recorded last summer. 
 But people in other parts of the country are also wary of the meter switch. Attorney General Richard Blumenthal of Connecticut frets that consumers could be shouldering the costs of the transition long before they realized the savings. 
 ''The major benefits come in the second and third stages,'' Mr. Blumenthal said, referring to instantaneous rate information, the ability to adjust use and the prospect of developing appliances that can be set to switch on or off when the meter announces that prices have reached a certain level. 
 So Mr. Blumenthal has helped persuade regulators in his state and Connecticut Light & Power to scale back a plan for widespread installation of smart meters, and to run a pilot program first. 
 In Texas, where state law encourages installation of smart meters, the public utility counsel, a consumer advocate, got the utilities to agree to pay tens of millions of dollars for public education and to subsidize the cost of an in-home display to give an instantaneous price in low-income households. 
 (While meters in Texas will bill customers based on time of day, the utilities do not routinely provide the indoor hardware that furnishes such information.) 
 Complicating the transition, the widespread introduction of smart meters comes amid a recession and a decline in electricity demand. 
 Two years ago, experts agree, it was cheaper to persuade 100,000 customers to each use two kilowatts less energy at any given moment than for a utility to build and run a 200-megawatt power plant. 
 But today, reining in energy consumption is less of a corporate priority: generating capacity is in surplus in almost all parts of the United States because the recession has shuttered so many factories. And in swaths of the eastern United States, the wholesale price difference between peak and off-peak demand is far smaller lately. 
 The long-term impact of the smart meters is uncertain. Some studies show that people use less electricity when they can see the numbers ticking higher on the meter. 
 Among residential customers who volunteered for a test program in California last summer, 70 percent saved money and 97 percent said they were satisfied with the program and wanted to stay in it, Mr. Tang of PG&E said. 
 Yet of about a million customers with smart meters at the time, only 24,000, or 2.4 percent, chose to take part in the test program.

HEADLINE: With a Too-Tiny Baby, She Was Out of Work and Out of a Home

BYLINE: By JULIE BOSMAN

 BODY:
The hallway in the long, narrow apartment in Washington Heights is kept dark most of the time, to save on energy bills. In one bedroom, damp laundry hangs from the railing of a canopy bed, a neat rectangle of blue baby blankets and teddy-bear-dotted clothes, all belonging to 8-month-old Kyler Barr, who is sleeping soundly in the next room.
 ''Since he's a preemie, I don't want to use the washing machines at the laundromat,'' said his mother, Tysheen Barr, with a self-deprecating chuckle. ''I'm paranoid. But there might be germs left in there that aren't good for him.'' 
 It was Ms. Barr's troubled pregnancy with Kyler that took her from steadily employed to jobless and temporarily homeless. Early this year, she was working in food service at a public elementary school, while taking care of her other son, Kysheen, whose ninth birthday is Monday. 
 But halfway through her pregnancy, it became clear that something was terribly wrong. Sonograms indicated that the baby was much smaller than he should have been. The doctors briefly worried that he had Down syndrome. 
 In March, Ms. Barr, who is 32 and has high blood pressure, was ordered on strict bed rest, forcing her to give up her part-time job and sign up for unemployment benefits and food stamps. 
 And in April, Kyler was born, at 27 weeks, weighing only 1 pound 1 ounce -- so small that his hand was no wider than his mother's pinky finger. 
 ''He had so many tubes and stuff coming out of him,'' Ms. Barr said, recalling the first time she saw her infant. ''I almost passed out. I started crying.''
 The arrival of a sick baby was too much for her grandmother, whose cramped apartment was home to Ms. Barr, Kysheen and several other relatives. By July, her grandmother ordered all of them to move out. 
 Going to live with the children's father was out of the question. Ms. Barr had begun dating him when she was a teenager in the South Bronx, but he had been only an intermittent presence in her life since then. (She said she is in the process of suing him for child support.)
 Desperate, Ms. Barr went to a homeless shelter, Kysheen and the infant Kyler in tow. ''I didn't have nowhere to go,'' she said. 
 Not long after Ms. Barr arrived at the shelter, Catholic Charities Archdiocese of New York, one of the seven agencies supported by The New York Times Neediest Cases Fund, intervened and found her an apartment, paying the first and last month's rent. All but $50 of the monthly $1,358 rent will be paid by the Department of Social Services until she can return to work. Catholic Charities also used $288 in Neediest Cases funds to buy a stroller for Kyler. 
 On a recent afternoon, Ms. Barr, short and compact in jeans and furry black boots, showed off the apartment, with its rows of knickknacks and framed family pictures, a vase of silk flowers in every room, and a certificate for excellence in reading -- awarded to Kysheen -- hanging from the refrigerator.
 She said he has worked to teach Kysheen good habits and manners, like how to properly cut his food. ''He will take his knife and fork and cut up his chicken fingers, he's so into it,'' Ms. Barr said. 
 Just after 3 p.m., Kysheen, in a white polo shirt, arrived home from school, escorted by a cousin. A few minutes later, he was happily slurping down ramen noodles and reciting his afternoon routine. ''First I get a snack, then I do homework, and then TV,'' he said. 
 Ms. Barr said she wants to finish college -- she came within a semester of graduating from South Carolina State University -- but first needs to find a job. 
 ''I miss working,'' she said. ''I always had a job, always. I love to work.''

HEADLINE: Still Settling The Score, Even Beyond The Grave

BYLINE: By JANET MASLIN

 BODY:
TOO MUCH MONEY 
 By Dominick Dunne 
 275 pages. Crown Publishers. $26. 
 When Dominick Dunne died on Aug. 26, an online guest book was set up so well wishers could leave condolence messages for his family. The site assured visitors ''that the tears of millions of loyal readers were dried by a sudden wind.'' The gust was said to be caused the ''the collective sigh of rich and famous bullies on multiple continents'' because Mr. Dunne's nonpareil society-crime reporting and his glaringly fact-based fiction would bedevil them no longer.
 Not so fast, globe-trotting bullies. Mr. Dunne left behind one last, stinging roman a clef. And he most assuredly used it to settle scores. 
 ''Too Much Money'' pits his autobiographical character, Gus Bailey, against the New York nouveau riche types of its title. And it keeps Gus constantly aghast at their gall. It commemorates Mr. Dunne's favorite obsessions -- crime, wealth, status, backbiting and power -- into a story with a distinctly valedictory flavor, to the point where some of it unfolds at New York's most elite funeral home. And it includes a line that can serve as Mr. Dunne's own epitaph, delivered by Gus as a slap to the book's most moneyed and graceless social climber. She has just made a donation large enough to get her name plastered onto New York's most important library. Reminding her that libraries exist not just as sites for cocktail parties but as places to house books, Gus tells her: ''I don't have to buy my way in.''
 ''Too Much Money'' takes pains to demonize this woman, using her as a way of focusing attention on Mr. Dunne's career in journalism. He had long since found the inside track at the trials of O. J. Simpson, the Menendez brothers, Phil Spector, Michael C. Skakel and others, when he zeroed in on Lily Safra, whose financier husband, Edmond, died in Monaco in 1999 in a fire under very peculiar circumstances. 
 The villainess of ''Too Much Money'' is a widow named Perla Zacharias, and she bears a strong yet carefully altered resemblance to Ms. Safra: Mr. Dunne learned the hard way, via a slander suit in the Chandra Levy case that left him frightened and distraught, that it's best to be discreet when flinging incriminating innuendoes. But the character of Perla comes to symbolize all that Mr. Dunne deemed loathsome in his own version of Edith Wharton's Gilded Age. Mr. Dunne, who earned his place in the social storytelling pantheon as a Truman Capote without the poison, used ''Too Much Money'' as a soapbox of sorts. Determined to deliver one last cattily entertaining book, he also voiced opinions on topics from Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg's domestic arrangements (''I like it that the mayor of New York City lives with a beautiful woman who is not his wife'') to more private matters, like Gus's lifelong determination to keep his homosexuality hidden from his children. 
 Mr. Dunne's grievances against Vanity Fair magazine, though settled by the end of the novel, are also included here, as is his contempt for the star-chasing New York attitudes that can extend to and beyond the grave. ''Did Xavier embalm that actor in 'Batman' who overdosed on prescription drugs?'' one character asks about a fluttery assistant at the famous funeral parlor. Another character replies: ''That was his day off, and he missed it. He was so disappointed.'' 
 The plot of ''Too Much Money,'' which is almost an incidental feature, has Perla scheming to stop Gus from writing a novel about her. (It doesn't work.) One of her ploys is to have Gus's publisher suggest he write instead about ''this Madoff fellow.'' That might well have been Mr. Dunne's next writerly destination, as could the posthumous struggle over the estate of Brooke Astor, although she is treated with the kind of kid gloves that suggest Mr. Dunne might not have wanted to become embroiled in her son's recent trial. 
 It is this book's style to obfuscate ever so slightly (the Astor name becomes Harcourt, and the troublemaking relative becomes a nephew) while still allowing -- no, insisting -- that readers' noses stay pressed to the glass of New York's whirl of bold-face names. If you can't figure out or don't care that the talk show host called Harry Sovereign may be Larry King, this is not a book for you.
 There's too much money in ''Too Much Money,'' even allowing for the centrality of shopaholic pornography to this book's genre. When one character has a stroke, he ruins both his own suit and his wife's, for -- we are explicitly told -- a total cost of $17,000. ''Thousand-dollar'' is a modifier for nouns like orchid, and there are price tags on virtually everything in the story. This may have been Mr. Dunne's point, but at his best he could wield that particular shiv with delicacy. This book contains blunt lines like: ''She pulled off her ten-thousand-dollar Valentino dress and threw it on the floor.'' That last image leads to an awkwardly coarse lesbian sex scene, one that demonstrates that Mr. Dunne wrote far more avidly about wretched economic excess than about physicality. Still, one of the book's sly virtues is using ''cheap'' as a compliment where sex is concerned and as a horror everywhere else.
 Both Gus Bailey and Mr. Dunne were saying goodbye. The book is full of quietly heartbreaking evidence of that. Early on, a debonair, elderly gay man proclaims himself ''absolutely riddled'' with cancer, adding, ''I don't have a chance'' before he makes precise arrangements to be well-dressed for his suicide and private cremation. Gus himself learns that he is ill late in the book but declines to dwell on that fact. Instead he and Mr. Dunne both exited on a grace note. They preferred to be remembered at their courtly best.

HEADLINE: As Prices Fall, Blu-ray Players Are Invited Home

BYLINE: By ERIC A. TAUB

 BODY:
Blu-ray, a high-definition variation of the DVD format introduced three years ago, was initially met by a collective shrug from most consumers. Who needed another black box to connect to the TV, the thinking went, even if it did promise to play movie discs in clear, crisp high-definition? 
 But this year, even as the country moves tentatively out of a recession, consumers are buying the devices at a faster pace than they bought previous generations of movie players like the VCR and the DVD player. Analysts predict that sales of Blu-ray machines will be up 112 percent over last year, one of the true bright spots in retailing this holiday season. 
 Blu-ray's household penetration is higher than that of DVD for the same period after introduction, according to Shawn DuBravac, chief economist for the Consumer Electronics Association. Three years after introduction, Blu-ray stand-alone players, which excludes Sony's PlayStation 3 game machines that also play Blu-rays discs, are in 7 percent of American homes.
 Amazon.com reports that sales of Blu-ray players are outnumbering those of standard DVD units, according to Paul Ryder, the company's vice president for consumer electronics. Among the top 10 disc players sold, eight were Blu-ray, and five of the top 10 movie titles sold were in the Blu-ray format.
 At a Best Buy in Thousand Oaks, Calif., small mountains of Blu-ray players are stacked seven units high wherever flat-panel TVs are on display, while the handful of standard DVD players are in a distant aisle. 
 The main reason for the shift in thinking is right there on the stacks of Blu-ray players that Best Buy has piled at its video wall. Prices for high-quality models have dropped below $150, a steep drop from the $300-plus that retailers were charging when Blu-ray had its debut. 
 ''The price for an impulse buy is under $100, and we're getting there,'' said Andy Parsons, president of the Blu-ray Disc Association, a trade group.
 Amazon's best-selling Blu-ray model, Panasonic's DMP-BD60, is available for $129, while a no-frills Magnavox Blu-ray player is on sale at Wal-Mart Stores for $78.
 ''We're sanguine about Blu-ray taking over as the physical disc format of choice,'' said Tom Adams, the president of Adams Media Research. ''The differences in cost between DVD and Blu-ray players and software is going away. So there will be a natural evolution from standard DVD to Blu-ray.''
 It also helps that more Americans now have 1080p HDTV displays, sets with sufficiently high screen resolution to fully display the clarity of a Blu-ray disc. Forty percent of all TVs sold are 1080p, according to Riddhi Patel, an analyst at iSuppli. She says that number should rise to 46 percent next year.
 In addition to superior picture quality, Blu-ray also offers features not available on standard DVD players, like pop-up menus during play. Some Blu-ray players can also connect to the Internet; the player can then receive additional information about a movie, offer movie-related games, provide updated trailers, and allow friends to simultaneously watch a film while writing comments on screen.
 The newest generation of Blu-ray players lets viewers receive streaming movies and TV shows from online providers like Amazon Video on Demand, CinemaNow, Netflix and YouTube.
 As a result, Blu-ray manufacturers have placed themselves in a seemingly awkward position: They are selling a device that relies on people to continue to buy discs, but the same device gives them a way to download videos -- bypassing the discs the machines were built to play.
 Consumer electronics companies believe that this strategy makes sense. The additional programming will add to the Blu-ray experience, executives say, which still offers superior picture and sound quality to what can be currently streamed over the Internet.
 And since most HDTVs do not yet come with their own built-in Internet capability, a Blu-ray player can become an inexpensive but essential all-in-one content source, according to Todd Richardson, senior vice president for P&F USA, the marketing arm for Philips.
 ''These services are supplemental. They fill out the consumers' demand for more and more content,'' added Tim Alessi, LG's director of new product development.
 Yet, as high-speed broadband becomes ubiquitous, the ability to quickly download Blu-ray-quality content will become a reality. That day is probably 10 years off, according to Ross Rubin, an NPD Group analyst, as physical discs continue to provide a higher-quality image and an easier way to move programming throughout the house than by trying to create an in-home network. 
 But the consumer electronics industry is no stranger to product life cycles and planned obsolescence. Already, manufacturers are readying a new line of Blu-ray players and TVs that can display video in 3-D. They should be in place by next year's holiday shopping season.

HEADLINE: Price of Flat-Panel TVs Rivals the Old Tube Type

BYLINE: By ERIC A. TAUB

 BODY:
If you listen to consumer electronics manufacturers, every year is the best year to buy a new TV. But this year is significant, as prices of several sizes of flat-panel TVs now cost the same as their picture-tube predecessors. 
 According to iSuppli, a research firm, the average selling price of a 23-inch LCD set is $451; three years ago it was $752. The average price of a 32-inch LCD is $600, about half of the $1,182 ticket in 2006.
 In the stores, flat-panel prices are even better. Wal-Mart is selling a 32-inch Vizio LCD for $400, and a 22-inch HDTV from RCA for $250.
 The price reductions are great for consumers, but not so good for the companies that manufacture the sets. ''The manufacturers needed to keep sales momentum going when people cut back on spending, so they're lowering prices,'' said Riddhi Patel, an analyst at iSuppli. ''They're just trying to see if they can survive one more quarter.''
 In addition, with less disposable income since the recession, consumers have cut back by buying smaller, less fancy TVs. ''Entry-level price points have become more attractive to consumers,'' said Bob Perry, Panasonic's senior vice president for marketing. ''There was the assumption that fewer 32-inch LCD TVs would be sold, but more were sold and that drove down prices.''
 According to Paul Semenza, vice president at market researcher DisplaySearch, price cuts are occurring even while the cost of the LCD panels used in the TVs has risen. Because mass merchants can survive with smaller margins, the large retailers have been able to lower prices to keep sales going.
 ''The manufacturers' attitude has been driven for a long time by market share, not profitability,'' said Chris Chinnock, principal with Insight Media, a research firm.
 According to Mike Abary, a Sony Electronics senior vice president, a new attitude has developed among consumers: one of ''good enough.''
 ''Cheap and simple is what consumers are demanding now in consumer electronics,'' Mr. Abary said. He pointed out that popular products like netbooks and inexpensive camcorders have fewer features than their older brethren. On the Friday after Thanksgiving, Sony's least-expensive Blu-ray player, available for about $120, was one of the company's top sellers.
 ''In TV and video, we've recognized that some house brands are moving the quickest,'' Mr. Abary said. ''I absolutely envision a time when we do a stripped-down line of TVs and a high-end line of 3-D-capable TVs.''
 As prices erode further, it puts pressure on the smaller manufacturers; with smaller product lines, they are less likely to be able to weather the competitive storm.
 ''When a 32-inch TV sells for $249, it's not possible to make money,'' Ms. Patel said.

HEADLINE: Disaster And Denial

BYLINE: By PAUL KRUGMAN

 BODY:
When I first began writing for The Times, I was naive about many things. But my biggest misconception was this: I actually believed that influential people could be moved by evidence, that they would change their views if events completely refuted their beliefs.
 And to be fair, it does happen now and then. I've been highly critical of Alan Greenspan over the years (since long before it was fashionable), but give the former Fed chairman credit: he has admitted that he was wrong about the ability of financial markets to police themselves. 
 But he's a rare case. Just how rare was demonstrated by what happened last Friday in the House of Representatives, when -- with the meltdown caused by a runaway financial system still fresh in our minds, and the mass unemployment that meltdown caused still very much in evidence -- every single Republican and 27 Democrats voted against a quite modest effort to rein in Wall Street excesses. 
 Let's recall how we got into our current mess.
 America emerged from the Great Depression with a tightly regulated banking system. The regulations worked: the nation was spared major financial crises for almost four decades after World War II. But as the memory of the Depression faded, bankers began to chafe at the restrictions they faced. And politicians, increasingly under the influence of free-market ideology, showed a growing willingness to give bankers what they wanted.
 The first big wave of deregulation took place under Ronald Reagan -- and quickly led to disaster, in the form of the savings-and-loan crisis of the 1980s. Taxpayers ended up paying more than 2 percent of G.D.P., the equivalent of around $300 billion today, to clean up the mess.
 But the proponents of deregulation were undaunted, and in the decade leading up to the current crisis politicians in both parties bought into the notion that New Deal-era restrictions on bankers were nothing but pointless red tape. In a memorable 2003 incident, top bank regulators staged a photo-op in which they used garden shears and a chainsaw to cut up stacks of paper representing regulations.
 And the bankers -- liberated both by legislation that removed traditional restrictions and by the hands-off attitude of regulators who didn't believe in regulation -- responded by dramatically loosening lending standards. The result was a credit boom and a monstrous real estate bubble, followed by the worst economic slump since the Great Depression. Ironically, the effort to contain the crisis required government intervention on a much larger scale than would have been needed to prevent the crisis in the first place: government rescues of troubled institutions, large-scale lending by the Federal Reserve to the private sector, and so on. 
 Given this history, you might have expected the emergence of a national consensus in favor of restoring more-effective financial regulation, so as to avoid a repeat performance. But you would have been wrong.
 Talk to conservatives about the financial crisis and you enter an alternative, bizarro universe in which government bureaucrats, not greedy bankers, caused the meltdown. It's a universe in which government-sponsored lending agencies triggered the crisis, even though private lenders actually made the vast majority of subprime loans. It's a universe in which regulators coerced bankers into making loans to unqualified borrowers, even though only one of the top 25 subprime lenders was subject to the regulations in question.
 Oh, and conservatives simply ignore the catastrophe in commercial real estate: in their universe the only bad loans were those made to poor people and members of minority groups, because bad loans to developers of shopping malls and office towers don't fit the narrative.
 In part, the prevalence of this narrative reflects the principle enunciated by Upton Sinclair: ''It is difficult to get a man to understand something when his salary depends on his not understanding it.'' As Democrats have pointed out, three days before the House vote on banking reform Republican leaders met with more than 100 financial-industry lobbyists to coordinate strategies. But it also reflects the extent to which the modern Republican Party is committed to a bankrupt ideology, one that won't let it face up to the reality of what happened to the U.S. economy.
 So it's up to the Democrats -- and more specifically, since the House has passed its bill, it's up to ''centrist'' Democrats in the Senate. Are they willing to learn something from the disaster that has overtaken the U.S. economy, and get behind financial reform?
 Let's hope so. For one thing is clear: if politicians refuse to learn from the history of the recent financial crisis, they will condemn all of us to repeat it.

HEADLINE: Paterson Trims Aid to Schools And Localities

BYLINE: By KAREEM FAHIM; Danny Hakim and Michael S. Schmidt contributed reporting.

 BODY:
Gov. David A. Paterson announced on Sunday that he would unilaterally withhold $750 million in scheduled payments to schools and local governments, saying that strong action was necessary to protect New York State from insolvency.
 The reductions of 10 to 19 percent in aid will affect schools and social service providers, health insurance payments, cities and counties. Mr. Paterson said the withheld funds were not ''a cut'' or an ''impoundment'' -- perhaps drawing a legal distinction because only the Legislature is empowered to make permanent budget cuts.
 Some lawmakers called the move illegal, but the governor said ''we are well within the bounds of legal authority.'' 
 The governor did not indicate when he would restore the funds, except to say, ''as sufficient revenues become available.'' 
 The reductions mean that New York City will not get approximately $84 million in municipal aid and school payments scheduled for Tuesday; an additional $107 million will be withheld across the state. Later this month, $560 million more in scheduled payments will be withheld.
 A spokesman for Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg said the city was still studying the governor's proposal. The mayor has said he would probably not object to a plan for spending cuts, as long as they did not disproportionately affect the city.
 In announcing the withholding, Mr. Paterson made good on a threat he issued late last month to act on his own if the Legislature did not make enough cuts to address a $3.2 billion state budget deficit. The governor acknowledged that the move was only a ''temporary fix.'' He said it was needed because of Albany's legislators' inaction.
 ''The reason that we don't have a permanent fix is because the Legislature walked away and ran back to their districts and told their constituents, 'Look, I saved the school district from the big bad governor,' '' he said. ''But the reality is that they only temporarily delayed the day of reckoning.'' 
 Mr. Paterson's cuts to school funds were a direct challenge to state lawmakers, who have regarded such state aid as sacrosanct. After the governor's announcement, school districts sought to determine the move's impact.
 It was also uncertain when the state's fiscal health would improve enough so that the withheld money could be restored; the state's revenue picture is expected to brighten somewhat next month, after bonuses are paid to Wall Street executives and as tax revenue starts to trickle in.
 Mr. Paterson is scheduled to present his executive budget next month, and he may propose that some of the withheld payments be cut permanently.
 Austin Shafran, the spokesman for the Democratic majority in the Senate, called Mr. Paterson's actions ''self-indulgent theatrics,'' and said that New Yorkers ''want their leaders to work together to get things done.''
 ''The first thing that should be done is to work with the Legislature to mitigate any potential cash-flow problem,'' Mr. Shafran said. ''Taking away money from schoolchildren should not be under consideration.''
 Assemblyman Richard L. Brodsky, a Westchester Democrat, said of Mr. Paterson, ''He doesn't have the legal authority to impound; he may have the legal authority to delay.'' Mr. Brodsky said that Mr. Paterson was trying to create the ''political environment'' for permanent budget cuts.
 ''If he' s trying to force a broad recognition that we've run out of money, fine,'' Mr. Brodsky said. But he warned that ''there will be human consequences.'' 
 Other lawmakers, including State Senator Carl Kruger of Brooklyn, a Democrat, pointed out that a 1980 Court of Appeals decision characterized a governor's attempts to impound money allocated by the Legislature as unconstitutional.
 For several weeks this fall, as state revenues continued to drop, lawmakers haggled over how to cut more than $3 billion from the state budget, with Mr. Paterson urging legislators to consider politically unpopular cuts to schools and health care. 
 The Legislature finally passed a $2.7 billion deficit-reduction plan this month, cutting pensions for many new government workers and overhauling public authorities, but the action was criticized by financial watchdogs who said it did not go far enough and relied too heavily on nonrecurring savings. His aides said that Mr. Paterson cut the state's largest expenditures remaining in December. In doing so, school districts took the brunt of the pain. 
 Mr. Paterson's plan calls for cutting 10 percent of payments due on Tuesday and 19 percent of payments due later in the month.
 Elizabeth Lynam, the deputy research director of the Citizens Budget Commission, a nonprofit group that analyzes government spending, called the move ''the right course of action.''
 ''If the funds are not available to make these payments right now, then they should not be made,'' she said.
 The cuts in school payments drew the strongest resistance. Though Mr. Paterson said that most school districts had reserve funds that would allow them to absorb the reductions, he acknowledged that poorer school districts were ''going to be a problem.'' 
 But Stephen Allinger, legislative director of the New York State United Teachers union, said many districts had already used up their reserves for the year. Mr. Paterson's reductions could affect after-school and sports programs, and result in staff reductions, Mr. Allinger said.
 And he asked a question about the cuts that seemed to be on many people's minds: ''What does this mean? Is it just late, or are they going to cut it altogether?''
 Mr. Paterson asserted that state law gives him the authority to order his budget director to stop certification of payments in order to preserve the economic stability of the state. Otherwise, Mr. Paterson reasoned, the state would be writing checks it could not back. Yet even as he acknowledged that his legal authority to withhold the payments might be challenged, he said that ''this is as far as I can expand the powers of the executive branch within the legal limit.''

HEADLINE: Create Jobs? Reduce Deficit? Obama's Political Quandary Grows

BYLINE: By JOHN HARWOOD

 BODY:
On the gargantuan budget deficit, the first problem for Democrats is political: voters fear overspending but want action to create jobs, which costs money.
 The second problem is economic. Curbing the deficit now, under Keynesian theories that Democrats still embrace, might crimp recovery from the Great Recession.
 The third problem is scale. Trillion-dollar deficits are not just unprecedented; they are also occurring on the eve of a demographic event certain to deepen the nation's fiscal hole -- retirement for the baby boomer generation. 
 The fourth problem is accountability. Since the Reagan era, the federal government has engaged in four major bouts of deficit reduction. In three of those -- 1982, 1990 and 1997 -- Democrats and Republicans shared power and responsibility for the difficult choices that deficit reduction requires.
 The other, in 1993, came when Democrats alone controlled the White House and Congress. They have not forgotten how badly Republicans defeated them in midterm elections the following year.
 ''Nobody believes -- not in the 1980s, not in the 1990s, not now -- there are easy ways to address deficits,'' said Joel Benenson, a pollster for President Obama. 
 Considering the circumstances, addressing the deficit now may present a more excruciating leadership challenge than ever.
 No Easy Answers
 Since the end of World War II, the federal budget has operated at a deficit in 52 of 64 fiscal years. For most of those years, it has been a second-tier political issue.
 That changed in the 1980s under President Ronald Reagan, when tax cuts, increased spending and a recession sent deficits above $200 billion. To curb them, Reagan signed tax increases pushed through by Congressional leaders of both parties.
 Deficits swelled back above $200 billion in 1990. President George Bush signed spending cuts and tax increases over opposition from his party's ascendant conservative wing in Congress.
 Three years later, Republicans wanted no part of tax increases in President Bill Clinton's economic program, leaving Democrats to shoulder deficit reduction burdens alone. Having captured control of Congress in 1994, Republicans subsequently joined Mr. Clinton in a budget-balancing compromise made easier by soaring revenues from the economic boom of the late 1990s.
 There is nothing easy about the predicament facing Mr. Obama and his party now.
 With unemployment at 10 percent for the first time in a quarter-century, Americans in last week's New York Times/CBS Poll called jobs and the economy the top issues facing the country. The White House and Congress are scrambling to respond with new jobs legislation, which may cost $200 billion or more.
 Yet a separate survey conducted for CNBC demonstrated the political risks of additional spending. By 56 percent to 33 percent, Americans said Washington should worry more about curbing the deficit than boosting the economy, even if that slows the pace of recovery.
 ''That's a tough conflict to manage,'' observed a Republican pollster, Glen Bolger.
 Talk vs. Action
 The outlines of a Democratic approach have begun to emerge: talk about deficit reduction in 2010, but defer serious action until after the midterm elections.
 One familiar vehicle for discussion would be a bipartisan commission of the kind proposed by Senators Kent Conrad, Democrat of North Dakota, and Judd Gregg, Republican of New Hampshire. Under the traditional dynamics of bipartisan compromise, such a panel would most likely produce a mix of tax increases and spending cuts.
 And yet achieving such a compromise has grown more difficult as the two parties have grown more ideologically homogenous -- and further apart from each other.
 The number of Republicans willing to back tax increases for deficit reduction has dwindled. Democrats are counting on Medicare spending cuts to help pay for health care legislation, and they still have pent-up domestic spending demands after eight years of President George W. Bush.
 In the 1990s, the post-cold-war ''peace dividend'' provided added fiscal flexibility that today's lawmakers can only envy as they pay for military operations in Iraq and Afghanistan. Meanwhile, Congressional Democrats feel an immediate need to speed job creation before Election Day 2010.
 Mr. Obama calls it ''a false choice'' to pit spending to spur the economy against reducing the deficit. His advisers say the president, and American voters, favor both -- spending to create jobs in the short term, and commitment to spending discipline and deficit reduction over the long term.
 ''It's not schizophrenic,'' Mr. Benenson said. ''They do want to see jobs created. They do want to see government tighten its belt a bit. But those things are not mutually exclusive.''
 And yet the long term is not as long as it used to be when Washington first began seriously fretting over the then-distant Social Security and Medicare costs of the baby boomers' golden years.
 ''We've basically taken a 30-year-old problem and turned it into a decade problem,'' said Douglas Holtz-Eakin, former director of the Congressional Budget Office. ''The stakes are a lot higher.''

HEADLINE: Summers Predicts Job Growth by Spring

BYLINE: By JOSEPH BERGER

 BODY:
Lawrence H. Summers, President Obama's top economic advisor, predicted on Sunday that by the spring the ranks of working Americans will start to grow once again.
 ''Most professional forecasters are looking for a return to job growth by the spring,'' he said in an appearance on ''ABC's ''This Week with George Stephanopoulos.'' 
 Mr. Summers, director of the White House's National Economic Council, made his forecast one day before President Obama is scheduled to meet with banking executives at the White House in an effort to ratchet up lending to consumers and small businesses, to make it easier for homeowners to obtain mortgages and spur businesses to generate jobs.
 Mr. Summers, Secretary of the Treasury at the end of the Clinton administration, said that ''it doesn't cost anything to encourage banks, as the president will be doing, to meet their responsibilities and expand the flow of credit to small business.'' He said the president will remind the bankers of what the federal government did to bail out banks when they were in trouble, ''that no major bank would be intact, would be in a position to pay bonuses, if that extraordinary support had not been provided.'' 
 The president, he said, ''will be talking with them about what they can do to support enhanced lending to customers across the country.''
 ''We were there for them and the banks need to do everything they canto be sure they're there for customers across this country,'' he said. 
 The nation's unemployment rate stabilized in November, with only 11,000 more people losing jobs and the rate itself edging down to 10.0 percent from its yearlong peak the previous month. The ranks of the employed stood at 138.5 million in November and the number of unemployed still seeking jobs stood at 15.4 million. When the recession began in December 2007, 7.5 million Americans were unemployed and the jobless rate stood at 4.9 percent.
 Mr. Summers said flatly that ''everyone agrees the recession is over.'' But on NBC's ''Meet the Press'' Christina Romer, another White House economic adviser, countered: ''I'm not going to say the recession is over until the unemployment rate is down to normal levels.'' Ms. Romer, chairwoman of the Council of Economic Advisers, placed that figure in the 5 percent range.
 On the same program, Alan Greenspan, chairman of the Federal Reserve from 1987 to early 2006, tried to reconcile the contradiction between the two presidential advisers by distinguishing between economic activity and joblessness. The low point in terms of economic activity was reached in June or July, he said. But, he added, ''merely having gotten by the bottom is not all that terrific because, by definition, at the bottom is when things are worse.'' 
 What concerns him, he said, was that 38 percent of the ranks of the unemployed are made up of people who have been jobless for more than 27 weeks, including many for more than a year. ''These people are losing their skills, and it's very critical that those people have the skills when the economy comes back or we will not be as productive as we'd like to be.''
 A sharp dissenter from Mr. Summers's declaration that the recession is over was Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, the Republican minority leader, who said that, given a 10 percent national unemployment rate and 11 percent in Kentucky, ''I don't think it's over.''
 ''I hope he's right that we're coming out of an economic slowdown, but unemployment is the key,'' he added on CBS's ''Face the Nation.''
 Mr. Summers, though, sounded a more upbeat tone.
 ''We were losing 700,000 jobs a month when President Bush turned the economy over to President Obama,'' he said. But looking at the latest employment statistics, he said, by spring, ''growth will be starting to turn positive.''
 Asked what the Obama administration would be doing to create jobs, Mr. Summers said, ''Every bill is going to be a jobs bill.'' The president plans to spend $50 billion on repairing the nation's infrastructure, and health care reform -- the centerpiece of the Obama domestic agenda -- too would help he economy by paring away the nation's deficit, which he described as an $8 trillion shortfall over 10 years that ''the Obama administration inherited.''
 The health care reform bill would help trim the deficit, he said, by taxing the so-called Cadillac health insurance plans and by providing more preventive care for more Americans.
 ''We will get to a point where we have significant reductions in health care costs,'' he said.
 Republicans and centrist Senators, appearing on Sunday morning talks show, were more skeptical, however. Senator McConnell predicted the bill being pushed by the Democratic leadership would increase health care costs. A recent effort to replace a proposal for a government-run health insurance plan with an effort to allow Americans between 55 and 65 to buy in to Medicare would ''exacerbate the problems of Medicare, which he said is ''unsustainable and going broke in seven years.''
 Senator Claire McCaskill, Democrat of Missouri, said she would have difficulty voting for the health care reform bill unless it was shown that it would not increase the deficit.
 ''My statement all along is it has to slow down the increase of health care costs over time, and that is bending the cost curve, and secondly that it has to be deficit neutral,'' she said on ''Fox News Sunday.''
 Senator Joseph Lieberman, an independent from Connecticut who caucuses with the Democrats, said he too would be reluctant to vote for a health care bill with a Medicare buy-in because ''it will add taxpayer costs, it will add to the deficit.'' 
 Splashing more cold water on a compromise engineered by Senator Harry Reid, the Democratic majority leader, Senator Lieberman predicted that there would not be 60 votes for the buy-in. He also urged Democrats to ''stop adding to the bill.''
 The basic bill, he said, already does enough to cover an added 30 million uninsured Americans with health insurance.
 ''''We don't need to keep adding onto the back of this horse or we're going to break the horse's back and get nothing done,'' he said. 
 ''You've got to take out the Medicare buy-in, you've got to forget about the public option,'' he said. 
 Senator Judd Gregg, the Republican from New Hampshire, said that letting people buy into Medicare at age 55 will encourage ''the people who are the sickest buying in, and therefore the cost of Medicare is clearly going to go up.'' 
 ''Medicare is already a bankrupt program,'' he said on Fox.

HEADLINE: Senate Passes Spending Bill Amid Debate on Raising Debt Limit

BYLINE: By CARL HULSE

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
The Senate on Sunday approved a $446.8 billion spending package that will keep much of the federal government running through next September.
 But even as they sent the spending measure to President Obama, Democrats were deeply divided over efforts to substantially raise the federal debt limit before Congress quits for the year. 
 With the increased spending and more red ink provoking new Congressional alarm, a group of Democratic deficit hawks was insisting that Congress and the White House agree to new efforts to rein in the deficit or they would block a large increase in the debt limit. 
 Failure to increase the $12.1 trillion debt limit to cover federal borrowing could lead to a technical government default. As a result, the White House is eager to get some breathing room on the debt by the end of the year, giving lawmakers worried about deficit spending added power.
 ''There are a number of us who feel very strongly that this is the moment we can get some kind of concession,'' said Senator Claire McCaskill, Democrat of Missouri and one of a group of lawmakers who met in the Capitol over the weekend to plot strategy.
 She and others said they wanted a vote on a new proposal to create a bipartisan, independent commission to recommend spending cuts and revenue increases to pare the deficit. Others want an agreement by Congress to follow ''pay as you go'' rules when considering legislation.
 If they are unable to strike a deal with the White House and the Congressional leadership, the lawmakers said they would support only a short-term increase in the debt limit -- perhaps into February -- to allow more time for negotiation and for Mr. Obama to present his own deficit-reduction strategy in his State of the Union address.
 ''We are not going to give up the leverage we have now,'' said Senator Kent Conrad, a North Dakota Democrat who leads the Budget Committee and is an author of the plan to create an independent deficit commission.
 The spending measure passed Sunday on a vote of 57 to 35. The push by Democrats comes as Republicans, who presided over deficit spending when they controlled Congress and the White House, have tried to paint Democrats as profligate because of the $787 billion stimulus plan and other spending increases.
 Trying to rebuild after two poor election showings, Republicans have focused on fiscal restraint as a way to try to recapture core conservative voters, despite their own recent record.
 Republicans pointed to a 10 percent to 12 percent overall spending increase included in the measure as representative of a Democratic willingness to overspend.
 ''Poll after poll have made it clear that this kind of irresponsible and excessive spending is unacceptable, but Democrats simply aren't getting the message,'' Michael Steele, chairman of the Republican National Committee, said in a statement after the vote.
 Top Democrats say their focus this year has had to be on job creation, but Mr. Obama and his aides say they intend to focus on deficit reduction next year and will propose a restrained budget in 2010. 
 Appearing Sunday on ''State of the Union'' on CNN, Lawrence H. Summers, the president's chief economic adviser, said Mr. Obama was receptive to new ideas for reducing the deficit. But Mr. Summers would not commit to White House backing for a commission with the ability to make recommendations to Congress for an up-or-down vote.
 ''What's fundamentally important is that we find a solution that works,'' Mr. Summers said. ''And the president will be open, is open, to any approach that offers the prospect of controlling the budget deficit.''
 Top Democrats in the House and Senate, including Speaker Nancy Pelosi, are strongly opposed to the idea of an independent commission, arguing that the concept relinquishes too much Congressional authority.
 Given that resistance, one compromise being discussed is a deficit reduction commission that would be created by executive order. It would still make recommendations to the House and Senate, but they would be subject to revision by Congress.
 Congressional leaders acknowledge that the deficit hawks may have enough backers to win some concessions or force only a short-term increase in the debt limit. The leadership had been hoping to raise it by as much as $1.8 trillion to avoid a second vote before the 2010 elections.
 The dispute is being negotiated at high levels as both Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. and Representative Steny H. Hoyer of Maryland, the majority leader, met with lawmakers uneasy about the debt in recent days. Mr. Conrad has also met with his own leadership.
 Political brinksmanship has been a staple of past debt limit fights as lawmakers use their enhanced leverage to push against the deficit and soften the sting of voting to raise the nation's borrowing power. In the mid-1980s, a group of deficit hawks seized on the need to increase the debt limit as an opportunity to push through the Gramm-Rudman-Hollings budget-cutting law.
 Democrats plan to add whatever debt limit agreement they can reach to a $626 billion Pentagon spending measure they intend to consider this week. After Sunday's passage of the spending package, the Pentagon money bill is the final one remaining, and the leadership intends to use it to carry last-minute legislation, some of which is highly contentious.
 Among other outstanding issues are an extension of unemployment and health benefits for out-of-work Americans, a potential House jobs bill, the renewal of a handful of expiring federal programs and possible action to prevent the federal estate tax from expiring. The House hopes to adjourn this week; the Senate, in the middle of its health care fight, is likely to be in session longer.

HEADLINE: When Woods Goes Missing, So Does the Audience

BYLINE: By LARRY DORMAN

 BODY:
As Tiger Woods's major sponsors plot their own courses in the enlarging wake of multiple accusations of Woods's marital infidelities, the PGA Tour and its players must also deal with the prospect of yet another protracted absence by its biggest rainmaker.
 ''We need him out here because of sponsorships and just the awareness in our tour in general,'' Steve Stricker told PGATour.com. 
 Stricker, the No. 3-ranked golfer in the world, was describing what came to be known as the Tiger Effect from the first day Woods joined the tour in 1996 -- no Woods, no ratings.
 Sponsors have reacted quickly after Woods announced Friday that he would take an ''indefinite break'' from the PGA Tour to work on his marriage. The global consulting giant Accenture ended its endorsement contract with Woods on Sunday, a day after Gillette announced it would reduce his presence in its advertising. 
 His presence on the tour is in question at least for the start of the 2010 season, which creates different concerns for the PGA Tour and golf in general. Most of his fellow competitors are prefacing or punctuating their remarks with expressions of concern for Woods's well-being, but all are aware of the effect he has on everything from the number of people who attend tournaments to the number of zeroes on the checks they deposit if they manage to beat him.
 Although Woods is not solely responsible for the economic growth of the tour, he is given much of the credit for the quadrupling of prize money since he joined it -- from $70 million in 1996 to $278 million in 2009. Most of the larger purses directly result from higher revenue from title sponsors, and the PGA Tour is in the midst of negotiating new deals with the sponsors of a dozen events that will expire by the end of 2010. Therefore, uncertainty about his availability will have a negative impact on the negotiations.
 ''We all know what kind of effect there is when he doesn't play in tournaments, let alone taking time off,'' the Hall of Famer Nick Price said. ''The golf world is going to miss him.''
 The main uncertainties facing the tour in 2010 depend on what the definition of ''indefinite'' turns out to be. In 2008, Woods played six events, including the United States Open, before he had surgery to repair his knee and missed about 10 tournaments, including two major championships.
 Television ratings for golf during his absence were down by an average of 50 percent from 2007, and down a similar level for the two events he missed from the 2009 schedule before returning to the W.G.C.-Accenture World Match Play.
 Was there an upside during the eight-month absence? There was the emergence of some new young stars. Anthony Kim, 24, and Camilo Villegas, 27, won twice -- though neither has won again. And the veteran Steve Stricker rediscovered his game and rose to No. 2 in the world golf rankings. And Phil Mickelson, who regained the No. 2 spot with his win at the Tour Championship, re-established himself as clearly the second-best player in the world and the only player besides Woods capable of moving the needle.
 Could Rory McIlroy, the 21-year-old sensation from Northern Ireland who will join the PGA Tour in 2010, become the new world star? Could Adam Scott, 29, who recently broke his slump with a win in Australia, ditch the matinee-idol work ethic and finally emerge as the golf star he was touted to be?
 Those are large question marks attached to any upside possibility for golf without Tiger Woods. Since no one, probably including Woods, knows how many events he will miss in 2010, any forecast is guesswork. But should he miss six months the tournaments that would suffer most based on his playing schedules from 2005-09 include the San Diego Open, where he started four of five seasons since 2006 at Torrey Pines Golf Course; the W.G.C.-Accenture in Marana, Ariz.; the W.G.C.-CA Championship in Miami; the Arnold Palmer Invitational in Orlando, Fla.; the Masters in Augusta, Ga.; the Quail Hollow Championship in Charlotte, N.C.; the Players Championship in Ponte Vedra, Fla.; and the Memorial Tournament in Dublin, Ohio.
 It is doubtful Woods would play in the United States Open in Pebble Beach, Calif., without a prior competitive start. Should he choose to play the Open, he will probably play at the Memorial two weeks before Pebble Beach, where he set the United States Open record with a 15-stroke victory in 2000.
 If Woods skips the entire season, he will also miss the remaining two major championships -- the British Open at St. Andrews, and the P.G.A. Championship at Whistling Straits in Kohler, Wis. -- and the AT&T, for which Woods is the host, at Aronimink Country Club near Philadelphia.
 ''Contrary to what everyone believes, the tour will go on,'' the golfer Chris DiMarco said in an interview with PGATour.com. ''Anytime you take the greatest competitor of all time out of the game, though, it will miss him.
 ''Sometimes you think he is superhuman, and he is with some of the things he's done on the golf course. This is about Tiger and his family, though. Golf is secondary right now. We were without him and it was awful, but this is way worse. This is life. This is reality.''

HEADLINE: Citigroup Nears Payback Deal; Obama to Press Banks for Help

BYLINE: By JEFF ZELENY and ERIC DASH; Jeff Zeleny reported from Washington, and Eric Dash from New York.

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
Citigroup was close to a deal on Sunday night to be the last of the big Wall Street banks to exit the government's bailout program, after trying to persuade regulators that it was sound enough to stand on its own. 
 Negotiations between the bank's executives and senior government officials went into the night and could still collapse. On Monday, President Obama is to meet with the chiefs of the nation's biggest banks at the White House and press them to help speed the economic recovery by providing more loans to small businesses and homeowners.
 The president, who has faced criticism from Democrats and Republicans alike for being too close to Wall Street, called Citigroup, Goldman Sachs and 10 other big banks to the gathering as anger over last year's bank bailouts continued to percolate. Mr. Obama will address the size of salaries and bonuses, an official said, as he seeks to impress upon bankers that they have a ''special responsibility'' to consumers.
 ''We have to get them off the sidelines and get them to play a more active role in our economic recovery,'' Rahm Emanuel, the White House chief of staff, said in an interview on Sunday. ''They play an essential role in helping the economy grow.'' 
 As banks prepare to issue another round of hefty bonuses, White House officials renewed their harsh tone against Wall Street on Sunday. In an interview on ''60 Minutes'' on CBS, Mr. Obama chided ''fat cat bankers'' for increasing their own pay as average Americans struggled to recover. 
 Lawrence H. Summers, the White House chief economic adviser, said on ''This Week'' on ABC that bankers ''need to recognize that they've got obligations to the country after all that's been done for them, and there is a lot more they can do.''
 Indeed, if the government approves Citigroup's repayment of taxpayer funds, it would free it from pay restrictions for banks that received multiple bailouts. And with most of the nation's biggest banks out of the bailout program, the president may soon lose some of his leverage over the banks.
 The White House has pointed to banks' repayment as proof that the bailouts helped the financial system recover from near disaster, but it wants the banks to help get the economy moving by lending more to companies to create jobs and to consumers in danger of losing their homes to foreclosure. 
 Including Citigroup, bailed-out banks will have returned at least $136 billion, or more than half the $245 billion in bailout money extended this year -- far faster than anticipated. Of course, the government still has tens of billions of dollars at stake with companies like the American International Group and General Motors. 
 The negotiations between Citigroup and regulators come just over a week after the government allowed its troubled rival Bank of America to repay its bailout money and underscore just how quickly confidence has returned to the financial markets. 
 That improvement holds the key to Citigroup's payback plan, as private investors replace $45 billion of taxpayer funds and as the bank weans itself off additional forms of government assistance. 
 Citigroup officials plan to announce a broad program as early as Monday. In a series of complex transactions, bank officials expect to raise about $18 billion by selling stock this week, in an effort to assuage regulators' concerns about the bank's ability to weather another severe economic downturn without returning to the government for more money.
 With its regulators' permission, Citigroup would then redeem at least $20 billion of preferred stock that the government received as part of the bank's first two rescues late last year. It would also exit a federal insurance policy on about $250 billion of troubled real estate and credit card assets. The bank, not taxpayers, would then be liable for those losses.
 The Treasury also wants to wind down its 34 percent ownership stake in Citigroup, which it acquired by converting $25 billion of preferred shares into common stock in a third rescue this year. The government is expected to sell its nearly 7.7 billion shares through a series of large stock sales over the next several months to institutional investors.
 But Citigroup's troubles, and those of other banks, are far from over. Some analysts believe the banks are too weak to repay the taxpayer money. If the government allows banks to deplete their capital levels too soon, they argue, they may be setting the stage for another crisis. 
 For Citigroup, a repayment could help it shed the stigma of having accepted bailout cash. But in some ways, it may be a hollow victory for Citigroup's chief executive, Vikram S. Pandit. 
 The move itself is unlikely to hasten the bank's rapid return to financial health. In fact, it has already proved costly to its existing shareholders in the short term. Citigroup's shares fell nearly 3 percent last week, to $3.95, over concerns the new stock offering would dilute their value. 
 Even if a repayment deal is completed, it will still take several more years to clean up the financial carnage. Citigroup has not posted a substantial profit in seven quarters, and the bank is expected to muddle through most of 2010 amid another wave of mortgage and credit card losses. 
 And, like several big rivals, the bank continues to lean heavily on government support through a debt guarantee program that makes taxpayers liable if it is unable to pay back the loans. Some analysts think that the bank is still too weak to stand on its own. 
 Citigroup executives, however, maintain that paying back the bailout money would have big advantages. Bank officials say it would quell fear that many of its most talented bankers and traders might join hedge funds and other rivals that have no restriction on hiring or bonuses.
 Although Citigroup would still fall under the pay rules outlined in the economic stimulus bill until the government sells its entire ownership stake, its exit from the bailout program would mean it would no longer be subject to the harsher rules imposed by the federal pay czar. 
 Regulators remain concerned about the bank's financial condition. After Bank of America received permission to exit the bailout program early this month, Citigroup officials redoubled their efforts to sever ties with Washington. Much of the discussion centered on how much additional capital Citigroup would need to replenish its coffers after the government's exit. 
 Citigroup argued it should have to raise only $15 billion more, an amount that would reduce the bank's current capital levels and still leave it with a bigger cushion than its competitors. But federal regulators were split over whether that was sufficient. 
 Treasury and some Federal Reserve officials felt more comfortable with that amount. But officials from the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, which has testy relations with Citigroup and deeper financial exposure, demanded it hold more capital. 
 Tensions have been running high as Citigroup and its regulators crammed a process that had taken months into a little more than a week of marathon discussions. If Citigroup does not reach a deal by Tuesday, bank officials fear it would be hard to pull off a big stock offering until next year, because many big investors leave for the holiday vacation. 
 The regulators' decision is likely to cause dozens of small and regional banks to repay the government soon and rid themselves of public controversy. At the same time, it could take extra capital out of the banking system that might otherwise encourage lending. Many of those banks are in the eye of the financial storm as losses on commercial real estate and corporate loans worsen. 
 Wells Fargo and PNC Financial, two large consumer banks that acquired deeply troubled rivals in the throes of the crisis, are still holding on to billions of dollars of taxpayer funds. Many community banks received millions.

HEADLINE: Bond Traders Put Pressure on Debt-Laden Nations

BYLINE: By LANDON THOMAS Jr.

DATELINE: LONDON 

 BODY:
The bond vigilantes are back.
 But this time they are roaming mostly through Europe rather than the United States -- at least for now. Their mission: to force governments to cut budget deficits that have ballooned in the wake of the financial crisis.
 As big investors in the credit markets, activist bond traders developed a fearsome reputation in the early 1990s by pushing up yields on Treasuries in order to force the government to tame large deficits. Their most famous target was a newly elected president, Bill Clinton, whom they pressured to abandon campaign promises of tax cuts. 
 Today, the bond market posse has set its sights on Europe -- particularly Britain and Greece -- where stagnant economies and high levels of government spending have led to the highest budget deficits in the region. 
 Although the left-leaning governments in both countries are struggling to show investors that they have a workable plan to reduce deficits -- which now average around 13 percent of gross domestic product -- bond traders are increasingly demanding higher interest rates to reflect the rising risks. 
 Bond traders last week pushed the spreads between Greek 10-year bonds and their benchmark German counterparts -- a measure of investor confidence in the country -- to highs of 250 basis points after the nation's credit rating was downgraded, raising concerns over Greece's ability to service its enormous debt. 
 In Britain, where the nation's economy and finances have fallen so sharply that investors fear a possible downgrade of the country's triple-A rating, bond traders are also taking a hard line. Last week, yields on gilts were pushed to their highest levels since the depths of the financial crisis, after the Labour Party issued a preliminary budget report that skimped on details of spending cuts.
 ''There is a clear drop in confidence on the part of bond investors,'' said Mark Schofield, a fixed-income strategist at Citigroup in London. ''I think it is all beginning to unravel.'' 
 The power of the bond trader to influence governments once prompted James Carville, Mr. Clinton's political strategist at the time, to say that he wished to be reincarnated as one because ''you can intimidate everybody.'' 
 Mr. Clinton may not have been intimidated, but he did heed the advice of Robert Rubin, who joined the administration from his post at the top of Goldman Sachs, that a policy of budgetary restraint would keep the bond market happy and interest rates on United States government bonds low.
 Since then, the vigilantes have been largely in abeyance: As the global economy boomed, public sector deficits were not a concern for investors.
 All that changed rapidly with the onset of the credit crisis last year. Bond traders surfed the global liquidity wave, buying up government debt all over the world in the view that, just as most big banks were too big to fail, so were sovereign economies, no matter how crushing their fiscal picture.
 But Dubai World's recent decision to delay payment on its debt has brought the crisis to reality for complacent bondholders. They have begun to demand that governments with large budget gaps start to pay higher interest rates on their bonds to reflect rising sovereign risk -- a development that will lead to higher borrowing costs in countries like Britain, Greece, Ireland and Spain. 
 The United States and Japan also face unusually high debt levels, deepened by huge stimulus programs. For the time being, investors are still willing to lend to them at generous rates. But bondholders are running out of patience as the finances of even the wealthiest nations spiral downward. 
 As bond investors become more impatient, some European countries have taken aggressive fiscal action. 
 In Ireland, the government this month presented the most severe budget in the nation's history, largely to prove to wary bond investors that it was serious about cutting its own deficit.
 ''There is a greater market focus now on who the fiscally vulnerable countries are,'' said Michael Saunders, the head of European economics at Citigroup.
 Britain falls into that category, he said, because the British Labour government, led by Prime Minister Gordon Brown, is facing a difficult election battle and appears more concerned with pleasing voters than investors. That could lead to a bond market rout if gilt holders, a large proportion of them foreign, come to the conclusion that cutting the deficit is not a top priority, he said.
 In the euro zone, the European Central Bank's interest in keeping inflation low means that it is likely to maintain a stable euro, leaving smaller European economies with no opportunity for a cheaper currency to help generate growth from exports. 
 As a result, governments in Portugal, Ireland, Greece and Spain have had to turn to increasingly skeptical bond markets to raise funds while waiting for their economies to recover through the far more painful process of squeezing wages and shedding jobs to restore competitiveness.
 A recent report from Standard Chartered even suggested that weak euro members like Greece and Ireland might reconsider their ties to the union if investors pulled the plug and stopped refinancing their countries' debts.
 ''The idea that currency unions can't break up is rubbish,'' said Tim Congdon, an economist and professed euro skeptic who has advised Conservative governments in Britain. ''The critical issue is whether governments can repay their debts in new currencies or euros once they leave.''
 If they can pay back bond investors in new and cheaper currencies, then it is in the interests of countries like Greece to go out on their own, Mr. Congdon said.
 But with other countries seeking the shelter of the euro and leaders like Angela Merkel of Germany hinting that the big powers would come to the rescue of Greece and other distressed countries if necessary, most economists argue that the euro zone is unlikely to crack.
 Still, that has not stopped bond investors from talking up a new divergence trade in Europe -- the flip side to the convergence trade earlier this decade, during which Irish, Greek and Spanish government bonds were bought on the theory that a grand economic harmony would sweep Europe.

PERSON: Paul A. Samuelson 

HEADLINE: Paul A. Samuelson, Nobel Economist, Dies at 94

BYLINE: By MICHAEL M. WEINSTEIN

 BODY:
Paul A. Samuelson, the first American Nobel laureate in economics and the foremost academic economist of the 20th century, died Sunday at his home in Belmont, Mass. He was 94. 
 His death was announced by the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, which Mr. Samuelson helped build into one of the world's great centers of graduate education in economics.
 In receiving the Nobel Prize in 1970, Mr. Samuelson was credited with transforming his discipline from one that ruminates about economic issues to one that solves problems, answering questions about cause and effect with mathematical rigor and clarity. 
 When economists ''sit down with a piece of paper to calculate or analyze something, you would have to say that no one was more important in providing the tools they use and the ideas that they employ than Paul Samuelson,'' said Robert M. Solow, a fellow Nobel laureate and colleague of Mr. Samuelson's at M.I.T. 
 Mr. Samuelson attracted a brilliant roster of economists to teach or study at the university, among them Mr. Solow as well as others who would go on to become Nobel laureates like George A. Akerlof, Robert F. Engle III, Lawrence R. Klein, Paul Krugman, Franco Modigliani, Robert C. Merton and Joseph E. Stiglitz. 
 Mr. Samuelson wrote one of the most widely used college textbooks in the history of American education. The book, ''Economics,'' first published in 1948, was the nation's best-selling textbook for nearly 30 years. Translated into 20 languages, it was selling 50,000 copies a year a half century after it first appeared.
 ''I don't care who writes a nation's laws -- or crafts its advanced treatises -- if I can write its economics textbooks,'' Mr. Samuelson said.
 His textbook taught college students how to think about economics. His technical work -- especially his discipline-shattering Ph.D. thesis, immodestly titled ''The Foundations of Economic Analysis'' -- taught professional economists how to ply their trade. Between the two books, Mr. Samuelson redefined modern economics.
 The textbook introduced generations of students to the revolutionary ideas of John Maynard Keynes, the British economist who in the 1930s developed the theory that modern market economies could become trapped in depression and would then need a strong push from government spending or tax cuts, in addition to lenient monetary policy, to restore them. Many economics students would never again rest comfortably with the 19th-century view that private markets would cure unemployment without need of government intervention.
 That lesson was reinforced in 2008, when the international economy slipped into the steepest downturn since the Great Depression, when Keynesian economics was born. When the Depression began, governments stood pat or made matters worse by trying to balance fiscal budgets and erecting trade barriers. But 80 years later, having absorbed the Keynesian teaching of Mr. Samuelson and his followers, most industrialized countries took corrective action, raising government spending, cutting taxes, keeping exports and imports flowing and driving short-term interest rates to near zero. 
 Lessons for Kennedy
 Mr. Samuelson explained Keynesian economics to American presidents, world leaders, members of Congress and the Federal Reserve Board, not to mention other economists. He was a consultant to the United States Treasury, the Bureau of the Budget and the President's Council of Economic Advisers. 
 His most influential student was John F. Kennedy, whose first 40-minute class with Mr. Samuelson, after the 1960 election, was conducted on a rock by the beach at the family compound at Hyannis Port, Mass. Before class, there was lunch with politicians and Cambridge intellectuals aboard a yacht offshore. ''I had expected a scrumptious meal,'' Mr. Samuelson said. ''We had franks and beans.''
 As a member of the Kennedy campaign brain trust, Mr. Samuelson headed an economic task force for the candidate and held several private sessions on economics with him. Many would have a bearing on decisions made during the Kennedy administration. 
 Though Mr. Samuelson was President Kennedy's first choice to become chairman of the Council of Economic Advisers, he refused, on principle, to take any government office because, he said, he did not want to put himself in a position in which he could not say and write what he believed.
 After the 1960 election, he told the young president-elect that the nation was heading into a recession and that Kennedy should push through a tax cut to head it off. Kennedy was shocked. 
 ''I've just campaigned on a platform of fiscal responsibility and balanced budgets and here you are telling me that the first thing I should do in office is to cut taxes?'' Mr. Samuelson recalled, quoting the president. 
 Kennedy eventually accepted the professor's advice and signaled his willingness to cut taxes, but he was assassinated before he could take action. His successor, Lyndon B. Johnson, carried out the plan, however, and the economy bounced back.
 Adding Bite to Academia
 In the classroom, Mr. Samuelson was a lively, funny, articulate teacher. On theories that he and others had developed to show links between the performance of the stock market and the general economy, he famously said: ''It is indeed true that the stock market can forecast the business cycle. The stock market has called nine of the last five recessions.'' 
 His speeches and his voluminous writing had a lucidity and bite not usually found in academic technicians. He tried to give his economic pronouncements a ''snap at the end,'' he said, ''like Mark Twain.'' When women began complaining about career and salary inequities, for example, he said in their defense, ''Women are men without money.''
 Remarkably versatile, Mr. Samuelson reshaped academic thinking about nearly every economic subject, from what Marx could have meant by a labor theory of value to whether stock prices fluctuate randomly. Mathematics had already been employed by social scientists, but Mr. Samuelson brought the discipline into the mainstream of economic thinking, showing how to derive strong theoretical predictions from simple mathematical assumptions. 
 His early work, for example, presented a unified mathematical structure for predicting how businesses and households alike would respond to changes in economic forces, how changes in wage rates would affect employment, and how tax rate changes would affect tax collections.
 His relentless application of mathematical analysis gave rise to an astonishing number of groundbreaking theorems, resolving debates that had raged among theorists for decades, if not centuries. 
 An Economic Theorem
 Early in his career, Mr. Samuelson developed the rudimentary mathematics of business cycles with a model, called the multiplier-accelerator, that captured the inherent tendency of market economies to fluctuate.
 The model showed how markets magnify the impact of outside shocks and turn, say, an initial one dollar increase in foreign investment into a several dollar increase in total domestic income, to be followed by a decline.
 Mr. Samuelson provided a mathematical structure to study the impact of trade on different groups of consumers and workers. In a famous theorem, known as Stolper-Samuelson, he and a co-author showed that competition from imports of clothes and similar goods from underdeveloped countries, where producers rely on unskilled workers, could drive down the wages of low-paid workers in industrialized countries.
 The theorem provided the intellectual scaffold for opponents of free trade. And late in his career, Mr. Samuelson set off an intellectual commotion by pointing out that the economy of a country like the United States could be hurt if productivity rose among the economies with which it traded. 
 Yet Mr. Samuelson, like most academic economists, remained an advocate of open trade. Trade, he taught, raises average living standards enough to allow the workers and consumers who benefit to compensate those who suffer, and still have some extra income left over. Protectionism would not help, but higher productivity would.
 Mr. Samuelson also formulated a theory of public goods -- that is, goods that can be provided effectively only through collective, or government, action. National defense is one such public good. It is nonexclusive; the Navy, for example, exists to protect every citizen. It also eliminates rivalry among its many consumers; that is, the amount of security that any one citizen derives from the Navy subtracts nothing from the amount of security that any other citizen derives. 
 The features of public goods, Mr. Samuelson taught, stand in direct contrast to those of ordinary goods, like apples. An apple eaten by one consumer is not available to any other. Public goods, he concluded, cannot be sold in private markets because individuals have no incentive to pay for them voluntarily. Instead they hope to get a free ride from the decisions of others to make the public goods available. 
 A Predictive Principle
 Mr. Samuelson pushed mathematical analysis to new levels of sophistication. For example, economists routinely write mathematical models of market economies that assume consumers and producers make choices to maximize their well-being. The question arises when such economies are stable: if disturbed by, say, droughts or wars or technological change, will the economy return to appropriate levels of prices and output or, instead, fly out of control? What Mr. Samuelson's ''correspondence principle'' shows is the theoretical link between the behavior of individuals and the aggregate stability of the entire economic system. Information about individual responses, Mr. Samuelson's theorem holds, shapes predictions about overall economic stability.
 He analyzed the evolution of economies with a mathematical model, called an overlapping generations model, that scholars have since used to study, for example, the functioning over time of the Social Security system and the management of public debt.
 He also helped develop linear programming, a mathematical tool used by corporations and central planners in socialist countries to calculate how to produce pre-set levels of various goods and services at the least cost. 
 Late in his career, Mr. Samuelson laid out the mathematics of stock price movements, an analysis that became the basis for Nobel Prize-winning research by his student Mr. Merton and Myron S. Scholes. They designed formulas that Wall Street analysts use to trade options and other complicated securities known as derivatives. 
 But beyond his astonishing array of scientific theorems and conclusions, Mr. Samuelson wedded Keynesian thought to conventional economics. He developed what he called the Neoclassical Synthesis. The neoclassical economists in the late 19th century showed how forces of supply and demand generate equilibrium in the market for apples, shoes and all other consumer goods and services. The standard analysis had held that market economies, left to their own devices, gravitated naturally toward full employment.
 Economists clung to this theory even in the wake of the Depression of the 1930s. But the need to explain the market collapse, as well as unemployment rates that soared to 25 percent, gave rise to a contrary strain of thought associated with Keynes.
 Mr. Samuelson's resulting ''synthesis'' amounted to the notion that economists could use the neoclassical apparatus to analyze economies operating near full employment, but switch over to Keynesian analysis when the economy turned sour. 
 Midwestern Roots
 Paul Anthony Samuelson was born on May 15, 1915, in Gary, Ind., the son of Frank Samuelson, a pharmacist, and the former Ella Lipton. His family, he said, was ''made up of upwardly mobile Jewish immigrants from Poland who had prospered considerably in World War I, because Gary was a brand new steel town when my family went there.'' 
 But after his father lost much of his money in the years after the war, the family moved to Chicago. Young Paul attended Hyde Park High School, where as a freshman he began studying the stock market. At one point he helped his algebra teacher select stocks to buy in the boom of the 1920s. 
 ''Hupp Motors and other losers,'' he remembered in an interview in 1996. ''Proof of the fallibility of systems,'' he said.
 He left high school at age 16 to enter the University of Chicago. ''I was born as an economist on Jan. 2, 1932,'' he said. That was the day he heard his first college lecture, on Thomas Malthus, the 18th-century British economist who studied the relation between poverty and population growth. Hooked, he began taking economics courses.
 The University of Chicago developed the century's leading conservative economic theorists, under the later guidance of Milton Friedman. But Mr. Samuelson regarded the teaching at Chicago as ''schizophrenic.'' This was at the height of the Depression, and courses about the business cycle naturally talked about unemployment, he said. But in economic-theory classes, joblessness was not mentioned.
 ''The niceties of existence were not a matter of concern,'' he recalled, ''yet everything around was closed down most of the time. If you lived in a middle-class community in Chicago, children and adults came daily to the door saying, 'We are starving, how about a potato?' I speak from poignant memory.''
 After receiving his bachelor's degree from Chicago in 1935, he went to Harvard, where he was attracted to the ideas of the Harvard professor Alvin Hansen, the leading exponent of Keynesian theory in America. 
 As a student at Chicago and later at Cambridge, Mr. Samuelson had at first reacted negatively to Keynes. ''What I resisted most was the notion that there could be equilibrium unemployment'' -- that some level of unemployment would be impossible to eliminate and have to be tolerated. ''I spent four summers of my college career on the beach at Lake Michigan,'' he said. ''It was pointless to look for work. I didn't even have to test the market because I had friends who would go to 350 potential employers and not be able to get any job at all.'' 
 Eventually he was converted. ''Why do I want to refuse a paradigm that enables me to understand the Roosevelt upturn from 1933 to 1937?'' he asked himself. 
 Mr. Samuelson was perceived at the outset of his career as a brilliant mathematical economist. He shot to academic fame as a 22-year-old prodigy at Harvard when he began a boldly sweeping and highly technical doctoral dissertation, published as a book in 1947 by Harvard University Press.
 At Harvard, as at Chicago, he was not shy about criticizing his professors -- ''respecting neither age nor rank,'' according to James Tobin, a Nobel laureate of Yale University. The young Mr. Samuelson's chief complaint against economists was that they preoccupied themselves with finer economic principles while all around them people were being thrown into bread lines.
 A Bold Dissertation
 His attitudes did not endear him to the austere chairman of the economics department at Harvard, Harold Hitchings Burbank, with whom he had a rocky relationship.
 But the publication of his dissertation was an immediate success. It won him the John Bates Clark Medal awarded by the American Economic Association to the economist showing the most scholarly promise before the age of 40; it would eventually help him win his Nobel, and it was frequently reprinted despite the heavy resistance of Professor Burbank, selling to economists around the world for more than 20 years. (''Sweet revenge,'' Mr. Samuelson said.) 
 Among Mr. Samuelson's fellow students was Marion Crawford. They married in 1938. Mr. Samuelson earned his master's degree from Harvard in 1936 and a Ph.D. in 1941. He wrote his thesis from 1937 to 1940 as a member of the prestigious Harvard Society of Junior Fellows. In 1940, Harvard offered him an instructorship, which he accepted, but a month later M.I.T. invited him to become an assistant professor. 
 Harvard made no attempt to keep him, even though he had by then developed an international following. Mr. Solow said of the Harvard economics department at the time: ''You could be disqualified for a job if you were either smart or Jewish or Keynesian. So what chance did this smart, Jewish, Keynesian have?''
 During World War II, Mr. Samuelson worked in M.I.T.'s Radiation Laboratory, developing computers for tracking aircraft, and was a consultant for the War Production Board. After the war, having resumed teaching, he and his wife started a family. When she became pregnant the fourth time, she gave birth to triplets, all boys.
 Marion Samuelson died in 1978. Mr. Samuelson is survived by his second wife, Risha Clay Samuelson; six children from his first marriage: Jane Raybould, Margaret Crawford-Samuelson, William and the triplet sons, Robert, John and Paul; and 15 grandchildren. Mr. Samuelson is also survived by a brother, Robert Summers, a professor emeritus of economics at the University of Pennsylvania and father of Lawrence H. Summers, director of President Obama's National Economic Council and former secretary of the Treasury under President Clinton and former president of Harvard. 
 A Keynesian Textbook
 The birth of the triplets doubled the number of children in the Samuelson household, which soon found itself sending 350 diapers to the laundry each week. His friends suggested that Mr. Samuelson needed to write a book to earn more money.
 He decided to write an economics textbook, but one that would not only be compelling for students but also sophisticated and comprehensive. And he wanted to center it on the still poorly understood Keynesian revolution. President Herbert Hoover, he noted, had never referred to Keynes other than as ''the Marxist Keynes.'' 
 ''I never quite understood that venom,'' Mr. Samuelson said.
 He said he ''sweated blood'' writing his book, employing detailed charts, color graphics and humor. He wrote: ''Economists are said to disagree too much but in ways that are too much alike: If eight sleep in the same bed, you can be sure that, like Eskimos, when they turn over, they'll all turn over together.''
 It would be difficult to overestimate the influence of ''Economics.'' Business Week, taking note of the textbook's publication in Greek, Punjabi, Hebrew, Russian, Serbo-Croatian and other languages, once said that it had ''gone a long way in giving the world a common economic language.'' Students were attracted to its lively prose and relevance to their everyday lives. Many textbook authors began to copy its presentation. 
 ''Economics,'' together with shrewd investing, made Mr. Samuelson a millionaire many times over.
 Friendship With a Rival
 A historian could well tell the story of 20th-century public debate over economic policy in America through the jousting between Mr. Samuelson and Milton Friedman, who won the Nobel in 1976. Mr. Samuelson said the two had almost always disagreed with each other but had remained friends. They met in 1933 at the University of Chicago, when Mr. Samuelson was an undergraduate and Mr. Friedman a graduate student.
 Unlike the liberal Mr. Samuelson, the conservative Mr. Friedman opposed active government participation in most areas of the economy except national defense and law enforcement. He thought private enterprise and competition could do better and that government controls posed risks to individual freedoms.
 Both men were fluid speakers as well as writers, and they debated often in public forums, in testimony before Congressional committees, in op-ed articles and in columns each of them wrote for Newsweek magazine. But Mr. Samuelson said he always had fear in his heart when he prepared for combat with Mr. Friedman, a formidably engaging debater.
 ''If you looked at a transcript afterward, it might seem clear that you had won the debate on points,'' he said. ''But somehow, with members of the audience, you always seemed to come off as elite, and Milton seemed to have won the day.''
 Mr. Samuelson said he had never regarded Keynesianism as a religion, and he criticized some of his liberal colleagues for seeming to do so, earning himself, late in life, the label ''l'enfant terrible emeritus.'' The experience of nations in the second half of the century, he said, had diminished his optimism about the ability of government to perform miracles. 
 If government gets too big, and too great a portion of the nation's income passes through it, he said, government becomes inefficient and unresponsive to the human needs ''we do-gooders extol,'' and thus risks infringing on freedoms. 
 But, he said, no serious political or economic thinker would reject the fundamental Keynesian idea that a benevolent democratic government must do what it can to avert economic trouble in areas the free markets cannot. Neither government alone nor the markets alone, he said, could serve the public welfare without help from the other.
 As nations became locked in global competition, and as the computerization of the workplace created daunting employment problems, he agreed with the economic conservatives in advocating that American corporations must stay lean and efficient and follow the general dictates of the free market. 
 But he warned that the harshness of the marketplace had to be tempered and that corporate downsizing and the reduction of government programs ''must be done with a heart.''
 Despite his celebrated accomplishments, Mr. Samuelson preached and practiced humility. The M.I.T. economics department became famous for collegiality, in no small part because no one else could play prima donna if Mr. Samuelson refused the role, and, of course, he did. Economists, he told his students, as Churchill said of political colleagues, ''have much to be humble about.''

HEADLINE: Connecticut Faces Winter Of Discontent

BYLINE: By PETER APPLEBOME. 
E-mail: peappl@nytimes.com

 BODY:
Let's see. Senator Dodd is in big trouble. There's a rare wide-open governor's race in both parties. The natives are restless because of an unpopular war, a shaky economy, gaping state deficits and unhappiness with politics as usual.
 The year, it turns out, is 1970, when Connecticut turned out its longtime Democratic senator, Thomas J. Dodd, replaced him with a Republican, Lowell P. Weicker, and elected Thomas J. Meskill as its first Republican governor in 16 years -- and for a year at least turned the Land of Steady Habits inside out. 
 There have been a few wobbly moments since then, the resignation of Republican Gov. John G. Rowland the most notable. But, for the most part, few places in America have had as steady a cast of political characters as Connecticut. Mr. Dodd's son, Christopher J. Dodd, was elected to the Senate in 1980, eventually becoming the longest-serving senator in Connecticut history. Senator Joseph I. Lieberman, first elected to the State Senate during the upheaval of 1970, has been the state's other United States senator since 1988. A Democrat has not held the governor's seat since 1991. 
 All of which, with the eerie bookends of Dodd the Elder and Dodd the Younger, makes the coming year the most unsettled in four decades in Connecticut politics, and perhaps offers a glimpse of how uneasy voters are elsewhere as well.
 What is less clear is whether reshuffling the deck will feel as substantial now as it did four decades ago.
 At the least, you can say this is the political consultants' full-employment program in Connecticut. With Christopher Dodd, a Democrat, rated perhaps the most vulnerable senator in Washington and with the unexpected decision last month by Gov. M. Jodi Rell, a Republican, not to run for re-election, every ambitious politician in a state that has had a longtime dearth of marquee races worth running in is coming out to sniff around the landscape. 
 The potential story lines are endless. With the death of Senator Edward M. Kennedy, Mr. Dodd may be the most influential Democrat in the Senate, at the center of writing both health care and financial reform regulation. And, as a result of his failed presidential bid when he moved his family to Iowa, his stewardship of the Senate Banking Committee during the economic meltdown and his own conduct, like a disputed loan from the fallen subprime giant Countrywide Financial, he is viewed as hanging on by a thread at home. 
 The political newsletter The Cook Political Report recently described Mr. Dodd as ''about as unelectable as unindicted incumbents get'' and rated the race ''Lean Republican.'' 
 Let the subplots begin: Could Mr. Dodd bow out, to be replaced by the Democrats eternal gentleman in waiting, Attorney General Richard Blumenthal? (Everyone mentions it and almost no one thinks it will happen.) Having been driven, in part, by a desire to redeem the name and reputation of his father, who was censured by the Senate over the misuse of campaign money, will Mr. Dodd leave on a similarly dismal note?
 WILL media motormouths get their dream smackdown between Mr. Dodd and Linda E. McMahon, the former chief executive officer of World Wrestling Entertainment, guaranteeing that political analysts like Bruno Sammartino, Superstar Billy Graham, Blue Meanie and Chyna will become major voices in determining the balance of power in the Senate? Or will they have to settle for a more predictable race between Mr. Dodd and Rob Simmons, a former congressman?
 There's more. Will Ralph Nader decide to jump into the Senate race? Will the antiwar brand of Ned Lamont, Mr. Lieberman's former nemesis, translate to the governor's race? Will voters be able to keep straight the gaggle of midlevel Connecticut politicians rushing to put their hands up?
 And, mostly there's this. In 1970, most of the noise and passion was coming from the left (and ended with the Democrats losing both races). Now it's coming from everywhere. In the mixed-martial-arts environment of the cable/blogosphere/24-hour news cycle, maybe we just end up with 1970 on steroids, political blood sport in which seeing the other guy lose, particularly if he's a symbol of Washington insiderdom like Chris Dodd, is as important as what you do if you win.
 Or maybe that is no longer enough. Left and right, tea-party types or Democrats and independents growing uneasy with change that feels too much like what we were supposed to be changing from; we're mad as hell and we're not gonna take it anymore -- though we invariably do. So does a pumped-up candidate emerge in either race, who really seems to offer something new, or do we figure that's too much to ask, shuffle the cards and figure that 40 years on, a little dramatic deja vu is about as much as we can expect?

HEADLINE: Planning Detour in the U.S., Giro Director Takes a Big Risk

BYLINE: By JULIET MACUR

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
With a course that winds more than 2,000 miles through Italy, up snow-covered mountains and down steep, snaking roads, the Giro d'Italia -- Italy's renowned 21-day cycling race -- is one of the world's most grueling sporting events. But Angelo Zomegnan, the race director, is out to make it even harder.
 A maestro of marketing, Zomegnan is the driving force behind bringing the first two stages of the Giro to the streets of Washington in 2012. He said the project would cost about $5 million.
 Some critics say starting the race in the United States is unrealistic: too expensive, too much of a hassle and too punishing for the riders, who would have to deal with jet lag. Others say it is nonsensical, comparing it to hosting the middle two games of the World Series overseas. 
 ''Is it crazy? Oh sure, yes, I've heard that,'' Zomegnan said last week before meeting with Washington's mayor, Adrian M. Fenty, to discuss race plans. ''But I think it is good to take chances. I don't say, why. I say, why not?''
 Zomegnan, a former journalist, has taken chances to garner more attention for the Giro, with mixed results.
 At the 2009 Giro in May, the race's 100th anniversary, he designed a spectacular, made-for-television course so demanding that some riders -- including the seven-time Tour de France winner Lance Armstrong -- complained that some parts were too dangerous. 
 Zomegnan all but called them wimps, saying they may be ''getting too old and no longer want to race in tough situations.'' The riders were angered, but the race garnered more spectators and a larger television audience than ever.
 ''Bringing in extreme events brings more publicity for the sport, but he goes a little too far in creating a spectacle and he neglects the sporting element and the safety of the riders,'' Pat McQuaid, the president of the International Cycling Union, said last week, adding that he had warned Zomegnan to keep the riders' safety in mind. 
 ''I understand his position of trying to create public interest, but this can't go on,'' McQuaid said. ''If the Giro idea becomes realistic, we would definitely have a say in the structure of the race. We would make sure to protect the riders.''
 McQuaid said that the priority for the cycling union would be for the riders to have enough time to overcome their jet lag. He said at least two to three days of rest in Italy would be necessary before the race continued. Zomegnan said one or two days would suffice.
 ''Normal people have jet lag,'' Zomegnan said. ''Normal people can't run three weeks and 3,500 kilometers. The riders aren't normal people.''
 Still, the project is going forward. Mark Sommers, a lawyer who is head of the group working to bring the race to Washington, said the city and Giro organizers had a ''tentative agreement.'' Over the next several weeks, Giro officials will speak to tourism, safety and city officials to complete details. 
 The proposed course for both stages would remain inside the city, passing buildings and monuments that have a link to Italy, Sommers said. One of those sites includes the Memorial Bridge, which connects Virginia and Washington. The statues at one end were gifts from Italy to the United States in 1950. 
 ''Angelo doesn't want the race to be Italian-centric; he's more universal than that,'' Sommers said. ''He has a larger mission to build the brand and the sport outside of Europe. He's inventive. You've got to love that.'' 
 That feat of holding two Giro stages in Washington would be a logistical marvel, requiring 198 riders and several hundred Giro and team staff to fly eight hours and traverse five time zones before the race resumes on Italian soil, in Rome. The bicycles, each worth thousands of dollars, would ride along.
 Other sports have already accomplished something similar, to different degrees. Major League Baseball has played regular-season games in Japan, and the N.H.L. has done so in Europe. The N.F.L. has played regular-season games in London.
 But none of those sports are quite like the Giro, one of cycling's three Grand Tours -- races that require riders to have nearly superhuman resilience as they endure physical pain day after day for three weeks. It is a triumph just to make it to the finish. None of the Grand Tours, which include the Tour de France and the Vuelta a Espana, have ever started outside Europe. But several times, Tour organizers have toyed with the idea. 
 In the 1980s, a New York start for the Tour was considered, but dropped because there were not enough Concordes to fly the riders back to France. In 2008, a start in Quebec City would have been part of the city's 400th anniversary, but Tour organizers balked. 
 ''It would be like asking the Formula One people to hold their time trials in Canada and then having the Grand Prix race run in Europe,'' the Tour official Jean-Francois Pescheux told La Presse, a newspaper in Montreal, during those negotiations. ''The idea has been studied, the potential is there, everything is there, but we can't allow it.''
 Zomegnan, however, says he does not see any problems with his plan. He tried to bring the race's start to New York for the Giro's anniversary, but decided against it because of the lagging economy. He then began working with Robin Morton, who runs an event planning and production company in New Jersey, to try again. They ended up in Washington.
 ''There's so many events that come to the city of New York, whether it's sporting events or global functions, I guess New York didn't want to pursue our plan,'' said Morton, who was the manager of the 1984 Gianni-Motta team, the first American-based team at the Giro. ''But Mayor Fenty is a big cycling fan, and the city is also trying to raise its profile. It was a good fit.''
 Some riders, including the Garmin-Transitions team leader Christian Vande Velde, say the plan not only is feasible, but it may also be fun.
 ''I think if you are intelligent about the whole matter and are civil to the riders, it would be beautiful and really cool, and it would bring a lot of recognition for our sport,'' Vande Velde said. ''It's a crazy idea, but it could work.
 ''But, of course, there's a fine line between crazy stupid and crazy spectacular,'' he added. ''I'm supportive of it, within reason.''

HEADLINE: Shares Rise as Dubai Bailout Eases Debt Concerns

BYLINE: By THE ASSOCIATED PRESS

 BODY:
Easing concerns about debt problems overseas nudged major stock indexes to new highs for the year.
 The market climbed on Monday after the news that Abu Dhabi had extended $10 billion to nearby Dubai to help the emirate make debt payments. Analysts have been concerned since last month that a cash crisis in Dubai could have repercussions in global credit markets. 
 In addition, Exxon Mobilsaid it would acquire XTO Energy to help it tap into the growing supply of natural gas -- a move that could signal more deals in the energy industry.
 A drop in shares of Exxon held the Dow Jones industrial average to more modest gains than other indexes. The Dow added 29.55 points, or 0.28 percent, to close at 10,501.05. The broader Standard & Poor's 500-stock index rose 7.7 points, or 0.7 percent, to 1,114.11, while the Nasdaq composite gained 21.79 points, or nearly 1 percent, to end at 2,212.10.
 Financial stocks rose after Citigroupsaid it would repay the $20 billion it received last year from the government's financial rescue program. The government also will sell its 34 percent stake in the company. The news came just days after Bank of America repaid the $45 billion in bailout money it owed taxpayers.
 The day's advance was orderly and signaled that traders remained cautious, as they have for weeks. A big run in stocks that began in March has slowed in the last month as investors look to lock in some of their gains from 2009 and determine how to position themselves for the new year. The S.& P. 500 index is up 1.7 percent so far this month, after a 5.7 percent gain in November and a 64.7 percent jump since early March.
 ''Most people, for the most part, have wrapped up the year,'' said Blaze Tankersley, chief market strategist at the brokerage Bay Crest Partners.
 The dollar weakened, helping to lift most commodities prices. Commodities are priced in dollars and become cheaper for foreign buyers when the United States currency falls.
 Gold rose, while oil fell 36 cents to settle at $69.51 a barrel on the New York Mercantile Exchange.
 The yield on the benchmark 10-year Treasury note was flat on Monday at 3.55 percent.
 Analysts said stocks were likely to drift as investors awaited comments about the economy and interest rates from the Federal Reserve, which wraps up its last policy meeting of the year on Wednesday.
 Investors expect the central bank to keep its benchmark interest rate at a historic low level of near zero. But there is some concern that rates could rise sooner than previously thought as the economy improves.
 ''People simply want to know if we are going to keep this low-interest-rate environment,'' said Michael Feser, president of Zecco Trading in Pasadena, Calif. ''That has really been fuel for this market.''
 The following are the results of Monday's Treasury auction of three- and six-month bills:

HEADLINE: How the Poll Was Conducted

 BODY:
The latest New York Times/CBS News poll is based on telephone interviews conducted Dec. 5 through Dec. 10 with 708 adults throughout the United States who said they were currently unemployed. 
 Households containing the unemployed were identified in two ways: respondents to 12 nationwide polls by The Times and CBS News during the past year were asked about unemployment in their household; and during November, thousands of additional random phone numbers across the country were screened for unemployment in the household. 
 Interviews with the unemployed were conducted during the December Times/CBS News survey. They were weighted by reported length of unemployment to approximate Bureau of Labor Statistics findings on shorter-term vs. longer-term unemployment.
 In theory, in 19 cases out of 20, overall results based on such samples will differ by no more than four percentage points in either direction from what would have been obtained by seeking to interview all American adults who say they are unemployed.
 In addition to sampling error, the practical difficulties of conducting any survey of the public may introduce other sources of error into the poll. Variation in the wording and order of questions, for example, can lead to somewhat different results. In particular, the questions used by this poll and by the federal government to measure unemployment were similar but not identical.
 Michael R. Kagay of Princeton, N.J., assisted The Times in its polling analysis. Complete questions, results and survey methods are available at nytimes.com/polls.

HEADLINE: Chihuahua Tale

 BODY:
Animal shelters across California are juggling chihuahuas. A rising tide of abandonment has led the little dogs to now rival pit bulls for the unhappy title of most popular, most unwanted breed. 
 In Oakland, half the dogs at one shelter are chihuahuas. In San Francisco's municipal shelter, the proportion of full- or part-chihuahuas is one-third and rising. Officials in Los Angeles have taken to airlifting them to the Northeast, which has many more chihuahua lovers than shelters here can supply. 
 Shelter officials say breeders and puppy mills have been saturating a market that has been artificially stoked by pop culture. Add a deep recession, and it's easy to understand the flood of plaintive stories and photos of unwanted dogs on shelter Web sites and on Craigslist, so far from the sunny worlds of ''Legally Blonde'' and ''Beverly Hills Chihuahua.'' 
 But let's leave Elle Wood out of this. Too many people learn too late that their little handbag companions can be nervous, yappy, fragile -- they are prone to chronic problems with their teeth, skulls and bones -- and expensive to maintain. 
 As shelters try to solve what is essentially a distribution problem, states need to discourage reckless breeders and pass laws requiring spaying and neutering. People also need to realize the responsibility they are taking on before they buy or adopt any dog. The dogs deserve a safe, caring and permanent home. (And, if it's a shorthaired chihuahua going to the Northeast in winter, a sweater.)

A JOBS APPEAL
 For Ex-Prisoners
 Just in time for the New Year's revelry is an unusual addition to the Times Square landscape: a billboard that encourages employers to hire people with criminal records. 
 The advertisement, which sits on top of the Westin Hotel on Eighth Avenue, between 42nd and 43rd Streets, was bought by a nonprofit group at a discount: a bargain $15,000 for a minimum of four weeks. Usually, the billboards in Times Square go for $35,000 for a similar period.
 ''It's only because of the recession'' that the opportunity for the advertisement came about, said Glenn Martin, a vice president at the nonprofit group, the Fortune Society, which helps people who have been incarcerated re-enter mainstream society.
 Under state law, it is illegal in most cases for employers, with the exception of law enforcement agencies, to decide against hiring someone solely because of a criminal record. 
 Though the law has been in place for about three decades, it is weakly enforced, said Mr. Martin, who is himself a former offender.
 The Fortune Society drafted a measure, which has since become law, requiring employers to post notices stating that discrimination against former inmates is banned and that the subject of a criminal background check should receive a copy of records obtained by a prospective employer.

 Left Bank Books Reprieve? Like many West Village bookstore owners, Kim Herzinger was facing the end of the road. After the landlord declined to renew his lease, he began the solemn rituals of closing: the funereal visits from customers, the tribute in the neighborhood newspaper, and the owner's hurried search for another job, in another field, in another city.
 Then, last week, Mr. Herzinger unexpectedly rewrote this familiar narrative: He announced that his shop, Left Bank Books, may not close. 
 Unlike similar bookstores that have recently closed -- the Oscar Wilde Bookshop is the latest example -- Mr. Herzinger said that he now planned to sign a five-year lease in the coming weeks to move to a larger space in the neighborhood, just a few blocks away.

 Still, the governor's job approval rating remains dismal. Twenty-three percent of the voters polled said Mr. Paterson was doing an excellent or good job; 76 percent said he was doing a fair or poor job.

HEADLINE: Top Author Shifts E-Book Rights To Amazon.com

BYLINE: By BRAD STONE and MOTOKO RICH

 BODY:
Ever since electronic books emerged as a major growth market, New York's largest publishing houses have worried that big-name authors might sign deals directly with e-book retailers or other new ventures, bypassing traditional publishers entirely.
 Now, one well-known author is doing just that. 
 Stephen R. Covey, one of the most successful business authors of the last two decades, has moved e-book rights to two of his best-selling books from his print publisher, Simon & Schuster, a division of the CBS Corporation, to a digital publisher that will sell the e-books to Amazon.com for one year.
 Amazon, maker of the popular Kindle e-reader and one of the biggest book retailers in the country, will have the exclusive rights to sell electronic editions of ''The 7 Habits of Highly Effective People,'' and a later work, ''Principle-Centered Leadership.'' Mr. Covey also plans to gradually make other e-books available exclusively to Amazon, which will promote them on its Web site. 
 The move promises to raise the already high anxiety level among publishers about the economics of digital publishing and could offer authors a way to earn more profits from their works than they do under the traditional system.
 Mr. Covey is making his books available to Amazon through RosettaBooks, an electronic book publisher that primarily traffics in the older works of authors like Kurt Vonnegut and Virginia Woolf. 
 Arthur Klebanoff, chief executive of RosettaBooks, said that Mr. Covey would receive more than half of the net proceeds that RosettaBooks took in from Amazon on these e-book sales. In contrast, the standard digital royalty from mainstream publishers is 25 percent of net proceeds. 
 ''There are superstars, and superstars are entitled to more,'' Mr. Klebanoff said.
 Sean Covey, a son of Mr. Covey and chief innovation officer for Franklin Covey, a training and consulting firm that also publishes business books, said that the higher royalty rate was ''a factor'' in the decision to switch to RosettaBooks. 
 The elder Mr. Covey was also particularly attracted by Amazon's plans to heavily promote the e-book editions of both ''7 Habits'' and ''Principle-Centered Leadership.'' 
 His move comes as publishers ratchet up their efforts to secure the digital rights to so-called backlist titles -- books published many years, if not decades, ago. These books can be vitally important to publishing houses because they are reprinted year after year and provide a stream of guaranteed revenue without much extra marketing effort.
 ''The 7 Habits of Highly Effective People,'' originally published in hardcover in 1989, is a steady seller for Simon & Schuster. This year alone, it has sold 136,000 copies in paperback, according to Nielsen BookScan, which generally tracks about 70 percent of sales. 
 Many authors and agents say that because the contracts for older books do not explicitly spell out electronic rights, they reside with the author. Big publishing houses argue that clauses like ''in book form'' or phrases that prohibit ''competitive editions'' preclude authors from publishing e-books through other parties. 
 Adam Rothberg, a spokesman for Simon & Schuster, declined to comment directly on Mr. Covey's moves, but said, ''Our position is that electronic editions of our backlist titles belong in the Simon & Schuster catalog, and we intend to protect our interests in those publications.''
 Other publishers have moved to stake their claim on e-book rights for older titles. On Friday, Random House sent a letter to dozens of literary agents stating that on all backlist books, it retained ''the exclusive right to publish in electronic book publishing formats.''
 Sean Covey said the decision to publish the e-book editions of the two older titles through RosettaBooks and Amazon was not a result of dissatisfaction with Simon & Schuster. He noted that both he and his father had continued to publish books through Simon & Schuster and would do so in the future.
 But the younger Mr. Covey noted that Franklin Covey was also experimenting with self-publishing new books, another way of cutting out the traditional print publisher. In August, the company published ''Predictable Results in Unpredictable Times'' by Stephen R. Covey, Bob Whitman and Breck England. It released an e-book edition through RosettaBooks and exclusively for the Kindle. 
 Sean Covey said that his father was co-author of another book, ''Great Work, Great Career'' that Franklin Covey was self-publishing. Amazon is taking pre-orders for it. That book will also be released in an exclusive Kindle e-book edition.
 The skirmish over e-books is part of a larger multidimensional chess match being played among publishers, authors, agents and book retailers. The big publishing houses hate the uniform e-book price of $9.99 that Amazon and others have set for newer titles. Although the retailers are subsidizing that price, executives say they believe that such pricing harms the market for more expensive hardcovers, and some publishers have reacted by announcing they will delay the publication of certain e-books by several months after they are made available in hardcover. 
 Last week, Simon & Schuster said it would delay by four months the e-book versions of 35 titles being published in hardcover from January to April. Both the Hachette Book Group and HarperCollins Publishers Worldwide have also indicated they will delay e-book editions.
 Reacting to that move, Drew Herdener, an Amazon spokesman, directly criticized Simon & Schuster and its chief executive, Carolyn Reidy. 
 ''Simon & Schuster is backward-leaning,'' Mr. Herdener said. ''Carolyn wants to corral readers, force them to buy what they wouldn't buy if they had a choice. It won't work. The better approach is to embrace the evolution of the book and give customers what they want. Forward-leaning publishers are going to clean up.''
 Mr. Rothberg, the Simon & Schuster spokesman, said that his company wasn't trying to upset anyone. ''The notion that we have done anything other than wholeheartedly embrace the digital revolution, whether it be for e-books, new formats, reaching out to our readers wherever they may be, and every other opportunity provided in the new digital era, is patently absurd,'' he said.
 He added, however, ''We understand that there's a lot at stake and we look forward to further discussions with Amazon about how to grow this business without making our discussions of a personal nature.'' 
 Mike Shatzkin, the chief executive of Idea Logical, which advises publishers on digital strategy, said that publishers were trying to minimize Amazon's outsize influence in the book business and preserve their own. ''Publishers are trying to herd Amazon back into their corner and keep it there,'' he said. ''But I think that this is going to be a very difficult situation for the big publishers to control.''

HEADLINE: How the Poll Was Conducted

 BODY:
The latest New York Times/CBS News Poll is based on telephone interviews conducted Dec. 5 through Dec. 10 with 1,650 adults throughout the United States. These included 1,031 representing all adults and an over-sample of 619 who said they were currently unemployed. 
 The sample of land-line telephone exchanges called was randomly selected by a computer from a complete list of more than 69,000 active residential exchanges across the country. The exchanges were chosen so as to ensure that each region of the country was represented in proportion to its population.
 Within each exchange, random digits were added to form a complete telephone number, thus permitting access to listed and unlisted numbers alike. Within each household, one adult was designated by a random procedure to be the respondent for the survey. 
 To increase coverage, this land-line sample was supplemented by respondents reached through random dialing of cellphone numbers. The two samples were then combined.
 Interviewers tried several times to reach every phone number in the survey, calling back unanswered numbers on different days at different times in the day and evening.
 For purposes of analysis, currently unemployed people were over-sampled in this poll. Households containing the unemployed were identified in two ways: respondents to 12 polls by The Times and CBS News in the past year were asked about unemployment in their household; and in November, thousands of additional random phone numbers were screened for unemployment in the household. 
 Interviews with qualifying adults were made in the December survey and yielded a total of 708 currently unemployed respondents. They were weighted to their proper proportion of the population, as determined by the official unemployment rate for November. They were also weighted by reported length of unemployment to approximate the official findings provided by the Bureau of Labor Statistics regarding shorter term versus longer term unemployment.
 The combined results have been weighted to adjust for variation in the sample relating to geographic region, sex, race, Hispanic origin, marital status, age, education and number of adults in the household. In addition, the land-line respondents were weighted to take account of the number of telephone lines into the residence, while the cellphone respondents were weighted according to whether they were reachable only by cellphone or also by land line.
 In theory, in 19 cases out of 20, overall results based on such samples will differ by no more than three percentage points in either direction from what would have been obtained by seeking to interview all American adults. For smaller subgroups, the margin of sampling error is larger. For example, for the 708 unemployed respondents, the sampling error was plus or minus four percentage points. Shifts in results between polls over time also have a larger sampling error. 
 In addition to sampling error, the practical difficulties of conducting any survey of public opinion may introduce other sources of error into the poll. Variation in the wording and order of questions, for example, may lead to somewhat different results. In particular, the questions used by this poll and by the Bureau of Labor Statistics to measure unemployment were similar but not identical.

HEADLINE: In Washington, a Different Kind of Bubble

BYLINE: By NICOLAI OUROUSSOFF

 BODY:
I've never stepped onto the National Mall without feeling a mix of emotions -- reverence, a flash of national solidarity, a feeling of loss -- but pure delight has never been one of them.
 That may soon change. For the last several months the newly appointed director of the Hirshhorn Museum and Sculpture Garden, Richard Koshalek, has been quietly at work on a plan to erect a 145-foot-tall inflatable meeting hall that would swell out of the top of the internal courtyard of the museum, which sits on the Mall midway between the White House and the Capitol. 
 Designed by the New York firm Diller Scofidio & Renfro, the translucent fabric structure, which would be installed twice a year, for May and October, and be packed away in storage the rest of the time, would transform one of the most somber buildings on the mall into a luminous pop landmark. It could be the most uplifting work of civic architecture built in the capital since I. M. Pei completed his East Building of the National Gallery of Art more than 30 years ago. 
 But it is what the project is intended to house, and to represent, that has the potential to shake up Washington. For decades government power brokers have dismissed much of contemporary culture as a playground for elites. Mr. Koshalek's vision would challenge that mentality by using performing arts, film series and conferences to foster a wide-ranging public debate on cultural values.
 Mr. Koshalek, who is known for his bubbly enthusiasm, has been a champion of architectural causes since his days as the director of the Museum of Contemporary Art, Los Angeles, in the late 1990s, when he helped lead the drive to build the Walt Disney Concert Hall. Later he worked behind the scenes with the city's government agencies and cultural institutions to hire respected architects for their new buildings rather than the kind of politically connected firms that were then the norm.
 He arrived at the Hirshhorn last April with a dual agenda: to raise the museum's national profile and to put Washington in closer touch with creative life around it. Within weeks he was promoting his vision to legislators, museum directors and foreign cultural attaches.
 Yet the museum he took over offered its own set of challenges. Completed in 1974, the building was one of the last major projects designed by Gordon Bunshaft, a pillar of American postwar Modernism. Its gray, drum-shaped exterior, propped up on four massive concrete legs, has a bunker-like appearance that seems to keep the city at a distance. The cylindrical courtyard, which is slightly off center in an obvious attempt to offset its formal purity, has the eerie stillness of a set from an Antonioni film.
 And since the Hirshhorn is part of the Smithsonian Institution and stands on such sacred ground, any permanent addition would require the approval of the notoriously conservative Fine Arts Commission and the National Capital Planning Commission, a process that could take years.
 The beauty of a temporary structure, Mr. Koshalek realized, is that he would only need to consult with the members of his own board. The budget would be around $5 million, a relatively paltry sum by the standards of recent museum expansions, even in today's rough economic climate. And the design's extreme flexibility -- it can be blown up at a moment's notice, and the interior can be easily reconfigured -- could allow the museum to respond nimbly to cultural issues of the moment. (Worst case, if it turned out that people hated it, it could be packed away forever.) 
 The architects imagine the installation process as a performance piece in itself, something like watching event organizers blow up the balloons for the Macy's Thanksgiving Day Parade. Two refrigerator-size air pumps would be used to inflate the baby-blue structure, which would fill the entire four-story courtyard and bulge out of the top. A smaller, globulelike form would swell out of the bottom of the building to create a public lounge overlooking the mall.
 The aura of lightness -- of a building that seems ready to float off into the sky -- is counteracted by the structural systems that hold the addition in place. A gigantic tube of water, like an inner tube, encircles the interior of the structure to weigh it down. A series of big steel cables, tethered to the inner tube at one end and to a roof-level truss at the other, would wrap several times around the translucent form as it rises through the core of the building, making it resemble an uneven stack of donuts or an act of ritual bondage. 
 Most visitors would enter the structure through a short, tube-shaped corridor located at the seam between the lounge and the main courtyard space. In the current version of the design, which is still being refined, the lounge's translucent blue skin becomes progressively more transparent at the base, so that visitors will be able to see out into the mall. The inner tube that would anchor this room's outer edge serves as an informal bench. 
 The main hall, by contrast, would be slightly more formal. A temporary stage would be built over the courtyard's off-center fountain, with up to 1,000 seats arranged in a semicircle around it. Further up, a few transparent areas in the fabric would allow visitors occasional views of people up in the galleries. (Given the height of the interior, the architects might consider adding one or two levels of balcony space, which would add richness to the design and take advantage of what is now a four-story-tall void.) 
 Will Mr. Koshalek's vision succeed? It's too soon to say. The project could become something Washington has never had: a real democratic forum for the debate of cultural issues as varied as, say, Hollywood morals and the impact of fundamentalism on the arts. It could also, of course, become a political punching bag.
 The structure itself, if it is ever built, will be part of a long tradition of architects seeking to tap into the energy and accessibility of popular culture. It includes projects like Archigram's 1969 Instant City, which was partly inspired by the cheap, ethereal structures of postwar Los Angeles, and Peter Cook's 1968 Ideas Circus, an informal think tank enclosed underneath a big dome that could be packed up in trucks and moved from city to city.
 Like those earlier models, the Hirshhorn project is informal, egalitarian and free of conventional hierarchies. It aims to provide an elastic framework for a more inclusive culture, one that is in a continual process of reinvention.
 At a time when Washington is focused on practical issues of survival, from health care to the war in Afghanistan, it would also provide a sanctuary for speculating on the nature of the civilization we are building.

HEADLINE: Drugs, Reconsidered

 BODY:
To the Editor:
 Re ''Addiction on 2 Fronts: Work and Home'' (Scientist at Work, Dec. 8): A. Thomas McLellan, the new deputy drug czar, won't be able to shift the government's focus to effective strategies like treatment and prevention until we stop wasting so many of our limited resources on arresting people for drug offenses. 
 Currently, there is a drug arrest every 18 seconds in this country. 
 As a former Seattle police chief who has seen the ravages of both drug abuse and drug policies, I hope federal officials will think about how many more resources we could pour into treatment if we regulated drugs and stopped putting handcuffs on people for what Dr. McLellan readily acknowledges is a medical issue. 
 Norm Stamper 
 Eastsound, Wash. 
 To the Editor:
 As federal and state governments cut spending for treatment, substance-abuse facilities are forced to cannibalize one another to remain economically viable. And with layoffs during the holiday season, there are fewer treatment providers. 
 Government needs to regulate health insurance companies and benefits so scarce resources can be allocated in the most advantageous manner. We need more sober houses, higher salaries to retain high-quality heath professionals, vocational training and intensive case management services, among other things. 
 Dr. McLellan, you provide the funds; we will do the rest.

HEADLINE: Paramount to Start Online Service to Sell Movie Clips

BYLINE: By BROOKS BARNES

DATELINE: LOS ANGELES 

 BODY:
Paramount Pictures, looking for new ways to turn its old movies into cash, especially as DVD sales continue to decline, is creating an online video clip service that will allow users to search hundreds of feature films on a frame-by-frame basis.
 Feeling ''the need for speed,'' as Tom Cruise put it in ''Top Gun''? Log on to ParamountClips.com, search for the exact video snippet you want and press the checkout button. Within minutes -- with the price depending on the type of licensing use you have in mind -- Paramount will electronically deliver the selection in the format and resolution desired. Most scenes are available in multiple languages. 
 The site, to be introduced on Tuesday, is powered by VideoSense, an automated indexing tool developed by the technology company Digitalsmiths. Using proprietary video interpretation systems, Digitalsmiths allows films to be quickly searched by specific actor, line of dialogue, location, genre or product, among other criteria.
 Paramount will initially restrict use to business customers -- advertising agencies, mobile carriers, foreign broadcasters -- that want to license pieces of films for commercial use. The plan is to ultimately open the site to consumers. People wanting to embed a specific scene from ''The Godfather'' on their blog could go to ParamountClips.com and buy it.
 The service reflects a renewed effort in Hollywood to create fresh content from existing libraries, much as ring tones became a blockbuster offering for the music industry. Movie and television studios, suffering from a steep drop in DVD sales, are hopeful that serving up clips can become a business in itself while also stoking demand for the films in their entirety.
 Although clips from films like ''The Godfather'' are already available free on YouTube, analysts said the new service was a chance worth taking.
 ''This Digitalsmiths technology is very impressive because it gives the ability to slice and dice and remodify content in a safe, automated way,'' said Bobby Tulsiani, a senior analyst at Forrester Research.
 ''It remains to be seen if it opens up a new business opportunity, but we didn't think people were going to pay for ring tones, either,'' he added. 
 Paramount's new service will initially allow users to search 80 films, including ''The Godfather,'' ''Forrest Gump,'' ''Grease'' and ''The Addams Family.'' More than 200 films will follow, with the ultimate goal being about 1,000 movies, or about a third of the studio's total library, according to Geremie Camara, vice president of product development for Paramount Digital Entertainment.
 Ben Weinberger, chief executive of Digitalsmiths, which is based in North Carolina, would not discuss pricing or say how much it cost to index movies; Mr. Camara also refused to provide financial information. Generally speaking, however, clip pricing ranges from technically free (a foreign network buys a movie and as part of the deal gets usage of a certain number of clips for promotion) to hundreds of thousands of dollars for a clip used in a national advertising campaign. The bigger the movie, the more expensive the clip: ''The Godfather'' is almost certainly going to cost you more than ''The Spiderwick Chronicles,'' although it depends on the usage.
 As for individual use, no pricing has been set but it will most likely follow the ring-tone model: Licensing a snippet of a song for a commercial is expensive, but a ring tone of the same snippet for personal use costs 99 cents.

HEADLINE: CHINA AND U.S. HIT STRIDENT IMPASSE AT CLIMATE TALKS

BYLINE: By JOHN M. BRODER and JAMES KANTER; Andrew C. Revkin and Elisabeth Rosenthal contributed reporting from Copenhagen, and Neil MacFarquhar from the United Nations.

DATELINE: COPENHAGEN 

 BODY:
China and the United States were at an impasse on Monday at the United Nationsclimate change conference here over how compliance with any treaty could be monitored and verified.
 China, which last month for the first time publicly announced a target for reducing the rate of growth of its greenhouse gas emissions, is refusing to accept any kind of international monitoring of its emissions levels, according to negotiators and observers here. The United States is insisting that without stringent verification of China's actions, it cannot support any deal.
 The stalemate came on a day of public and private brinkmanship as the talks moved into their second and final week. Earlier Monday, a group of poor nations staged a brief walkout from the bargaining table, and a chaotic registration system left thousands of attendees freezing outside the conference hall and forced the temporary closing of the subway stop near the Bella Center, where the meetings are being held.
 The slow progress of the climate negotiations could pose problems later in the week, when the heads of government begin arriving. It is not customary for so many technical, financial and emotional issues to be unsettled when national leaders sit down to negotiate an agreement. President Obama and other world leaders have said that they hope to reach some interim agreement at the Copenhagen talks, but that a binding global accord is not likely to be completed until next year. 
 Negotiators for the United States and China have been trading public accusations in recent days and making little progress in negotiations on the critical issue of treaty compliance. 
 Chinese negotiators have said little during formal negotiation sessions here, where they have been working in partnership with the developing countries. They have made clear that they do not expect money from the industrial powers to help make the shift to a more energy-efficient economy.
 But they will not accept any outside monitors to ensure that they are indeed making the changes that they have promised to reduce the amount of carbon dioxide and other pollutants emitted per unit of economic output.
 ''I think there's no doubt that China, when it says 40 to 45 percent reduction in energy intensity, is serious about that,'' said Ed Miliband, the British secretary of state for energy and climate change. ''The more challenging hurdle is finding a formula for ensuring the outside world that an avoided ton of gas is in fact a ton.''
 He Yafei, the Chinese vice foreign minister, said China's laws would guarantee compliance.
 ''This is a matter of principle,'' even if it scuttles the talks, he said in an interview with The Financial Times.
 American officials said that despite nearly a year of negotiations with the Chinese, there were still fundamental problems that may not be fixed here before the meetings end. The United States says it believes that the Chinese emissions target is too low -- a top American official called it ''disappointing'' the day it was announced. Without a stronger emissions commitment and an agreement to international monitoring by China, Congress is unlikely to approve a tough new domestic climate regime for the United States.
 ''If China or any other country wants to be a full partner in global climate efforts, that country must commit to transparency and review of their emissions-cutting regime,'' said Representative Edward J. Markey, Democrat of Massachusetts and a co-sponsor of the climate and energy bill that passed the House in June. ''Without that commitment, other governments and industries, including those in America, will be hesitant to engage with those countries when they try to partner on global warming.''
 And the Chinese refusal to accept verification measures could also lead to calls for punitive tariffs on Chinese goods coming into the United States. The House bill allows for the imposition of tariffs on goods from countries that do not constrain their carbon output. A group of 10 Democratic senators wrote to Mr. Obama two weeks ago warning that the Senate would not ratify any treaty that did not protect American industry from foreign competitors who do not have to meet global warming emissions limits.
 That threat could, paradoxically, help drive the Chinese to cement a deal here, an American official said. ''Their No. 1 motivation is to avoid border tariffs,'' the official said.
 Barbara Finamore director of the China program for the Natural Resources Defense Council, said the top Chinese leadership was pursuing a cautious and calculated strategy as the talks near a decisive phase this week.
 ''They're going to wait until the last hour of the last day and just as the other side is walking out they'll say, 'Hey, come back.' Just as they do every day in every market in China,'' Ms. Finamore said. ''That's why they're the best negotiators in the world.''
 As the dispute between China and the United States was playing out in private, a group of poor nations threw the talks off track for a time with a public protest. They complained that the industrial countries were doing too little to curb their own climate-altering emissions and consigning them to perpetual poverty. 
 Representatives of several African officials demanded that the rich countries sign a binding treaty that included a large transfer of wealth to the developing world. They brought the public sessions of the meeting to a halt at midday, but delegates began returning to the large conference hall as evening fell, and the talks resumed in desultory fashion.
 John Hay, a spokesman for the United Nations body sponsoring the conference, said: ''The plenary was suspended. A slew of technical meetings have not taken place. It's an indication of how adamant the G-77 are about these issues,'' he said, referring to the group of less-developed nations. 
 In New York on Monday, Ban Ki-moon, the United Nations secretary general, warned the negotiators in Copenhagen that leaving too much for the heads of state and government to hammer out at the end of the week risked enfeebling any final deal. 
 ''There is no time left for posturing or blaming,'' he said at a news conference, before leaving for the Danish capital. ''If everything is left to leaders to resolve at the last minute, we risk having a weak deal or no deal at all, and this will be a failure of potentially catastrophic consequences.''
 Todd Stern, the chief American negotiator, acknowledged that Monday had been a difficult day but said that progress continued to be made.
 ''In any big and complicated negotiation, and this may be the biggest and most complicated ever, it never goes smoothly,'' he said. ''It never goes as planned. There's always bumps. There's always zigs and zags, people getting up and down, and that's to be expected.''

HEADLINE: Four Sides To Every Story

BYLINE: By STEWART BRAND. 
Stewart Brand is the author of ''Whole Earth Discipline: An Ecopragmatist Manifesto.''

DATELINE: San Francisco 

 BODY:
 CLIMATE talks have been going on in Copenhagen for a week now, and it appears to be a two-sided debate between alarmists and skeptics. But there are actually four different views of global warming. A taxonomy of the four: 
 DENIALISTS They are loud, sure and political. Their view is that climatologists and their fellow travelers are engaged in a vast conspiracy to panic the public into following an agenda that is political and pernicious. Senator James Inhofe of Oklahoma and the columnist George Will wave the banner for the hoax-callers. 
 ''The claim that global warming is caused by manmade emissions is simply untrue and not based on sound science,'' Mr. Inhofe declared in a 2003 speech to the Senate about the Kyoto accord that remains emblematic of his position. ''CO2 does not cause catastrophic disasters -- actually it would be beneficial to our environment and our economy .... The motives for Kyoto are economic, not environmental -- that is, proponents favor handicapping the American economy through carbon taxes and more regulations.''
 SKEPTICS This group is most interested in the limitations of climate science so far: they like to examine in detail the contradictions and shortcomings in climate data and models, and they are wary about any ''consensus'' in science. To the skeptics' discomfort, their arguments are frequently quoted by the denialists.
 In this mode, Roger Pielke, a climate scientist at the University of Colorado, argues that the scenarios presented by the United Nations Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change are overstated and underpredictive. Another prominent skeptic is the physicist Freeman Dyson, who wrote in 2007: ''I am opposing the holy brotherhood of climate model experts and the crowd of deluded citizens who believe the numbers predicted by the computer models .... I have studied the climate models and I know what they can do. The models solve the equations of fluid dynamics, and they do a very good job of describing the fluid motions of the atmosphere and the oceans. They do a very poor job of describing the clouds, the dust, the chemistry and the biology of fields and farms and forests.'' 
 WARNERS These are the climatologists who see the trends in climate headed toward planetary disaster, and they blame human production of greenhouse gases as the primary culprit. Leaders in this category are the scientists James Hansen, Stephen Schneider and James Lovelock. (This is the group that most persuades me and whose views I promote.)
 ''If humanity wishes to preserve a planet similar to that on which civilization developed and to which life on earth is adapted,'' Mr. Hansen wrote as the lead author of an influential 2008 paper, then the concentration of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere would have to be reduced from 395 parts per million to ''at most 350 p.p.m.'' 
 CALAMATISTS There are many environmentalists who believe that industrial civilization has committed crimes against nature, and retribution is coming. They quote the warners in apocalyptic terms, and they view denialists as deeply evil. The technology critic Jeremy Rifkin speaks in this manner, and the writer-turned-activist Bill McKibben is a (fairly gentle) leader in this category.
 In his 2006 introduction for ''The End of Nature,'' his famed 1989 book, Mr. McKibben wrote of climate change in religious terms: ''We are no longer able to think of ourselves as a species tossed about by larger forces -- now we are those larger forces. Hurricanes and thunderstorms and tornadoes become not acts of God but acts of man. That was what I meant by the 'end of nature.''' 
 The calamatists and denialists are primarily political figures, with firm ideological loyalties, whereas the warners and skeptics are primarily scientists, guided by ever-changing evidence. That distinction between ideology and science not only helps clarify the strengths and weaknesses of the four stances, it can also be used to predict how they might respond to future climate developments. 
 If climate change were to suddenly reverse itself (because of some yet undiscovered mechanism of balance in our climate system), my guess is that the denialists would be triumphant, the skeptics would be skeptical this time of the apparent good news, the warners would be relieved, and the calamatists would seek out some other doom to proclaim.
 If climate change keeps getting worse then I would expect denialists to grasp at stranger straws, many skeptics to become warners, the warners to start pushing geoengineering schemes like sulfur dust in the stratosphere, and the calamatists to push liberal political agendas -- just as the denialists said they would.

HEADLINE: For Many, Uncertainty, Fear and Shame Often Follow Pink Slips: 'Slow the Bleeding' By Lowering Sights

BYLINE: By MICHAEL LUO

 BODY:
Lee Daves, 54, is coming to the end of his unemployment benefits and is not sure what he will do next. 
 ''I'm going to find something soon,'' he said. ''I have to. It may not be what I want. If I have to wash dishes, that's what I'll do. Hopefully I can do better than that.''
 Mr. Daves, of Springfield, Mo., was laid off in January from a small glass company where he operated a machine that created bevels on mirrors. He lived fairly frugally, owning a mobile home and paying rent only for the lot. 
 But his unemployment benefits still failed to cover his expenses. He was forced to liquidate a meager 401(k) retirement account and believes he has enough savings to last a few more months. 
 His old job paid $13 an hour. He has lowered his sights to anything that pays around $9 an hour, which would almost equal his unemployment benefits. But once he exhausts his benefits, he said, he will have to resort to finding something that pays the minimum wage.
 ''I have a lot of confidence that I can find something that will at least slow the bleeding,'' he said. 
 He has had trouble sleeping because of the stress, saying he is ''generally in a depressed state.'' He gets some health care through the Department of Veterans Affairs, but he has had to neglect things like dental work and figures he will probably need to have some teeth removed when -- make that if -- he gets a job with benefits again.

HEADLINE: Poll Reveals Depth and Trauma of Joblessness in U.S.

BYLINE: By MICHAEL LUO and MEGAN THEE-BRENAN; Marina Stefan and Dalia Sussman contributed reporting.

 BODY:
More than half of the nation's unemployed workers have borrowed money from friends or relatives since losing their jobs. An equal number have cut back on doctor visits or medical treatments because they are out of work.
 Almost half have suffered from depression or anxiety. About 4 in 10 parents have noticed behavioral changes in their children that they attribute to their difficulties in finding work.
 Joblessness has wreaked financial and emotional havoc on the lives of many of those out of work, according to a New York Times/CBS News poll of unemployed adults, causing major life changes, mental health issues and trouble maintaining even basic necessities. 
 The results of the poll, which surveyed 708 unemployed adults from Dec. 5 to Dec. 10 and has a margin of sampling error of plus or minus four percentage points, help to lay bare the depth of the trauma experienced by millions across the country who are out of work as the jobless rate hovers at 10 percent and, in particular, as the ranks of the long-term unemployed soar. 
 Roughly half of the respondents described the recession as a hardship that had caused fundamental changes in their lives. Generally, those who have been out of work longer reported experiencing more acute financial and emotional effects.
 ''I lost my job in March, and from there on, everything went downhill,'' said Vicky Newton, 38, of Mount Pleasant, Mich., a single mother who had been a customer-service representative in an insurance agency. 
 ''After struggling and struggling and not being able to pay my house payments or my other bills, I finally sucked up my pride,'' she said in an interview after the poll was conducted. ''I got food stamps just to help feed my daughter.''
 Over the summer, she abandoned her home in Flint, Mich., after she started receiving foreclosure notices. She now lives 90 minutes away, in a rental house owned by her father.
 With unemployment driving foreclosures nationwide, a quarter of those polled said they had either lost their home or been threatened with foreclosure or eviction for not paying their mortgage or rent. About a quarter, like Ms. Newton, have received food stamps. More than half said they had cut back on both luxuries and necessities in their spending. Seven in 10 rated their family's financial situation as fairly bad or very bad.
 But the impact on their lives was not limited to the difficulty in paying bills. Almost half said unemployment had led to more conflicts or arguments with family members and friends; 55 percent have suffered from insomnia. 
 ''Everything gets touched,'' said Colleen Klemm, 51, of North Lake, Wis., who lost her job as a manager at a landscaping company last November. ''All your relationships are touched by it. You're never your normal happy-go-lucky person. Your countenance, your self-esteem goes. You think, 'I'm not employable.' ''
 A quarter of those who experienced anxiety or depression said they had gone to see a mental health professional. Women were significantly more likely than men to acknowledge emotional issues.
 Tammy Linville, 29, of Louisville, Ky., said she lost her job as a clerical worker for the Census Bureau a year and a half ago. She began seeing a therapist for depression every week through Medicaid but recently has not been able to go because her car broke down and she cannot afford to fix it. 
 Her partner works at the Ford plant in the area, but his schedule has been sporadic. They have two small children and at this point, she said, they are ''saving quarters for diapers.''
 ''Every time I think about money, I shut down because there is none,'' Ms. Linville said. ''I get major panic attacks. I just don't know what we're going to do.''
 Nearly half of the adults surveyed admitted to feeling embarrassed or ashamed most of the time or sometimes as a result of being out of work. Perhaps unsurprisingly, given the traditional image of men as breadwinners, men were significantly more likely than women to report feeling ashamed most of the time. 
 There was a pervasive sense from the poll that the American dream had been upended for many. Nearly half of those polled said they felt in danger of falling out of their social class, with those out of work six months or more feeling especially vulnerable. Working-class respondents felt at risk in the greatest numbers.
 Nearly half of respondents said they did not have health insurance, with the vast majority citing job loss as a reason, a notable finding given the tug of war in Congress over a health care overhaul. The poll offered a glimpse of the potential ripple effect of having no coverage. More than half characterized the cost of basic medical care as a hardship.
 Many in the ranks of the unemployed appear to be rethinking their career and life choices. Just over 40 percent said they had moved or considered moving to another part of the state or country where there were more jobs. More than two-thirds of respondents had considered changing their career or field, and 44 percent of those surveyed had pursued job retraining or other educational opportunities. 
 Joe Whitlow, 31, of Nashville, worked as a mechanic until a repair shop he was running with a friend finally petered out in August. He had contemplated going back to school before, but the potential loss in income always deterred him. Now he is enrolled at a local community college, planning to study accounting.
 ''When everything went bad, not that I didn't have a choice, but it made the choice easier,'' Mr. Whitlow said. 
 The poll also shed light on the formal and informal safety nets that the jobless have relied upon. More than half said they were receiving or had received unemployment benefits. But 61 percent of those receiving benefits said the amount was not enough to cover basic necessities.
 Meanwhile, a fifth said they had received food from a nonprofit organization or religious institution. Among those with a working spouse, half said their spouse had taken on additional hours or another job to help make ends meet.
 Even those who have stayed employed have not escaped the recession's bite. According to a New York Times/CBS News nationwide poll conducted at the same time as the poll of unemployed adults, about 3 in 10 people said that in the past year, as a result of bad economic conditions, their pay had been cut.
 In terms of casting blame for the high unemployment rate, 26 percent of unemployed adults cited former President George W. Bush; 12 percent pointed the finger at banks; 8 percent highlighted jobs going overseas and the same number blamed politicians. Only 3 percent blamed President Obama.
 Those out of work were split, however, on the president's handling of job creation, with 47 percent expressing approval and 44 percent disapproval.
 Unemployed Americans are divided over what the future holds for the job market: 39 percent anticipate improvement, 36 percent expect it will stay the same, and 22 percent say it will get worse.

HEADLINE: U.S.O.C. Reduces List for Chief Executive's Job to Six

BYLINE: By KATIE THOMAS

 BODY:
The next leader of the United States Olympic Committee will probably be selected from among six candidates who include the former chief executive of the San Diego Padres, the chief executive of USA Swimming, and a Colorado Springs lawyer who served as the temporary head of the organization from 2000 to 2001, according to people familiar with the selection process.
 The list of finalists, first reported by The Chicago Tribune, is said to include Sandy Alderson, a former Major League Baseball executive vice president who until March served as the chief executive of the Padres; Chuck Wielgus, the head of USA Swimming; and Scott Blackmun, who was the acting chief executive of the U.S.O.C. for a year. 
 Norman Bellingham, the chief operating officer of the Olympic committee; and Mark Lewis, the president of Jet Set Sports, the travel agency with the exclusive right to sell Olympic tickets in the United States, are also reported to be on the list. Wielgus and Lewis declined comment, and the others did not return calls or e-mail messages. The Tribune report also cited an unnamed sixth candidate.
 The selection committee is scheduled to interview the candidates for the chief executive's job over the next few weeks before submitting names of two or three finalists to the Olympic committee's board of directors, said the people familiar with the selection process, who requested anonymity because the selection process was supposed to be confidential. 
 In a conference call Monday, Larry Probst, the chairman of the U.S.O.C. board, declined to name finalists or say how many there were. He said that the selection committee had narrowed the field from more than 100 and that the board was hoping to make its choice by early January. 
 Nearly all of the likely candidates have some familiarity with the complex and often clubby world of Olympic politics, in contrast with the acting chief executive, Stephanie Streeter, whose only previous Olympic experience was a brief stint on the board of directors.
 In addition to Wielgus and Bellingham, who hold Olympic jobs, Alderson worked on international projects for Major League Baseball. After leaving the U.S.O.C., Blackmun became the chief operating officer of the Anschutz Entertainment Group and advised London on its bid for the 2012 Games. Lewis's resume includes working for NBC on Olympic sponsorships and serving as the marketing director for the Salt Lake Games. 
 The sixth candidate does not have an Olympic background.
 Streeter, a former chief executive of the Banta Corporation, took over from Jim Scherr in March and has announced her plan to leave by the end of the year. She and Probst faced harsh criticism by leaders of the governing bodies of Olympic sports, which sharpened after Chicago failed to win its bid for the 2016 Games. 
 Mike Plant, a member of the board who has sided with Probst's critics, praised him Monday for reaching out to interest groups. ''My hat is off to him because he stepped up and did what he said he was going to do,'' Plant said. 
 In the conference call, Streeter compared the year to a roller-coaster ride. ''Typically, there are the drops and the gut-wrenching and the exhilaration you feel at the end, because your eyes are saucer-wide and you forget the ups,'' she said. 
 The year's successes, she said, include an increase in financing of winter athletes, signing new sponsors despite the recession and breakthroughs in sports like the biathlon and the Nordic combined. 
 ''We feel we had a very productive and successful year,'' Streeter said.

HEADLINE: Warmer Relations With Turkey Kindle Hopes in Syria

BYLINE: By ROBERT F. WORTH

DATELINE: ALEPPO, Syria 

 BODY:
Ever since Syria and Turkey lifted their visa restrictions in September, Turkish visitors have poured into this picturesque northern city. Hawkers in Aleppo's ancient souk now call out to shoppers in Turkish, and cross-border commerce has soared. The two countries have embarked on a very public honeymoon, with their leaders talking about each other like long-lost friends. 
 But this reconciliation is about far more than trade, or the collapse of old Turkish-Arab enmities. At a time of economic and political uncertainty here, the new warmth with Turkey has stirred hopes about Syria's future direction, in areas that include religion, oil and gas, and peace with Israel. 
 For some here, the new closeness with secular, moderate Turkey represents a move away from Syria's controversial alliance with Iran. For others, it suggests an embrace of Turkey's more open, cosmopolitan society. And for many -- including Syria's president, Bashar al-Assad -- it conjures different dreams of a revitalized regional economy, less vulnerable to Western sanctions or pressure. 
 ''It's much more than an economic relationship,'' said Samir al-Taqi, director of the Orient Center for International Studies in Damascus. ''It's about regathering the region, and a feeling that the West is much weaker, less liable to do anything here. I think Syria has lots of ambitions to redefine its geopolitical position.''
 Those ambitions became apparent in October, when Syria delayed signing an economic agreement with the European Union that it had sought for years, hinting that it wanted better terms. The agreement had been initialed in 2004, when Syria felt threatened by the United States invasion of Iraq and desperate for economic and political succor. Now Syria's leaders feel far more confident, analysts say. 
 That confidence has less to do with Syria's still-ailing economy than with its political position. The West's isolation of Syria has given way to engagement, despite Syria's continuing support for the militant groups Hamas and Hezbollah. The United States is expected to send a new ambassador to Damascus soon, ending a long freeze in diplomatic relations. 
 Syria's relationship with Turkey -- which has been slowly warming for years -- helped bring about this political realignment. Turkey mediated indirect talks between Syria and Israel in 2008, fostering renewed hopes in the West for a peace deal. 
 But the widespread notion that Turkey will draw Syria toward moderation and a regional peace deal may be something of a fantasy, albeit a useful one. Turkey's alliance with Israel has cooled noticeably since Israel's war in Gaza a year ago, which provoked outrage in the region and reaffirmed the political value of Syria's ties to Hamas. Israel expressed interest in restarting indirect talks with Syria this month, but many here are skeptical. Syria is keenly aware of the backlash it might face from domestic radicals -- or even from Iran -- if it drew closer to Israel.
 Instead, the new Turkish alliance may be valuable precisely because it helps Syria hint at change while keeping its options open, said Peter Harling, a senior Damascus-based analyst with the International Crisis Group, and lead author of a report on Syria's foreign policy published Monday. 
 ''In a region full of unresolved conflicts, Syria has chosen to hedge its bets,'' Mr. Harling said. ''Aligning with Turkey helps Syria to offset competing pressures from Iran and the West while strengthening its position economically.'' 
 But the relationship is not just about providing Syria with political cover. Mr. Assad, the Syrian president, has made clear that he hopes to foster a regional energy network, building on Turkey's natural gas pipelines. Trade between the countries doubled between 2007 and 2008, and doubled again in 2009, to an estimated $4 billion, according to the Aleppo Chamber of Commerce. 
 ''I think there is a sort of vision developing between Syria and Turkey where they could serve jointly as a regional trade hub, linking Europe with the Gulf and other parts of the East,'' said Nabil Sukkar, a Damascus-based economic analyst. 
 It is too soon to tell how far that vision will go, or whether Syria will start to feel swamped by imports from Turkey's more powerful economy. In the meantime, the political opening has corresponded to a real social and cultural rediscovery, with Turks and Arabs warming to each other after long years of hostility. Syria, after all, was born out of the Ottoman Empire's dismemberment in 1920, and its identity was built in large part on the rejection of its former masters in Istanbul. 
 On a popular level, there was bitter resentment over Turkey's annexation of the Arabic-speaking Hatay district, which had been Syrian. As recently as 1998 the two countries were on the brink of war over Syria's support for Kurdish rebels. Relations improved slowly after Syria expelled Abdullah Ocalan, the rebel leader.
 The thaw has accelerated strikingly in recent months, with Turkish journalists writing glowing accounts of their travels here. Many Syrians say Turkey feels much closer to them culturally than Iran or Saudi Arabia, two important allies of recent decades. Turkish films and television shows are often dubbed into Syrian Arabic and become huge hits here. One film, ''Valley of the Wolves: Iraq,'' portrayed Turkish agents taking revenge on American soldiers for massacres carried out on Arabs in Iraq, in a neat parable of recent policy shifts. 
 For Syrians, the warmth is partly aspirational: many hope that Turkey's gradual shift over the past decade from military autocracy to a more democratic and tolerant political system will be replicated here. For the moment, they must be content with having new friends.
 ''Before, we were afraid to come here,'' said Omer Sonmez, a Turkish businessman who first visited Syria three months ago, and now crosses over regularly to trade roasted pumpkin seeds and other foods. ''We thought it would all be so closed, with no women on the street. But when you talk to Europeans, they say the same thing about Turkey!''
 ''And look,'' Mr. Sonmez added, glancing around at the crowds emerging from Aleppo's covered market. ''We are not so different. Even our faces are similar.''

HEADLINE: Tapping the New Gusher

BYLINE: By JAD MOUAWAD and CLIFFORD KRAUSS

 BODY:
Over the last decade, a handful of the nation's small energy companies pulled off a coup. Right under the noses of the industry's biggest players, they discovered huge amounts of natural gas in fields stretching from Texas to Pennsylvania.
 One of these companies, XTO Energy, grew almost unnoticed into the nation's second-largest gas producer, amassing a substantial portfolio of gas fields, and developing expertise in the complex technology needed to extract the gas from beds of a dark rock called shale. 
 Now, the biggest energy companies are paying attention.
 Exxon Mobil, the world's largest publicly traded oil and gas producer, said Monday that it had agreed to buy XTO in an all-stock deal valued at $31 billion, the biggest oil and gas deal in four years. 
 The purchase allows Exxon to expand in shale gas, an area that has seen tremendous growth, and increase its gas resources by 45 trillion cubic feet, roughly equivalent to two years of domestic demand. The transaction is the company's biggest since the $81 billion merger of Exxon and Mobil in 1999.
 The acquisition extends Exxon's bet that fossil fuels will remain a critical part of the nation's energy supply for decades. At the same time, Exxon expects the demand for natural gas, which emits half as much carbon dioxide as coal when burned, will rise as the United States looks to pare its global warming emissions and the world seeks greener sources of energy.
 ''This is not a near-term decision; this is about the next 10, 20, 30 years,'' Rex W. Tillerson, the chairman and chief executive of Exxon, said in a conference call on Monday. ''We think there will be significant demand for natural gas in the future.'' 
 Shale gas drilling poses some environmental concerns in the communities where it occurs. Yet natural gas holds promise to help slow the growth in global carbon dioxide emissions, if power companies shift toward burning more gas and less coal. 
 Exxon said this month, in its long-term outlook on energy demand, that it expected natural gas consumption to grow faster than oil or coal consumption over the next two decades.
 ''These unconventional resources are going to take on an increasing role in our energy needs,'' said Daniel Yergin, the chairman of IHS Cambridge Energy Research Associates, a consulting firm, adding that the interest of large oil companies in shale gas was fairly recent. ''This demonstrates how important natural gas is now, seen as part of the mix for a low-carbon future.''
 After largely ignoring the surge in domestic resources, Washington is starting to pay attention, too, as Congress struggles to come up with an energy and climate bill that will reduce carbon emissions. 
 J. Larry Nichols, the chairman of Devon Energy and of the American Petroleum Institute, said: ''Regardless whether or not Congress passes any legislation regulating carbon, the underlying fact is our nation is going to need a growing amount of electricity, and natural gas is in an excellent position to capture a significant amount of that market.''
 Big companies concentrated their efforts in recent years on international bets, leaving domestic exploration to smaller oil and gas companies with limited financial resources. Even as gas production grew in recent years, many companies went deeply into debt to finance their exploration. 
 Gas prices tumbled when the recession hit, leaving many of the small companies in a weakened financial position. That means more of them could become acquisition targets.
 Gas prices have recovered from their lows in recent months, trading at $5.33 per thousand cubic feet in New York on Monday, after falling as low as $2.50 in September. At their highest levels, in 2004 and in 2008, gas prices rose above $14 per thousand cubic feet.
 Exxon's deal is the latest and most significant signal that large companies are moving to make major investments in American shale fields. Over the last year, BP; Statoil, the Norwegian oil company; and Eni, the Italian oil company have bought several billion dollars of shale gas assets in Pennsylvania, Oklahoma, Texas and Arkansas. 
 What may be emerging, industry analysts say, is a marriage between companies with deep pockets that need to expand their fossil-fuel reserves and companies that have staked out enormous fields but have little financial wherewithal to develop them.
 David Rockecharlie, co-head of the energy investment banking group at the Jefferies Group, who was a lead adviser to XTO in its negotiations with Exxon, estimated that it would take more than $1 trillion to develop domestic shale fields. That is an amount that independent producers cannot finance alone. 
 The purchase could set off a fresh round of mergers and acquisitions in the energy sector, which had been quiet recently. The last major oil and gas deal was the $35 billion takeover of Burlington Resources, another gas company, by ConocoPhillips in 2005, according to data from Thomson Reuters.
 For major oil companies like Exxon, Shell, BP or Chevron, who have found it tough to increase their production and reserves on their own, big acquisitions offer a quick way to expand their operations after amassing mountains of cash in recent years. Industry executives and analysts predicted that potential takeover targets could include Chesapeake Energy, Devon Energy, EnCana and EOG Resources.
 ''This is really a significant event, a paradigm shift for our sector,'' said John H. Pinkerton, chairman and chief executive of Range Resources, a major shale gas developer in Fort Worth, and also a possible takeover target. ''There are obviously other majors looking at these shale plays. It would not surprise me at all to see these shale assets being bought by the major oil companies.''
 Exxon already has substantial gas production in Qatar, Russia and Nigeria. This month, it approved the construction of a $15 billion project in Papua New Guinea to supply gas to Japan and China. The company is also part of a $37 billion deal to deliver Australian gas throughout Asia over the next several decades.
 But the company has lagged in the United States, where XTO produces twice as much natural gas than Exxon does. With the help of some acquisitions of its own, XTO reported a 23 percent jump in gas production in the third quarter, to 2.33 billion cubic feet a day, putting it just behind Chesapeake as the top domestic producer. 
 Founded in 1986, XTO has developed a strong technical knowledge in developing shale gas, which Exxon would like to apply to unconventional gas holdings it has been building up in Poland, Hungary and Argentina, Mr. Tillerson said. Exxon will set up a production unit to manage its global portfolio of unconventional resources that will be based in Fort Worth, in XTO's current offices.
 The term unconventional resources is applied to a broad category of fuels like shale gas, tar sands and other forms of oil and gas that require sophisticated technology to extract and are typically more expensive to develop. Unlike traditional oil and gas supplies, which have been declining, reserves of unconventional resources are growing because of new discoveries. 
 Exxon will assume XTO's $10 billion in debt as part of the deal.

HEADLINE: Spending and Saving

BYLINE: By SHERYL GAY STOLBERG

 BODY:
Pushing back against Republican assertions that President Obama's proposed health care overhaul would drive up medical costs, the White House said Monday that the pending Senate bill would ultimately slow the growth of health care spending by one percentage point a year. 
 ''There's a lot of talk these days about fiscal responsibility,'' Christina D. Romer, the chairwoman of Mr. Obama's Council of Economic Advisers, said in a conference call with reporters. ''I want to tell you that what's going on on the floor of the Senate right now is probably the most important thing we can do for the long-run fiscal health of this country.''
 Ms. Romer made her case just as the Senate was entering a make-or-break week on health care legislation. She said that while spending would inevitably go up in the short term as more uninsured people were covered, both the government and the private sector would save money over the long term if the bill were enacted.
 The council calculated that from 2016 to 2019, if the Senate bill passes, the annual growth rate of federal spending on the programs would be ''at least 0.7 percentage points lower than it otherwise would have been.'' 
 By 2019, total federal spending on Medicare and Medicaid would be lower than it would have been without passage of the Senate health bill, the council predicted. 
 ''We are going to be expanding coverage to 30 million Americans; you can't do that and not spend more,'' Ms. Romer said, adding, ''What we're talking about is what happens over the longer haul, and it's actually not that far into the future.''

HEADLINE: Obama Presses Biggest Banks To Lend More

BYLINE: By HELENE COOPER and ERIC DASH; Helene Cooper reported from Washington, and Eric Dash from New York.

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
President Obama pressured the heads of the nation's biggest banks on Monday to take ''extraordinary'' steps to revive lending for small businesses and homeowners, prompting assurances from some financial institutions that they would do more even as they continued to shed their supplicant status in Washington.
 Meeting with top executives from 12 financial institutions, Mr. Obama sent a clear message that the industry had a responsibility to help nurse the economy back to health and do more to create jobs in return for the huge federal bailout last year that kept Wall Street and the banking system afloat. 
 But Mr. Obama also confronted the limits of his power to jawbone the industry as banking companies continued to repay government money received in the bailout. Citigroup and Wells Fargo, two of the biggest, announced on Monday that they were doing precisely that. 
 If the banks came hat in hand to Washington a year ago to assure their survival, they returned on Monday in a much stronger position to deal with the government. As they scurry to repay the government and escape its influence over their operations, they have been fighting elements of legislation to regulate their industry more tightly. 
 At the same time, the banks are seeking to restore executive pay to high levels and asserting that the government's demand that they hold bigger financial buffers against possible losses makes it hard for them to issue more loans. 
 During the hourlong meeting in the Roosevelt Room of the White House, Mr. Obama prodded the executives to stop fighting the regulation legislation intended to deal with the problems that led to the financial crisis, White House officials said.
 ''I made very clear that I have no intention of letting their lobbyists thwart reforms necessary to protect the American people,'' Mr. Obama said in remarks after the meeting. ''If they wish to fight common sense consumer protections, that's a fight I'm more than willing to have.''
 The heads of three of the biggest companies -- Goldman Sachs, Morgan Stanley and Citigroup -- did not even make it to the White House meeting in person. They had waited until Monday morning to travel on commercial flights to Washington and then were held up by fog. 
 By contrast, James E. Rohr, PNC Financial's chief executive, drove his own car on Sunday evening to Washington from Pittsburgh, stopping at a Wendy's for a sandwich en route. Other chief executives made sure they would arrive on time: Jamie Dimon of JPMorgan Chase flew into Washington on one of the bank's private jets, while Kenneth D. Chenault of American Express took Amtrak.
 Executives at the meeting said that Mr. Obama had told the missing three that he understood that their flight had been canceled. But he directed strong words at the industry afterward.
 ''America's banks received extraordinary assistance from American taxpayers to rebuild their industry,'' Mr. Obama said. ''Now that they're back on their feet, we expect an extraordinary commitment from them to help rebuild our economy.''
 He added, ''Ultimately in this country we rise and fall together; banks and small businesses, consumers and large corporations.''
 In the glare of the presidential spotlight, Bank of America used the occasion to say it would increase lending to small and mid-size businesses by $5 billion next year over what it lent to them in 2009. JPMorgan Chase announced a similar increase in early November and recently experienced an increase in new applications for loans.
 Wells Fargo said in a statement on Monday that it expected to increase lending in 2010 as much as 25 percent, to more than $16 billion, for firms with $20 million or less in annual revenue.
 The banking executives promised Mr. Obama that they would take second looks at loans they had denied over the last year. Richard K. Davis, the chief executive of US Bancorp, told reporters after the meeting that the executives were aware of the public perception that they were profiting with hefty bonuses at taxpayer expense, and that they realized they were ''under a microscope'' and needed to align themselves more closely with the needs of consumers.
 But he cautioned that banks had a responsibility to carefully evaluate the qualifications of each client, lest there be a repeat of the bad lending practices that contributed to the financial crisis to begin with. 
 ''We simply want to assure that we make qualified loans,'' he said.
 White House officials acknowledged that beyond the legislation on Capitol Hill, the administration's leverage to prod the bankers, particularly on lending, was limited. But Robert Gibbs, the White House spokesman, said that Mr. Obama would keep up the public pressure. ''I think that the bully pulpit can be a powerful thing,'' he said.
 In calling the bankers to the White House, Mr. Obama was seeking to capitalize on public anger over the continuation of big bonuses for Wall Street executives, coupled with the slow pace of renewed lending by institutions bailed out by taxpayers. 
 During Monday's meeting, Mr. Obama did not repeat the language he used in an interview on ''60 Minutes'' on CBS Sunday night, in which he termed the bank executives ''fat cats.'' During the meeting, ''he didn't call us any names,'' Mr. Davis said, adding that ''we agree viscerally that more lending needs to be done.''
 But with the unemployment rate at 10 percent, the White House needs to move the conversation from visceral to specific, administration officials said. Mr. Obama pressed the bankers to come up with possible solutions, according to administration officials and industry officials. In contrast to the lecturing tones of a similar meeting last March, several people in attendance Monday described this session as more constructive.
 ''There were no pitchforks, no fat cat bankers,'' said Mr. Rohr of PNC.
 Several of the chief executives, armed with statistics about initiatives to hire new bankers, replied that they were very focused on lending. Some, like Mr. Davis of US Bancorp, raised ideas like giving a second look to previously denied loans. Others proposed cutting the red tape on Small Business Administration loans. 
 Mr. Obama will meet next week with representatives of smaller banks, where he is expected to sound similar tones.

HEADLINE: No Boom in Bookings

BYLINE: By SUSAN STELLIN

 BODY:
For the travel industry, 2009 is a year best forgotten, or as the chairman of Southwest Airlines, Gary C. Kelly, put it in a message to customers, it was ''an annus horribilis.'' 
 And the prospects for 2010? This is typically when the industry issues its forecasts for the year ahead, and those forecasts are often shaded with optimism about better times ahead. But this time, many travel executives and analysts are declining to make rosy predictions. Instead, they are offering a forecast that goes like this: Although some indicators show that travel has stabilized, with tentative signs of improvement in airline bookings and hotel reservations, this trend could falter if fuel prices increase or the fragile economic recovery takes a turn for the worse.
 Because of the weak spots in the economy, Mr. Kelly notably contradicted some of his colleagues' predictions about an increase in business travel at a recent airline investor conference. 
 ''What we stated was we are not planning for a big return of business travel next year,'' said Laura Wright, Southwest's chief financial officer and senior vice president for finance. ''To put that in context: we don't know. We don't have a long-term view of the booking curve.''
 Southwest and other airlines have seen encouraging signs in recent months. Southwest carried nearly 8 percent more revenue passengers in November than in the same month last year, and Virgin America recently reported its first quarterly operating profit, earning $5.1 million in the third quarter. But comparisons with late 2008 can be misleading because of the steep drop in business travel that occurred a year ago as the financial crisis deepened. 
 ''As we all know, the messages are really mixed on the economy, and employment numbers are still bad,'' Ms. Wright said. ''We're assuming business travel is not just going to rebound next year. If it does come on stronger than we expected, we'll be thrilled.''
 That conservative assessment is in line with the most recent figures released by the Air Transport Association, the trade group representing the leading carriers in the United States. In October, passenger revenue at its member carriers fell 15 percent compared with the same month in 2008, the 12th consecutive month of declines, while the number of passengers flying dropped 3 percent.
 Because previous forecasts were revised as the economy floundered and travel fluctuated in response to news headlines, the association has stopped issuing forecasts, choosing instead to report monthly results based on actual performance numbers. Commenting on the mixed outlook for 2010, John P. Heimlich, the trade group's chief economist, wrote via e-mail, ''What we do know is that rarely has such a cloud of uncertainty hung over any new year, and that better than 2009 isn't saying a whole lot.''
 Still, there has been some positive news in recent performance results. Perhaps the most concrete sign of improvement is that airline ticket sales handled by the Airlines Reporting Corporation increased nearly 7 percent in November -- the first monthly increase since September 2008.
 The company tracks transactions handled by roughly 17,000 travel agencies, including online outlets like Expedia, small retailers and travel management companies like American Express. While its figures do not include tickets purchased directly through the airlines, the company estimates it captures more than 50 percent of all air ticket transactions, and a larger percentage of business travel purchases. Besides the encouraging sales figures, the total number of transactions reported through the company in November rose 8 percent. 
 ''We're certainly pretty excited about the November numbers,'' Allan Muten, a company spokesman, said, noting that even though the dollar figures represented just one month of positive news, the number of ticket transactions has shown a slightly longer upward trend.
 ''Transactions had been going into the green for a couple months, but sales had remained in the red,'' he said. ''Now the total sales figure is in the green as well, which is very positive.''
 Yet ticket sales, as well as other statistics, can be seen from multiple angles, leading to different conclusions about the travel industry's health. More people may travel next year but continue to pay lower prices for plane tickets and hotel rooms, stimulating the economy but not necessarily pushing airline balance sheets into the black.
 Brian Pearce, chief economist for the International Air Transport Association, which plans to release its 2010 forecast on Tuesday, said that although passenger numbers were moving in a positive direction, the global airline industry was still ''a long way from seeing normal air travel and revenues.''
 ''It's good for passengers but not so good for airlines trying to restore revenue,'' he said. ''We're expecting airline revenues this year to be $80 billion lower than they were in 2008.''
 Michael Boyd, president of the aviation consulting firm Boyd Group International, said he believed that American carriers were on much better financial footing than their foreign counterparts, but he did not see any economic indicators suggesting either business or leisure travel would rebound next year.
 ''Our data show that air passenger traffic will be down 3.5 to 4 percent nationally,'' he said. ''But if oil prices don't get too frisky, we think the airline industry will do fairly well.''
 The hotel industry, though historically more profitable than the airlines, faces a more daunting problem in attracting business. Scott Berman, hospitality practice leader for PricewaterhouseCoopers, said he expected hotel occupancy levels to edge up to 55.8 percent in 2010, from 55.2 percent for 2009. The industry's historical average is 63 percent.
 Rates are expected to show an 8.8 percent decline in 2009, and to drop an additional 1.8 percent next year, Mr. Berman said. But he said his conversations with hotel executives indicated that reservations had been picking up in the last two months, an encouraging sign but one he did not want to overstate. 
 ''I don't want to paint this as we've done anything but turn a corner,'' Mr. Berman said. ''Anybody who suggests that the industry has come back is not correct.''

HEADLINE: Setbacks Signal New Post-Election Reality for Bloomberg

BYLINE: By MICHAEL BARBARO

 BODY:
When aides to Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg recently sought backing from City Council members for a key development project, they heard something they were not accustomed to: No.
 Normally, Mr. Bloomberg would quickly bring them into line. But on Monday, council members fought him all the way to a humiliating 45-to-1 defeat for one of the mayor's signature proposals, a $310 million shopping center in the Bronx. 
 It was the largest project turned down by the Council since Mr. Bloomberg came to office eight years ago, and perhaps the strongest indication yet of the changed landscape the mayor faces a month after his unexpectedly close re-election. 
 In the past few weeks, Mr. Bloomberg has suffered several setbacks, been forced to modify signature demands and backed down from high-profile fights. 
 Bowing to neighborhood activists and a languid economy, the mayor retreated from a proposal last week to immediately build housing in a park planned for the Brooklyn waterfront, a feature that aides described as crucial to the project's future. 
 To pass a package of environmental rules, the administration dropped an ambitious initiative opposed by real estate interests that would have required landlords to pay to make their buildings more energy efficient.
 Over Mr. Bloomberg's objections, and despite the threat of a veto, the Council overwhelmingly approved laws that would ease parking restrictions. 
 ''If anyone thought there was going to be a third-term honeymoon, the honeymoon has ended before the third term even began,'' said Stuart Appelbaum, president of the retail workers' union, which fought the Bronx retail project.
 So after years of largely unchallenged authority, Bloomberg 3.0 is beginning to look like this: a mayor suddenly grappling with emboldened opposition, limits to his influence, a city teeming with economic frustration and residents who are distrustful, in some ways, of a Manhattan billionaire.
 ''This is a new world now,'' said Councilman Bill de Blasio, the city's public advocate-elect, who built his campaign around the need for a check on Mr. Bloomberg's power. ''He now has to work, as most mayors do, to strike more of a balance and reach a consensus.''
 Aides to the mayor dismissed the idea that Mr. Bloomberg had been chastened, pointing to a series of major policy proposals that he has outlined, and battle lines he has drawn, since winning a third term. 
 He scored a rare victory in Albany with the passage of legislation that would require a new, less expensive pension plan for new city workers. He has vowed to take on the teachers' union by using student test scores in tenure decisions. And he picked a fight with the Manhattan district attorney, Robert M. Morgenthau, by accusing him of hiding taxpayer dollars in secret bank accounts. But even there, he quickly withdrew from the battle after public criticism.
 The aides said the mayor was no less ambitious, nor less firmly wedded to his beliefs today than he was before the election, no matter the size of his victory margin at the polls (for the record, it was 4.6 percent, down from 20 percent in 2005). In several cases, they said, the mayor was yielding to economic realities, not political pressure. 
 The mayor, said Jason Post, a spokesman, ''will continue to make the tough decisions and stand behind key principles, but he has never had a problem with being flexible to help build a better city.'' 
 But aides privately conceded that the city's political atmosphere has changed. 
 Two citywide elected offices, the comptroller's and the public advocate's, will soon be occupied by Bloomberg skeptics. And a union-backed party that angrily opposed the mayor's undoing of term limits won a large number of seats on the Council and is eager to flex its muscle on issues of economic populism and projects like the Bronx shopping center.
 It is no coincidence that lawmakers from the Bronx led the revolt against the retail project: The borough has the city's highest unemployment rate, and voters there rejected Mr. Bloomberg in large numbers in November, favoring his Democratic rival, William C. Thompson Jr.
 The council members argued that the shopping center, to be built in an abandoned armory, would create low-paying retail jobs that would perpetuate poverty. Since the project was to receive government subsidies, they argued that the city should require retailers to pay a ''living wage,'' which is nearly three dollars more than the minimum wage.
 The mayor's office rejected imposing a wage requirement on stores, but in negotiations with lawmakers, aides signaled a readiness to use city money to directly or indirectly increase the workers' pay, according to those involved in the discussions. But the mayor ultimately rejected the plan, wagering that the council members would relent. They did not, and the talks collapsed over the weekend. 
 The administration said it was standing up for basic business principle: private industry should not be handcuffed by ad hoc government mandates.
 ''It's just very disappointing,'' the mayor said, ''and very bad for the Bronx, a borough that really needs the help.''
 The battle was, in many ways, a replay of the mayor's race, with the union-backed Working Families Party, the retail workers' union, and the Bronx borough president, Ruben Diaz Jr., fighting the mayor, and the business community and construction workers' union standing behind Mr. Bloomberg. Even the rhetoric seemed borrowed from the election. Mr. Diaz spoke of ''the people prevailing over corporate America.'' 
 The message seemed to resonate with lawmakers outside of the Bronx, who said their constituents had tired of watching the city's rich get richer while they struggled to cope with higher taxes and fees. 
 ''The fight over the armory is about people who are hurting, saying the developers are going to make money, the city will make money, why not us?'' said Councilman James S. Oddo, a Republican from Staten Island.
 ''Is there any personal pique involved, where people want to score a win against the mayor? Sure, you can't discount that,'' he said. ''But for most of us, we just hear every day how much pain people are in.'' 
 Senior aides to Mr. Bloomberg seemed stunned by the defeat. They privately bemoaned the loss of thousands of new jobs in the middle of a deep recession, over what they viewed as a misguided policy debate. 
 And they fretted over its political meaning. Even the mayor's close allies in the Council, including the speaker, Christine C. Quinn, voted to kill the project. 
 Councilman Peter F. Vallone Jr., who endorsed Mr. Bloomberg for re-election, voted against the shopping center on Monday, saying he felt compelled to support his colleagues from the Bronx. With a hint of regret, he called the fight ''a harbinger of things to come.''

HEADLINE: Obama's Multitasking, and His Decisions

 BODY:
To the Editor:
 Re ''As Obama's Poll Numbers Fall, Criticism of Multitasking Rises'' (The Caucus column, Dec. 7): 
 The problem is not the president's tackling health care, Afghanistan, the economy and climate change at the same time. It's that in each of the first three, the president has made the wrong decision.
 On health care, he abandoned the only true reform -- single-payer -- choosing an expensive pseudo-reform that benefits only the insurance cartel and pharmaceutical industries. On the economy, he sided with Wall Street instead of Main Street. On Afghanistan, he decided on an expansion of a futile war of absurdity instead of a return to sanity.
 His sinking poll numbers are tied to the failure to deliver ''change we can believe in.''

HEADLINE: Waking Up Serious Instead Of Silly

BYLINE: By ALESSANDRA STANLEY

 BODY:
The best way to assess George Stephanopoulos's first day as Diane Sawyer's replacement on ''Good Morning America'' was to watch the competition on NBC. 
 The ''Today'' show, as is its wont, started on Monday with a melodramatic report on missing hikers on Mount Hood and then lingered on Tiger Woods's misfortunes by way of a long, lurid interview with Cori Rist, who claims to be one of his mistresses.
 Mr. Stephanopoulos didn't adjust to the tabloid tone of morning news so much as bring his sober Washington talk show with him to the ABC studio in Times Square. Monday's show led with President Obama's attack on Wall Street bankers, illustrated with a clip from a ''60 Minutes'' interview on CBS from the night before. Mr. Stephanopoulos then chatted with David Axelrod, a senior adviser to Mr. Obama. 
 ''Good Morning America'' did report the latest on Tiger Woods -- the consulting firm Accenture dropped its sponsorship of him -- but interviewed only advertising and media experts, with no detours to mistresses or Vegas blondes. Even the musical guest of the day was high-minded: the cellist Yo-Yo Ma playing ''Dona nobis pacem.'' 
 Mr. Stephanopoulos is a policy-minded, even wonky addition to a morning show that in the past mostly relied on Everyman bathos and Hollywood glitz. His debut marks the start of a busy season of turnover in the ABC News division: Ms. Sawyer, who takes over the evening news from Charles Gibson later this month, bade a tearful goodbye to her morning viewers last week. Mr. Gibson's tenure as the anchor of ''World News'' ends on Friday. 
 ABC News hopes that its anchor shakeup will help close its ratings gap with NBC News, but new faces are not necessarily a guarantee of success: the anointment of Katie Couric as the first solo female network anchor has not budged CBS's evening news out of a distant third place. 
 Despite ever-dwindling audiences, network news programs cling to established formula and cookie-cutter formats. Changes in personnel don't radically alter the program, but personality does have an effect on its content. 
 While it takes time for anchors to adjust to new desks, and first days do not always reflect subsequent performance, it was notable that Mr. Stephanopoulos did not try to morph into Morning George right out of the gate. This anchor -- who went to ABC News after working as a campaign operative and White House adviser to President Bill Clinton, and will continue to host ''This Week With George Stephanopoulos'' until a successor is named -- led with his strong suit. He questioned Mr. Axelrod about the health care bill; the president's plans to badger ''fat cat'' bankers about bonuses; and the economy. Mr. Axelrod presented him with an alarm clock permanently set to 3:30 a.m., a gift from, as he put it, ''your friends in the White House.'' 
 He was welcomed with fanfare by his co-host, Robin Roberts, but it wasn't clear that the two have natural chemistry. Ms. Roberts, who was of a height with Ms. Sawyer, towers over the diminutive Mr. Stephanopoulos; their senses of humor seem equally unaligned. Ms. Roberts is more literal than funny and is given to outsize expressions of feeling. Mr. Stephanopoulos is reserved and permits himself small, sarcastic asides. 
 After noting that surveys suggest that women view Mr. Woods less favorably than men do, the new anchor said dryly, ''Well that's a shocker, huh?''
 Ms. Roberts, using a ''Romper Room'' tone that suggested that she didn't realize he was kidding, replied, ''We're learning something new every day.''
 Mr. Stephanopoulos wasn't the only new face on the ''Good Morning America'' set. Sam Champion stayed on as weatherman, but JuJu Chang took over the news desk from Chris Cuomo, who will be an anchor on ''20/20.'' 
 Mr. Stephanopoulos wasn't spared the more frivolous consumer tips that are the backbone of morning talk shows. He sat, gamely but rigidly, through a lesson on Internet coupon shopping. He chatted with Dr. Mehmet Oz about holiday heart attacks: Dr. Oz reported that booze, fatty food and stressful relatives are a ''hurricane of factors that make this holiday so dangerous.'' 
 Mr. Stephanopoulos will almost certainly have more silly features in his future, but it looks as if he won't entirely shun his political past. On a network morning show, that's a refreshing change.

HEADLINE: New Natural Gas Pipeline From Central Asia Feeds China

BYLINE: By ANDREW E. KRAMER; Edward Wong contributed reporting from Beijing.

DATELINE: MOSCOW 

 BODY:
With the turn of a ceremonial valve, China's president, Hu Jintao, opened a big natural gas pipeline from central Asia to China on Monday, significantly increasing China's access to the fuel and providing the first major alternative to exporting the region's gas through Russia. 
 The ambitious project runs 1,140 miles across three Central Asian nations to the Chinese border, linking Turkmenistan to the Chinese region of Xinjiang. Once inside China, it connects with a pipeline that can carry the fuel even farther east.
 Though helpful to energy-parched China, the project siphons potential supplies from the long-delayed pipeline that the European Union would like to see built from Turkey to Central Europe. Such a project could also tap sources of natural gas in Turkmenistan, a stark illustration of the overlapping energy interests at play in the region.
 For the China pipeline, Turkmenistan says it can supply 40 billion cubic meters of gas for 30 years once the line reaches full capacity, reported China Daily, an official English-language newspaper. That is about the equivalent of half of China's current consumption of natural gas.
 The pipeline is the first major export corridor for natural gas out of the region that does not pass through Russia. It breaks from the Soviet-era design of a pipeline system built to supply Eastern Europe via Russia to the north of Central Asia. The new pipe revives a pre-Soviet view of trade in the region, in which economic exchanges flow east and west, not just through Russia.
 ''The startup of this pipeline reconstructs the ancient Silk Roads and symbolizes friendship and cooperation,'' Kazakhstan's president, Nursultan Nazarbayev, said at the ceremony on Monday, the Interfax news agency reported.
 Mr. Hu was in Turkmenistan to turn the valve, which signaled the start of gas being transported along the pipeline. An inauguration ceremony was also held Saturday in Kazakhstan for that country's part of the project.
 China's accomplishment was all the more notable because Europe and the United States have been jousting with Russia for years to break its natural gas pipeline monopoly.
 Alexander A. Cooley, an authority on Central Asia at Barnard College, said China succeeded because it did not blend energy ventures with support for democratic change in the region, or demands for access to the military bases the United States needs to help wage the war in Afghanistan, as was the case with the Western powers. These other Western policy goals in Central Asia served only to stiffen Russian opposition to European and American oil and gas ventures, which fed into Russia's fear of being encircled by Western interests in the region, he said.
 Russia also acquiesced to the Chinese because the pipeline poses far less of an immediate threat to the business of Gazprom, the Russian gas monopoly, than a westbound pipe would, according to Vitaly Y. Yermakov, research director for Russia and the Caspian for IHS CERA, an energy consulting group.
 Russia's paramount goal is to prevent the West from breaking a monopoly on natural gas pipelines from Asia to Europe, which is the core of Gazprom's business. The eastbound Chinese pipeline, in contrast, does not undercut an existing Russian export market, because Russia sells no pipeline gas to China now.

HEADLINE: Wells Fargo to Repay U.S., a Coda to the Bailout Era

BYLINE: By ERIC DASH and ANDREW MARTIN

 BODY:
When Washington pressed the nation's largest banks to take billions in federal support last autumn, few protested more loudly than Wells Fargo. On Monday, Wells became the last of the big lenders to rush through a repayment before the end of the year, signifying a fitting bookend to the bailout era.
 Hours after Citigroup confirmed it was exiting the federal Troubled Asset Relief Program, Wells said it would return the $25 billion it was given to weather the worst financial storm since the Depression. Wells, the largest consumer bank in the United States, will raise $10.4 billion in a share sale to help replenish its coffers. 
 Wells joins Citigroup, Bank of America and JPMorgan Chase, its largest rivals, in shedding the stigma of taxpayer support and the restrictions on compensation that came with it. At the same time, President Obama was pressing chief executives of large bailed-out banks to step up lending to help an economic recovery. 
 ''The stigma of TARP is becoming such an emotional, testosterone-driven thing that they want to be done with the government,'' said David H. Ellison, a portfolio manager at FBR Funds, which specializes in financial stocks. ''If Bank of America, if Citigroup can do it, then why not me, too?'' 
 Mr. Ellison said banks appeared to be ''rushing in'' to pay back the government, so they can offer bigger bonuses to their executives and get lawmakers off their backs. 
 But the prospect of huge losses on mortgages and commercial real estate loans early next year might also be causing the repayment stampede, he said. 
 ''It may be as much about raising capital as it is paying off TARP,'' he said.
 While bank profits surged this year as the economy recovered and the stock market rebounded, many banks were fearful of what next year might bring and wanted to raise money in the capital markets now. 
 Although the recession has ended, high unemployment means banks like Wells and Citigroup, which aggressively peddled consumer loans, will face looming losses as consumers struggle to make ends meet. The stock market is also likely to level off after a breakneck year, analysts said. 
 Any sudden event on the world stage, like a further weakening in emerging markets or a sovereign default, could restrain the environment for raising capital. 
 Only nine months ago, big institutional investors were so fearful during the credit crisis that they refused to pour money into the banks that badly needed it. Talk of nationalization prevailed. 
 But confidence has come back to the market, in part because the government has shown its willingness to save large banks whose demise would produce systemic risks after the fall of Lehman Brothers. 
 Yet even as banks pay back their bailout money, the government is still extending them billions of dollars in taxpayer support through other programs run by the Federal Reserve and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation. 
 In spite of the recent rush to repay the government, many financial experts say the financial system is sound. At both Citigroup and Wells Fargo, regulators required the banks to swap in private money almost dollar for dollar with the bailout funds.
 ''You are talking about them having about the same amount of capital and less of a government role, which the markets will like,'' said Douglas J. Elliott, a former investment banker and fellow at the Brookings Institution. 
 Even so, other financial experts worry that the government may be making a terrible mistake by allowing the biggest banks to exit too quickly. 
 If the economy takes a turn for the worse, they argue, these same large banks will return to the government for a new round of aid. 
 ''The guarantee is no longer explicit, it's implicit -- just like the implicit guarantee for Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac,'' said Dino Kos, a banking analyst and former Federal Reserve official. ''This is the nature of the 'too big to fail' problem.''
 For the banks' existing stockholders, repayment comes at a high cost. As part of Citigroup's agreement with the government, the bank is planning to raise about $17 billion by selling stock, which will dilute the value of existing shares.
 ''It's terribly negative,'' said Richard Bove, an analyst at Rochdale Securities. ''Management has shown that it is willing to take any action to harm shareholders as long as the executives get paid more money.''
 Mr. Bove said the payback did nothing to improve Citigroup's overall financial health, nor did it remove the bank entirely from government control. Instead, Citigroup's management had ''ruined'' the stock price for the next three or four months, he said.
 On Monday, Citi's stock lost 25 cents and closed at $3.70.
 Citigroup will still operate under a loose set of pay restrictions. By contrast, Wells will now face no pay restrictions since it will have fully repaid its bailout funds. But that may hold less significance, because Wells, a commercial bank, does not have the traders and bankers who demand multimillion-dollar salaries and bonuses. 
 That became a sore point for Wells when Henry M. Paulson Jr., then the Treasury secretary, summoned its chief executive to appear last October with seven others at the Treasury Department. 
 At the meeting, Richard M. Kovacevich, then the Wells Fargo chairman, protested strongly that, unlike its New York rivals, Wells was not in trouble because of investments in exotic mortgages, and did not need a bailout, according to people briefed on the meeting.
 But Wells has since changed its tune as it struggles to digest Wachovia, which it took over at the height of the financial crisis after a heated fight with Citigroup. After that merger, Wells was saddled with a giant portfolio of troubled real estate loans, and it faces a coming wave of losses on its pick-a-pay mortgages and commercial real estate and corporate loans. 
 Under the terms of the deal, Wells will raise $1.35 billion by issuing common stock to Wells benefit plans. The bank will also increase equity by $1.5 billion through asset sales.
 Wells's current chief executive, John G. Stumpf, said the move was a good deal for investors and taxpayers, who walk away from their investment in the bank with a $1.4 billion dividend.

HEADLINE: How Much Will Health Reform Cost?

 BODY:
To the Editor:
 In ''Can We Afford It?'' (editorial, Dec. 13), you remark that Republican critics oppose the currently proposed health care reform on the grounds that the nation cannot afford to add this new trillion-dollar entitlement in tough economic times.
 Here we should recall that in 2003, barely out of the recession of 2000-2, President George W. Bush and his then Republican Congress passed the Medicare Modernization Act of 2003, a huge new entitlement. 
 Unlike serious attempts to make the current health reform deficit-neutral, however, the entire cost of the Medicare drug bill simply has been deficit- financed since the inception of the program in 2006. Current projections are that the legislation will add in excess of $1 trillion to the federal deficit over the period 2010 to 2019. 
 Foreigners have bought many of the new United States Treasury bonds sold to finance this largess. Our children will have to service these bonds and ultimately redeem them.
 There is something quite untoward for people who went along with that glaring fiscal irresponsibility to now belatedly discover the virtue of fiscal probity.
 Uwe E. Reinhardt Princeton, N.J., Dec. 13, 2009
 The writer is a professor of political economy at Princeton University.
 To the Editor:
 As a dermatologist in practice for 30 years, I read ''Can We Afford It?'' with interest. You state that the House and the Senate have a lot of ideas that could bring down costs over time. To the contrary, all of the ideas you cited would actually increase costs to me and my patients. 
 Electronic records are expensive, take far too much time away from patient care and don't have any influence on the number of tests I do.
 Standard claims forms and automated claims processing have been around for years and have reduced costs as much as they are going to.
 As for replacing fee-for-service with fixed payments for a year's worth of service, I'll retire before falling for this boondoggle. How else other than fee-for-service are you going to pay me for caring for patients who have such diverse needs as the kid I see once every few years for a wart to the elderly person with a melanoma that requires half a day in the operating room and follow-up visits every few days or weeks?
 Your readers should ask themselves what it would be like trying to see a doctor when that doctor has already been paid for seeing you and would have a strong financial incentive not to see you again.
 Rick Parkinson Provo, Utah, Dec. 13, 2009
 To the Editor:
 You acknowledge that for many, $1 trillion is unimaginably more than we can pay for expansion of health care, yet as you point out, it's less than the $4 trillion unfunded Bush tax cuts.
 Let's look at it another way:
 Over 10 years, $1 trillion is $100 billion a year. Given an estimated 308 million people in the United States, that's $325 a year per person. The $325 breaks down to $27 a month, or roughly $6 a week, or less than 90 cents a day for each of us, man, woman and child, for 10 years, during which we would be providing health insurance to over 30 million people not covered today.
 Yes, health care reform is fiendishly complex and expensive. Can we afford a trillion dollars? Yes.
 Ben Hardy Bloomfield, Conn., Dec. 13, 2009
 To the Editor:
 You seem to be looking past the reality and track record of health care reform finances when you posit that the country can, in fact, afford the current legislative initiative. 
 Yes, Congress estimates that the proposed legislation will cost in the neighborhood of $1 trillion over 10 years with a net reduction of the deficit of about $100 billion to $200 billion. So what's the problem? Congressional budgetary ineptitude. 
 Sally C. Pipes, president of the Pacific Research Institute, had it right when she argued that with the advent of Medicare in 1965: ''The cost was about $3 billion and it was projected to cost $12 billion in 1990. Well in fact it cost $107 billion. Last year it cost $427 billion; it's estimated in 2017 to cost $884 billion.'' 
 Just imagine what a similarly misestimated $1 trillion program will actually cost just 10 years out -- $10 trillion?

 To the Editor:
 Re ''Lieberman Says He Can't Back Current Health Bill'' (news article, Dec. 14): Senate Democrats should force Senator Joseph I. Lieberman, independent of Connecticut, and his Republican allies to filibuster the health care bill throughout the holiday season rather than letting them hold the American people hostage to their tactics.
 Moreover, the filibusters should be shown live in public hospital emergency rooms throughout the United States, so that the uninsured people waiting for primary care can understand exactly who is preventing them from obtaining affordable health insurance. (Better yet, make the filibusters take place in emergency rooms, but the Capitol Police might object.) Jonathan I. Ezor West Hempstead, N.Y., Dec. 14, 2009

HEADLINE: Railyards Developer Pledges Some Low-Rent Apartments

BYLINE: By MANNY FERNANDEZ

 BODY:
New York City housing officials and the real estate company that plans to transform the West Side railyards into a high-rise residential and business district have agreed to preserve hundreds of apartments near the site as affordable dwellings for low- and middle-income New Yorkers. 
 The agreement calls for 551 apartments that are owned by the developer, the Related Companies, or will be acquired by the city, in the area surrounding the 26-acre railyards to remain at those affordable rents, many of them permanently. Rent protections at other development projects often expire. 
 Related and the city had already pledged to build 743 new below-market-rate apartments as part of the project -- 431 out of roughly 5,000 residential units that Related plans at the railyards complex and 312 more to be developed by the city nearby.
 Many of the units are intended for families earning no more than 80 percent of the median household income in the city -- roughly $61,000 for a four-person household under federal guidelines. The agreement, part of a rezoning plan, came about after negotiations between Related and the mayor's office, city housing officials, community activists and City Council leaders, including the Council speaker, Christine C. Quinn, who had made the creation of housing for low- and middle-income families a priority. 
 Development plans at the railyards have had a long, rocky history. In 2005, Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg suffered a blow to his agenda when plans to build a football stadium for the Jets there fell apart. 
 ''This is a very significant victory for the West Side, to see a plan move forward for the western railyards, a plan that does not include football, and a plan that does include affordable housing,'' Ms. Quinn said at a news conference Monday at City Hall after the rezoning was approved by the Council's zoning subcommittee and its land use committee. 
 The city expanded its commitment to preserve affordable housing units in the area as a way to achieve the mayor's overall goals of redeveloping the West Side and financing 165,000 units of affordable housing throughout the five boroughs. It had the effect of ensuring that the rezoning received broad support from elected officials and community leaders. 
 ''This isn't just a specific project,'' said the deputy mayor for economic development, Robert C. Lieber. ''It's really about building out an overall community.''
 The relatively smooth approval of the plan by the two Council committees was in stark contrast to another closely watched Related project that the committees took up Monday and ultimately struck down: the redevelopment of the Kingsbridge Armory in the Bronx into a shopping mall. The rezoning plan for the railyards now heads to the City Planning Commission and then goes before the full Council for final approval next week.
 ''We were happy to be able to come up with a menu of affordable options that worked from everybody's point of view,'' said Jay Cross, president of Related Hudson Yards, the joint venture between Related and Goldman Sachs, that is developing the site.
 The $15 billion railyards project will transform the largest undeveloped site left in Manhattan into a high-rise enclave with 12 million square feet of office towers, apartment buildings, a hotel, parks and retail businesses. The 26-acre railyards, owned by the Metropolitan Transportation Authority, sit on both sides of 11th Avenue between 30th and 33rd Streets, near the Jacob K. Javits Convention Center. 
 In a $1.054 billion deal last May, Stephen M. Ross, chief executive of Related, signed an agreement with the transportation authority to develop the site.

HEADLINE: Even Bigger Than Too Big to Fail

 BODY:
Asserting that it ''is among the strongest banks in the industry,'' Citigroup announced on Monday that it would soon repay $20 billion of federal bailout money. This from a bank that has been in the red for most of the past two years, that is expected to limp through 2010 amid a torrent of loan losses, that saw its stock price close after the announcement at a measly $3.70 a share -- and that, like other big banks, is still reluctant to lend.
 Meanwhile, the Treasury Department, which seems to have no qualms about Citigroup's self-proclaimed strength, plans to sell its $25 billion stake over the next six to 12 months. 
 Citigroup's planned exit from the bailout -- like Bank of America's earlier this month -- would be welcome if the banks were the picture of health. But their main motive is to get out from under the bailout's pay caps and other restraints. The Treasury Department's approval is a grim reminder of the political power of the banks, even as the economy they did so much to damage continues to struggle.
 Over the weekend, President Obama summoned the nation's biggest bankers to Washington, but some of the biggest recipients of taxpayers' money, including Citigroup and Goldman Sachs, didn't bother making the extra effort to get there ahead of time to avoid the predictable winter weather that grounded their flights.
 Mr. Obama was right when he said the banks owe ''an extraordinary commitment'' to taxpayers, and he got some promises to lend more. But that would have been more convincing if the administration had held the banks' feet to the fire in the first place and had not agreed so quickly to freeing them from the bailout restraints. The truth is that the taxpayers are still very much on the hook for a banking system that is shaping up to be much riskier than the one that led to disaster. 
 Big bank profits, for instance, still come mostly courtesy of taxpayers. Their trading earnings are financed by more than a trillion dollars' worth of cheap loans from the Federal Reserve, for which some of their most noxious assets are collateral. They benefit from immense federal loan guarantees, but they are not lending much. Lending to business, notably, is very tight.
 What profits the banks make come mostly from trading. Many big banks are happy to depend on the lifeline from the Fed and hang onto their toxic assets hoping for a rebound in prices. And the whole system has grown more concentrated. Bank of America was considered too big to fail before the meltdown. Since then, it has acquired Merrill Lynch. Wells Fargo took over Wachovia. And JPMorgan Chase gobbled up Bear Stearns.
 If the goal is to reduce the number of huge banks that taxpayers must rescue at any cost, the nation is moving in the wrong direction. The growth of the biggest banks ensures that the next bailout will have to be even bigger. These banks will be more likely to take on excessive risk because they have the implicit assurance of rescue.
 The White House's proposal to overhaul financial regulation has ideas for banks that are too big to fail. The House passed a bill last week that would require big banks to have bigger capital cushions to absorb losses. It gives the government authority to seize and dismantle big financial firms at imminent risk of failure and mandates banks to pay for a $150 billion fund to cover the costs of any future mess. It grants regulators authority to limit the operations or even break up big banks deemed too risky, even if they appear healthy.
 These provisions still seem vulnerable to being gamed. The Senate, which is unlikely to pass its version of the deal until next year, should explore more direct measures, like banning banks beyond a certain size, measured by their liabilities. 
 If we have learned anything over the last couple of years, it is that banks that are too big to fail pose too much of a risk to the economy. Any serious effort to reform the financial system must ensure that no such banks exist.

HEADLINE: Putting Obama on Hold, In a Hint of Who's Boss

BYLINE: By ANDREW ROSS SORKIN. 
The latest news on mergers and acquisitions can be found at nytimes.com/dealbook.

 BODY:
President Obama didn't exactly look thrilled as he stared at the Polycom speakerphone in front of him. ''Well, I appreciate you guys calling in,'' he began the meeting at the White House with Wall Street's top brass on Monday. 
 He was, of course, referring to the three conspicuously absent attendees who were being piped in by telephone: Lloyd C. Blankfein, the chief executive of Goldman Sachs; John J. Mack, chairman of Morgan Stanley; and Richard D. Parsons, chairman of Citigroup. 
 Their excuse? ''Inclement weather,'' according to the White House. More precisely, fog delayed flights into Reagan National Airport. (In the ''no good deed goes unpunished'' category, the absent bankers were at least self-aware enough to try to fly commercial.)
 That awkward moment on speakerphone in the White House, for better or worse, spoke volumes about how the balance of power between Wall Street and Washington has shifted again, back in Wall Street's favor. 
 Now that Citigroup has given back its bailout money -- and Wells Fargo announced late on Monday that it would, too -- whatever leverage Washington had over the financial services industry seems to be quickly eroding. 
 Executive compensation, leverage limits and lending standards were all issues that Washington said it planned to change -- and when the taxpayers were the shareholders of these firms, it probably could have done so. But now the White House has been left in the position of extending invitations, rather than exercising its clout. And in the figurative and literal sense, it is getting stood up.
 Those who attended the meeting -- Jamie Dimon of JPMorgan flew down on a private jet and didn't take any heat for it -- seemed to talk a good game, but even President Obama acknowledged they might have been just toying with him.
 ''The problem is there's a big gap between what I'm hearing here in the White House and the activities of lobbyists on behalf of these institutions or associations of which they're a member up on Capitol Hill,'' he said after the discussion.
 Are we making too much of this meeting and its grounded attendees?
 The meeting was always just going to be political theater. Wall Street bankers were supposed to play their part on the public stage in Washington, and submit to a scolding from the president about bonuses and the need to start lending more to help get the economy moving.
 But inevitably public perception will issue its harsh ruling, and it goes something like this: If the meeting were really that important to Mr. Blankfein, Mr. Mack and Mr. Parsons, they would have found a way to get there. 
 They would have left the night before, or they would have flown out at the crack of dawn, or better yet, taken Amtrak (I called customer service, and the Acela was running only a couple of minutes late). 
 In fairness, there is little question that they wanted to be there and seemed genuinely disappointed they couldn't make it. (You could hear it in Mr. Mack and Mr. Blankfein's voice when they got on the call. ''Mr. President, we're upset we're not able to be there, but we're on line with you now,'' Mr. Mack said. ''It's certainly not for a lack of effort,'' Mr. Blankfein quickly followed up.)
 But this missed meeting clearly didn't help their case. 
 After all, they sure hoofed it down there last year, when Henry M. Paulson Jr. ordered them to meet him in Washington with less than 24 hours of notice. Most of them got there early, and went home with $10 billion to $25 billion of taxpayer money.
 Upon hearing the news Monday morning of the airplane delays, Mark Haines, an anchor at CNBC, went on the air and, in a Howard Beale moment, said what many Americans were probably thinking: ''These guys are such little girls! Give me a break. What a bunch of wimps! Thanks for all that taxpayer money ... and, ah, gee, there are delays at the airport!''
 But extra effort may have been a lot to ask given the blasting headwinds they were flying into down in Washington.
 President Obama's ''60 Minutes'' interview Sunday night eviscerating Wall Street laid down the not-so-welcome mat. ''I did not run for office to be helping out a bunch of fat-cat bankers,'' he said. 
 Inside the Obama administration, there were bruised feelings about the need for a conference call to have a meeting. 
 ''It was pretty nervy,'' one staff member told me. 
 That's not to say that Mr. Blankfein, Mr. Mack and Mr. Parsons have not been trying to be constructive. 
 Mr. Mack has been particularly outspoken about the need for serious financial reform on Wall Street. Mr. Parsons, too, has been trying to act as a liaison with Washington and has not pushed back on legislation. 
 And Mr. Blankfein, who is under perhaps the hottest spotlight, has been saying many of the right things, though he probably can't say enough of them at the moment.
 But as President Obama has said, it is not what those leaders say to him that really matters. 
 ''The way I see it, having recovered with the help of the American government and the American taxpayers, our banks now have a greater obligation to the goal of a wider recovery, a more stable system, and more broadly shared prosperity,'' Mr. Obama said.
 There's an expression that many bankers already know, and might want to keep in mind if they are summoned to Washington again. The saying is often trotted out on Wall Street when people need to be reminded of the importance of getting on a plane and seeing a client: ''You can't fax a handshake.''

HEADLINE: As 787 Takes Flight, Seattle Wonders About Boeing's Future

BYLINE: By WILLIAM YARDLEY

DATELINE: EVERETT, Wash. 

 BODY:
The new Boeing 787 Dreamliner lifted into the gray skies here for the first time on Tuesday morning, more than two years behind schedule and burdened with restoring Boeing's pre-eminence in global commercial aviation. 
 ''Engines, engines, engines, engines!'' shouted April Seixeiro, 37, when the glossy twin-engine plane began warming up across from where spectators had informally gathered at Paine Field. Ms. Seixeiro was among scores of local residents and self-described ''aviation geeks'' who came to watch the first flight.
 Moments after the plane took off at 10:27 a.m., Mrs. Seixeiro was wiping tears from her eyes. A friend, Katie Bailey, 34, cried, too. 
 ''That was so beautiful,'' Ms. Bailey said.
 Even as aviation fans celebrated in this Seattle suburb, where generations of families have built planes for Boeing, the 787's long route to takeoff was challenged yet again: the test flight was cut short because of what Boeing said was rough weather. Rather than cross the Cascade Mountains, as was intended, the plane instead spent much of its time over Puget Sound and the Strait of Juan de Fuca before touching down in light rain about two hours early, at about 1:30 p.m., at its intended destination, Boeing Field in Seattle.
 Randall Neville, one of the test pilots, said afterward that weather, including poor visibility, was the only reason for the change in plans. ''The thing that caught me most today was that this airplane flew like we expected it to,'' Mr. Neville said. ''There were no surprises.''
 Designed to be 20 percent more fuel-efficient, quieter and more comfortable than other commercial jets, and built for long-range flights, the 787 is central to Boeing's effort to retake momentum from Airbus, the European competitor that has gained on it over the last decade. Boeing has about 840 orders for the 787. Some others were dropped because of the recession and production delays. Boeing officials said Tuesday that customers would get the first 787s in the second half of 2010. The plane can seat 200 to 300 people.
 Unlike jets Boeing made here for decades, the 787 is built more from plastic composites than metal and is pieced together from parts made around the country and the world. Initially expected to fly in 2007, it has been plagued by production flaws.
 As Boeing has changed its manufacturing methods, it has also changed its relationship with the Seattle region. The company moved its executive offices to Chicago in 2001, and this fall it announced that it would open a second 787 plant in South Carolina. The company has had ongoing disputes with labor unions in the Seattle area, and many people here worry that it will reduce its presence in Washington State. 
 ''It's a bigger deal than they say,'' said Mrs. Seixeiro's husband, Steve, referring to the new South Carolina plant. Neither he nor his wife work for Boeing, but both view it as important to the area's economy.
 Garrett Wiedmeier, who grew up with posters of jets on his bedroom walls and watched first flights of the 767 and 777, said he did not fault Boeing for expanding beyond Seattle.
 ''I think Boeing will be here for a long time to come,'' said Mr. Wiedmeier, 37. ''It's just got such a big infrastructure here. But I do worry.''

HEADLINE: Ignoring Failure's Real Cost

BYLINE: By DAVID LEONHARDT. 
E-mail: Leonhardt@nytimes.com

 BODY:
Greg Woock is the chief executive of Pinger, a fast-growing Silicon Valley company that makes iPhone applications. So Mr. Woock spends a fair amount of time interviewing job applicants. In almost every interview, he told me recently, the applicant asks about Pinger's health insurance plan.
 Now think about that for a minute.
 In the cradle of American innovation, workers are making career choices based on co-payments, pre-existing conditions and other minutiae of health insurance. They are not necessarily making decisions based on what would be best for their careers and, in turn, for the American economy -- that is, ''where their skills match and where they can grow the most,'' as another Silicon Valley entrepreneur, Cyriac Roeding, says. Health insurance, Mr. Roeding adds, ''is distorting the decision-making.''
 It is impossible to know how much economic damage these distortions are causing, but they clearly aren't good. Economic research suggests that more than 1.5 million workers who would otherwise have switched jobs fail to do so every year because of fears about health insurance. Some of them would have moved to companies where they could have contributed more, and others would have started their own businesses. 
 This link between insurance and innovation isn't relevant merely for the obvious reason that Congress is in the late stages of debating health reform. It is also relevant because the United States is suffering from an innovation deficit.
 Even before the financial crisis, the decade that will end later this month was on pace to have the slowest economic growth of any since before World War II. The No. 1 reason, I'd argue, was our innovation deficit.
 For most of this decade, the rate at which companies eliminated jobs was actually lower than in the 1990s (despite the stories you sometimes hear about the United States having entered a new era of economic instability). The problem was that companies weren't creating enough new jobs. The rate at which existing companies added jobs declined 14 percent from the end of the 1990s to 2007, according to the Labor Department. The rate at which start-up companies created jobs fell even more: 24 percent.
 Given the consequences of the innovation deficit -- slower growth, fewer jobs, lower living standards -- you would want to look for every possible solution, wouldn't you?
 You'd want to allow more talented immigrants to become citizens, so that the next Sergey Brin, Liz Claiborne or Andy Grove, immigrant entrepreneurs all, didn't end up starting their companies elsewhere. You would want to clean up the tangled corporate tax code. You would want to finance more basic research.
 And you would want to make people feel confident that they could take risks -- start a new company or join a young one -- without worrying about whether they would still receive adequate medical care. 
 Congress is now close to passing a very promising health reform bill. Neither the bill that the House passed last month nor the bill being debated in the Senate is good enough yet. But they are close.
 Ultimately, health reform will be judged by two yardsticks. The first will be whether it begins to shift medicine away from the corrosive fee-for-service system that leads to uneven results and soaring costs. The second will be whether people can easily buy insurance even if they don't work for a large company or qualify for Medicare or Medicaid. 
 Silicon Valley, with its network of venture capital backers, figures out a way to get most of its workers some kind of health insurance. But many other entrepreneurs have a harder time of it. Only 46 percent of companies with three to nine employees offer health insurance, down from 56 percent a decade ago, according to the Kaiser Family Foundation. 
 Why? The administrative costs of insurance are high when they aren't spread over a large group of workers. Insurers also know that the individuals and small companies who sign up for health plans tend to be the ones with the most medical problems, pushing premiums for such plans even higher. 
 So unless the government steps in to create a large pool of workers who can then buy insurance more cheaply, many small companies will go without it -- and some workers will find themselves tethered to the safety of a big company. 
 As Eric Schmidt, Google's chief executive, told me, ''There clearly are people who choose to stay in their jobs due to the fact that they don't have insurance portability.'' Just consider the economic research showing that people married to someone with health insurance are more likely to work at small companies than people who aren't so lucky. 
 The path to a health bill that begins to solve both core problems -- access and cost -- is fairly clear, numerous health economists say. It involves combining the Senate provisions on cost and quality control (and, ideally, strengthening them) with the House provisions on insurance access. Ezra Klein, the blogger and health policy writer, refers to it as a ''health care reform fantasy draft.''
 The House bill does a good job of creating affordable insurance plans for the uninsured but does little to attack fee-for-service medicine. As a result, medical costs are likely to stay high for everyone.
 The Senate bill, by contrast, has the ''essential elements of a successful, fiscally responsible reform strategy,'' according to a recent letter from 26 economists, including four Nobel Prize winners and two former directors of the Congressional Budget Office. But the Senate plan is too rough on the newly insured. It would force many of them to pay thousands of dollars a year out of pocket, on top of their premiums, for care. 
 ''Take the Senate on cost control and the House on affordability,'' Jonathan Gruber of M.I.T. argues, ''and you've the best possible bill.'' 
 And what if Congress -- distracted by hot-button issues like drug imports, government-financed abortions and the so-called public option -- produces something short of best? Should we then hope that it gives up and take another crack at health reform in, say, 2025?
 Well, remember that this process was never going to be easy and was always going to be messy. But in the coming days and weeks, the choices before Congress will be straightforward: How can the bills still be improved? And once all the negotiating is over, will the final package seem likely to do more good than harm? 
 Last week, Medicare's chief actuary came out with a report that offered some useful guidance on that second question. The report became fodder for critics of the bills because it estimated that the current Senate plan would raise national health spending slightly. Without health reform, the country would spend $4.67 trillion on medical care in 2019. With it, we would spend $20 billion more, a total of $4.69 trillion. 
 If you dug into the report, however, you discovered the main reason for the projected increase. Vastly more people -- about 33 million -- would have insurance if the Senate plan passed. ''There are more people insured, and more people getting treatment,'' the actuary, Rick Foster, said.
 Yet health spending would rise by just 0.5 percent. The cost of insuring a given individual would be significantly reduced, in other words, and millions of people would no longer have to worry about whether they were insured.
 Maybe one of those millions will end up starting the next great American company.

HEADLINE: Deep Losses Forecast for Airlines in 2010

BYLINE: By NICOLA CLARK

 BODY:
Demand for air travel is expected to rebound next year as the global economy recovers, but airlines will continue to report significant losses as excess capacity forces them to keep ticket prices low, an industry trade group said Tuesday. 
 The International Air Transport Association said industrywide losses would reach $5.6 billion in 2010, larger than a previous forecast of $3.8 billion. Still, the projected losses are half the record $11 billion loss expected for 2009. 
 Passenger demand could grow by about 4.5 percent next year, reversing a 4.1 percent drop in 2009, the association's secretary general, Giovanni Bisignani, said in a statement. 
 ''Tough times continue,'' Mr. Bisignani said. ''The number of travelers will be back to the peak levels of 2007, but with $30 billion less in revenues.'' 
 Earlier fears of a wave of new airline bankruptcies during the winter low season have subsided, thanks to the industry's collective cash reserves of about $38 billion -- most of that built up through aircraft sales and leasebacks as well as borrowings from international capital markets.
 But despite that cash cushion, Mr. Bisignani warned there was ''no recovery in sight for 2010.'' 
 Asian airlines are likely to show the sharpest improvement next year, with losses expected at about $700 million, compared with $3.4 billion in 2009. The recovery will be led by China, whose economy is forecast to grow by 9 percent next year. 
 Airlines in Europe will be the slowest to recover, generating the largest expected losses -- $2.5 billion next year, the association said. In North America, losses are expected to shrink to $2 billion, from $2.9 billion this year. 
 In the Middle East, carriers' losses are expected to fall to $300 million, from $1.2 billion in 2009, despite the recent financial difficulties affecting Dubai. The gulf region has become a major hub for intercontinental traffic.
 Airlines have reduced the number of available seats by about 6 percent this year, exceeding the decline in passenger numbers. But the air industry group warned that roughly 1,300 new aircraft were scheduled for delivery to airlines in 2010, which would contribute 2.8 percent to global capacity growth and help to keep a lid on airfares. 
 As if to underscore that trend, Delta Air Lines, the world's biggest airline by passengers carried, said on Tuesday that it expected to maintain its seating capacity next year at 2009 levels, rather than cut seats by a further 3 percent as previously planned. 
 ''The industry is structurally out of balance,'' Mr. Bisignani said. ''The precipitous fall in yields will likely never be fully recovered.'' Yield refers to the average revenue earned per distance traveled. 
 ''It is difficult to see how this can be balanced on the cost side of the equation,'' he added. ''After almost a decade of cost cutting,'' additional savings on items other than fuel ''will be incremental at best.'' Cargo demand is expected to grow by 7 percent next year, to 37.7 million tons, which is stronger than a September forecast of 5 percent growth, the association said, as global economies recover and companies build up depleted inventories. Cargo demand has fallen by about 13 percent this year.

HEADLINE: Iranian Dealings Lead to a Fine For Credit Suisse

BYLINE: By CLAUDIO GATTI and JOHN ELIGON; Claudio Gatti is an investigative reporter for Il Sole 24 Ore. He is based in New York. Graham Bowley contributed reporting.

 BODY:
Credit Suisse is expected to pay a fine of $536 million to settle accusations by the United States government and New York State authorities that it violated sanctions by helping Iran and other countries secretly funnel hundreds of millions of dollars through American banks, people involved in the negotiations said Tuesday.
 Investigators found that the bank, the second-largest in Switzerland, removed information from American-bound wire transfers that would have signaled that the money originated in Iranian banks, according to a law enforcement official briefed on the case. 
 Two of the organizations that Credit Suisse facilitated transactions for, the official said, were the Atomic Energy Organization of Iran and the Aerospace Industries Organization, both of which are designated as proliferators of weapons of mass destruction by the United States Office of Foreign Assets Control. Both are barred from doing business with the United States.
 In a statement released Tuesday, Credit Suisse confirmed that it would most likely pay $536 million in a settlement. The release did not provide details about the case, other than to say that it involved dollar payments from 2002 through April 2007 for ''parties that are subject to U.S. economic sanctions.''
 Credit Suisse said it began an internal investigation into the situation in December 2005 and had since changed its practices, including termination of all business with organizations that have been subject to sanctions by the Office of Foreign Assets Control, closing an office in Tehran and appointing a global sanctions compliance officer.
 An official settlement, which will allow Credit Suisse to avoid prosecution, is expected to be announced on Wednesday, but late Tuesday, the bank issued a statement confirming the fine.
 In October, Robert M. Morgenthau, the Manhattan district attorney, announced that his office, the Justice Department and the Federal Reserve were working on a case against a large international ''mainstream bank'' for allowing illicit financial transactions with Iran, which has long been subject to sanctions by the United States government.
 In the weeks that followed, Credit Suisse officials negotiated the amount of the fine with federal and state authorities.
 Mr. Morgenthau declined to comment Tuesday. His office is expected to split the settlement amount evenly with the federal authorities. Under a new state law, Mr. Morgenthau's office would then disburse his office's share -- $268 million -- equally between New York City and the state. The $268 million would be the largest financial settlement that the Manhattan district attorney's office has ever secured.
 The fine imposed on Credit Suisse comes at a time of heightened tension between the United States and Iran. The Obama administration recently signaled its intention to push for a new set of sanctions that could further restrict Tehran's economic and commercial activities unless Iran agrees to bring its nuclear activities under stricter international supervision. 
 Federal and state authorities reached a similar settlement in January with Lloyds TSB, a London-based bank now under British government control. In that case, Lloyds agreed to pay $350 million to settle accusations that it had removed identifying information from transactions originating in Iran, Libya and Sudan.
 But in the Lloyds case, the authorities were not able to identify specific Iranian organizations that were carrying out the transactions or what was being purchased.
 The authorities identified more than 7,000 illicit transactions that Credit Suisse facilitated, worth about $700 million, a law enforcement official said. Investigators found an additional $1.1 billion in transactions that had been manipulated, but they have not deemed them as violating sanctions in this case, the official said.
 Investigators found that Credit Suisse's employees violated both state and federal laws by falsifying outgoing dollar payment messages that involved Iran. The bank's employees removed reference to Iran or its banks, a practice called stripping.
 Not only did Credit Suisse employees strip the wire transfers, but they also advised the Iranian banks on how to format their transfers to avoid detection, according to the official. As a result, investigators say, Iranian banks like Bank Saderat and Bank Melli were able to use Credit Suisse to send more than a billion dollars through New York banks. 
 The Atomic Energy Organization is said to have ties with Iran's nuclear weapons program, while Aerospace Industries works with long-range missiles, the authorities said. Law enforcement officials said they thought the organizations had been buying materials for their programs. The sellers, most of whom were outside the United States, wanted dollars, and so the money passed through Manhattan banks, law enforcement officials said.
 But in some cases, a law enforcement official said, the money was used for purchases from United States companies. But the Iranian organizations concealed their identities from the American sellers by setting up shell companies, law enforcement officials said.
 Credit Suisse also facilitated smaller transactions for banks in other sanctioned countries, including Cuba, Sudan, Burma and Libya, the official said.
 It has not been a good year for Swiss banks in the United States. In February, UBS was fined $780 million by the Justice Department for helping about 50,000 wealthy Americans evade taxes.
 UBS admitted criminal wrongdoing in selling offshore banking services that the I.R.S. said it suspected had been used by Americans to avoid taxes. Six months later, in August, UBS turned over the names of about 4,450 of those clients. That move contributed to the decision by 14,700 Americans to join an I.R.S. amnesty program and disclose their previously secret foreign bank accounts.
 In the fall, UBS received a $5.3 billion capital injection from the Swiss government in return for a 9 percent stake. It was allowed to dispose of up to $60 billion of illiquid securities and impaired assets. The Swiss government offered Credit Suisse a similar deal, but the bank opted to raise money from private investors.

HEADLINE: Pact Ends Long Trade Fight Over Bananas

BYLINE: By STEPHEN CASTLE

DATELINE: BRUSSELS 

 BODY:
The European Union initialed a deal on Tuesday to resolve a dispute over banana imports dating back more than 15 years, ending the longest trade battle in its history as a bloc and potentially opening the way for progress in other areas. 
 After losing several cases at the World Trade Organization, the European Union agreed to cut the tariff applied to Latin American bananas, thereby reducing the preferential treatment given to growers in former colonies in the Caribbean and Africa. 
 The move could open opportunities for producers in Ecuador and other Latin American nations to increase exports to the European Union, the world's biggest trading bloc. 
 The deal Tuesday was initialed by the European Union, the United States and Latin American, African and Caribbean nations. As part of the agreement, Washington said it would settle its W.T.O. dispute with the Europeans over bananas. 
 Tension over European rules on banana imports date back to the late 1950s, when the forerunner of the European Union was created. But it was not until the 1990s that the dispute heated up, after the creation of common European rules on banana imports on July 1, 1993. 
 The rules were challenged by five Latin American countries. On Feb. 11, 1994, a panel at GATT -- the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, the predecessor body to the W.T.O. -- ruled against the new banana import regime, which was then challenged in 1996 at the W.T.O. 
 Latin American nations and American corporations complained bitterly about preferential treatment of Europe's former colonies in the Caribbean and Africa. Those countries argued that they could not compete with the vast, mechanized plantations used by corporations in Central America, and that their economies would collapse without protection. 
 Under the deal initialed Tuesday, the European Union will cut the tariff paid on bananas from Latin American countries in eight stages, reducing it to $114 a ton in 2017, from $176 a ton currently. 
 An initial cut to $148 a ton will apply once the deal has been signed. That is likely to take several months, but exporters will be able claim the benefit of this first cut from the date of initialing. 
 The European Commission president, Jose Manuel Barroso, described the agreement as ''a compromise that works for all sides.'' He added that it was ''an important boost for the multilateral system.'' 
 That statement underlined Europe's desire to solve the dispute, which had undermined its ability to take other trade partners to task for breach of W.T.O. rules. 
 In 1999 and 2000, the United States and Ecuador won the right to impose trade sanctions on European goods after the W.T.O. ruled that the banana tariffs were illegal. 
 Europe subsequently changed its import requirements more than once, but not enough to withstand challenge by Latin American nations. 
 So sensitive was the issue that the negotiation over bananas formed part of the talks during the Doha global trade round before they collapsed in July 2008. 
 A report for the International Center for Trade and Sustainable Development, by Prof. Giovanni Anania of the University of Calabria in Italy, projects that, after the tariff cuts, European imports of bananas will increase 6 percent. 
 On Tuesday, the European Union said it would propose giving African, Caribbean and Pacific countries an extra 200 million euros, or $293 million, in aid to add to the 450 million euros they have received since 1994 to help them to adapt.

HEADLINE: Building New Neighborhoods in Syracuse, Using Some Pieces of the Old

BYLINE: By ALEC APPELBAUM

DATELINE: SYRACUSE 

 BODY:
Standing on the windblown rooftop of a twisty glass building here, Ed Bogucz waved one arm toward the downtown skyline and the other toward a neighborhood of abandoned houses and vacant lots where he is investing in green-home technology. The whole area, he said, is a laboratory. ''The thing about Syracuse is that it's at a great scale,'' he said. ''It's big enough to have density and small enough that you can study the whole thing.'' 
 Mr. Bogucz's organization, the Syracuse Center of Excellence, has teamed with the Syracuse University School of Architecture and a local nonprofit developer called Home HeadQuarters in a unusual real estate experiment. The center, one of six founded within the last decade by the state under former Gov. George E. Pataki to nurture promising industries in college towns, is investing in companies that use less fossil fuel in building affordable homes, outfitting them and supplying them with energy. 
 The center will soon move from an office park into the five-story building where Mr. Bogucz was standing, where it will monitor demonstration technologies. 
 The architecture school, meanwhile, is leading a project to put some of those technologies into effect in the Near West Side, a dilapidated neighborhood near downtown, where construction has begun on homes that emit almost no carbon and cost less than $150,000 to build. Three such homes, already in contract, should be complete by summer. 
 Mr. Bogucz, who pronounces his name BO-gish, said that after distributing $200 million in public money to dozens of green building companies since its founding, the center is currently monitoring many awards and $5 million in grants for start-ups. ''It's the ultimate in patient capital,'' he said, ''and Syracuse is at the forefront of sustainability.'' 
 In homes under construction on the Near West Side, two pilot companies are working at opposite ends of a house's life. One is e2e Materials, an Ithaca company that makes particleboard and walls from soy flour and fibers of natural grasslike materials.
 By buying the flour left over from soy production and using perennial supplies of lightweight fibers rather than diminishing stocks of lumber, e2e can significantly lower the amount of dedicated energy it takes to construct a house, according to the company's chief executive, Patrick Govang. This avoided fuel use, Mr. Govang added, means that, over time, e2e's product will generate significantly fewer carbon emissions than wood. The company also recently started trying to grow flax within the state, he said.
 Mr. Govang has run the company since it was spun off a Cornell University experiment in fiber design in 2007. He said the latest iteration of e2e's material, which he plans to produce in standard four- by eight-foot sizes by spring, could go into walls and floors. ''A typical floor system in a home costs about $24 per square foot,'' he said. His company expects to sell at half that price. 
 But e2e has not yet achieved economies of scale in its manufacturing, and it is relying on the Center of Excellence to cover the gap between what it charges and what clients can pay. (The center has also paid to use e2e materials to make the reception desk at its new headquarters.). 
 The other business working in the Near West Side with the center's support faces no shortage of raw material. Northeast Natural Homes, a father and son outfit, competes with demolition contractors by ''deconstructing'' old homes, one plank at a time, rather than razing them.
 The company then resells the lumber for new building projects. The father, Kevin Stack, said that he had trained 16 people to pull 12,100 pounds of lumber from a little 89-year-old house on the Near West Side, all of it stronger and more reliably usable than lumber from a distributor. 
 These two companies see huge market opportunities once they can achieve economies of scale. Mr. Govang pointed out that his material's protein made it a natural fire retardant, rendering formaldehyde unnecessary. And he said that by growing fibers regionally, as he hopes to do soon with help from government sources, he would continually replenish the supply. 
 Mr. Stack said that in cities like Buffalo and Flint, Mich., with thousands of abandoned homes, deconstruction could compete with traditional demolition. ''You could say this is all stored carbon that would go into a landfill,'' he said. If the United States adopts a cap on carbon emissions, he argued, home builders could buy salvaged lumber and then sell the right to emit the amount of carbon that would have burned if the lumber had gone into a landfill. 
 Mr. Stack's son, Josh, sees plenty of opportunity in his hometown. ''There are 1,450 abandoned homes in Syracuse,'' he said. 
 Some of Northeast Natural Homes' lumber will go into one of the new houses that the architecture school has nurtured. Developed by Home HeadQuarters, which has renovated homes in the neighborhood for decades, these houses will be compact and offer reconfigurable interiors. 
 The one using Northeast Natural Homes' recovered lumber, designed by the New York architecture firm of Cook & Fox, will feature elaborate dividers that serve as movable walls. 
 Mr. Bogucz is negotiating to reach a price at which e2e's material can go into the house's movable walls, given the architecture school's mandate that the house cost less than $150,000 to build. 
 Even though the houses are selling at low prices, they show high ambition. In another experiment, two New York architecture firms -- Architecture Research Office and Della Valle Bernheimer -- have designed a home to meet a standard called Passivhaus, which requires a building exterior so airtight that residents hardly need to use boilers or air-conditioners. Jared Della Valle, a partner in Della Valle Bernheimer, described it as sealing in heat and cool, ''like a sheep.''
 Mr. Bogucz, a trained engineer, has also invested in demonstrations of systems that use excess heat from electricity or water to heat homes. 
 Champions of the Syracuse experiments know that most people associate their city with industrial decline and urban emptiness. But Mr. Bogucz said his investments could change that. Noting how the fledgling e2e had impressed Cook & Fox, Mr. Bogucz made a prediction. ''Within five years, I expect e2e will have annual revenues of several hundred million dollars and several hundred employees,'' he said. 
 He also predicts that 50 full-time deconstruction experts will be at work by 2015 -- because old houses will still outnumber new ones for a while.

HEADLINE: A Dubious Prize in Raising Capital

 BODY:
Hot money rules. Hong Kong has taken the crown from New York as the global capital for stock-market listings. The exchange has bagged $27 billion of public offerings in 2009 to date, compared with $26.5 billion in the United States. This says more about easy money and market mania than it does about China's rise. 
 Three kinds of companies have given the Hong Kong stock exchange its prize. First, there are those firms that failed to go public during previous rallies. Second, there are Chinese firms looking to tap investors who are bullish about China's growth. 
 Finally there are companies that have diverted fund-raisings from other countries and markets. Consider the spinoff of casino assets by Wynn and Sands, or the $2 billion I.P.O. of the Russian metals giant Rusal, scheduled for early in 2010.
 Despite these, Hong Kong's supremacy might be misleading. In China, public offerings are of disproportionate importance to the equity market. For equity fund raising overall, New York still reigns supreme, with $226 billion raised this year, three times the amount in Hong Kong. As if to illustrate the point, Citigroup and Wells Fargo announced a total of $30 billion in subsequent stock sales this week, notching up almost half the total amount of equity raised in Hong Kong so far this year.
 Moreover, the liquidity tsunamis that are driving Hong Kong's equity market may also bring it crashing down. Excess savings from the mainland are leaking over the border in search of a return, amid China's extraordinary monetary easing program. From the other side of the world, investors are borrowing at the near-zero rates in the United States and reinvesting in Hong Kong stocks and property for a higher return, a revival of the boom-time ''carry trade.''
 This is creating some distortions. Hong Kong's pool of cash and demand-deposits has grown almost 50 percent as investors shift their funds away from longer-term savings into a form they can spend or invest. House prices have risen for 10 months in a row, and any initial public offering that rises less than 20 percent on its first day is deemed a failure. China will rise, all right. But for now, the real growth is in the region's asset bubbles.
 Box-Office Blues
 The latest financial release from Hollywood looks like a dud. A two-year-old studio, The Film Department, is planning an initial public offering. But all it has to show for itself after two years of moviemaking is one hit and $34 million of losses. 
 The founders began The Film Department with Tinseltown-size ambitions. Mark Gill, an indie studio veteran who worked on ''March of the Penguins,'' and Neil Sacker, associated with ''Crash,'' planned to release 30 films in their first five years. They're off to a slow start. 
 ''Law Abiding Citizen'' has generated $72 million of ticket sales. But The Film Department still hasn't paid off all the release expenses. And its second film, starring Catherine Zeta-Jones, doesn't have distribution yet. That's not promising given the company's debt load.
 The studio owes $62.3 million against $1.9 million of unspoken-for cash. Missed interest payments last summer put the firm in default, and attempts to raise new equity over the summer failed. 
 Lenders are granting some leniency in hope of getting paid with I.P.O. proceeds. A Christmas debt payoff sounds like a Jimmy Stewart classic but not a compelling investment thesis. So Mr. Gill and Mr. Sacker have tried to spice up the offering by adding distribution to the mix. But that plan depends on raising more cash.
 Retail investors shouldn't get sucked in. The movie business is a notorious money pit, with high upfront costs and lumpy cash flows. The studio will use about 40 percent of the $85 million it wants to raise to shrink debt. That will leave enough to finance just two more films before it embarks on another $160 million of borrowing. 
 A writers' strike and the credit squeeze certainly couldn't have helped the fledgling studio. But it still largely missed out on this year's record domestic box office. With a weak track record, an unproven business model and no signs of a hit on the horizon, The Film Department still has much to prove.

HEADLINE: Shares End Lower After Inflation Report

BYLINE: By THE ASSOCIATED PRESS

 BODY:
The stock market fell from 14-month highs on Tuesday, and Treasuries slipped on reports that inflation rose faster than expected last month.
 Shares lost ground late in the day after General Electric forecast that revenue and earnings would be flat next year.
 Major stocks indexes slid 0.5 percent, including the Dow Jones industrial average, which fell 49 points. 
 Trading was subdued for most of the day as Federal Reserve policy makers gathered for a two-day meeting on interest rates. The Fed is not expected to raise rates from their record lows, but the day's economic reports brought reminders that the central bank could be forced to increase rates sooner than expected to keep inflation at bay.
 The government said wholesale prices jumped 1.8 percent last month, more than double the gain analysts expected. Core inflation, which excludes often-volatile food and energy costs, rose 0.5 percent, the biggest increase in more than a year.
 Analysts said the increase in food and energy costs was probably a concern for Fed officials.
 ''They're the twin pistons of inflation,'' said Christopher Wolf, managing partner and a chief investment officer at Cogo Wolf Asset Management in San Francisco.
 Meanwhile, the Fed said industrial production rose 0.8 percent in November, the biggest gain since August. The rise in production meant factories ran at a higher capacity. The portion of capacity being used remains below average, but if factories start seeing demand increase, prices could rise.
 The reports put inflation in front of investors. If prices start to rise too quickly, the Fed could be forced to raise rates and risk choking off a nascent economic recovery.
 ''There is a fair chance that the Fed is going to have to start putting some brakes on the economy,'' Mr. Wolf said, adding that he did not expect any immediate action from policy makers.
 Higher rates would help shore up the dollar, which rose on Tuesday, but has fallen against other major currencies since stocks began rising in March. It could also trip up the stock market as traders realign their holdings.
 Stocks have slowed their nine-month advance in December as traders look to lock in gains for the year and seek clues about what might be able to drive the market in 2010. The benchmark Standard & Poor's 500-stock index has jumped 63.8 percent from a 12-year low in March on relief that the economy was stabilizing. Analysts say investors will need substantive signs that the economy is improving to extend the gains next year.
 On Tuesday, the Dow fell 49.05 points, or 0.5 percent, to 10,452.00. The S.& P. 500 fell 6.18 points, or 0.6 percent, to 1,107.93, and the Nasdaq declined 11.05 points, or 0.5 percent, to 2,201.05.
 The Dow and S.& P. 500 index closed Monday at their highest levels since October 2008 as concerns eased about global debt problems.
 Bond prices fell, pushing yields higher. The yield on the benchmark 10-year Treasury note rose to 3.59 percent, from 3.55 percent late Monday. The price of the 10-year note fell 9/32 to 98 8/32. 
 The dollar rose against other major currencies, while gold prices fell.
 Crude oil rose $1.18 to settle at $70.69 a barrel in New York trading.
 Investors turned cautious after G.E.'s forecast. The stock fell 20 cents, or 1.3 percent, to $15.75.
 Britain's FTSE 100 fell 0.6 percent, Germany's DAX index rose 0.2 percent, and France's CAC-40 added 0.1 percent. Japan's Nikkei stock average fell 0.2 percent.
 Following are the results of Tuesday's auction of four- and 52-week bills:

HEADLINE: Democrats Put Off Some Difficult Issues Until 2010

BYLINE: By CARL HULSE

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
Faced with a shortage of time and an abundance of disagreement, Congressional Democrats are pushing fights over an increase in the federal debt limit and several other tough issues into 2010.
 House Democratic leaders said Tuesday that they would try to conclude their business for the year on Wednesday by sending to the floor a must-pass $626 billion Pentagon spending measure, a stopgap two-month increase in the government's borrowing power and a provision to provide two more months of unemployment pay and health coverage for jobless Americans.
 The House is also expected to consider and pass a $150 billion Democratic effort to create jobs and provide financial assistance to states and localities. That measure would not be considered in the Senate until sometime next year. 
 Congressional Democrats reversed themselves on a plan to win approval of a more substantial increase in the debt ceiling because of resistance from about a dozen Senate Democrats who do not want to take that step without some commitment that Congress would take concrete action to control the spreading red ink.
 Representative Steny H. Hoyer, the Maryland Democrat and House majority leader, acknowledged that delaying action to resolve the wide array of issues was not ideal, but he said it was the best choice at the moment.
 ''In a world of alternatives, that is the one we have,'' he said. ''This is what we can get done now.'' 
 While the decision to put off the debt fight -- as well as potential clashes over highway construction, antiterrorism laws and satellite television rights -- takes Congress off the hook for now, it significantly complicates the Democratic calendar for 2010.
 Democrats now will have to resolve all those policy disputes while preparing for a vote on President Obama's request to add 30,000 troops in Afghanistan and, perhaps, still wrestling with health care. At the same time, the delay pushes some of the more politically delicate issues, like as an increase in the debt limit, that much closer to the November elections.
 While the House was hoping to finish for the year and allow Speaker Nancy Pelosi to lead a bipartisan delegation to the climate talks in Copenhagen, the situation in the Senate was in flux, with the health care debate likely to continue well into next week. And there was no assurance from Senate Republicans that they would make it easy for Democrats to finish quickly.
 ''I think we'll wait until we see exactly how this is all going to be packaged before reacting to it,'' said Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, the Republican leader.
 The Pentagon spending bill, which typically has strong bipartisan support, is the last of a dozen annual money measures awaiting passage. Democrats had planned to attach to it a provision that would increase the current statutory debt limit of $12.1 trillion by another $1.8 trillion to avoid having to revisit the debt issue before the 2010 elections.
 But Republicans, who have been assailing Democratic spending, balked at that approach, and the leadership also found itself negotiating with House and Senate Democrats who said they would not back the debt increase without some concessions.
 Specifically, Senate Democrats led by Kent Conrad of North Dakota, chairman of the Budget Committee, wanted the debt increase tied to a vote on the creation of a bipartisan commission to recommend spending cuts and revenue increases to reduce the debt. And House moderates sought more adherence to ''pay as you go'' rules.
 Despite days of negotiations, Democrats were not able to reach an agreement and instead decided to seek approval of an increase in the debt sufficient to last into February while talks continued. As a result, Democrats face the prospect of two votes to increase the debt limit, a vote most lawmakers would rather avoid.
 The debt limit was not the only issue left unfinished. The Pentagon measure is also expected to wrap in short-term extensions of other expiring federal programs and laws, including provisions of the antiterrorism USA Patriot Act, a highway construction law, small-business programs and a law governing satellite television transmission of local broadcast channels, among others.
 Trying to ease fears of lawmakers worried that Congress has not done enough to create new jobs, the House was expected to pass a plan that would redirect $75 billion from the bank bailout fund to pay for infrastructure projects around the county as well as help states and cities retain and hire emergency personnel and teachers. The measure would also pay for another four months of safety-net programs like unemployment benefits and food stamps.
 House Democrats, clearly frustrated at the pace of business in the Senate, said they hoped the measure would become law next year.
 ''We hope that when we pass it here, that it will, after the first of the year, be passed by the Senate, signed into law before the president comes to deliver his State of the Union address,'' Ms. Pelosi said Tuesday.

HEADLINE: A Stimulus That's Short Of Stimulating

BYLINE: By JIM DWYER. 
E-mail: dwyer@nytimes.com

 BODY:
The shining city of New York opened for business Tuesday morning, one day after the normally very obedient and housebroken City Council rose up against the mayor and voted down a heavily subsidized shopping mall development at the Kingsbridge Armory in the Bronx. 
 The developer could not, or would not, promise that the stores would pay more than the minimum wage of $7.25 an hour. Once the mall was open, public funds still would have been needed to provide subsidies for people working at wages that would most likely have left them far below the poverty line. The mayor argued that low-paying jobs were better than none. 
 In any case, there were more primal forces at work than a debate over the economics of the living wage. It turns out that even the docile Council has decided that it's safe to stick a finger in Michael R. Bloomberg's eye. This may turn out be a long four years for him, and not just because of a frisky Council with notions of its own independence.
 Take the events of Tuesday morning. In a meeting on William Street, the city's Economic Development Corporation drew $19.5 million out of a purse labeled ''American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009'' for the construction of a six-story parking garage at St. Barnabas Hospital in the Bronx. 
 Currently, about 25 people are employed as parking attendants and valets at the hospital. The new garage, where drivers will park themselves, will have jobs for 6. 
 Officials from the hospital and the city spent a good part of the day arguing that the project really wasn't all that grim -- many of the attendants would get jobs at parking lots elsewhere in the city, or could be hired as security guards at the hospital, and so on.
 However you slice it, building the garage would result in a loss of about 20 parking positions.
 ''This financing is from an agency whose sole goal is to create jobs,'' said Bettina Damiani, director of Good Jobs New York, a research group that analyzes the city's economic development strategies. ''So why are they funding projects that will lose jobs?''
 The answer, said David Lombino, a spokesman for the Economic Development Corporation, is that the project will help buttress the central mission of St. Barnabas, which is losing money on its current parking setup. The hospital argues that a lack of parking facilities will thwart its ability to hire capable people and serve patients. 
 But there's more. In truth, the city is financing the project because it has federal money and apparently doesn't have all that many other great ways to spend it. 
 In its earliest days, the Obama administration sponsored stimulus legislation that included money, in the form of tax-free bonds, to get stalled construction projects moving. Among the requirements: the money could only be used for retail or commercial purposes, not to build housing, and it had to be done by for-profit entities. The work had to be ''shovel ready'' and is supposed to be finished by the end of 2010. 
 St. Barnabas set up a for-profit corporation to build the parking garage. That is being run by Scott Cooper, the chief executive of the hospital, who was paid $934,536 last year, including a bonus of $150,000 when the hospital lost millions. Dr. Cooper will not be paid extra for his work on the parking garage corporation, said Steve Clark, a hospital spokesman.
 IT was a mistake, Mr. Clark said, to think about the garage project simply in terms of the lost positions. ''That's the easy way of looking at it,'' he said. ''It's a community hospital and it needs a garage. Its economic viability depends on it. There are 2,200 other people working in the hospital, and not having this garage could jeopardize their jobs.''
 In seeking the financing, the hospital noted that it was surrounded by deep poverty, which the city and hospital officials emphasized in making their case. Ms. Damiani said that simply invoking the difficulties of the neighborhood should not have carried the day. ''They're flaunting the poverty in the Bronx without guaranteeing that the people of the Bronx will get anything,'' she said.
 The government is fighting over scraps. One day it is over jobs in a shopping mall that pay $7.25. The next day it is about financing $19 million to build a garage that will cost only 20 jobs, and supposedly head off the loss of thousands of others. We are in an era of threadbare ambition.

HEADLINE: New Immigration Bill Is Introduced in House

BYLINE: By RANDAL C. ARCHIBOLD

 BODY:
The on-again, off-again drive to overhaul the nation's immigration laws moved back to Congress on Tuesday with the introduction of legislation that would open a path to legal status for millions of illegal immigrants.
 The bill, introduced by Representative Luis V. Gutierrez, Democrat of Illinois, was seen as the opening volley in what Democrats and Republicans expect to be a hard-fought battle. President Obama has pledged to take up the issue early next year; efforts to overhaul the laws during George W. Bush's presidency failed despite the backing of Mr. Bush and some Republicans. 
 Mr. Gutierrez, one of Mr. Obama's earliest Latino supporters in Congress, said in an interview that the bill reflected a growing impatience with the pace of immigration change among a coalition of Democratic lawmakers, immigrant advocates and labor and religious groups.
 ''This says, 'Here, this is what we want; our proposal is out of the box,' '' Mr. Gutierrez said. 
 The pressing desire for ''comprehensive immigration reform'' -- as it is known by supporters -- was made clear in the acronym of Mr. Gutierrez's bill: ''C.I.R. A.S.A.P.''
 Matthew Chandler, a spokesman for Janet Napolitano, the homeland security secretary, said she was pleased that ''Congress is taking steps forward on immigration reform'' but withheld comment on the details of the bill.
 On Capitol Hill, the bill was declared dead on arrival by some Republicans -- and, privately, by some Democrats -- and denounced as impractical and amounting to amnesty for people who had entered the country illegally. Two previous Congressional efforts to revamp immigration laws in the Bush years failed largely because of similar objections.
 Representative Brian Bilbray, a California Republican who heads the House Immigration Reform Caucus, said the bill would only generate a new wave of migrants to compete with Americans for jobs at a time of 10 percent unemployment.
 Democrats in the Senate who would steer an immigration overhaul through that chamber generally welcomed Mr. Gutierrez's bill, though aides said it was too liberal to win passage as written.
 Still, the legislation hewed closely to some recent statements by Obama administration officials, mainly in its call for improved border security, a crackdown on employers who hire unauthorized workers and some way to open the door to citizenship for illegal immigrants.
 Under the bill, to gain legal status and possibly citizenship, illegal immigrants already here would have to demonstrate they had been working, pay a $500 fine, learn English and undergo a criminal background check, among other provisions. Unlike previous proposals in Congress, they would not have to return to their homeland first, something known as ''touchback.''
 The measure also calls for additional training and equipment for border guards, though not the hiring of new ones, and would require the Homeland Security Department to improve immigration jails and eliminate a program that deputizes local and state officers as immigration agents.
 The bill lacks a broad program championed by many Republicans, as well as Democrats including Mr. Obama, to address future labor demands and to better control the flow of immigration. To do that, they have advocated a program under which people could work only temporarily in the United States and then return home. Instead, the bill calls for a federal commission to study the best approach for the ''future flows of workers.''
 ''In order for immigration reform to be effective, it needs to be comprehensive,'' said Representative Jeff Flake, an Arizona Republican who collaborated with Mr. Gutierrez on previous immigration bills but not this one. ''Any bill without a temporary worker program is simply not comprehensive.''
 Senator Charles E. Schumer, Democrat of New York, is working with some Republicans on a separate bill that he has said could be ready whenever Mr. Obama asked for it. Administration officials, juggling the economic crisis, wars in Afghanistan and Iraq and a divisive fight over health care, have resisted promising a specific timetable.

HEADLINE: Second City Looks Back In Laughter

BYLINE: By LARRY ROHTER

DATELINE: CHICAGO 

 BODY:
On a frigid Wednesday night in December 1959, a revolution in comedy began here, almost unobserved. In a partly refurbished Chinese laundry in a bohemian neighborhood, a small improvisational troupe calling itself the Second City took to the stage for the first time to satirize the foibles of the Eisenhower era for an audience of barely 100, with a few bentwood chairs the only props. 
 Since that initial Dec. 16, millions have attended Second City shows or watched the troupe's scores of alumni on television or in films. Second City is often likened variously to a comedy factory, farm team, finishing school or ''Harvard of humor,'' and its graduates include Alan Arkin and Joan Rivers from the early years, Bill Murray, Chris Farley and Mike Myers from later eras and Tina Fey and Stephen Colbert more recently. 
 Now ensconced in larger quarters just down the street in Old Town, but with the same style of chairs still onstage, Second City commemorated its 50th anniversary over the weekend with shows, parties and panel discussions that, more than one performer said, ''felt like a high school reunion.'' Highlights will be broadcast as a TBS special next June and will soon be posted at the troupe's Web site, secondcity.com. But with the entertainment industry struggling to adapt to shifting tastes and new modes of expression, the gathering also served another purpose: to underline how the conception and execution of what is considered funny has changed, thanks to Second City. 
 At the time of the company's birth, the dominant style in American comedy was stand-up, often with a strong dollop of borscht-belt shtick. From the start, Second City stood in contrast to that approach: it emphasized an ensemble, not the individual performer; improvisation rather than a written routine; sketches instead of jokes; and intellectual rather than slapstick humor.
 ''We came from the theater, and that affects the way you act, construct your scenes and think about your audience,'' Bernard Sahlins, the only surviving founder of Second City, said in an interview on Friday. In those early years, he added, when he auditioned performers, ''I would sometimes ask, 'Have you read Dostoyevsky? Who is the secretary of agriculture?,' because I wanted us always to be playing at the top of our intelligence.''
 Today few Second City sketches run as long as the 10 to 12 minutes that were not uncommon a half-century ago (audiences weaned on television are less patient), and there are more likely to be curse words and references to television than to 19th-century Russian literature. But the environment in which the troupe operates has changed even more drastically, which affects the expectations of the performers. 
 In those early years ''comedy was not the economic commodity that it is now, and you weren't practicing it for that reason,'' said David Steinberg, who was part of a mid-1960s cast that also included Robert Klein and Fred Willard, went on to a successful stand-up career and today directs television shows. ''It was a different kind of commitment then. We were all misfits, outsiders, University of Chicago dropouts, connecting as a group, a community. There was no plan, no other goal, no thought of getting a show or a series or doing anything other than this.'' 
 Nowadays a stint with Second City is often just a stage in a larger career strategy whose trajectory has been established by the example of all those successful alumni. A Second City credential can confer so much credibility that ''some people lie about it'' at auditions, said Tami Sagher, an alumna who has written for ''30 Rock'' on NBC and ''Psych'' on USA and appeared in ''Curb Your Enthusiasm'' on HBO and the film ''Knocked Up.'' What transformed Second City into an institution with national reach was ''Saturday Night Live.'' The original cast included three Second City alumni -- John Belushi, Dan Aykroyd and Gilda Radner -- and ever since then, the company has been such a permanent pipeline for that NBC show, supplying about two dozen performers and even more writers, that staff members here recall Mr. Sahlins growing glum or irritated every time Lorne Michaels, executive producer of ''Saturday Night Live,'' came to see a revue.
 But in retrospect, several of those who trod the path to ''SNL,'' as the show is often called, seemed to prefer the work they did at Second City. At a panel discussion Rachel Dratch, who left the show in 2006, said that she ''felt freer here'' in Chicago; Tim Kazurinsky, an early-'80s cast member, said ''SNL'' seemed ''a little bit toothless'' by comparison; and Horatio Sanz (on the air from 1998 to 2007) lamented that ''at 'SNL' you have to have the joke on the first page'' of a script, whereas Second City allowed the performer-writer to ''do what you wanted to do, to put in a 30-year-old reference and say, 'Deal with it.' '' 
 Second City's 50th anniversary occurs at a moment when the company's influence and prestige may be at a peak, even as television itself seems desperate to find new forms and approaches. Alumni of the troupe represent three of the most highly praised shows on the air right now: Steve Carell in ''The Office,'' Mr. Colbert on ''The Colbert Report'' and Ms. Fey on ''30 Rock.''
 Ms. Fey was not part of the weekend's events, though several other ''30 Rock'' actors and writers who also trained at Second City were, including Scott Adsit and Jack McBrayer. But an alumni reunion show on Saturday night included Mr. Colbert and Mr. Carell, who revived a surreal sketch in which they return to Mr. Colbert's Southern hometown only to find themselves transformed into elderly black women named Shirley and Sarah.
 The television show that probably most reflects a Second City sensibility, however, is ''Curb Your Enthusiasm,'' the Larry David series that has been nominated for 30 Emmys since 2000. Jeff Garlin and Shelley Berman, who play Mr. David's manager and father, are products of the Second City system, just like Mr. Steinberg, who has directed several episodes, and various guest stars. 
 '' 'Curb Your Enthusiasm' could not exist without Second City,'' Mr. Garlin said at a panel discussion on Sunday. That comedy series works from an outline, not a detailed script, to encourage improvisation. ''It was always planned that way from the beginning, and that's Second City,'' he added.
 Over the years Second City has also become a commercial brand -- a notion that would probably have been fodder for the beatnik and hippie types who flocked to the troupe in its early years. It has national and international touring casts, has opened branches in places like Las Vegas and Detroit, has signed a deal a few years ago to provide comic troupes on Norwegian Cruise Line vessels, and organizes workshops for businesses on team building and communication skills. 
 In addition, thousands of people have enrolled in its courses that teach improvisation, and there is even a program in which college students receive credit for comedy studies. At one such class last week, undergraduates analyzed sketches on YouTube that ranged from Ernie Kovacs to the sitcom ''It's Always Sunny in Philadelphia.''
 Second City's newest venture is a unit that will specialize in short-form video, with offices in Chicago and Los Angeles and an eye to developing material that can be made into series. In the 1970s and '80s the Emmy-winning television show ''SCTV,'' with Martin Short, Catherine O'Hara, Harold Ramis, Eugene Levy and others largely from the Toronto branch, was an underground hit of sorts, and ''finding the brass ring a second time is where my head is at,'' said Andrew Alexander, Second City's chief executive. 
 ''For me, the growth now is in trying to get more on TV, which is a great way of promoting yourself,'' he added. ''We've gone the traditional road in developing TV shows and done pilots for everybody, but the stars never aligned, and now we are trying it a different way.''
 Onstage here, however, the original Second City ethos and approach continue strong. The current revue, the troupe's 97th, is called ''Taming of the Flu'' and pokes fun at political figures like Mayor Richard M. Daley of Chicago and the French president, Nicolas Sarkozy; includes a pointed skit on race and class; and has a third act that is totally improvised. 
 ''What drew me here in the first place was a renegade, anti-establishment attitude that I connected with,'' said Brad Morris, a member of that cast. ''This is still a place where you can do whatever the hell you want, and if you do it right, when you leave here, you can write, act and even direct. Nobody here is ever a one-trick pony.''

HEADLINE: G.E. to Focus On Energy And Health Care

BYLINE: By THE ASSOCIATED PRESS

 BODY:
General Electric's chief executive, Jeffrey R. Immelt, said Tuesday that the company was undergoing a renewal after what had been one of the most difficult years in its 117-year history. 
 Mr. Immelt said in his annual outlook session for analysts in New York that G.E. was focusing on sectors like energy and health care as it looked to its big industrial divisions to navigate out of the deep recession. It also plans to rely much less on its lending arm, GE Capital, for profits next year.
 Yet despite the shift in strategy, G.E.'s forecast for 2010 showed that the effects of the economic crisis would linger. Overall revenue and profit are expected to be largely flat next year at GE Capital and at the industrial divisions that make jet engines, power plant turbines and medical equipment.
 G.E. recently announced plans to sell its NBC entertainment division to Comcast, a move that will help it free up cash that Mr. Immelt said would be used to expand. He did not cite specifics, but G.E. is expected to have up to $26 billion in cash by the end of 2010.
 The financial crisis and global recession was a double blow for G.E. over the past year, as borrowers in areas like commercial real estate defaulted on loans and strapped customers pulled back on equipment orders.
 To save cash, G.E. was forced to cut its dividend by 68 percent, the first reduction since the Great Depression. It lost its top credit rating and issued most of its debt this year under a program that provided government backing. Its shares fell to a low of around $6 in the first quarter before recovering somewhat in the summer and fall.
 G.E. has made some significant changes to try to achieve stability during the turmoil.
 Its new mantra for GE Capital is ''safe and secure,'' meaning it is cutting the size of the unit that once generated 50 percent of all corporate profits and reducing its reliance on riskier investments. It is also pursuing government stimulus money.
 Stock in G.E., which is based in Fairfield, Conn., fell 20 cents, to $15.75.

HEADLINE: State Energy Plan Promotes Clean, Efficient Alternatives

BYLINE: By MIREYA NAVARRO

 BODY:
A New York State board has recommended a plan intended to make energy more affordable, efficient and environmentally friendly while helping to create jobs over the next 10 years, officials said. 
 The plan, released Tuesday by the State Energy Planning Board, is not binding, but Gov. David A. Paterson, who convened the board last year, said the recommendations will guide legislation he plans to pursue in the year ahead.
 ''New York will lead the nation in the clean energy economy, and this state energy plan will help us get there,'' Governor Paterson said in a statement. 
 The plan includes improvements in energy efficiency, more reliance on state energy supplies like natural gas and increased investment in clean-energy projects as a source of jobs.
 One initiative in the plan, which updates energy goals set in a similar report in 2002, calls for a new state building code that would require stricter energy efficiency standards. Another calls for disclosing energy use for buildings at the time of sale to encourage energy upgrades. The plan also calls for expanding solar and wind energy projects while doubling the state's production of natural gas, a less polluting fossil fuel than coal. 
 Thomas Congdon, the deputy secretary of energy for Governor Paterson and the board's chairman, said the plan was critical to the broad goal of meeting 45 percent of the state's electricity needs by 2015 by increasing its reliance on renewable energy and keeping a lid on overall demand. He said it emphasized energy efficiency more than previous blueprints and laid out a timetable for action by government agencies and lawmakers. 
 ''It's one of the most aggressive clean-energy targets in the country, with a very detailed implementation plan to get us there,'' he said.
 But while generally praising the plan's comprehensiveness, environmentalists and other supporters of the state's goals said that it fell short on setting specific targets, and some were skeptical about how much of it would end up being implemented. James Van Nostrand, executive director of the Pace Energy and Climate Center, said that 10 months after the governor announced his ''45 percent by 2015 goal,'' the State Public Service Commission has yet to take specific action to help finance some of the programs that would help meet that goal.
 ''In our experience New York has never had a problem identifying policy objectives,'' Mr. Van Nostrand said. ''It's just the implementation that is slow.''
 But some business groups said they were optimistic that some of their priorities would be addressed. They particularly welcomed the plan's embracing of legislation to establish a uniform statewide permit process to speed up the approval of applications for power plants. 
 Mr. Congdon said applications now have to meet the individual requirements of local governments, a process that has deterred or slowed dozens of proposals for new wind farms. But Paul Steidler, a spokesman for the New York Affordable Reliable Electricity Alliance, said many of the proposals were for natural gas plants, particularly after state officials finish drafting regulations for natural gas drilling on the Marcellus Shale.
 If the permit process were simpler, he said, ''you'd get quite a few proposals out of the gate.''

HEADLINE: Festiveness, Stacked Up Southern Style

BYLINE: By KIM SEVERSON

DATELINE: Hartford, Ala. 

 BODY:
 IN this corner of the country, where cotton and peanuts pay the bills and the Florida border is a morning's walk away, the worth of a cook can be measured in cake layers.
 All across the South at Christmas, layer cakes parade across virtually every sideboard. But in the small towns of southeast Alabama, they are more than holiday tradition. 
 They're currency, comfort and status. Everyone knows whose cakes are tender and whose consistently reach 12 layers or more.
 ''Three or four weren't nothing to brag about,'' said Franklin Peacock, who has been eating layer cake here since the 1930s. ''Five or six is about where you'd want to start talking about your cake.'' 
 Martha Meadows, 77, learned to bake 15-layer cakes from her mother, who cooked each layer one at a time in a cast-iron hoe-cake pan. The pan now lives in a kitchen cupboard in the small house in a cotton field between this town and Slocomb, Ala., where Mrs. Meadows has lived for 34 years. 
 Why 15 layers? ''That's just the way it comes out,'' she said. ''One time I got 17. Of course, I weren't trying.''
 Mrs. Meadows is a whirl of efficiency, using a stand mixer to prepare the yellow batter and rotating six cake pans in and out of the oven, frosting each layer with warm, boiled chocolate icing as the next batch bakes. The result is known as a little layer cake because the layers are thin. Baking and frosting one takes her two hours, she said, ''if you don't count the cleaning.''
 This Christmas season, she'll bake about 10, selling some to neighbors and donating others to her Baptist church.
 It's a relatively light year. Five years ago, she made 105 for Christmas. ''I'd never do that again,'' she said. 
 I was introduced to Mrs. Meadows by Franklin Peacock's son, the chef Scott Peacock, who was raised on southeast Alabama layer cake. He now lives in Atlanta, where he runs the Watershed restaurant, but he has recently been traveling home to record stories from cooks in their 80s, 90s and 100s for an oral history project. 
 He is forever bragging about the layer cakes from Hartford, his hometown. I met him in Alabama to see for myself.
 Especially at Christmas, the cake ladies of Alabama distinguish themselves with cakes whose recipes are a century old. To be sure, many Southern Christmas tables will hold red velvet or Italian cream cakes with cream cheese frosting, but those are Johnny-come-latelies, introduced in the 1960s and nothing like the old-fashioned layer cakes with tricky boiled icing.
 The little layer cake is perhaps the showiest of the extensive southern Alabama repertory. There is always a poundcake on the table at Christmas, as there often is year-round. And, usually, there is a fruitcake, like the simple ones with pecans and two kinds of dried fruit that the members of the Sardis United Methodist Church are making this season. A core group of about eight cranked out 1,000 of them, selling various sizes for $5 a pound. A couple of years ago, they made enough to buy a new grand piano for the church. Last year, the cakes helped pay to remodel the church kitchen.
 There is, of course, coconut cake with its fluffy frosting whipped from egg whites and boiled sugar, with fresh coconut pressed into its sides. And certainly, there are Lane cakes, made with an 1898 recipe named after Emma Rylander Lane of nearby Clayton, Ala., who called it her prize cake. The cake was a childhood favorite of President Carter, whose hometown of Plains, Ga., is a few hours' drive from Clayton. Harper Lee, who grew up in Monroeville, Ala., mentioned Lane cake in ''To Kill a Mockingbird.'' 
 The Lane cake is made with lots of egg whites, the yolks reserved for a rich filling of ground pecans, coconut and raisins flavored with bourbon or local wine. That makes it something of an illicit treat here in dry Geneva County, which is thick with non-drinking Baptists, some of whom substitute grape juice.
 Like many of these layer cakes, the Lane cake gets better with a little age. Some cooks still store theirs in a tin with cut apples, to keep it moist while the alcohol mellows and flavors meld.
 Lemon cheese cake is another lovely layer cake that makes economical use of yolks and whites. It's nothing like what a New Yorker thinks of as cheesecake. The ''cheese'' is really an eggy lemon curd piled between layers of cake made sturdy by egg whites. More lemon curd covers the whole cake, its layers visible beneath the slightly translucent jelly.
 Caramel cake is harder to come by. Its icing is demanding. The cook must take a half-cup of sugar to the edge of burning in a cast-iron skillet, boil it with more sugar, cream and butter and then beat it into a fluffy tan confection. The trick is to work fast so it doesn't set up before the cake is frosted. 
 ''That frosting is a demon,'' said Nancie McDermott, author of ''Southern Cakes.'' ''There's a reason people quit making that boiled frosting and went to confectioners' sugar. But that's what makes these cakes so special. It's really a dying art.''
 The same boiled frosting, but with cocoa instead of caramel, stars as the thin fudge-like coat of the chocolate little layer cake. In most of the South, even in other parts of Alabama, the cake is virtually unknown. 
 It does, however, show up in some interesting pockets. The chef Art Smith, who grew up in Florida a couple of hundred miles from Mrs. Meadows, made a 12-layer version for Oprah Winfrey. On the Outer Banks of North Carolina, a version with 14 marshmallows melted into the icing began appearing in the 1960s, apparently an import that came with women transplanted from other parts of the South, said Elizabeth Wiegand, author of ''The Outer Banks Cookbook.'' 
 The most strikingly similar cake I found is one made with a virtually identical recipe on Smith Island, a community of about 250 people off the coast of Maryland. Local bakers claim the Smith Island cake was developed in the 1800s by the wives of watermen who needed a sturdy layer cake on their boats during the long autumn oyster harvest.
 ''As Pee-wee Herman used to say, I love that story,'' said Ms. McDermott, who believes most of the tales surrounding layer cakes are charming but not true. ''There doesn't have to be a story. There can just be cake,'' she said. ''But it's like arguing about barbecue. It's fun. It's harmless.''
 No matter what their origins, Alabama layer cakes are worth trying. They are the perfect holiday confection -- difficult enough to be special but not so hard that a cook with a few free hours, a pantry of common ingredients and a little dedication cannot make one.
 I'm not much of a baker, so I took some lessons in Alabama. While the measurements were exact, the methods were sometimes vague. I asked Mrs. Meadows how long to beat the batter. ''It needs to be beaten a pretty good little bit,'' she said.
 How long should I cook the icing?
 ''When it gets to cooking, turn it down.'' 
 Many experienced cooks in the South assume that everyone knows how to bake. Virginia Willis, author of ''Bon Appetit, Y'all,'' sent me a coconut cake recipe she got from an 80-year-old family friend from Augusta, Ga. It begins: ''Make a yellow cake.''
 But the bakers I met were encouraging. They downplayed their own skill and promised me that success or failure sometimes have more to do with the phase of the Moon or the quality of a particular bag of flour than with skill.
 ''Mine are lopsided this morning,'' said Jean Strickland, 77, whose caramel cake in fact didn't look a bit lopsided the day I met her. Mrs. Strickland bakes about eight layer cakes a month for people who are too sick to make their own or for the old folks' home or, really, anyone in need.
 ''It's partly what I call my ministry,'' she said. 
 But it's also the best way she knows to make herself feel better.
 ''If you get down and out,'' she said, ''just get in the kitchen and bake a cake.''
 Recipe: Chocolate Little Layer Cake Adapted from Martha Meadows Time: 2 1/2 hours
 Adapted from Martha Meadows
 Time: 2 1/2 hours
 FOR THE CAKE:
 2 sticks butter, more to grease pans
 2 1/2 cups sugar
 1/3 cup shortening
 5 eggs 
 2 teaspoons vanilla
 5 cups flour
 1 teaspoon salt
 2 teaspoons baking soda
 5 teaspoons baking powder
 2 cups milk
 FOR THE ICING: 
 5 cups of sugar
 1/3 cup cocoa
 1 stick butter, cut into pieces
 1 15-ounce can evaporated milk
 1/2 cup whole milk
 2 teaspoons vanilla.
 1. Preheat oven to 400 degrees. Grease three 9-inch cake pans and line with rounds of parchment or waxed paper.
 2. In a mixer, cream together butter, sugar and shortening until fluffy, about 3 minutes. Beat in eggs one at a time and continue to mix on medium until eggs are well incorporated. Stir in vanilla.
 3. Sift flour, then add salt, baking soda and baking powder. Sift a second time. With mixer on low, alternately add flour mixture and milk in about 4 additions, then increase speed to medium. Beat until smooth, about 4 to 5 minutes, scraping down sides of bowl.
 4. Spread 3/4 cup batter in each pan. Bake 6 to 8 minutes, or until cake springs lightly when pressed with a finger. Flip cake out of pan onto paper towels or cake rack while still very warm. Repeat with second set of layers. 
 5. When first layers go into oven, start to make icing. Put sugar and cocoa in a deep, heavy-bottomed saucepan and mix well. Turn heat to medium-high and add butter and milks, bringing to a boil. Boil for about 4 minutes, stirring continually, careful to watch that it does not boil over. Lower heat to simmer, add vanilla and stir occasionally for another 7 to 10 minutes. If using a candy thermometer, cook to the point just before soft ball stage or about 230 degrees. 
 6. Begin icing first layers, still warm, when second batch is in the oven. Flip layers over so that top side faces up. Use about 4 tablespoons of icing per layer. Icing will be thin but will firm up as it cools. Stack layers, then continue icing and stacking as layers are baked. 
 7. When all layers are iced and stacked, glaze top and sides of cake. Contours of layers will be visible through icing. If icing hardens too much while frosting cake, set back on low heat and stir until it is spreadable.
 Yield: One 12-layer cake.

 Adapted from ''The Gift of Southern Cooking,'' by Scott Peacock and Edna Lewis (Knopf, 2003).
 Time: 2 hours.
 FOR THE CAKE: 
 1 cup (2 sticks) unsalted butter at room temperature, more to grease pan
 3 1/4 cups cake flour 
 2 1/4 teaspoons baking powder
 1/4 teaspoon salt
 2 cups granulated sugar
 8 egg whites
 1 cup milk
 2 teaspoons vanilla extract
 FOR THE LEMON CURD:
 2 1/4 cups granulated sugar
 3/4 cup plus 1 tablespoon fresh lemon juice
 3/4 cup (1 1/2 sticks) unsalted butter, melted 
 12 egg yolks
 3 tablespoons finely grated lemon zest
 1/2 teaspoon salt.
 1. Preheat oven to 350 degrees. Grease three 9-inch cake pans and line with parchment or waxed paper. 
 Mix flour, baking powder and salt and sift onto a piece of waxed paper or parchment. 
 2. In a large mixing bowl, beat sugar and butter until light and fluffy, scraping sides as needed. Whisk egg whites until well blended but not foamy, and add to batter in 4 batches, making sure each addition is well incorporated. 
 3. Add dry ingredients and milk to batter, alternately, in 4 batches, mixing each only until just blended. Mix in vanilla.
 4. Divide batter among 3 pans. Gently drop each one on a counter to eliminate large air bubbles. Bake for about 20 minutes or until cake springs back in center when pressed or a cake tester comes out clean. Let rest for 5 minutes, then remove cake from pan and cool completely on rack.
 5. Meanwhile, make curd: Put all ingredients in a non-reactive saucepan and whisk to blend. Set over medium heat and cook, stirring constantly, until filling thickens and a candy thermometer registers 170 degrees. This can take 10 to 15 minutes. Do not let filling simmer or boil. Remove from heat and pour into a bowl to cool to room temperature.
 6. Place a cake layer on a cake stand or plate and spread 2/3 cup curd on top to the edges. Stack another layer and continue until all layers have been used. Use remaining curd on top and sides. Filling is somewhat translucent, so layers will be visible through curd on sides. If layers slide while frosting, push 3 or 4 long wooden skewers through them to hold until cake sets. Cake is best left covered at room temperature overnight.
 Yield: One layer cake.

HEADLINE: With a Front-Row View of Poverty, She Needed Help

BYLINE: By JENNIFER MASCIA

 BODY:
For more than half her life, Yolanda Clinkscales has balanced a full-time job with the demands of motherhood, and in all that time she has never needed a handout. 
 A longtime employee of the city's Department of Homeless Services, Ms. Clinkscales, 45, already knew how easily a person could slip into poverty. Then it happened to her.
 When she needed surgery and quickly used all of her sick days, she had to take an unpaid six-week leave and found herself in the uncomfortable position of asking for money. Though she earns $2,126 a month as a clerical associate -- one of dozens of positions she said she has held at the department -- she quickly fell behind on rent. She pays $774 for the subsidized two-bedroom Hamilton Heights apartment she shares with her son Shaquille White, 12, just seven blocks from where she grew up. 
 An aunt stepped in and lent her $2,000 for back rent -- ''She's letting me pay her back $200 a month,'' Ms. Clinkscales said -- but there was still the matter of a $609.31 Con Edison bill. 
 In April she approached the Carrera Program, an adolescent outreach program at Shaquille's charter school that has formed a partnership with the Children's Aid Society, one of the seven beneficiary agencies of The New York Times Neediest Cases Fund. Within days she received a $100 voucher for groceries from Pathmark; two weeks later the agency paid her electric bill. 
 When asked whether it was difficult to ask an outsider for financial help, she nodded solemnly. 
 ''Sometimes you have to put your pride aside,'' she said. 
 Though she is still hindered by sciatica, bursitis and a herniated disc, ailments that forced her to take another unpaid week in June, Ms. Clinkscales regularly tends to a gaggle of nephews and grandchildren, who treat her apartment as their local headquarters. On any given afternoon she will come home from work to find rambunctious pint-size relatives scampering in and out of her living room.
 ''My sister lives on the sixth floor, and my mom lives on the fifth floor,'' she said in gravelly tones as she bounced her 21-month-old grandson, Misoun, on her knee, her eyes sparkling. He climbed off her lap and began stomping repeatedly on one of her sofa pillows. ''They use my son's room as a playroom,'' she said of her grandson and his cousins. 
 Though Shaquille's bedroom -- with its bunk beds, sky-blue walls and posters of Bow Wow and Shaquille O'Neal, after whom he was named -- is the main draw for his cousins, the centerpiece of Ms. Clinkscales's tastefully decorated living room is Shaquille's collection of trophies, some three dozen in all, dating from age 6 and commemorating victories in football, baseball and basketball. Half a dozen medals are slung around the trophies, and plaques line the wall. 
 Though her son is an avid athlete, Ms. Clinkscales said he really wants to be a reporter. ''Ask Shaquille and he'll be able to tell you any story -- on the block, at the precinct,'' she said. ''We call him 'Eyewitness News.' ''
 Shaquille then bounded inside, slightly out of breath. Shy and quiet, Shaquille suffers from cognitive delays, necessitating placement in a special education program. (Ms. Clinkscales's older son, Michael Clinkscales, 27, a former employee of Yankee Stadium, is currently unemployed.)
 Though her brush with financial distress appears to be behind her for now, Ms. Clinkscales is always mindful of those for whom she struggles to find shelter every day. Though she said she was always kind to her clients, she now has a special understanding of their predicament.
 ''It doesn't pay to be nasty,'' she said. ''We are all one paycheck from being homeless.''

HEADLINE: Health Care Talks Show Sharp Democratic Divide

BYLINE: By SHERYL GAY STOLBERG and ROBERT PEAR; David M. Herszenhorn contributed reporting.

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
As the battle over health care lurches toward a conclusion, President Obama is confronting an increasingly sharp divide on the Democratic left, with liberals in the Senate and the House split on a critical question: How much of what they want is enough?
 In the Senate, where time is running out for Democrats to meet the president's deadline of passing a bill by Christmas, liberals signaled on Tuesday that they would hold their noses and vote for a version of the measure that would strip out some of their most cherished provisions, including an expansion of Medicare and the possibility of a government-run insurance plan.
 But the House seemed unwilling to fall in line. The majority leader, Representative Steny H. Hoyer of Maryland, said flatly on Tuesday that the House would not ''simply take the Senate bill'' and adopt it unchanged. 
 And Howard Dean, the former Vermont governor and presidential candidate who is a respected voice among liberals, stirred the pot on the Democratic left by saying, ''the best thing to do right now is kill the Senate bill'' and start over. 
 At the White House, Mr. Obama declared himself ''cautiously optimistic'' after a meeting with the entire Senate Democratic caucus, where he urged senators to put aside their differences and ''seize the moment,'' to pass a measure that would extend health coverage to 30 million uninsured Americans.
 ''Now, let's be clear,'' Mr. Obama said after the hourlong private meeting. ''The final bill won't include everything that everybody wants. No bill can do that. But what I told my former colleagues today is that we simply cannot allow differences over individual elements of this plan to prevent us from meeting our responsibility to solve a longstanding and urgent problem for the American people.''
 The meeting underscored the sense of urgency for Mr. Obama, who has made passing a health care overhaul his highest legislative priority. He is leaving on Thursday night for Copenhagen to attend a conference on climate change, and he acknowledged that ''there are still disagreements that have to be ironed out'' and ''work to be done in the next few days.''
 In the Senate, Democratic leaders said they were confident they could resolve those disagreements because liberals seemed willing to make concessions to get a bill passed. The latest version of the Senate legislation omits a new government-run insurance plan to compete with the private sector, and the expansion of Medicare to allow people as young as 55 to buy into it.
 ''We are very disappointed,'' said Senator Sherrod Brown, Democrat of Ohio, who is a leading liberal in the Senate. Still, Mr. Brown said, ''I'm going to vote for the bill -- there's too much at stake.''
 Speaking to reporters after the White House session, the No. 2 Democrat in the Senate, Senator Richard J. Durbin of Illinois, cast the liberals' dilemma this way: ''Many of us who are on that side of the caucus really felt we had to weigh on balance what remains. And what remains is dramatic, and we just don't want to lose the opportunity, the once-in-a-lifetime opportunity.''
 The Senate majority leader, Harry Reid of Nevada, is still putting the bill together, but he and other leading Democrats sounded confident after the session with Mr. Obama that they would get the 60 votes they need to overcome staunch Republican opposition. Mr. Reid sketched out a timeline in which he would move Friday to bring the debate to a close and would hold final votes on the bill on Dec. 23 or 24.
 Senator Max Baucus, Democrat of Montana and chairman of the Finance Committee, said: ''We don't have 60 votes locked in yet. But we will get 60.'' 
 In the House, though, liberals were none too pleased. Representative Lynn Woolsey, Democrat of California and co-chairwoman of the Congressional Progressive Caucus, said it would be ''very difficult'' for her to vote for legislation that does not include a government plan, dubbed a public option, or a Medicare buy-in.
 ''Without that and without any public option, I don't see what we are offering the American people,'' Ms. Woolsey said. ''We are not offering any significant competition to the insurance industry. Premiums could skyrocket.''
 As Democrats debated among themselves, Republicans made clear that they would fight the bill every step of the way in the Senate. ''Our Democratic friends are about to walk off a political cliff here,'' Senator Lindsey Graham, Republican of South Carolina, said Tuesday. ''Do we really want to change one-sixth of the economy without a single Republican vote?''
 One Republican being courted by the White House, Senator Susan Collins of Maine, said Tuesday that she could not vote for the measure in its current form. ''This bill is getting better,'' she said, ''but it's still too deeply flawed for me to support it.'' 
 Other issues flared Tuesday as well. The Senate rejected a bipartisan proposal to allow imports of prescription drugs from Canada and other countries where prices are often lower; the provision fell 9 votes short of the 60 needed. The Senate also turned down a Republican effort to revise the bill to eliminate any tax increases for individuals with incomes less than $200,000 a year and for couples with incomes less than $250,000. At the same time, Democrats are trying to negotiate a compromise on abortion coverage that would help win the vote of Senator Ben Nelson, Democrat of Nebraska.
 At the White House session, Mr. Obama tried to appeal to lawmakers' sense of history. Mr. Baucus, who took notes on a paper napkin, quoted the president as saying: ''This is the moment of our legislative lifetimes. This is why people run for public office, to be here at the creation of something really big.''
 Just how big, though, remains an open question, especially among liberals in the president's party. The session was called after Senator Joseph I. Lieberman, independent of Connecticut, announced over the weekend that he could not vote for the measure unless the Medicare expansion was stripped from the bill. 
 Several people who attended the session recounted this exchange:
 ''What's happening is not any fun for me,'' Mr. Lieberman said. 
 Mr. Brown, who has championed the public option, turned to Mr. Lieberman and said, ''You know, Joe, it's not fun for us either.''
 At that point, Mr. Obama stepped in. 
 ''Why don't we all begin to have some fun?'' he said. ''Let's pass the bill.''

HEADLINE: The Accidental Empire of Fast Food

BYLINE: By GLENN COLLINS

 BODY:
CONSIDER, now, the not-so-fast-food rollout. Of the anti-chain chain.
 Indeed, to comprehend the prudent and eccentric global-expansion vision of Shake Shack, Danny Meyer's mini-chain of burger-and-custard stands, it is useful to consider the essence of contemporary American fast food. 
 ''The whole experience is to cram people into a cookie-cutter space, to feed them as many unhealthy calories as possible -- then get them to leave,'' said Mr. Meyer, the president of the Union Square Hospitality Group and the Yoda of Shake Shack. ''That stripping away of human experience? That is where fast food went astray.'' 
 Contrast and compare, then, with the three Shake Shacks in New York City, where patrons are cheerfully welcomed at the counter of a neighborhood-centered, urban-fantasy version of a burger roadhouse. On the menu? Whole-muscle, no-trimmings, fresh-ground, antibiotic-and-hormone-free, source-verified-to-ranch-of-birth, choice-or-higher-grade Black Angus beef. 
 Furthermore, ''people have to wait in line just to place their orders,'' Mr. Meyer, 51, said on a recent afternoon. ''After that? They have to wait for us to cook their orders. And then? We hope they'll stay awhile, as they eat. To enhance the communal experience.''
 And since Mr. Meyer's team is on the case, the imminent proliferation of the concept -- four Shacks will open in 2010, and a long-range plan calls for even more -- will be persistent. Thoughtful. Considered. Crafted. Correct. In short, exactly what might be expected in a venture where the entire burger-management team honed its skills in three-star restaurants.
 And it's all so Danny. 
 ''A hamburger stand is a very democratizing amenity,'' he said. ''We hope that each new Shake Shack can become both a citizen of, and mirror of, their communities.'' 
 The Shake Shack rollout is precedent-shattering for the Union Square Hospitality Group. ''We've always resisted expanding anything, ever,'' Mr. Meyer said. ''We resisted offers in Las Vegas. We resisted reality TV shows. And it took six years with Shake Shack before we decided to go forth and multiply.''
 He has put David Swinghamer -- his longtime business partner -- in charge of the Shacking of America. As Mr. Swinghamer says of the ramp-up: ''This is not a formula that anyone else has, or would do.'' (Mr. Swinghamer had supervised the Blue Smoke barbecue restaurants, which Mr. Meyer would like to replicate, but others will lead that push.)
 If the deliberate pace of expansion hardly seems to suggest a world-domination strategy, nevertheless a global future is in Mr. Meyer's sights. Next year Shake Shack plans to plant its standard in Kuwait -- way beyond its well-worn subway stops. 
 Mr. Swinghamer said the Shack in Kuwait will be managed by Alshaya, a local company that handles 50 brands in the Middle East, including Starbucks, Dean & DeLuca and Le Pain Quotidien.
 In the United States, however, Shacks will not be franchised. Mr. Swinghamer said that ''in five years we could have 20, mostly up and down the East Coast.''
 Scheduled to open next year is an outpost on the ground floor of a Miami Beach building on Lincoln Road designed by the Pritzker Prize-winning Swiss architecture firm Herzog & de Meuron. (It designed the bird's nest stadium at the Beijing Olympics.)
 Another new Shack will land at Prince and Mulberry Streets, to be opened this spring. 
 On the Upper East Side, Mr. Swinghamer has leased a ground-floor space next door to the Barnes & Noble on the southeast side of East 86th Street near Lexington Avenue. 
 It is to open sometime next year, around the time another Shack will make its debut in the theater district at the southwest corner of 44th Street and Eighth Avenue, Mr. Swinghamer said. 
 Schnipper's Quality Kitchen, three blocks south at 41st Street and Eighth Avenue -- whose menu includes premium burgers -- seems sanguine about the impending Shack. 
 ''We serve a much more varied menu,'' said Andrew Schnipper, its chief executive, who is also looking for more locations. 
 Mr. Swinghamer professes not to see competition with Schnipper's. ''All boats rise with the tide,'' he said. 
 Shake Shack has also been trying to transplant its Noo Yawk sensibility to an octagonal outpost on the Boston Common (in a crumbling former men's room). So far Bostonians have mostly greeted the prospect with snark. Some said that since hometown milkshakes are called frappes, the interloper might more properly be emblazoned with the words Frappe Shack. 
 Mr. Swinghamer said Boston Common is still on his radar. After all, Mr. Meyer brought a Chicago-style hot dog -- celery salt, sport peppers and all -- to condescending Manhattanites. 
 Mr. Meyer's accidental empire began with a hot dog cart in 2001, part of an art installation in Madison Square Park. ''To our astonishment, every day, a line would form,'' Mr. Meyer said. The cart expanded into a burger stand, ''and none of us had any idea that that could be a success.''
 The Shake Shack prototype cost a bit shy of $1 million, even though the prefabricated building, designed by James Wines, ''arrived like the falling house'' among the Munchkins, Mr. Meyer said. ''One day it wasn't there? And the next day it was there.'' 
 In future, Mr. Swinghamer said, each new Shack will cost over $1 million and will be in what he called ''special places in each community.'' 
 Thus, the popular Shack satellite at Columbus Avenue and 77th Street ''is across from a museum and has a distinctive glass 'sidewalk shed' that is an indoor cafe,'' said Randy Garutti, chief operating officer of Shake Shack. 
 And at Citi Field in Flushing, Queens, home of the New York Mets, Shake Shack is crowned by the beloved skyline silhouette that once topped the demolished Shea Stadium scoreboard. 
 Mr. Meyer said that keeping a sense of community was one challenge in expanding the Shacks, along with maintaining the original's quality, hospitality and ''glint in its eye.'' He referred to the bad puns that he seems to favor, such as the fall ''Shacktoberfest,'' and the winter ''Have Yourself a Merry Little Custard.''
 The Union Square Hospitality Group does not discuss revenues, which have been estimated at $70 million by trade publications. 
 Shake Shacks ''are profitable,'' Mr. Meyer said. ''They don't need a robust economy to work. They have a highly focused menu. They are replicable. There is no reservation operation. There is no florist. And it's a fun thing.'' 
 The premium burger market ''is a really hot niche,'' said Malcolm M. Knapp, who heads a restaurant consulting firm in Manhattan that bears his name. 
 He said of Shake Shack: ''They can make a lot of money. Burgers are not only American comfort food, but they are also American ethnic food.'' This is why ''Americans go abroad hankering for a burger,'' Mr. Knapp said, and why a global premium-burger strategy could be well received. 
 The popularity of the Shake Shacks has been wildly beyond expectations, partly due to their humble order average of $13, ''perfect for this economy,'' Mr. Swinghamer said.
 Remarkably, with more than $4 million in yearly sales, each of the Manhattan Shacks outdistances both premium and mass-market burger chains. McDonald's, for example, has an average of $2.29 million in yearly revenues from each of its 13,958 outlets, according to Technomic, a Chicago-based restaurant consultant. The Shacks also outdo a premium-burger legend, the Virginia-based Five Guys Burgers and Fries; its 535 stores each average $1.03 million in sales. 
 Some customers think the Shack rollout is long overdue. ''The quality is there, so if they don't screw it up, they'll be O.K.,'' said Sandy Hawkins, a 61-year-old inventor from TriBeCa who was consuming his Shackburger under heat lamps on a recent frigid afternoon in Madison Square Park. 
 So how fast and how far can the Hospitality Group take this? Five Guys began franchising only in 2003, and has now ballooned to 535 stores. ''Our focus is not on how many you do,'' Mr. Swinghamer said bluntly. ''If we can't do it right? We won't do it.''
 Mr. Meyer commented that ''we will grow as broadly as we can, without losing the quality, the hospitality, the community. And the sense of humor.''

HEADLINE: Production Gains in U.S. Offer Hope for More Hiring

BYLINE: By JAVIER C. HERNANDEZ

 BODY:
From steel making to mining, American industries posted higher-than-expected gains in production in November, the Federal Reserve said Tuesday, offering some hope that manufacturers would soon begin to accelerate their output.
 But many factories were still operating below capacity, economists noted, and the gains could disappear if spending by American consumers remained weak.
 ''Positive momentum is building, but at this point a broad-based economic recovery has yet to materialize for American industries,'' said Dave Huether, chief economist for the National Association of Manufacturers. ''The recovery is still fragile and in the beginning stages.'' 
 Federal Reserve policy makers are expected to weigh the data on production, as well as a separate report released Tuesday showing an increase in wholesale prices, when they meet to set interest rates on Wednesday. But despite an increase in production and prices, many economists say they believe that inflationary pressures remain in check and that the Fed will leave rates unchanged.
 Over all, industrial production rose 0.8 percent in November -- the largest increase since August -- outpacing expectations. Capacity utilization, which measures how much of the nation's production capability is in use, remained at 71.3 percent, far below the historical average of 80.9.
 Fed officials have said in recent weeks that the large amount of excess capacity in the economy will keep inflation under control. 
 The rise in industrial production suggested companies were backing off efforts to rid their shelves of excess goods and switching into production mode to keep up with orders. The shrinking value of the dollar has helped nurture demand abroad for products like computers and machinery. But economists say they believe that gains in production cannot be sustained only by rising exports: American consumers must increase spending.
 ''We're not going to go back to the high-flying, debt-based spending we had this last decade,'' said Daniel J. Meckstroth, chief economist for Manufacturers Alliance/MAPI. ''But you have to have a moderate pace of growth in consumer spending.''
 Mr. Meckstroth said it would probably take three years before manufacturing returned to its pre-recession levels. 
 Even as production ramps up, hiring remains weak. Many companies face increasing costs, placing limits on how much they can spend on workers and equipment. Wholesale prices on products as diverse as trucks and vegetables climbed 1.8 percent in November, according to a Labor Department report released Tuesday, in large part because of a surge in fuel costs. 
 Analysts had predicted a more modest increase of 0.8 percent, and several economists said the next several months would probably show less significant gains as energy prices stabilized. Still, the government recorded the first year-over-year increase in prices since the height of the financial crisis a year ago. 
 At a time when 15.4 million Americans are feeling the squeeze of unemployment and businesses are struggling to regain their footing, companies may find themselves unable to pass the higher prices along to consumers.
 ''It's going to complicate the lives of businesses a lot,'' said Nariman Behravesh, chief economist for IHS Global Insight. ''I don't think it will derail the recovery, but it's a problem that could slow down hiring if they can't pass these costs down.''
 Rising oil prices led the gains, with the cost of gasoline increasing 14.2 percent. Even after energy and food costs were excluded, the index rose 0.5 percent, the largest increase since October 2008, lifted by a 4.2 percent increase in the cost of light trucks and sport utility vehicles and a 2.6 percent rise in cigarettes.
 A separate index on manufacturing in New York State fell to its lowest level since July, after four months of steady increases. The number of factory employees also fell.

HEADLINE: Delegates at Talks Scramble as Gulf on Issues Remains

BYLINE: By TOM ZELLER Jr.; John M. Broder, James Kanter, Andrew C. Revkin and Elisabeth Rosenthal contributed reporting.

DATELINE: COPENHAGEN 

 BODY:
Impatience was clearly rising Tuesday at global climate negotiations here as delegates struggled without success to surmount disputes over issues like emissions targets and financial aid for developing countries. 
 With less than four days left in the two-week conference, a new draft negotiating text circulating among delegates reflected the wide gulf over those issues and others like monitoring emissions of heat-trapping gases. The United States and China remained at a tense impasse over China's refusal to accept international monitoring on its turf. 
 Yvo De Boer, the chief United Nations official running climate talks, warned that talks were moving too slowly. Carrying an orange-and-white life ring to his midday news conference to make his point, he nodded to the challenge of balancing the needs of the nearly 200 countries involved. 
 ''This process is not about ramming the interests of the few down the throats of the many,'' he said. ''This process is about many trying to address all interests.'' 
 Mr. De Boer cited disputes between large and small, rich and poor, vulnerable and resilient, on layered issues ranging from protecting forests to paying to bring more energy choices to places that hardly have any.
 Todd Stern, the chief climate negotiator for the United States, also warned that was ''a great deal left to do.''
 ''The parties are still far apart on a fair number of issues,'' he said.
 As world leaders began making their way to Copenhagen for an uncertain conclusion to the two-week talks, protesters and police also clashed on the streets. For the first time since the two-week conference began, law enforcement officers used tear gas to disperse crowds of rioters, who were reportedly lobbing small firebombs, a police spokesman said Tuesday.
 Nearly 200 more arrests were made Monday night as the protesters, angered by the lack of progress in negotiations, set fire to makeshift barricades in Copenhagen's Christiania neighborhood.
 Prime Minister Gordon Brown of Britain was expected to arrive Tuesday afternoon, two days ahead of schedule, in an effort to move the talks forward. The Danish presidency of the conference asked nations to pair up -- one from a developing country, and one from an industrialized nation-- and seek jointly to push other countries to make progress on some of the most difficult issues that still must be resolved.
 Ed Miliband, Britain's secretary of state for climate change, for example, will team up with the Ghanaian environment minister, Hani Sherry Ayittey, to lead group talks aimed at ensuring that enough money is put on the table for poor countries. Poorer nations say they need a robust long-term financing commitment from developed nations to cope with climate changes they did not cause, like rising seas.
 Mr. Miliband and Ms. Ayittey ''will be undertaking intensive consultations aimed at breaking through the deadlock on one of the toughest issues on the table in Copenhagen,'' the British government said.
 At his midday news conference, Mr. De Boer said, ''What makes this process complicated is that you have small island nations who are about to disappear because of sea level rise, you have oil producers who are legitimately concerned about the future of their economy, you have major industrialized nations who are afraid they will lose jobs and you have major developing countries whose overriding concern is economic growth and poverty eradication.'' 
 Speaking at the conference, Al Gore, the former vice president and climate campaigner, called on President Obama and the United States Senate to set a deadline of April 22 -- the 40th anniversary of the first Earth Day -- for passage of a climate change bill to improve the chances of a binding global treaty next year. 
 When contacted, a senior administration official refused to be pinned down to a date but said, ''We'll do everything in our power to move it as quickly as possible.''
 Mr. Gore also called for a climate summit meeting next July in Mexico City -- six months before a meeting already planned there -- to advance efforts toward a treaty on climate change, Bloomberg News reported.
 On Tuesday morning, lines of government delegates and representatives of environmental organizations seeking access to the conference already stretched several hundred yards outside the venue's main entrance. 
 The United Nations, which is sponsoring the talks, said in an e-mail statement on Tuesday that more than 45,000 people had applied to attend the conference -- three times the capacity of the building
 ''An overwhelming number of those who applied arrived on Monday, causing congestion in the area outside the U.N. venue, which is under the control of the Danish police,'' the statement said.

PERSON: Oral Roberts 

HEADLINE: Oral Roberts, Fiery Preacher With Vast Empire, Dies at 91

BYLINE: By KEITH SCHNEIDER; Laurie Goodstein contributed reporting.

 BODY:
Oral Roberts, the Pentecostal evangelist whose televised faith-healing ministry attracted millions of followers worldwide and made him one of the most recognizable and controversial religious leaders of the 20th century, died Tuesday in Newport Beach, Calif. He was 91.
 The cause was complications of pneumonia, said Melany Ethridge, a spokeswoman for Mr. Roberts. He died at a hospital in Newport Beach, where he lived.
 At the height of his influence, Mr. Roberts sat at the head of a religious, educational and communications enterprise based in Tulsa, Okla., that managed a university that bears his name, mounted healing ''crusades'' on five continents, preached on prime-time national television and published dozens of books and magazines. 
 He was the patriarch of the ''prosperity gospel,'' a theology that promotes the idea that Christians who pray and donate with sufficient fervency will be rewarded with health, wealth and happiness. Mr. Roberts trained and mentored several generations of younger prosperity gospel preachers who now have television and multimedia empires of their own. Mr. Roberts was as politically conservative as his contemporaries in what became known as the ''religious right,'' but he was known more for his religious style than for his political pronouncements. He was widely lampooned after he proclaimed on his television program in 1987 that God would ''call him home'' if he did not raise millions.
 By 1985, the Oral Roberts Evangelistic Association and Oral Roberts University employed more than 2,300 people and earned $110 million in revenue. The expanse of Mr. Roberts's ministry, coupled with his fiery preaching, tycoonlike vision and jet-set lifestyle, also attracted persistent questions throughout his career about his theology and his unorthodox fund-raising techniques, although no credible evidence of malfeasance was ever produced on his watch. 
 His university later fell into debt, however, and his son, Richard Roberts, was forced to leave his post as head of the university in 2007 after he was accused of using university funds for personal luxuries. 
 Oral Roberts, who rose from stifling poverty and a nearly fatal case of tuberculosis as a teenager, rarely fought back in public. He was convinced, he said, that God had spoken to him directly as a young man and had ordered him on the path -- pursued with uncommon entrepreneurial energy -- to ''put Jesus into my focus at the center of all my thoughts, my dreams, my plans, my accomplishments, my destiny and any legacy I might leave behind.''
 His influence derived from his intimate understanding of those who turned to him for worship. They were white and black and Hispanic, the poor and the ill, hard-working people who could not afford an abundance of material possessions but whose dreams of health and prosperity were tied to an abiding love of God.
 The rise of his ministry coincided with the development of television. Mr. Roberts was among the first American religious leaders to recognize and deploy this new communications tool to touch people, and he seized on its extraordinary national and global reach. It helped that he was a natural showman, capable of booming, florid oratory. But he could also be intimate and tender, relying on a homespun speaking style, a gentle touch and a deep knowledge of Scripture to connect with his followers, many of whom viewed him as heroic.
 He began his television career in 1954 by filming worship services conducted under a traveling tent, the largest of which held 10,000 people. He maintained that God worked in a miraculous way through his hands, and the peak of every service came when he seated himself like a prince on an elevated stage and worshipers gathered in a prayer line. One by one they paused before Mr. Roberts, spellbound, as his right hand gripped their bodies and he prayed for healing. 
 Leaders of the Roman Catholic Church in the United States and other religious denominations questioned the authenticity of the healing. In the mid-1950s, in a step that would become familiar, a group of Arizona ministers offered to pay $1,000 to anyone who had been healed by Mr. Roberts and could provide medical proof. They received no response. Still, thousands of Mr. Roberts's followers asserted that they had been cured by his hand alone. 
 On the first night of a 10-day crusade in Harrisburg, Pa., for example, a frail boy stricken by polio and epilepsy rose unsteadily to his feet after Mr. Roberts had touched him. Of his doubters, Mr. Roberts said at the time: ''I'll leave them to their theology. I'm out to save souls. I have more friends among doctors than among ministers.''
 Mr. Roberts's will to succeed, as well as his fame, helped to elevate Pentecostal theology and practice, including the belief in faith healing, divine miracles and speaking in tongues, to the religious mainstream. During the 1970s, Time magazine reported, his television program ''Oral Roberts and You'' was the leading religious telecast in the nation. 
 Oral Roberts University estimated that Mr. Roberts, its founder and first president, had personally laid his hands on more than 1.5 million people during his career, reached more than 500 million people on television and radio, and received millions of letters and appeals. Among those seeking counsel and prayer were Presidents John F. Kennedy, Richard M. Nixon and Jimmy Carter. John Lennon wrote a letter to Mr. Roberts in 1972 seeking forgiveness for publicly remarking that the Beatles were ''more popular than Jesus'' and asking him to ''explain to me what Christianity can do for me.''
 Mr. Roberts's prominence and will to succeed were important factors in building the Pentecostal and charismatic movements and combining them into the fastest-growing Christian movements in the United States in the 1980s and 1990s and, by 2000, the largest Christian movement in the world. ''No one had done more to bring the Pentecostal message to respectability and visibility in America,'' David Edwin Harrell Jr. wrote in ''Oral Roberts: An American Life'' (Indiana University, 1985). 
 Granville Oral Roberts was born on Jan. 24, 1918, in the countryside near Ada, in Pontotoc County, Okla. He was the youngest of four children, three of them boys, raised in frontier poverty by Ellis Roberts, a traveling Pentecostal preacher, and his wife, Claudius, who was part Cherokee. When he was 16, Mr. Roberts was found to have a case of tuberculosis so advanced that he was not expected to survive. While he was bedridden, a healing evangelist named George Moncey held worship services in a tent in Ada. On the car ride to Mr. Moncey's service, Mr. Roberts later recalled, he heard God talking to him. 
 ''It was as if I was totally alone,'' Mr. Roberts wrote in his autobiography, ''Expect a Miracle'' (Thomas Nelson, 1995), one of more than 50 books he wrote. ''Then I heard that voice I've heard many times since: 'Son, I am going to heal you, and you are to take my healing power to your generation. You are to build me a university and build it on my authority and the Holy Spirit.' ''
 At the end of the service, Mr. Roberts recalled, Mr. Moncey stepped in front of him, put his hand on the boy's head and commanded the disease to ''come out of this boy.'' 
 Mr. Roberts recovered fully and began a new life of prayer and preaching. He was 18 when he delivered his first sermon. That same year he met Evelyn Lutman Fahnestock, a schoolteacher. They married on Christmas Day, 1938. By then Mr. Roberts was two years into a 12-year career as a pastor in towns around the South and had studied at Oklahoma Baptist College and other religious universities. 
 In the late 1940s, Mr. Roberts said, he heard God speak to him again, urging him to ''be like Jesus and heal people as he did.'' He rented an auditorium in Enid, Okla., and held his first healing service. A turnout of 1,000 inspired him to resign his pastorate in Enid and move to Tulsa, where he founded the Oral Roberts Evangelistic Association and began an itinerant ministry of faith healing. 
 In 1963 he founded Oral Roberts University. Accredited in 1971, it now has about 3,000 students and is the largest charismatic Christian university in the world. 
 In 1978 he began building the City of Faith Medical Center, a 2.2 million-square-foot, $250 million assemblage. But its construction was challenged by Tulsa's existing hospital providers, who questioned the need. 
 The medical center's economic problems produced an indelible moment that seemed to distill the concerns about Mr. Roberts's practices that many of his opponents had long harbored. In early January 1987, on his television show, he made an appeal that tied his life to a $4.5 million fund-raising goal. 
 ''I'm asking you to help extend my life,'' he said. ''We're at the point where God could call Oral Roberts home in March.''
 The appeal was widely ridiculed by religious leaders and late-night television comedians. Mr. Roberts subsequently announced that he had met his goal, raising a total of $8 million, and that his life had been spared. The medical center closed in 1989. 
 Mr. Roberts's personal life was as prone to crisis as his career. Rebecca, his oldest child, and her husband, Marshall Nash, died in a plane crash in 1977. His youngest son, Ronnie Roberts, died of a self-inflicted gunshot in 1982. 
 Mr. Roberts's wife of 66 years, Evelyn, died in 2005. He is survived by a daughter, Roberta Potts, and a son, Richard Roberts, who succeeded him as president of Oral Roberts University and resigned in 2007, both of Tulsa; 12 grandchildren; and several great-grandchildren. 
 Mr. Roberts came out of retirement in 2007 to temporarily assume the largely ceremonial position of co-president of Oral Roberts University, after Richard Roberts took a leave of absence. In 2009, Oral Roberts addressed the Oklahoma State Senate, which had passed a resolution honoring him for his life's work.
 ''I'm 91 years of age, and I'll soon be going home to my heavenly father,'' he said. ''I look forward to that with great peace and joy, leaving behind my legacy to bless the people.''

 CORRECTION:
An obituary on Dec. 16 about the evangelist Oral Roberts referred incorrectly to the Pentecostal and charismatic movements. Collectively they had become the fastest-growing Christian movement in the world by 2000, not the largest Christian movement. A reader pointed out the error shortly after the article was published; this correction was delayed for research.

HEADLINE: As Goldman Thrives, Some Say an Ethos Fades

BYLINE: By JENNY ANDERSON

 BODY:
Just over a week ago, on the evening of Dec. 7, Lloyd C. Blankfein hosted a reunion of one of the most elite clubs in American finance: former partners of Goldman Sachs, the Wall Street giant he has led, with remarkable and controversial success, since 2006. 
 The gathering, held at the venerable New York Athletic Club, both celebrated Goldman's past and looked toward its future. What, Mr. Blankfein was asked, did he want his legacy to be?
 Mr. Blankfein replied that like his predecessors, he hoped to position Goldman Sachs to capitalize on whatever opportunities might arise during his tenure. As bland as that might sound, few on or off Wall Street have seized opportunities in these troubled economic times as skillfully as Mr. Blankfein.
 But as President Obama prods the financial industry to do more to help ordinary Americans -- he chided ''fat cat bankers'' on Sunday for increasing their pay -- some current and former Goldman executives say Mr. Blankfein has built a money machine that, while it still values its customers, culture and reputation, puts profits above all. 
 Interviews with nearly 20 current and former Goldman partners paint a portrait of a bank driven by hard-charging traders like Mr. Blankfein, who wager vast sums in world markets in hopes of quick profits. Discreet bankers who give advice to corporate clients and help them raise capital -- once a major source of earnings for Goldman -- have been eclipsed, these people said. 
 Mr. Blankfein has surrounded himself with a tight circle of executives drawn from Goldman's trading operation. Many of these executives, like Mr. Blankfein, cut their teeth in the commodities division, J. Aron & Company. Gary D. Cohn, Goldman's president, as well as the heads of the bank's asset management division, are J. Aron alumni. So is the head of human resources. 
 With the traders ascendant, Goldman's bankers are being urged to generate bigger profits. In what former partners called a significant shift, Goldman now uses ''profiles'' to track how much money its bankers are bringing in. 
 Granted, money is what makes Wall Street run, and Goldman Sachs is no exception. 
 ''I don't buy the argument that the old Goldman was more principled and less greedy,'' said Arthur Levitt, a Goldman adviser and former chairman of the Securities and Exchange Commission. 
 But even Goldman concedes it is changing with the times. ''This business is all about serving clients, and if you don't evolve, you die,'' said Lucas van Praag, a Goldman spokesman. 
 After first guiding Goldman through the near collapse of the nation's financial system and then deftly extricating his bank from a federal bailout, Mr. Blankfein is now presiding over one of the richest periods in the bank's 140-year history. Mr. Blankfein has accelerated a decade-long decline of Goldman's old partnership ethos, which was built around the principle that its bankers and traders can do well -- indeed, very well -- while putting their customers first, former partners said. 
 Some Goldman alumni worry that Mr. Blankfein is jeopardizing the culture of success that defined the bank for much of its modern history. They wonder if Goldman will become, as one former partner put it, ''just like every other bank on Wall Street'' -- that is, focused on short-term profits rather than long-term gains. 
 Publicly, Mr. Blankfein espouses the Goldman Sachs way. But privately, current and former partners say that he has fundamentally changed the way Goldman views its customers and the broader marketplace. The changes began when Goldman went public in the late 1990s, but have accelerated under Mr. Blankfein, they say. 
 None of these people were willing to speak out publicly about Goldman, which, for most of them, has been the source of sizable fortunes.
 Bowing to pressure from shareholders and the public to rein in runaway pay on Wall Street, Goldman announced last week that its top executives, including Mr. Blankfein, would forgo cash bonuses this year. Instead, the executives will be paid in the form of special stock -- an arrangement that, while eliminating big paydays this year, nonetheless may turn out to be enormously lucrative if Goldman's share prices rises in the future. 
 Even so, many Goldman employees are stunned by the public resentment directed at the bank in general and Mr. Blankfein in particular, who, after first steadfastly defending Goldman's profits and pay, recently offered a vague apology for ''mistakes'' that led to the financial crisis. 
 ''Would John Weinberg ever be in this situation?'' asked one former partner, referring to the legendary senior partner who ran Goldman for many years. ''No way. He would have thought about the firm over 50, 100 years, not what people will get paid this year.'' 
 Since the modern Goldman emerged during the Depression, its executives have cultivated a ruthless professionalism tempered by what might best be described as Goldman Sachs Exceptionalism: a sense that Goldman stands apart from, if not above, Wall Street rivals.
 This sense, strengthened by a tradition of government service among senior executives, runs deep inside the bank's headquarters at 85 Broad Street in Lower Manhattan. Indeed, from the day they arrive, employees are steeped in the firm's 14 principles. No. 1 is: ''Our clients' interests always come first. Our experience shows that if we serve our clients well, our own success will follow.''
 Almost from the start, however, two camps inside Goldman competed for profits and power: investment bankers and traders. 
 Today, the traders -- Mr. Blankfein's camp -- are firmly in power. While Goldman employs nearly 31,000 people, in business ranging from money management to traditional investment banking, the bank makes the bulk of its money from trading. Mr. van Praag said 50 percent of Goldman's revenue came from fees that it charged for services like investment banking. The other half is generated by Goldman, using its capital for itself and its clients. While Mr. Blankfein's traders are minting money, his investment bankers are being pressed to keep a closer eye on the bottom line. Bankers who once spent years cultivating corporate clients in hopes of one day landing lucrative work like advising on a big merger, are now being urged to squeeze more revenue from their customers. 
 In 2006, Jon Winkelried, a Blankfein lieutenant who was then Goldman's co-president, stunned some bankers by suggesting that the bank make more money from its powerful corporate customers. One goal was to have Goldman wear several hats in deals, for example, by advising on a merger, financing it and investing in the transaction. 
 Mr. Winkelried and executives under Mr. Blankfein changed the way investment bankers were measured. Goldman instituted banker ''profiles,'' a sort of daily profit and loss statement, to see how much business its employees and clients were doing. While such assessments have long been common elsewhere on Wall Street, Goldman disdained them until Mr. Blankfein became chairman and chief executive. 
 Mr. Winkelried, who has since left Goldman, declined to comment for this article. 
 The shift had two effects, Goldman bankers said: It focused employees on the customers who might generate the most money for Goldman, and it prompted bankers to fight more aggressively for credit for their deals. 
 ''It was more efficient,'' one former partner said. ''But it changed the way we ran the business.'' 
 Mr. van Praag, the Goldman spokesman, said that banker scorecards were traditionally used only for so-called relationship bankers, who cultivate customers over time. But starting in 2001, investment bankers became responsible for a wider array of products -- debt, complicated securitized products, and other types of financing -- and the new system kept a tally on all their activities, not just advisory work with clients. 
 The profiles update automatically with revenue tallies. Bankers may review them at any time. 
 Former partners said that while Goldman had always sought to maximize profits, the bank used to take a longer-term view. For instance, if a corporation that Goldman was advising decided against a merger, the bank would not necessarily drop the customer, figuring that it might reap profits from a deal in the future. 
 ''You probably had a little more tolerance for longer-term perspective,'' one former partner said. 
 Given Goldman's plans to pay out billions of dollars in bonuses this year, many outsiders might think the bank pays little attention to its public image. In fact, current and former executives say, Goldman is acutely aware of its diminished public standing. 
 But even people close to Goldman acknowledge that as long as the bank is making a lot of money, public opinion does not matter all that much. 
 ''Their reputation has suffered,'' Mr. Levitt said. ''So has every other financial institution. And I'd rather suffer the way Goldman suffers.'' 
 Still, Goldman's tarnished reputation has become a hot topic inside the bank. A few months ago, at a meeting of Goldman's in-house leadership program, known as the Pine Street Group, the bank's image came up. The group of 30-odd people wrestled with questions like how to talk to family members about Goldman and its role in the financial world. 
 Another question that came up was what to do if someone at a cocktail party started criticizing Goldman. Mr. van Praag, who ran the meeting, suggested that the executives should explain how Goldman made its money. But another Goldman executive offered a different answer: change the subject.

HEADLINE: China, Rushing Into Reactors, Stirs Concerns

BYLINE: By KEITH BRADSHER

DATELINE: SHENZHEN, China 

 BODY:
China is preparing to build three times as many nuclear power plants in the coming decade as the rest of the world combined, a breakneck pace with the potential to help slow global warming. 
 China's civilian nuclear power industry -- with 11 reactors operating and construction starting on as many as an additional 10 each year -- is not known to have had a serious accident in 15 years of large-scale electricity production.
 And with China already the largest emitter of gases blamed for global warming, the expansion of nuclear power would at least slow the increase in emissions. 
 Yet inside and outside the country, the speed of the construction program has raised safety concerns. China has asked for international help in training a force of nuclear inspectors. 
 The last country to carry out such a rapid nuclear expansion was the United States in the 1970s, in a binge of reactor construction that ended with the Three Mile Island accident in Pennsylvania in 1979. And China is placing many of its nuclear plants near large cities, potentially exposing tens of millions of people to radiation in the event of an accident.
 In addition, China must maintain nuclear safeguards in a national business culture where quality and safety sometimes take a back seat to cost-cutting, profits and outright corruption -- as shown by scandals in the food, pharmaceutical and toy industries and by the shoddy construction of schools that collapsed in the Sichuan Province earthquake last year.
 ''At the current stage, if we are not fully aware of the sector's over-rapid expansions, it will threaten construction quality and operation safety of nuclear power plants,'' Li Ganjie, the director of China's National Nuclear Safety Administration, said in a speech this year. 
 A top-level corruption scandal is already unfolding in the nuclear industry.
 In August, the Chinese government dismissed and detained the powerful president of the China National Nuclear Corporation, Kang Rixin, in a $260 million corruption case involving allegations of bid-rigging in nuclear power plant construction, according to official media reports. No charges have been reported against Mr. Kang, who is being held incommunicado for interrogation.
 While none of Mr. Kang's decisions publicly documented would have created hazardous conditions at nuclear plants, the case is a worrisome sign that nuclear executives in China may not always put safety first in their decision-making. 
 In contrast with its performance in industries like toys, China has a strong safety record in industries like aviation, which receive top-level government attention. 
 The challenge for the government and for nuclear companies as they increase construction is to keep an eye on a growing army of contractors and subcontractors who may be tempted to cut corners.
 ''It's a concern, and that's why we're all working together because we hear about these things going on in other industries,'' said William P. Poirier, a vice president for Westinghouse Electric, which is building four nuclear reactors in China. 
 Philippe Jamet, the director of the division of nuclear installation safety at the International Atomic Energy Agency in Vienna, said that China had welcomed foreign inspectors at its reactors and that ''they show pretty good operations safety.'' 
 But he added that the international agency was concerned about whether China would have enough nuclear inspectors with adequate training to handle the rapid expansion.
 ''They don't have very much staff, when you compare their staff with how many they will need,'' Mr. Jamet said. The agency accepted a Chinese request to send a team of international experts to the country next year to assess staffing and training, he added.
 In late October, Prime Minister Wen Jiabao ordered a quintupling of the safety agency's staff by the end of next year, to 1,000, according to United States regulators. Chinese officials did not respond to requests for confirmation.
 China has two rival state-owned nuclear power giants: the China National Nuclear Corporation, mainly in northeastern China, and the China Guangdong Nuclear Power Group, mainly in southeastern China.
 Western experts regard the Daya Bay nuclear power plant in Shenzhen, which mainly uses French designs and is run by China Guangdong Nuclear, as evidence that China can run reactors safely. A display case holds trophies the power plant won in global safety competitions.
 China National Nuclear likewise cooperates with international inspectors and has had no reported mishaps. But its roots are in a government ministry with close ties to the former Soviet Union, making it more of an enigma to most Western experts, and the corruption case has added to their concern. China National Nuclear was on track to grow faster than China Guangdong over the next decade. 
 China National Nuclear has sought to hush up the case involving the arrest of its president, deleting from its Chinese-language Web site even the most minor news releases that mentioned Mr. Kang. In a faxed response to questions, China National Nuclear made no mention of Mr. Kang, but emphasized that its plants met international standards. 
 The arrest of Mr. Kang, a member of the Chinese Communist Party's powerful Central Committee, can be seen as evidence of China's seriousness about safety. 
 Today, China's nuclear plants can produce about nine gigawatts of power when operating at full capacity, supplying about 2.7 percent of the country's electricity. Three years ago, the government set a goal of increasing that capacity more than fourfold by 2020.
 The government will soon announce a further increase in its targets, to 70 gigawatts of capacity by 2020 and 400 gigawatts by 2050, said Jiang Kejun, an energy policy director at the National Development and Reform Commission, the main planning agency. 
 Electrical demand is growing so rapidly in China that even if the industry manages to meet the ambitious 2020 target, nuclear stations will still generate only 9.7 percent of the country's power, by the government's projections.
 Bringing so much nuclear power online over the next decade would reduce the country's energy-related emissions of global warming gases by about 5 percent, compared with the emissions that would be produced by burning coal to generate the power.
 ''For anyone concerned about carbon dioxide emissions, it's heartening, but it's only a piece of the puzzle,'' said Jonathan Sinton, a China specialist at the International Energy Agency in Paris.
 China, which by most estimates overtook the United States in 2006 to become the largest emitter of greenhouse gases, is seeking sharp improvements in the energy efficiency of its economy. 
 But the economy is growing so fast that even if the country can meet its goals, total emissions will rise 72 to 88 percent by 2020, Mr. Sinton said.
 The challenge for China is to build and operate its nuclear reactors without the equivalent of the Three Mile Island accident, in which a reactor core partly melted and released radioactivity, or the Chernobyl disaster in the former Soviet Union in 1986, the world's worst civilian nuclear accident.
 China does not use the kind of reactor that exploded at Chernobyl. And engineers in China study the mistakes that poorly trained operators made at Three Mile Island.
 Liu Yanhua, a vice minister of science and technology, said China believed that its nuclear industry would continue to grow safely.
 ''So far,'' Mr. Liu said, ''there is no damage.''

HEADLINE: A Test for President Karzai

 BODY:
President Hamid Karzai's inaugural speech last month resonated with high-minded purpose. He vowed to end the ''culture of impunity'' and ''bring to justice'' those who threaten Afghanistan's future with predatory ways. Ministers in his government, he insisted, ''must possess integrity and be professionals serving the nation.'' 
 Whom Mr. Karzai chooses for his new cabinet will be the first indicator, after his fraud-marred election, of whether he is truly determined to rein in epidemic levels of corruption and incompetence. His speech on Tuesday to an anti-corruption conference in Kabul suggested, ominously, that he still does not get it.
 Mr. Karzai defended the mayor of Kabul, Abdul Ahad Sahibi, who was convicted earlier this month of misusing public funds and is facing other charges, including embezzlement, corruption and misuse of power. The president called Mr. Sahibi a ''clean person'' and demanded that his chief justice and attorney general look into the conviction, which is now on appeal. 
 Some members of the current cabinet, including the defense minister, Abdul Rahim Wardak, and interior minister, Hanif Atmar, deserve to stay. Mr. Karzai needs to bring in competent outsiders, such as Ashraf Ghani, a former World Bank official and presidential candidate. 
 Some top officials must go, starting with the minister of mines, Muhammad Ibrahim Adel, who is under investigation of taking a $30 million bribe. Mr. Karzai should also cut his ties with Gen. Abdul Rashid Dostum, a warlord and former Karzai military adviser whose forces have been accused of killing thousands of Taliban prisoners of war in 2001. General Dostum needs to stand trial. 
 Mr. Karzai should also distance himself from his brother, Ahmed Wali Karzai, a powerful provincial council member in Kandahar who is accused of protecting narcotics traffickers and also of being on the C.I.A. payroll.
 There is some good news. An anti-graft unit is starting up and some ministers are under investigation for embezzlement. But a lot more needs to be done, including streamlining government procedures so there are fewer chances for bribes.
 President Obama and his advisers dropped the ball badly when they failed to stop Mr. Karzai's supporters from trying to steal the election. Before the Afghan president chooses his new government, Washington must demand that he finally cut his ties with corrupt officials and choose men and women of integrity.

HEADLINE: Kraft Stands Firm on Its Cadbury Offer

BYLINE: By THE ASSOCIATED PRESS

DATELINE: LONDON 

 BODY:
Kraft Foods, the consumer products company, questioned the growth targets of its takeover target, Cadbury, on Tuesday as it stuck by its $:9.8 billion hostile bid for the British chocolate company. 
 Kraft suggested that it had no plans to raise the price of its cash-and-stock offer of $16.3 billion, despite a recent surge in Cadbury's share price that leaves the American company's offer well below current trading levels.
 Responding to Monday's start of formal defense documents by Cadbury, which seized the moment to play up its position as a strong independent company by raising its long-term performance targets, Kraft said it intended to maintain a ''disciplined approach.''
 ''We have heard nothing from Cadbury that surprises us,'' the chairman and chief executive of Kraft, Irene B. Rosenfeld, said in a statement. ''Cadbury's defense document only reinforces our belief that there is a compelling strategic and financial rationale to combining these two companies and that doing so would be in the best interest of both companies' shareholders.''
 Kraft, based in Northfield, Ill., said that Cadbury shareholders should consider how the company planned to meet its higher profitability forecasts without more spending on restructuring and how sales could accelerate amid low food price inflation.
 Cadbury, which also confirmed that it had received rival approaches from the Hershey Company and Ferrero International of Italy, lifted revenue growth to 5 to 7 percent a year, up from 4 to 6 percent, and forecast improved margins of 16 to 18 percent by 2013, up from the ''mid-teens.''
 The company also held out a carrot to investors of double-digit growth in dividends per share from 2010 onward.
 But some analysts have suggested those projections, at the top of the forecasts for the confectionary market, could be tough for Cadbury to achieve alone, and the company chairman, Roger Carr, left the door open for some kind of tie-up.
 The company's board is open to discussion with any potential suitor -- Kraft included -- that made a compelling offer, Mr. Carr said on Monday. But he added that no such offer was yet on the table and that Kraft's offer was a ''long, long, long way off.''
 As well as Hershey and Ferrero, analysts have suggested that Nestle may be interested, although the Swiss company has made no comment.
 Kraft has said it wants to get majority shareholder votes for its offer -- now worth $:7.27, or $11.82, a share -- by Jan. 5. But it can extend that deadline to Feb. 2 under British takeover laws, and has until Jan. 19 to raise its bid.

HEADLINE: Bernanke Tells Senate Panel Rising Inflation Is Unlikely

BYLINE: By REUTERS

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
The Federal Reserve chairman, Ben S. Bernanke, in a response to a lawmaker's questions made public Tuesday, said the United States economy was operating so far beneath its potential that inflation was unlikely to become a problem. 
 The response was to a question asked by Senator Jim Bunning, a Republican from Kentucky, at Mr. Bernanke's confirmation hearing for a second term.
 In the hearing before the Senate Banking Committee earlier this month, Mr. Bernanke came under fire both for failing to prevent the financial crisis and for overextending the central bank in an attempt to ease the banking sector's strains.
 Mr. Bernanke, in a written response received by Mr. Bunning's office on Monday, said high unemployment and idle factory capacity made it unlikely that inflation would post a rapid increase any time soon.
 ''The bulk of the evidence indicates that resource slack is now substantial,'' Mr. Bernanke wrote. His response was posted on Mr. Bunning's Web site.
 ''I continue to expect slack resources, together with the stability of inflation expectations, to contribute to the maintenance of low inflation in the period ahead,'' he said.
 The latest figures on producer prices outside the volatile food and energy sectors, published by the Labor Department on Tuesday, showed a surprising 0.5 percent spike, prompting a sell-off in both stocks and government bonds on inflation fears.
 Asked about market gyrations, Mr. Bernanke argued that the recent rise in gold prices, which have surged to above $1,200 an ounce, were not a sign of increasing inflation expectations.
 He also said he saw no sign of a bubble in the stock market, which has gained more than 60 percent from its March lows.
 The Senate Banking Committee will vote on the nomination of Mr. Bernanke to a second four-year term on Thursday, the panel said on Tuesday. If the committee approves Mr. Bernanke, his nomination will be considered by the full Senate.

HEADLINE: New York's Fiscal Crisis

 BODY:
A Legislature in Denial
 Gov. David Paterson of New York announced this week that the state will have to delay $750 million in scheduled payments to schools and local governments. It is a drastic step, but the governor, rightly, argues that he had no alternative. It was either that or watch the state slip $1 billion into the red. 
 Even to borrow that money, the governor and legislative leaders would have to declare a fiscal emergency before they could seek an expensive short-term loan. The Legislature, in denial, is refusing to do the hard work that's needed. 
 Mr. Paterson has gone for a delay in the hopes that tax revenues next month will be a little higher than projected. There is no guarantee that Wall Street bonuses or first signs of recovery will bring in enough cash to make it through to the end of the fiscal year in March. 
 Unless there are serious changes in the way New York spends and raises money, the state could be facing a $10 billion deficit next year. 
 New York is not alone in facing tough times. But for years, New York's Legislature has been spending beyond its means. The recession has made matters far worse. Mr. Paterson, who took office just as Bear Stearns collapsed in 2008, has been warning of calamity ever since. The Legislature has stubbornly refused to listen.
 Last month, the governor called lawmakers back to Albany to fill a $3.2 billion gap in this year's budget of $132 billion. The governor proposed painful cuts: including $113 million from the New York City-area public transit budget; $686 million in school funds, or about 3 percent per district with even larger cuts for wealthier districts; $470 million from health care spending. 
 The Democratic-majority Legislature balked. Lawmakers decreed there would be no midyear cuts in school budgets, not even for wealthy districts. Although they did improve the pension structure, legislators protected other programs like health care and shielded state workers from furloughs or layoffs. 
 They finally made some cuts, including a larger swipe at the Metropolitan Transportation Authority, but mostly they drained other savings accounts and used some of the federal stimulus dollars that were supposed to be saved for next year. 
 Even then, they only came up with $2.7 billion -- and were $500 million short. That left Governor Paterson no choice but to delay payments to schools cities and towns. Some of these schools have rainy-day funds, but Mr. Paterson should try to limit cuts for the poorer areas. Communities will have no choice but to pare down spending. 
 Legislative leaders -- from both parties -- need to wake up to the harsh reality. When the stimulus money is gone there will be no cushion, and there is no hidden cache of funds about to be discovered. 
 There is no chance of balancing next year's budget as required by law unless they are finally willing to make deep cuts, even in favorite programs, personal items to districts and especially those items backed by the state's most powerful education unions, and health care and business lobbyists. At this point, there is no other choice.
 Long Island's Fortress Mentality
 There may be some dire situation in which state senators from Long Island will stop insisting that their disproportionate share of state school aid must not be cut, delayed or in any way changed. Don't count on it.
 Despite the serious disaster that has hit the state's budget, the Long Island delegation has been behaving as it always has. They have opposed Gov. David Paterson's repeated efforts to get New York's finances in order, including his latest tactic of delaying $750 million in December payments, including aid to schools, to avoid insolvency this year. The naysayers include the usual Republican bloc, along with two newcomer Democrats with dicey re-election hopes, Craig Johnson and Brian Foley.
 Greedy parochialism is old news in Nassau and Suffolk Counties. Turn back to any year -- say, 1988, when this page was deploring how ''a pork-minded bloc of Republican senators'' known as ''the Long Island Eight,'' led by Ralph J. Marino of Muttontown, was holding a budget hostage over aid to local school districts.
 The state's convoluted school-aid formulas have long favored rich Long Island schools at the expense of those in New York City and other districts where people are poor and needs are great. Long Island has some of the highest-spending districts and best-paid superintendents in the country. It's home to a district -- Roslyn -- where administrators, employees and their families stole millions of dollars for years, and nobody noticed.
 This is not to say that Long Islanders are not feeling financial pain. They pay some of the highest property taxes in the country, and Mr. Johnson and Mr. Foley have good reason to be afraid of wrathful voters, who just fired the able Nassau County executive, Thomas Suozzi, because they were sick of paying high taxes. 
 But Long Islanders have proudly embraced their ever-more-expensive schools for years, approving ever-higher budgets and ever-soaring official salaries. For years they have benefited from the powerful bloc voting of their Senate delegation. It's ridiculous to think their schools can't possibly tap rainy-day funds or find savings on an island where superintendents routinely make six figures, where some rich villages give students two identical textbooks -- one for home and one for school -- and where the sports and arts and video and language programs are the envy of the nation. 
 New York is in dire straits, the governor is trying to cope and Long Island's schools are touchable.

HEADLINE: Shares End Mixed as Fed Holds Rates Steady

BYLINE: By REUTERS

 BODY:
Shares closed mixed on Wednesday after the Federal Reserve reiterated its intention to keep interest rates low for the foreseeable future to ensure a sustainable economic recovery.
 Wall Street trimmed its gains on news that the Fed voted unanimously to keep benchmark borrowing costs in a range of zero to 0.25 percent, which are record lows. 
 The central bank's policy-making committee also reminded markets that it would allow most of its special liquidity facilities, which have helped bolster the banking system since last year's credit crisis, to expire by early next year.
 ''The liquidity pullback, people are looking at it and saying we're not going to get that free run that we've had in the stock market, we're not going to have all that free capital that we had previously,'' said Dan Cook, senior market analyst at IG Markets. ''That will have people concerned, heading into the new year.''
 Financial stocks, which had initially climbed after reports that banking regulators would give institutions a grace period before enforcing more stringent capital rules, also slipped after the Fed's statement.
 By the end of the day, the Dow Jones industrial average was down 10.88 points, or 0.10 percent, at 10,441.12. But the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index gained 1.25 points to 1,109.18. The Nasdaq added 5.86 points, or 0.27 percent, to 2,206.91.
 After the closing bell, Citigroup shares slid 5.2 percent to $3.27, on reports that the bank's equity offering had been priced at $3.15 a share. The chip maker Intel slid 2.1 percent to $19.38 after the federal government accused the company of using its market dominance to stifle competition.
 Honeywell International, the largest maker of cockpit electronics, dropped 2.1 percent, to $40.37, after it forecast a drop of 13 to 21 percent in net profit next year. 
 Among other factors of note to investors was news from Washington that two bills were introduced to reinstate the 1930s-era Glass-Steagall Act to split commercial and investment banking.

HEADLINE: Unemployed Facing End of Federal Subsidy for Insurance Bought Through Cobra

BYLINE: By PATRICK McGEEHAN

 BODY:
While lawmakers in Washington continue to debate how to make health care affordable for more Americans, thousands of unemployed New Yorkers like Rhonda R. Baumser are suddenly struggling to hang onto their health coverage.
 Ms. Baumser, a lifelong resident of Bayside, Queens, had been relying on a federal subsidy that paid two-thirds of her health insurance premium, enabling her to maintain the same coverage she had before she was laid off in November 2008. 
 The subsidy was intended to avert the loss of insurance for millions of Americans affected by the steep rise in unemployment in the last two years. But it was intended to last for only nine months, so people like Ms. Baumser now face the prospect of being without a job or the means to pay for health coverage. 
 Ms. Baumser, who is 49 and single, was one of the early recipients of the subsidy after losing her job coordinating repair work at Equinox fitness clubs around the country. When the subsidy was offered as part of the federal stimulus program at the end of last winter, it reduced her monthly insurance premium to $135.93 from $388.37.
 This month, the cost of her coverage shot back up by more than $250 a month. It again eats up about one-fourth of Ms. Baumser's unemployment benefits, which come to $387 a week after taxes.
 ''I'm pretty much tapped out in the bank,'' Ms. Baumser said, adding that she probably would have to withdraw money from her 401(k) savings plan to pay the higher premiums. ''There's one thing I really try not to go without, and that's medical insurance.''
 Like many laid-off workers, Ms. Baumser continued the health benefits Equinox provided, under a program known as Cobra, for the Consolidated Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1986. In essence, she has been buying her health insurance from her former employer.
 From March through November, the federal government picked up 65 percent of the cost. But the subsidy lasts for only nine months and will not be available to people who lose their jobs after Dec. 31, unless Congress extends it. On Wednesday, the House approved a six-month extension, and the bill now goes to the Senate.
 The end of the subsidy can be particularly hard on families that are covered by a single health-insurance policy. Families USA, a nonprofit organization that lobbies for affordable health care, said the average monthly premium for a family covered by Cobra was $1,111, meaning that the subsidy was saving the typical family more than $700 a month.
 In some states, the average unemployment benefit is smaller than the average cost of Cobra benefits, said Ron Pollack, the executive director of Families USA.
 ''This makes it clear that the people subsisting on unemployment benefits are very unlikely to be able to afford their Cobra premium,'' Mr. Pollack said. 
 Mr. Pollack said that neither federal nor state governments have said how many people have received the subsidy or how many are exhausting it now. Advocates for an extension of the subsidy estimate that it doubled the number of Americans continuing their health benefits through the Cobra program. 
 ''It is safe to say that, were the subsidy to end, probably half of the people participating in Cobra would drop off,'' said Judith M. Conti, federal advocacy coordinator for the National Employment Law Project. 
 Ms. Conti said she expected Congress to extend the subsidy by early January. But she said that would probably be done by including an extension or reauthorization of the subsidy in one of the big year-end spending bills that are pending. With the Senate still debating an overhaul of the country's health care system, there is no time to take up the Cobra subsidy as a separate matter, she said.
 ''The timing couldn't be more ironic,'' Ms. Conti said. ''It's hard for Congress to have both of these conversations at the same time. You're not going to take a break from health care to discuss health care.''
 In the meantime, New Yorkers like Tracey Lutz are facing much bigger bills for their coverage. For her health insurance through Empire BlueCross BlueShield, Ms. Lutz, 48, had to pay $315 more this month than last because her subsidy expired at the end of November, she said.
 That bill came due while Ms. Lutz was battling to stave off foreclosure on the home in Center Moriches on Long Island that she shares with her 24-year-old daughter, who is a nurse, and two grandchildren. After losing her job running a nonprofit agency on the east end of the Island more than a year ago, Ms. Lutz fell behind on her $2,021 monthly mortgage payments. In August, the lender notified her that it had begun foreclosing on the house, she said.
 Since then, she has been searching for a job while trying, so far in vain, to work out a reduced payment plan with the lender, she said. 
 ''The only way that I'm really surviving right now is that my daughter lives here with me,'' Ms. Lutz said. ''I was paying everything. Now she's paying too.'' 
 As for her no-longer-subsidized health insurance, she said: ''I made the first payment, and I'm just going to have to go month by month. You can't expect people to have insurance if they can't afford it.''
 Ms. Lutz said that her health had been good since the initial stress of being fired dissipated. But, she added, ''I'll be 49 this month, and you just don't know.''

HEADLINE: 24 Sites Cut From City Plan For 290 Parks

BYLINE: By MIREYA NAVARRO

 BODY:
From Borough Park in Brooklyn to Morris Heights in the Bronx, many New York City residents will still have to walk more than 10 minutes to reach a playground or park. 
 Shrinking funds have led the city to scrap plans to refurbish 24 of the 290 schoolyards slated for public use in Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg's environmental agenda, the city's Independent Budget Office said Wednesday on its Web site. Nine of the schoolyards cut are in Queens, with eight in Brooklyn and seven in the Bronx.
 The cuts are expected to save $25 million. ''It's not a large cut to the program, but it's a rollback,'' said Doug Turetsky, the budget office's chief of staff. ''It's an example of how fiscal difficulties are affecting neighborhoods.''
 The environmental plan, called PlaNYC, was announced with great fanfare in 2007 and included converting schoolyards into public places on weekends and after classes with the goal of ensuring that every New Yorker would live within a 10-minute walk of a playground or park.
 A spokesman for the mayor, Jason Post, said every capital program had been reduced because of tax-revenue loss during the recession. ''We had to cut everything a little bit,'' he said.
 He said the eliminated sites ''were more expensive to renovate or they were not viable to convert because of access issues or inadequate space.'' 
 Most of the schoolyards need investments ranging from play equipment to pavement repairs and new fencing, but the budget for such improvements has dropped 26 percent since 2007, to about $71 million. Ninety-six schoolyards have already opened under the program.
 Some park advocates see the cuts as a major blow. The city lags well behind others in available parkland -- offering 4.6 acres of parkland per 1,000 residents compared to a median of 6.8 acres among 13 densely populated areas, according to figures from the Trust for Public Land.
 ''It's a slap in the face of communities that desperately need open space,'' said Geoffrey Croft, president of NYC Park Advocates, a watchdog group.
 The 290 playground conversions were originally expected to be completed by 2030 and to offer new play space to 360,000 children. But the budget office warned that ''many of the schoolyards yet to be finished under the plan require the most work.''

HEADLINE: Good Customers, Bad Bill Payers

BYLINE: By CAITLIN KELLY

 BODY:
When credit markets seized up more than a year ago, many small businesses were caught flat-footed. Their clients were not paying, or were paying more slowly, and the owners were left emotionally stressed and financially damaged.
 But after the initial shock wore off, those owners have come up with a variety of ways to make sure they do get paid. 
 The National Federation of Independent Business, which has 350,000 members, signed up 200 members for a Web seminar on collections, said Karen Harned, executive director for the organization's small-business legal center. ''This is always a big issue for small-business owners.''
 Arne Salkin, an account executive with Transworld Systems, a 39-year-old national collections agency, said the problem was felt by owners in an array of businesses. ''Our clients include cigarette wholesalers, pest management companies, nursing homes and private day schools,'' he said 
 With 150 offices and 75,000 customers across the United States, Transworld sends out customized demand letters, he said. Its customers, most of them small businesses, pay $750 for a series of five letters asking for payment, each escalating in intensity. Typically, they are sent out every two weeks, matching a standard pay period.
 This system worked, in one instance, for David Neal, assistant corporate controller for Hoover Treated Wood Products, a lumber wholesaler in Thomson, Ga., when a client owing $15,000 paid the entire amount after receiving two letters. ''I was shocked,'' Mr. Neal said. ''We were very surprised that it worked.'' 
 But another client -- a longtime customer, Mr. Neal said -- was in arrears for $45,000, ignored all five letters and then went out of business in late October. ''It will have to be written off,'' he said. 
 That is painful for a low-margin industry like his, which typically bills within 15 days and in which 95 percent of clients pay promptly, Mr. Neal said. His firm typically has $4.5 million a week in receivables, he said, and payments started slowing in November 2008. 
 Geoffrey Wilson, owner of 352 Media, a 10-year-old Web development firm in Gainesville, Fla., lost $165,000 in early 2008 when three clients did not pay. The three firms were start-ups, he said, two in Florida, one in Michigan. 
 ''It was devastating,'' he said. ''It damaged our cash flow and really hurt us.'' The company, with major companies like Microsoft and American Express, did not have to lay off any of its 40 employees, but the experience left scars, Mr. Wilson said.
 ''It makes you really angry,'' he said. ''These were clients we had extensive interactions with over several months, sometimes with as many as 50 meetings. It felt very personal. Suddenly you have to threaten them, sue them.''
 Today, Mr. Wilson is much more cautious about accepting new clients and is clear from the outset about payment terms -- 33 percent upfront, raised from 25 percent in August 2008. Clients are now classified as standard or preferred, the latter being firms with 15 employees and at least two years in business. Standard clients must pay in full before material is delivered, and the business owner will be asked for a personal guarantee, he said.
 Some customers are newly candid about their own financial woes, ''which we'd never seen before,'' he said. ''They've become very truthful. As a business owner, I really appreciate their honesty. It allows us to better plan our situation. I need an accurate understanding of what's coming in instead of having a client simply go silent.''
 Lisa Brock, head of Brock Communications in Tampa, Fla., is taking a personal approach to managing late payers, recently visiting the chief executives of two local clients to negotiate payment. Now, more than ever, Ms. Brock said, she wants to know whom she is dealing with before entering into any business deal. A free consultation allows her to decide if a client's values match hers. If so, she delves deeply into their references. ''We've done more of this recently than in the 14 years we've been in business,'' she said. ''There are a number of ways to check people out: annual reports, a Dun & Bradstreet report, ask for personal and professional references.'' 
 Cindy White, whose 11-year-old company manufactures knitted ribbon jackets that are sold in 40 high-end boutiques nationwide for $800 to $1,000, has been owed $5,000 for six months from several clients, forcing her to lay off employees. She has also fallen behind in the rent on her Phoenix design studio. ''I have a lot of stores out there who owe me money, but they're my bread and butter. You don't want to upset them by suing or sending out collection letters.'' 
 The decision whether to hold back or escalate demands for payment was made for her recently after a seven-year client, a store that closed, refused to communicate with her and did not pay for the jackets she had shipped. ''I was furious,'' Ms. White said. ''This was a store I had a longstanding relationship with.'' 
 Ever since, she said, ''I have been on the phone every few days with all the stores that owe me money, just keeping tabs and making sure they are still viable.'' She said she is hopeful that the economy will come back, and ''I am willing to work with them because they are my lifeblood.''
 Such attentiveness is necessary, agreed Ms. Brock. ''I look at our profit and loss statements biweekly.'' She advises scrutinizing client lists to predict potential trouble spots. ''Even having two slow payers is significant.''
 When a client refuses to pay, last-ditch options include hiring a collections agency -- which typically recoup in full only 11 percent of the time -- hiring a collections lawyer, who may claim one-third of what they recover, or filing a case in small-claims court. Joshua Friedman, a collections lawyer in Beverly Hills, Calif., said his business had been booming since last fall, with clients coming to him ''in every field you can imagine.''
 ''Sometimes people can't pay. Sometimes it's a matter of straight-out fraud, where buyers are not doing enough due diligence. People are desperate to do the deal,'' he said. Mr. Friedman takes on only cases worth more than $10,000.
 ''I try to resolve everything without filing a suit,'' he said. His success rate is still only 20 percent, he warned. ''My clients know better than I do if the client is really likely to settle.''

HEADLINE: Welfare Rolls Grow in City, But Increase Is Modest

BYLINE: By JULIE BOSMAN

 BODY:
As the number of New Yorkers applying for food stamps, enrolling in Medicaid and checking into homeless shelters climbed last year, the welfare rolls presented something of a riddle: they continued to fall.
 But last month, nearly 355,000 people in the city received welfare payments, a 4 percent increase over the year before, according to city officials, who predict that if the economy does not recover, the growth will continue for at least 18 months.
 City welfare officials and advocates for the poor disagree on why it took so long for the rolls to grow -- the rise began in the summer -- but the trend is a reflection of the national welfare reform of the 1990s, which also may be a factor in why the growth has been so slow. Even with the increases, the caseloads are still 23 percent lower than when Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg took office in 2002 and are just a third of the number at the enrollment peak in 1995. 
 The most significant of those reforms put a five-year lifetime limit on eligibility and required most recipients to look for work or enter job training. Welfare recipients who have reached the five-year limit can sign up for a program called Safety Net Assistance, whose costs are shouldered by the city and state. More than 90,000 of the city's welfare recipients are in the Safety Net program, which comes with work requirements but no time limit. At least 29,600 people have signed up for welfare in 2009 for the first time. 
 Meanwhile, participation in the federally subsidized food stamp program and Medicaid has risen sharply. More than 2.8 million people in New York are enrolled in Medicaid, and more than 1.6 million receive food stamps, a 21.9 percent increase over last year.
 Some advocates for the poor said they were relieved to see even a modest increase in the welfare rolls. 
 ''It should be considered a positive thing and a natural thing as we start to head into a 10 percent overall unemployment rate in New York,'' said David R. Jones, the president and chief executive of the Community Service Society, one of the city's oldest social services agencies for low-income people. ''If unemployment rates continue to spiral upward in New York, and you didn't see an increase in welfare, something would be seriously wrong. That would mean that we weren't getting people on relief quickly enough.''
 Others who work with the poor question whether the welfare program is reaching enough people who are in need, especially the newly unemployed.
 ''For me, the most significant point might be not so much that welfare has finally been responsive to the increased need of low-income New Yorkers, but why it has been relatively so unresponsive,'' said Don Friedman, a managing lawyer for the Empire Justice Center, a legal advocacy group.
 Robert Doar, the commissioner of the city's Human Resources Administration, said he had anticipated a slight increase in caseloads, and attributed it in part to the struggling economy. He also suggested that the recent increase in the basic welfare check -- the first in 19 years -- might have encouraged some recipients to enroll. (For a family of four, the subsidy rose to $413.70 a month, from $375.70.)
 Some of the new welfare recipients had signed up for food stamps and unemployment benefits but were having trouble finding jobs, Mr. Doar said. ''The lag is because people don't turn to cash welfare until they're really down to the end of the line,'' he said.
 It is much simpler to receive food stamps than cash assistance. The Bloomberg administration has streamlined the process for applying and worked with community groups to enroll participants, and it has allowed many people to mail in applications, be interviewed over the phone and renew their eligibility for food stamps less frequently.
 The application process for cash assistance, however, has not changed, and the federal work requirements are still in place. Applicants are also required to submit to a home visit that officials say is intended to detect fraud.
 Many cash assistance recipients balk at the work rules, which are strictly enforced. Evelyn Melenz, a mother of two from East New York, Brooklyn, said she received food stamps but had heard that staying on welfare was difficult. 
 ''It used to be easier to go on cash assistance,'' she said as she left a food stamp office in Brooklyn this month. ''You didn't have to go to work, you didn't have to report every day to an office and sign in and sign out. Now, if you don't go to those group job meetings in the mornings, they shut down your whole welfare case. So that's why I just get food stamps.''
 Bich Ha Pham, the director of policy, advocacy and research for the Federation of Protestant Welfare Agencies, said she frequently heard from low-income people who were frustrated by the long waits at welfare offices, which are run by the Human Resources Administration.
 At one office on Hoyt Street in Downtown Brooklyn where applications for cash assistance, food stamps and other social services are processed, the line routinely stretches around the corner.
 Lillian Hillard waited outside the office the other day, smoking a cigarette and pacing in frustration.
 Ms. Hillard, 48, who lives with her mother and two teenage children in the Brownsville section of Brooklyn, said she had been out of work for more than two years. She receives food stamp benefits totaling $327 a month and has not been on welfare in years, but she recently submitted an application to get back on cash assistance. Ms. Hilliard said she was told it would take 45 days for her welfare application to be processed.
 ''I didn't want to do it,'' she said. ''But my mother's going to kick us all out soon, and then we're going to have to go to the shelter.''

HEADLINE: Cautiously Optimistic Fed Pledges to Leave Rates Low

BYLINE: By CATHERINE RAMPELL

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
The Federal Reserve said on Wednesday that it was still wary of raising interest rates because it believed the economy remained fragile but took steps to wind down emergency lending programs.
 In a statement released after two days of meetings by the Federal Open Market Committee, the central bank said its benchmark overnight interest rate would remain at virtually zero, its level for the last year. The Fed repeated its expectation that it would keep rates ''exceptionally low'' for ''an extended period.''
 Most of the language in the report was unchanged from statements released after other recent Fed meetings, although it was marginally more upbeat. Together with recent comments from other economic policy makers -- and Wednesday reports showing increases in housing construction and subdued inflation -- the Fed's release illustrates growing, if cautious, optimism about the economy. 
 The committee said that economic activity, including household spending, had continued to pick up and that the deterioration in the job market was slowing. Improvements in the financial markets have also become ''more supportive of growth,'' the statement said. 
 But businesses are still cutting back on fixed investment, and employers still appear reluctant to hire. 
 ''Though we have begun to see some improvement in economic activity, we still have some way to go before we can be assured that the recovery will be self-sustaining,'' Mr. Bernanke said in a speech at the Economic Club of Washington last week. 
 In its statement Wednesday, the Fed said that it was gradually slowing its purchases of mortgage-backed securities and other agency debt, and that most of its emergency liquidity programs would expire in February. 
 The Term Asset-Backed Securities Loan Facility, created to help banks supply credit to households and small businesses by supporting the issuance of certain asset-backed securities, is still expected to end by June 30. 
 The statement pointedly left open the possibility of changing these plans, however.
 ''The market with the greatest potential to give problems for the financial system is commercial real estate, so the Fed had to drop a hint that it was keeping its options open,'' said John Ryding, chief economist at RDQ Economics.
 The statement comes at a time when the central bank's response to the financial crisis -- and to its denouement -- is being watched closely by traders and politicians alike. Lawmakers have been threatening to take away some of the bank's supervisory powers and subject it to greater oversight. 
 The Fed chairman, Ben S. Bernanke, also endured some tongue-lashings in his reconfirmation hearings this month. The Senate Banking Committee has scheduled a confirmation vote on Thursday morning. If the committee approves Mr. Bernanke for a second term, his nomination will be considered by the full Senate.
 Mr. Bernanke and the Fed face a difficult balancing act in the quest to return monetary policy to normal after two years of unprecedented intervention in the credit markets. 
 If the Fed waits too long to raise interest rates and draw down its balance sheet, it risks severe inflation. But tightening too early, or even intimating that it could tighten soon, might spook markets and derail the recovery. 
 Similar concerns about timing also affect the government's fiscal stimulus projects, too.
 Economic output grew at an annualized rate of 2.8 percent in the third quarter. Consumer prices increased 0.4 percent at a seasonally adjusted rate in November, according to a government report released Wednesday morning. Additionally, the Fed's favored barometer of inflation, a measure based on consumer spending that excludes food and energy, has increased 1.4 percent over the last year.
 November's jobs report, which was better than expected but still showed payroll job losses on net, has signaled that the job market may recover in the coming months.
 Mr. Bernanke is expected to be reconfirmed by Congress to serve another four years as chairman, in spite of some vocal opposition. His current term ends Jan. 31. 
 In an indication of his growing popular acclaim for his handling of the crisis -- if not necessarily his leadership before the crisis -- Mr. Bernanke was named Person of the Year by Time magazine on Wednesday. He has received similar accolades in recent weeks from other magazines.

HEADLINE: Air Routes In Asia Stir Bidding War

BYLINE: By MICHELINE MAYNARD; Hiroko Tabuchi contributed reporting.

 BODY:
With the ink barely dry on a landmark aviation treaty between the United States and Japan, a billion-dollar bidding war escalated Wednesday over which American carrier would team up with troubled Japan Airlines.
 The chief executive of American Airlines, Gerard J. Arpey, offered to raise his airline's $1.1 billion investment proposal for the Japanese carrier, known as JAL. At a news conference in Tokyo, he argued that a competing bid by Delta Air Lines would undermine the new treaty, which is meant to open up competition over the Pacific.
 Delta Air Lines, meanwhile, countered that its bid would provide more passengers and revenue from tickets to JAL. 
 Its president, Edward H. Bastian, said in an interview he was confident that American regulators would grant antitrust immunity to a deal with JAL, something American has yet to receive for a longstanding deal with British Airways.
 The battle over JAL highlights the importance of routes over the Pacific, industry experts said. Although the Japanese economy is stagnant, its airports are still important transfer points for flights to other destinations in Asia. 
 Further, Japan remains the world's second-biggest economy, and is a major destination for business travelers and companies shipping goods abroad, said Matthew J. Slaughter, an associate dean at the Tuck School of Business at Dartmouth.
 ''It's big,'' he said of the tussle between the airlines over JAL. ''If you suddenly liberalize the flow between the world's two biggest economies, you can see why companies would want to take advantage of the situation.''
 Late Friday, American and Japanese negotiators reached a preliminary agreement on an open skies treaty, similar to one reached earlier this decade between the United States and Europe. 
 The agreement will allow airlines to fly more routes between the United States and Japan, and also opens up Haneda Airport in Tokyo to limited flights from the United States. International carriers largely serve Narita Airport, 40 miles from central Tokyo.
 However, Japanese officials said they would not sign the final treaty, set to take effect next fall, unless the country's two main carriers, All Nippon Airlines and JAL, find American partners and receive antitrust immunity from the Transportation Department. The applications must be filed by mid-February.
 All Nippon, known as A.N.A., is already a partner with United Airlines through the Star Alliance, a group of international airlines, and the two carriers plan to seek antitrust immunity.
 The government also wants JAL to seek assistance from another airline as part of a revamping plan. JAL, mired in red ink after years of mismanagement and the global economic downturn, is seeking a government bailout, but progress has stalled over steep pension reductions that will be required if the airline receives government assistance.
 JAL posted a loss of 32.2 billion yen ($360 billion). But last month, Delta and SkyTeam said they were willing to provide a package of more than $1 billion in financial assistance to JAL, if it would become its partner and join its alliance. The package includes $500 million in financing, and $20 million to cover the cost of switching alliances.
 As the competition has heated up, the chief executives of both airlines have traveled to Japan to meet with JAL and government officials. Both argue that their experience in revamping, which took place through the bankruptcy process at Delta, and out of court at American, would be valuable in an overhaul of JAL.
 On Wednesday, Mr. Arpey said American, along with the Oneworld alliance and the investment advisers TPG, were willing to increase their offer above $1.1 billion.
 The bid ''will enhance JAL's opportunity for long-term success, and it will inject a large amount of much-needed capital in the short term,'' he said. American's partnership with T.P.G. would increase its ability to ''gather up the necessary capital,'' Mr. Arpey added.
 An arrangement with Delta, however, would create a true trans-Pacific powerhouse. Delta, which acquired Northwest Airlines last year, already operates about one-third of flights between the United States and Japan.
 An alliance with JAL would give it more than half those flights, making it difficult to receive antitrust approval, Mr. Arpey said.
 Mr. Bastian, however, said the proposed deal would give Delta and SkyTeam about 46 percent of service to Japan. In comparison, he said American and British Airways would operate about 60 percent of flights between the United States and Britain under their proposed arrangement. (Those two airlines say the figure is 43.6 percent.) They sought antitrust approval for their deal in August 2008, and had hoped to receive it by now.
 ''We don't have any reason to believe it won't be approved,'' Mr. Bastian said of a Delta-JAL immunity request.
 Mr. Arpey also said that the costs and risks JAL would incur in switching alliances, at a time that it was also trying to restructure, would far outweigh the benefits. 
 But Delta, which flies to Tokyo from 12 destinations, said its larger network would bring approximately $1 billion a year in revenue to JAL, double the $500 million a year in revenue JAL receives from the Oneworld alliance. 
 Though international air travel has been weak for more than a year because of the global recession, industry officials say they believe it will improve in 2010, especially in Asia, which was hit hard by the economic decline.
 The anticipation of better days ahead explains why the two airlines are so eager to claim JAL as a partner, Mr. Slaughter said. 
 ''Japan still has very prominent business activity,'' he said. ''For passenger traffic and cargo traffic, an agreement makes total sense.''

HEADLINE: Paterson Is Sued Over Payments Withheld From School Districts

BYLINE: By NICHOLAS CONFESSORE

DATELINE: ALBANY 

 BODY:
A coalition of teachers' unions and local school officials mounted a legal battle on Wednesday against Gov. David A. Paterson, arguing that his decision to unilaterally withhold hundreds of millions of dollars in scheduled payments to school districts violated New York's Constitution. 
 The educators asserted in a lawsuit filed in State Supreme Court in Albany County that Mr. Paterson had no power to withhold money after its expenditure had been authorized by the Legislature. 
 ''This is a terrible day in New York's history,'' said Alan B. Lubin, vice president of the New York State United Teachers, one of the groups that helped draft the lawsuit. ''For this coalition to stand back and watch the governor take the money that was allocated by the State Legislature for schools, for programs, for children, and pull it back, is really a terrible thing to have witnessed.''
 Mr. Paterson announced Sunday that he would withhold the money after weeks of failed negotiations with the Legislature over how to close a $3.2 billion deficit. He also said that if the economy did not improve and if state revenues did not rise next year, the money being withheld could become the basis for cuts in next year's budget.
 At a news conference at the Capitol minutes after the lawsuit was filed, Mr. Paterson reiterated that the payments being withheld were part of the roughly $750 million in local aid that he was not distributing because the state was projected to run out of money before the end of the year.
 ''I am being sued for trying to keep New York State's finances solvent,'' Mr. Paterson said. ''This is a desperate attempt by special interests to put their needs ahead of the people of the State of New York. This lawsuit does nothing to help us solve a severe cash crisis that threatens our ability to pay our obligations at the end of the month.''
 The lawsuit was filed by the state teachers' union and groups representing school district superintendents, school board members and administrators.
 Leaders of the groups suggested, in a news conference on the steps of the Capitol, that children would suffer if the money, about $582 million in school aid and property tax reimbursements, was not restored. School district officials also suggested that they should not have to dip further into their own reserve funds -- which total $1.1 billion statewide -- before Mr. Paterson had exhausted the state's own emergency fund.
 L. Oliver Robinson, president of the New York State Council of School Superintendents and superintendent of the Shenendehowa School District outside Albany, said Mr. Paterson's decision would force cuts in critical services.
 ''When I go back to my school district,'' he said, ''and meet with the kids in classrooms, the questions they're asking me are, 'Dr. Robinson, will we still have this? Will we still have sports? Will we still have music? Will we still have robotics?' ''
 A spokesman for Mr. Paterson said that the governor's order meant that $120,000 was being withheld from Mr. Robinson's district and that the school system had about $3.8 million in reserve funds.
 Mr. Lubin proposed options to avoid the loss of school aid. Mr. Paterson, he said, should consider buying prescription drugs for state health plans from Canada, cooperative purchasing of school supplies or higher income taxes on the wealthy -- a move that would raise taxes on high earners for the second time in less than a year.
 ''I would have him look at the revenue sources available in New York State, and some of the programs that he's refused to look at for the past 16 months,'' Mr. Lubin said.
 Mr. Paterson singled out school officials and advocates for criticism, noting that while he had tried to delay payments equally across the board, those who filed the lawsuit were in essence arguing that their funding was sacrosanct, even amid the worst state fiscal crisis in a generation.
 ''What these school districts and unions and otherwise have done is said: 'We aren't the special interests -- we're extra special,' '' Mr. Paterson said. '' 'We're supposed to get all the money and everybody else can just divide up the crumbs.' ''

HEADLINE: Pittsburgh Holds Off on a Vote to Tax Tuition

BYLINE: By IAN URBINA

 BODY:
In a sudden change of course, Pittsburgh's mayor asked the City Council Wednesday to postpone a vote on the nation's first tuition tax on college students, holding out hope that the city's 10 colleges and universities will agree to provide economic help voluntarily.
 ''Over the last several days, thanks to your strength, conviction and support, we have made progress,'' Mayor Luke Ravenstahl wrote in a letter on Wednesday to City Council members, citing discussions with Pittsburgh's nonprofit community. ''I feel that a one-week hold on this bill is an appropriate measure.'' 
 University officials and students, who have been asking for weeks for the mayor to drop his proposed 1 percent tuition tax, hailed the decision as a victory. The mayor is racing the clock because two of the Council members whose votes he needs to get the measure approved are leaving the Council at the end of the year. 
 In addition, state lawmakers are considering a bill that would explicitly prevent municipalities from enacting such measures. 
 If approved, the tax would affect students attending college in Pittsburgh and would raise more than $15 million in annual revenue that is needed to pay pensions for retired city employees. Mr. Ravenstahl said he still hoped to get an agreement with the universities or seek a final vote before Dec. 29.
 The proposal was being watched closely by other cities struggling with similar budget gaps. Students and college officials in Pittsburgh have argued that the tax would set a bad precedent in altering the tax-exempt status of nonprofit organizations and pose an unfair burden on institutions that already contribute substantially to the city. 
 Council members said Wednesday that they believed the tax would probably be avoided. 
 ''I don't see this vote taking place next week because I think both sides are looking for a graceful and face-saving way to get out of the conflict,'' said Doug Shields, Council president and an opponent of the tax.
 Mr. Shields said he believed that the mayor would take the tax off the table and that, in return, the universities would agree to some payment and help in lobbying state lawmakers for changes in how the city raised revenue.
 But some Council members said the tax was still a possibility. 
 ''There are still five strong votes backing the mayor's tax if he has to go that way,'' said Councilman Jim Motznik, a supporter of the tax. ''We don't want to impose this tax on students, but what we are really talking about here is the cost of one extra textbook so that we can avoid raising property taxes or laying off a hundred cops.''
 Mary Hines, chairwoman of the Pittsburgh Council of Higher Education and president of Carlow University, said that once the mayor removed the threat of a tax, universities would probably be willing to commit to a three-year voluntary payment.
 That commitment would be predicated, however, on a broader agreement from the city to work together on larger budgetary strategies, like raising the service tax that everyone who works in the city pays to about $144, up from $42, Ms. Hines said. To make such a change would require approval from the state legislature, and the mayor has asked the universities to help him lobby for that change. 
 In Harrisburg, the state capital, lawmakers sought to get in front of the mayor's plan. Representative Paul Costa, Democrat of Turtle Creek, has drafted a bill that would explicitly prevent municipalities from taxing tuition. 
 The tax, were it imposed, would also probably face a court challenge.
 Mr. Ravenstahl has said that if the universities do not agree to a voluntary payment, he will be left with no other option but to impose the tuition tax. The city currently forgoes about $50 million in real estate taxes from nonprofit institutions, he contends.
 The City Council has twice delayed action on the measure, which would cost students $27 a year at the Community College of Allegheny County and $409 at Carnegie Mellon University.
 Dave Gau, a student government board member at the University of Pittsburgh who has helped organize opposition to the tax, said the delay in the vote was a clear victory for students.
 ''I hope that by Monday, the City Council will see that the tax is extremely unfavorable and spend their efforts coming up with alternatives,'' Mr. Gau said.

HEADLINE: House Approves Bills on Debt Limit and Pentagon Spending

BYLINE: By CARL HULSE

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
The House on Wednesday narrowly approved a short-term, $290 billion increase in federal borrowing power, setting the stage for a major fight over national fiscal policy in 2010.
 As the House finished its business for the year, lawmakers, in a rare show of bipartisanship, also easily approved a $626 billion Pentagon spending measure, wrapping up the annual spending bills almost three months behind schedule.
 The Pentagon measure, which passed on a vote of 395 to 34, pays for continuing operations in Iraq and Afghanistan. It also included short extensions of the USA Patriot Act, the antiterrorism legislation enacted after Sept. 11, and several other expiring laws and programs as well as two more months in jobless pay and health care for the unemployed. 
 The interlude of legislative cooperation was brief.
 Members of the House and Senate failed to come to terms on extending the federal estate tax, which is scheduled to be repealed entirely for 2010 before being reinstated at a lower threshold in 2011. Lawmakers hope to work out a more orderly transition when they return in January.
 In what House members hope was their last significant vote of an eventful year, a $174 billion measure intended to create jobs was approved on a surprisingly close party-line vote of 217 to 212. The measure would redirect $75 billion from the Wall Street bailout fund to a variety of construction and employment programs, but no similar measure is expected to be considered in the Senate until next year.
 Lawmakers quickly returned to partisan sniping before voting 218 to 214 to raise the federal debt limit, with each party blaming the other for running up the national debt over the last decade. Both the debt increase and the Pentagon measure must still be approved by the Senate, which is locked in its health care debate.
 The Treasury Department had sought the debt increase, saying the federal government was in danger of exceeding the legal debt limit of $12.1 trillion by Dec. 31, putting it in jeopardy of defaulting and threatening its ability to operate.
 ''We have the full faith and credit of the United States of America in our hands,'' said Representative Charles B. Rangel, Democrat of New York and chairman of the Ways and Means Committee. ''People have a political problem with raising the debt, but our country has a fiscal problem.''
 Republicans said the need to increase the debt reflected excessive Democratic spending and called on Congress to reduce spending instead. ''Give the gift that America deserves, a responsible federal budget,'' said Representative Dean Heller, Republican of Nevada. ''Merry Christmas to everyone.''
 Democrats countered that Republicans presided over deficit spending during most of the last decade as the federal government turned a surplus at the end of the Clinton administration into a deficit during the tenure of President George W. Bush. They said Republicans recklessly cut taxes while adding the costs of the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan to the deficit.
 ''I don't know how you could have voted for the war in Iraq and vote now not to pay the bill,'' said Representative Richard E. Neal, Democrat of Massachusetts and a senior member of the Ways and Means Committee.
 If approved by the Senate, the debt increase is expected to be sufficient to carry the government through Feb. 11. In the interim, Democrats say they will try come to an agreement among the White House, Congressional leaders and centrist Democrats in both houses who are pressing for an independent commission with the power to recommend spending cuts and tax increases for Congressional approval.
 Congressional Democrats had intended to seek an increase in the national debt ceiling of $1.8 trillion, enough to carry the government through next November and avoid another vote on the politically treacherous topic before the elections. But party deficit hawks balked and said they would support a substantial increase only if they were given a vote on the deficit panel and other concessions.
 Representative John S. Tanner, Democrat of Tennessee and a leader of the fiscally conservative Blue Dog Coalition, said the short-term increase in the debt limit amounted to Congress's ''hitting the pause button'' while allowing lawmakers time to work out a way to tackle the deficit. 
 Representative Allen Boyd, Democrat of Florida and another Blue Dog, said Congress had to come up with a new approach to enforcing fiscal responsibility.
 ''We don't have the will in the United States Congress to discipline ourselves,'' he said. ''We have proven that over the years.''
 But Speaker Nancy Pelosi and other top members of Congress have strongly resisted the idea of a independent commission, saying it cedes too much of the responsibility that should belong to Congress. One compromise proposal centers on a commission created by executive order. Democrats on both sides of the issue say they will try to find a resolution quickly, and President Obama is due to present his own deficit-reduction plan early next year as Democrats try to neutralize spending as a political issue in the midterm elections.
 Members of Congress loathe voting to raise the debt limit since it allows opponents to paint them as favoring added spending and the majority party typically has to muster the votes to protect the nation's credit. No Republican voted for the increase approved Wednesday, and 39 Democrats also voted no.
 Besides extending the Patriot Act, the Pentagon measure delayed for two months a scheduled cut in Medicare payments to doctors and extended for two months programs covering food stamps, transportation construction, flood insurance and small-business loans, among other things.

HEADLINE: Something Rented, Something Green

BYLINE: By JENNIFER STEINHAUER

DATELINE: TORRANCE, Calif. 

 BODY:
It is a nibble weird that a guy who describes his relationship to Christmas as ''hostile'' runs around greater Los Angeles in a floppy red Santa hat and answers his iPhone, ''Merry Christmas, this is Scotty Claus!''
 But bummed as false merriment and gift obligations render him, Scott Martin -- landscape architect and tree hugger in a literal sense -- was unnerved by the sight of post-Christmas trees lying about like so much discarded sausage casing. 
 What people really ought to do, he reasoned, was rent a Christmas tree, and return it, alive, to the nursery after the season. 
 Mr. Martin's idea, enabled by a rotten economy that made his free time greater and his potential labor pool deeper, is now manifest in his new business delivering live, potted Christmas trees that are taken away once the toys have been unwrapped and, possibly, already broken, and the New Year's confetti has been swept away.
 Rentable Christmas trees, which have been tried in Oregon and a smattering of other places over the years, are a perfect match for Los Angeles, he said, where Christmas trees have ''an image issue,'' and escaping a drive through traffic with a tree strapped to a car roof is especially welcome.
 ''You can try anything here, and no one will tell you it's a bad idea,'' said Mr. Martin, who is 30 and grew up in the South Bay here, where as a teenager he delivered trees for a nursery. ''California is more attached to the green movement, so they are more willing to try this service here.''
 To rent a tree, a customer visits Mr. Martin's Web site, livingchristmas.com, picks out a tree from among several varieties and then awaits delivery. Delivery days are determined by geography, to save time and gas. Prices range from $50, for a two-to-three-foot number, up to $185 for something bigger. While two weeks is the recommended length of stay for a live tree in a house, Mr. Martin lets his customers keep them for three. 
 The tree is then picked up to join its evergreen cousins; they will summer together on industrial properties where Mr. Martin rents space for pennies on the dollar to house his inventory. People who want the same tree next year ask for it to be tagged with their name, so it might return next December, taller. 
 Extra-credit points: The delivery trucks run on biodiesel; the trees are cared for by adults with disabilities; the drivers will pick up donations for Goodwill and used wrapping paper for recycling; and the Web site also sells eco-friendly, fair-trade ornaments. 
 Mr. Martin -- whose landscape architecture work slowed quite a bit this year, given that most of it was in Dubai -- gets delivery help from some laid-off architects he knows. ''They are willing, for $15 an hour, to put on reindeer antlers and tell people 'Merry Christmas.' ''
 Last Friday, Mr. Martin expertly threaded his truck through the small streets and secret byways of Manhattan Beach, until he pulled up in front of an old beach house where, naturally, there was no parking.
 ''Can we steal your driveway to deliver a Christmas tree?'' he gamely asked a neighbor, who appeared to find it hard to say no to a cheerful pair of guys -- Mr. Martin and his helper, Justin (Season) Casillas -- in festive headwear carrying a spruce. Delilah and Charlotte Samuels, the children of the house, came racing out into the drizzle to check out the incoming tree. 
 Their mother, Megan Arquette, buried her nose in the branches. ''Ramona, you're back!'' she said, taking in the tree's scent. ''Ummmm. It smells so good.''
 The family was one of last year's handful of pilot customers; this year, the company has rented 400 trees and expects to finish the season with 500.
 ''We love this,'' Ms. Arquette said of tree renting. ''It stays fresh, the cleanup is minimal because it doesn't drop anything, and it goes away and comes back next year. It's kind of like having a little pet.''
 The drive to anthropomorphize live trees seems common. Alice Haliburton, who heard about tree rentals from a pal in her spinning class, was giddy to see her ''fluffy'' tree arrive, so much so that she jumped around a little. ''He smells great, and he's got a good home!'' she exclaimed as Mr. Martin and Mr. Casillas wedged him into a corner of her apartment in Redondo Beach. ''And you can see he's happy.''
 Yeah, so there can be problems. The guy who was supposed to pick up storage trays for the trees out in Chino left without them. People get touchy about trees. They don't appreciate traffic. ''I try to explain it's Christmas, and it's a tree,'' Mr. Martin said. ''I say: 'Your temporary tannenbaum is not there yet? What can I do for you?' ''
 But he looks forward to bringing his trees back next year. ''Your kids are growing, your trees are growing, it's really dynamic,'' he said. ''We're breathing new life into the holiday.''

HEADLINE: At Many Colleges, Early Applications Rise

BYLINE: By JACQUES STEINBERG

 BODY:
This was the year when the frenzy to gain early admission to the nation's most selective colleges seemed likely to subside, at least in part because a student admitted under a binding early program cannot seek competing financial aid offers as leverage to negotiate a better package.
 But for many admissions offices, there appears to have been no letup. 
 Duke, Northwestern, Brown, Cornell, Columbia, Johns Hopkins and Dartmouth, among other highly selective colleges, received substantially more applications for their early decision programs this year than they did last.
 Other colleges, including Wesleyan, Emory, Pomona and Grinnell, drew about as many early applications this fall as they did last fall, a time when the economic downturn was only just beginning. Each of those programs requires students to withdraw all other applications and attend if admitted.
 ''The fear of not getting in is a trump card,'' said Jon Reider, director of college counseling at San Francisco University High School, a private school, and a former admissions officer at Stanford. ''That fear is more powerful than any piece of factual information, such as, 'Gee, colleges are having a hard time with financial aid, maybe we should cast our net fairly widely and not jump the gun and throw our eggs all in one basket.'''
 Not all colleges held their ground, however. Yale and Williams saw a drop in early applications.
 For the colleges themselves, which sent notifications to early-admission applicants this week, the calculus appears to have been more complicated. While early decision candidates are some of the savviest, most talented -- and, yes, financially flush students -- the increase in early decision applications did not necessarily translate into a surge of offers of admission. 
 Cornell, for example, received an additional 136 applications for its binding early decision program this fall, when compared to last, but accepted 103 fewer students than last year.
 While nearly 40 percent of the seats in next year's freshman class at Cornell are now reserved, the university has still allowed itself much flexibility for the main round of admission, when most students will apply. Moreover, colleges like Cornell are committed to assembling the most diverse classes possible -- including racially and socio-economically diverse classes -- and many of those who apply early tend to be white and of some means.
 Johns Hopkins and Brown also received more early applications this fall, but accepted fewer students.
 ''Colleges are hesitant to go beyond a certain line when it comes to the percentage of the incoming class that they obtain through early decision,'' said David Hawkins, director of public policy and research for the National Association for College Admission Counseling. ''They're aware of the research, and the potential inequities they might produce if they cross that line.''
 Still, it is difficult to find a clear theme in all the colleges' application figures for this fall. Williams, which has a binding early admission program, received 73 fewer applications this fall, a drop of 13.5 percent. And Yale -- which has a non-binding early program, but which requires that its early applicants apply to no other early programs -- received nearly 300 fewer applications, a drop of 5 percent.
 And yet, Stanford, which has a program similar to Yale's, got 183 more applications than last fall, an increase of 4 percent. And early applications to M.I.T., another non-binding program, surged by 13 percent, the university said Wednesday night.
 In the case of Stanford and M.I.T., early applicants had little to lose, for they have until May to decide whether they wish to attend, a period in which they can consider other colleges' offers.
 In response to criticisms of early programs in recent years as the province of the elite (and the plugged-in), Harvard and the University of Virginia are among a handful of schools that have discontinued their early programs.
 Some college counselors -- including Bill McClintick, a counselor at Mercersburg Academy in Pennsylvania, and a former president of the National Association for College Admission Counseling -- said some students at his school had specifically bypassed any binding early programs this fall, in favor of non-binding, to preserve their financial options.
 Mr. Reider said several of his students had made similar decisions to bypass early decision entirely for the main round.
 ''I have to write a lot of recommendation letters now,'' he said.

HEADLINE: Pride Sends China to U.S. on Art-Treasure Hunt

BYLINE: By ANDREW JACOBS; Li Bibo contributed research from Beijing.

 BODY:
China's ''treasure hunting team'' descended on the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York last week, and James C.Y. Watt, the patrician head of Asian art, braced for a confrontation.
 For the past two weeks, the delegation of Chinese cultural experts has swept through American institutions, seeking to reclaim items once ensconced at the Old Summer Palace in Beijing, which was one of the world's most richly appointed imperial residences until British and French troops plundered it in 1860.
 With a crew from China's national broadcaster filming the visit, the Chinese fired off questions about the provenance of objects on display, and when it came to a collection of jade pieces, they requested documentation to show that the pieces had been acquired legally. 
 But then, with no eureka discovery, the tension faded. The Chinese pronounced themselves satisfied, smiled for a group photo, and drove away. 
 ''That wasn't so bad after all,'' Mr. Watt said.
 Emboldened by newfound wealth, China has been on a noisy campaign to reclaim relics that disappeared during its so-called century of humiliation, the period between 1842 and 1945 when foreign powers subjugated China through military incursions and onerous treaties.
 But the quest, fueled by national pride, has been quixotic, provoking fear at institutions overseas but in the end amounting to little more than a public relations show aimed at audiences back home.
 At its core, such mixed signals are an outgrowth of China's evolving self-identity. Is it a developing country with fresh memories of its victimization by imperial powers? Or is it the world's biggest exporter, eager to ensure good relations with the outside world to protect its trade-dependent economy?
 ''China is like an adolescent who took too many steroids,'' said Liu Kang, a professor of Chinese studies at Duke University. ''It has suddenly become big, but it finds it hard to coordinate and control its body. To the West, it can look like a monster.'' 
 Recounted in Chinese textbooks and in countless television dramas, the destruction of the Old Summer Palace, or Yuanmingyuan as it is called in Chinese, remains a crucial event epitomizing China's fall from greatness. Begun in the early 18th century and expanded over the course of 150 years, the palace was a wonderland of artificial hills and lakes, and so many ornate wooden structures that it took 3,000 troops three days to burn them down.
 ''The wound is still open and hurts every time you probe it,'' said Liu Yang, a Beijing lawyer and a driving force in the movement to regain stolen antiquities. ''It reminds people what may come when we are too weak.'' 
 Stoked by populist sentiment but carefully managed by the Communist Party, the drive to reclaim lost cultural property has so far been halting. While officials privately acknowledge there is scant legal basis for repatriation, their public statements suggest that they would use lawsuits, diplomatic pressure and shame to bring home looted objects -- not unlike Italy, Greece and Egypt, which have sought, with some success, to recover antiquities in European and American museums.
 ''The ideal scenario would be for the holders of these relics to donate them back to China,'' said Chen Mingjie, the director of the palace museum, whose grounds include a shabby exhibition hall and an evocative pile of stone ruins that are instantly recognizable to any Chinese elementary school student. 
 The Communist Party has long used the narrative of foreign subjugation as a binding force, one that has become especially useful in recent years as the credo of market economics overruns the last remnants of its Marxist ideology.
 But arousing nationalist sentiment, Chinese officials have learned, is a double-edged sword. In 2005, officials allowed public ire against Japan, over territorial disputes and textbooks that glossed over Japanese wartime atrocities, to boil over into violent street protests. After some of the anti-Japanese slogans began morphing into demands for action by Chinese leaders, the authorities clamped down.
 The delegation traveling to United States museums appears to have been caught up in a political maelstrom. The relics quest intensified this year after Christie's in Paris auctioned a pair of bronze animal heads that had been part of a fountain on the palace grounds; the sale was met with outrage in China. In the end, a Chinese collector sabotaged the auction by calling in the highest bids -- $18 million for each head -- then refusing to pay.
 The United States scouting tour -- visits to England, France and Japan will come early next year -- quickly turned into a spectacle sponsored by a Chinese liquor company. As for the eight-member delegation, a closer look revealed that most either were employed by the Chinese media or were from the palace museum's propaganda department. 
 ''These days even building a toilet at Yuanmingyuan would be front-page news in People's Daily,'' said Liu Yang, a researcher who joined the trip.
 But the 20-day spin through a dozen institutions has not been especially fruitful. Wu Jiabi, an archaeologist and the leader of the delegation, said that meaningful contacts were made but acknowledged that the group had not discovered illicit relics.
 The visit has had its share of mishaps. Not all the museums on the itinerary were prepared for the delegation. One stop, the Nelson-Atkins Museum of Art in Kansas City, Mo., was scrapped after the group realized the museum was in the Midwest, not in the Northeast.
 The art experts whom the group met along the way offered consistent advice: the lion's share of palace relics are in private hands, including those of collectors in Hong Kong, Taiwan and mainland China. ''The best thing would be to look through the catalogs of Sotheby's and Christie's,'' said Mr. Watt of the Metropolitan Museum.
 Although the Chinese public broadly supports recovering such items, a few critics have suggested that the campaign merely distracts from the continued destruction of historic buildings and archaeological sites across the country. A government survey released this month found that 23,600 registered relics had disappeared in recent years because of theft or illicit sales, while tens of thousands of culturally significant sites had been plowed under for development.
 What's more, said Wu Zuolai, a professor at the China Academy of Art, the obsession with Yuanmingyuan ignores the plunder of older sites that are more artistically significant.
 ''Chinese history did not start with the Qing Dynasty,'' he said. ''This treasure hunting trip is just a political show. The media portray it as patriotic, but it's just spreading hate.''
 Like many of the curators the delegation met last week, Keith Wilson, who oversees the Chinese art collection at the Arthur M. Sackler Gallery and Freer Gallery of Art, both part of the Smithsonian Institution in Washington, said that he was unsure what delegation members were really after. ''They took a million miles of video, but in the end, I really felt they were not controlling their own destiny,'' he said.
 Mr. Liu, the researcher who was part of the delegation, seemed to admit as much, complaining that politics had upstaged scholarship. Even if he stumbled upon a palace relic, he said, he would be reluctant to take it back to an institution whose unheated exhibition space resembled little more than a military barracks. ''To be honest, if you leave a thermos in our office, it gets broken,'' he said. 
 ''Maybe it's better these things stay where they are.''

HEADLINE: A Holiday of White Conquest Persists in a South Africa Far From United

BYLINE: By BARRY BEARAK

DATELINE: PRETORIA, South Africa 

 BODY:
The 16th of December was once a day of rival holidays here, two opposing flows of memory colliding at a junction.
 Afrikaners, the descendants of white settlers, celebrated the Day of the Vow, a covenant said to be made between their ancestors and God in 1838 that led to the slaughter of 3,000 Zulus. Blacks commemorated the same day on the calendar, marking the start of armed struggle against the apartheid regime by the African National Congress in 1961.
 With the arrival of multiracial democracy in 1994, lawmakers considered it wise to maintain Dec. 16 as a holiday, proclaiming it a Day of Reconciliation, a time for all races to come together in the spirit of national unity.
 But 15 years later, that happily-ever-after ending is a long way off, and the ideal of a rainbow nation now seems little more than a deft turn of phrase. According to a poll released last week by the highly regarded Institute for Justice and Reconciliation, 31 percent of South Africans believe that race relations have not improved since the end of apartheid, and 16 percent actually think they have gotten worse. (About 50 percent said relations had improved.) 
 As for the holiday itself, most Afrikaners have found it hard to set aside one of their most sacred occasions, and on Wednesday, thousands of them gathered, as they do every year, inside the marble chamber of a mammoth granite monument near Pretoria. The structure is a shrine to the Great Trek, when white pioneers migrated north with their ox-drawn wagons and ramrod-loading muskets, completing a conquest they saw as the fulfillment of a divine mission.
 ''The Day of Reconciliation may be a good idea, but for Afrikaners, the Day of the Vow is still what's in our hearts,'' said Johan de Beer, 46, a teacher waiting on the steps for the gates of the monument to open in the early morning. ''This is a religious holiday that is based on our people's history.''
 In his inauguration address, Nelson Mandela spoke of a covenant of his own, longing for ''a rainbow nation at peace with itself and the world.'' Viewers of the new American movie ''Invictus'' might be tempted to conclude that such racial harmony prevailed in the aftermath of a long-shot upset in a rugby game.
 The recent survey results would probably stun someone who went to sleep during apartheid and awakened in the present. After all, blacks not only control the government, they mingle in the finest restaurants and swankiest malls. The so-called black diamonds include liberation struggle heroes who have been welcomed into the boardrooms of the nation's largest corporations.
 But while South Africa is the continent's wealthiest country, income inequality here remains among the worst in the world. About 29 percent of blacks are unemployed, compared with 5 percent of whites, according to recent figures. When statistics include discouraged workers -- dropouts from the labor force -- the jobless rate climbs to nearly 50 percent. Most of the unemployed have never held a single job, according to a study by a panel of international economists.
 The recent poll results also showed that nearly one in four South Africans never speaks to people of other races in a typical day. ''In the upper income groups there is a lot of integration, but very little among the poor,'' said Fanie du Toit, the executive director of the institute that released the poll. ''About 40 to 50 percent of blacks are slum dwellers or rural people who never come in contact with whites.''
 At the Voortrekker Monument, among those celebrating the Day of the Vow, barely a black person was in sight but for the men in blue uniforms picking up the trash. ''I don't know anything about their holiday,'' said one of those workers, Elias Selema.
 The earliest attendees took seats beneath the monument's dome in the main hall, a huge room encircled by friezes made from Italian marble that depict the epic migration. Others sat a level below, surrounding the cenotaph, the empty tomb that is the symbolic resting place of those who died during the trek. Still more took seats on the surrounding lawns and in the gardens.
 ''This is my day of thanksgiving,'' said Callie van Merwe, an 89-year-old woman dressed in the loose frock and white cotton bonnet of a settler. She added: ''Today is a happy time, but I feel bad about the future. This country is changing, changing too much.''
 There are several versions of the Day of the Vow and the Battle of Blood River that followed. The historical record is one-sided, and no doubt the retellings lend themselves to myth. One historian, Leonard Thompson, has said the mythology came to serve a political purpose, used to justify the racial oppression of apartheid as God's will.
 In the story's most common rendition, a brigade of 468 voortrekkers, or pioneers, and about 60 of their slaves set out to avenge hundreds of deaths at the hands of the Zulus. Their leader, Andries Pretorius, cleverly selected a place to camp that was protected by a steep ravine and the Ncome River, which broadened at that spot into a deep hippopotamus pool.
 Preceding the Zulu attack that was sure to come, the trekkers came together to recite a vow. In part it read, ''If he will protect us and give our enemy into our hand, we shall keep this day and date every year as a day of thanksgiving like a Sabbath, and that we shall erect a church in his honor.''
 The Afrikaners chained their covered wagons together, placing barbed shrubs beneath them. Wave after wave of Zulus charged, trying to use their short spears in close combat, but instead dying in heaps as smoke rose from muskets and cannons. As the story goes, 3,000 Zulus died while the trekkers suffered only three injuries. So many warriors fell dead in the Ncome it then became known as Blood River.
 ''We believe it was God's will to have Christians lead the way in this land,'' said Lukas de Kock, one of the leaders of Wednesday's worship. ''On that day, the Day of the Vow, God made a clear statement that this was his will for South Africa.''
 The reading of the vow is one of the two most solemn moments of the prayer service. The other comes precisely at midday as families lean over the parapets that overlook the cenotaph.
 Careful calculations were made by the monument's designers, and exactly at noon on each Dec. 16, the sun shines through a small opening in the dome, alighting on the empty tomb 138 feet below and yet again signaling for many that it was the Lord's will that the land be theirs.

HEADLINE: Challenging Intel

 BODY:
The Federal Trade Commission has, at long last, brought an antitrust suit against Intel. The leviathan of the microchip industry has used its enormous market power -- it controls 80 percent of the global microprocessor market and more than half the market for graphics chips -- to shut rivals out, suppressing competition and reducing consumers' choices. 
 If successful, the F.T.C.'s case could open the door to increased innovation from rival firms in one of the most vital sectors of the American economy.
 Intel has suffered a string of legal challenges and defeats around the world. In May, the European Commission fined it $1.5 billion for abusing its power by offering illegal rebates to computer makers that purchased all or most of their chips from Intel and threatening to punish those who bought too much from rivals. Japan and South Korea have also acted against Intel. 
 In November, Attorney General Andrew Cuomo of New York filed an antitrust suit against Intel. That month, the company paid $1.25 billion to settle a suit brought by its main rival, Advanced Micro Devices, for allegedly using illegal tactics to defend its near-monopoly. 
 The F.T.C.'s case is broader. It charges that Intel redesigned software to slow the performance of A.M.D.'s chips. And it argues that Intel is applying the same bullying strategy to the growing market for graphics chips used to run video on computers. It alleges Intel has engineered its processors to ensure that graphics chips made by A.M.D. and another rival, Nvidia, won't run smoothly on a computer that uses an Intel central processor. 
 The F.T.C. wants Intel to stop using threats, bundled prices or other offers to encourage exclusive deals, hamper competition or distort prices. It said it may seek an order stopping Intel from making or distributing products that impair the performance of rival chips. Intel says the F.T.C. case is misguided and argues that the remedies would hinder product improvements, limit its ability to protect its intellectual property and make it impossible for the company to compete on price.
 We believe it is long overdue. Monopolies have been given too easy a ride over the last decade -- and American businesses and consumers have paid the price.

HEADLINE: Introducing a Twitter for Credit Card Purchases

BYLINE: By DON STEINBERG

 BODY:
Philip Kaplan earned notoriety and profit a decade ago with a site that chronicled the implosion of the Internet bubble. Now he is back with a project that seems sure to get attention again: Blippy, a soon-to-start online social network that lets you share details of your credit card purchases with friends or strangers. 
 Mr. Kaplan's earlier venture, an obscenely named Web site that parodied FastCompany magazine, chronicled the dot-com carnage in 2000 and 2001. Though that site trashed failing start-ups, Mr. Kaplan was an entrepreneur himself: he made money by devising a self-service tool that allowed advertisers to place ads on the site. The tool worked so well that in 2002, he spun it off to create AdBrite, which places ads on more than 100,000 affiliated sites and had 2008 revenue of $31.6 million. 
 Still chairman and a major shareholder, Mr. Kaplan, now 34. left his chief executive role at AdBrite last year, turning its management over to a hired chief executive and freeing himself to noodle. Most of his tinkering is based on the potential of social media sites like Twitter, where he goes by the name Pud. In June, he became entrepreneur in residence at the venture capital firm Charles River Ventures, but after just half a year, he left to work full time on Blippy. 
 Currently in invitation-only beta testing and headed for a public introduction in 2010, Blippy reports your credit card purchases (for example, ''Alice spent $47.60 at Macy's'') to others, as if the transactions were tweets on Twitter or Facebook status updates.
 Mr. Kaplan spoke about Blippy earlier this week. A condensed version of the conversation follows.
 Q. Before we start -- on Aug. 30, you tweeted: ''Getting married. About to walk down aisle. Putting phone on vibrate.'' Really?
 A. Yes, that was true. I was about to walk down, and at the last moment I realized my phone was still on, so I tweeted that out real quick. My wife is also a fan of technology, so she appreciated it.
 Q. So how does Blippy work?
 A. The idea is that most Americans have two or three credit cards in their wallet. You sign one of them up to be the social card -- it's connected to the site. The other cards you keep private. If I use my public card at a Starbucks, for instance, all my friends know that I'm at the Starbucks, and they can come and see me, or whatever.
 Q. And you wouldn't need to announce that via Twitter -- it just shows up online?
 A. We call it passive sharing.
 Q. But even on my public card, I'd control who sees what I'm buying?
 A. You can make your account public or private, like on Twitter where you can protect your stream and only people you approve will see it. And it's only going to show the charges you want it to show. Some people are only sharing their iTunes or Amazon purchases. The cool thing about iTunes and Amazon is that you can show the exact product that you're buying, not just the amount.
 Q. So you're not going to sell me out when I buy a Wang Chung song online?
 A. You won't have to worry about any private information being sold.
 Q. Talk about conspicuous consumption. This probably isn't for everyone.
 A. I guess you need to have the right temperament if you to want to blog and tweet and Facebook and all that. It's just another way of saying, ''Here's what I'm doing,'' or ''Here's where I am,'' or ''Here's a band that I'm really into'' -- obviously, because I just bought five of their albums.
 There are roughly 100 people using the site now, friends of ours. It's going to be invite-only for a while. The best thing is the unintended coincidences that happen. My brother spent $4,000 at Crutchfield, an electronics store. I asked him what he bought, and he said a TV. I said: ''I'm in the market for a TV. That looks a little expensive, but tell me about it.'' He had done all this research -- who knew? I wouldn't have known which of my trusted friends to ask about it. 
 Q. Is this a Twitter app?
 A. It's not currently tied in with any other social network. It looks similar to Twitter but our data is structured. Unlike a Tweet or a Facebook status update, every ''Blip'' -- as we're calling them -- is the same format, which is: ''X spent Y dollars at Z.'' You can click on the Z to see who else spent money at Z. Or you can click on the X to see what else that person is buying. 
 Q. So you can aggregate spending data? 
 A. Yeah, there's a lot of interesting data we're hoping to provide to users. For instance, you can see people paying different amounts for the same thing: phone bills, cable bills, haircuts, gym memberships.
 Q. Won't marketers be able to see what people are buying and aim ads at your users?
 A. Not any differently than they can see what you're Tweeting or what you're blogging about. It's probably more interesting to marketers, but that's not our focus. Our focus is just in making it a really fun and interesting place for our users.
 Q. You left your job at Charles River Ventures to do this. What kind of funding do you have?
 A. We're not making any funding announcements yet. But obviously we came out of C.R.V.
 Q. How did Blippy get started?
 A. I met the other two Blippy co-founders at C.R.V., Ashvin Kumar and Chris Estreich. They originally built the concept, and I was popping into their office every day, trading ideas. The more I worked on it, the more excited I got, to the point where I couldn't think about anything else and basically begged to work on it together. Now I'm full-time Blippy.
 Q. Is there a revenue model cooked into the plan?
 A. We're evaluating different ways to generate revenue, but right now we're just focusing on making the best product we can. 
 Q. Do you ever think about starting your parody site back up? There would be plenty of material these days.
 A. I guess I don't have that negative feeling that I had back then. Back then, I saw a lot of money being wasted, a lot of ridiculous companies. But I'm kind of liking what I see now. And the failures these days are banks and car companies. It's not so funny now.
 Q. But people lost jobs at pets.com and you had fun with that.
 A. Well, it's never funny when people lose jobs, and that was kind of the whole point of [the parody site]. It was kind of the voice of the worker. But I don't see mistakes like that anymore, companies like furniture.com where they would spend more to ship the furniture than they would make on the furniture -- so the more they sold, the faster they would go out of business. I think people have learned their lessons. The companies that don't have revenue streams today, it's by choice.
 Q. How is Blippy different from the kind of company that your site would have destroyed?
 A. [That site] covered companies that were spending millions and doing big layoffs. A recurring theme is, ''This company could be run by just three programmers and a pot of coffee.'' Which is exactly what we're doing. [That site] would be proud.

HEADLINE: M.T.A. Approves Big Service Cuts In Mass Transit

BYLINE: By MICHAEL M. GRYNBAUM

 BODY:
The Metropolitan Transportation Authority approved a punishing slate of service cuts on Wednesday that would amount to the most significant erosion of New York City's transit system since its recovery from the ruinous days of the 1980s.
 The cuts represent some of the first concrete consequences of a fiscal crisis in New York State that until now had mostly been restricted to ominous words from politicians. 
 The authority's board unanimously approved the plan -- which includes eliminating the W and Z subway lines, reducing service on dozens of bus routes, and phasing out free fares for students -- to cope with a $400 million shortfall in state financing that emerged in the past two weeks.
 ''The M.T.A. has become the first state agency to face the music of the national economic collapse,'' said Assemblyman Richard L. Brodsky, a Westchester Democrat. ''This is the opening refrain of a full symphony of pain that's going to hit other parts of the state next year.'' 
 None of the cuts will take effect until the spring, and the plan's more controversial elements have to be approved again next year, opening the door to months of public hand-wringing and political brinkmanship. Many public officials, for example, have vowed to preserve free rides for students. But any restoration of service cuts would probably require an influx of new revenue. That reality -- accompanied by pressure from politicians, riders and parents -- resurrected talk of ideas once thought politically untenable, like placing tolls on the free East River bridges.
 The plan also brought a sense of deja vu. A nearly identical slate of cuts was avoided earlier this year after a similar public outcry and a last-minute bailout from Albany legislators. 
 But officials insisted on Wednesday that this time was different. The state is staring at a $6.8 billion deficit, and Gov. David A. Paterson has already announced a delay on payments to schools and property owners. 
 ''I don't want to leave any impression that we're going to magically find a set of service changes that don't have a major impact,'' said Jay H. Walder, the chairman of the transportation authority.
 Still, even the chairman acknowledged that in the murky world of municipal politics, there was always some wiggle room. 
 ''This is the beginning, not the end,'' Mr. Walder said, moments before the budget was approved 12 to 0. He later added, ''We may be able to look at it, we may be able to do it a little bit better, and I, at least on a personal basis, would like a little bit of time and space to see how we might do that.'' 
 In its current form, the budget would reduce bus and subway service during late nights, weekday afternoons and weekends. Service on dozens of bus lines would be reduced or ended, and the agency would cut transportation options for disabled riders. Although the W and Z lines would be eliminated, passengers on those routes would not be abandoned: both lines run along tracks served by other subway routes.
 The authority also plans to lay off 700 workers, reduce management salaries by 10 percent and trim administrative costs. No fare increase was included in the plan, although a 7.5 percent rise is scheduled for 2011.
 The plan to phase out free or discounted fares for students, which the authority said would eventually save $170 million annually, earned a particularly fierce reaction on Wednesday, even by the standards of an agency that is a traditional target of New Yorkers' complaints.
 ''You sit here and bring anxieties to young children,'' declared Councilman Charles Barron, as he addressed the board in the fifth-floor boardroom of the authority's Madison Avenue headquarters. ''What do you want them to do? Jump the turnstiles and turn them into criminals?''
 Scott Stringer, the Manhattan borough president, chastised the authority's board for engaging in ''a budget dance that is quickly becoming known as the hustle.'' Another speaker compared the agency to Ebenezer Scrooge.
 While the board members acknowledged that the cuts were painful, they directed blame squarely at a state government that they said had failed its responsibility to adequately finance a basic public service.
 ''This agency is in an abusive relationship with two deadbeat dads,'' said Doreen M. Frasca, an appointee of Governor Paterson, referring to Albany and City Hall, which provide most of the authority's financing.
 ''If the Legislature and the governor think these deep service cuts are not going to impact them in an election year, they are sadly mistaken,'' said Andrew Albert, the chairman of the New York City Transit Riders' Council.
 Earlier this month, the authority appeared confident it could end the year on steady financial ground. Mr. Walder, who began his job in October, had laid out a lofty agenda of high-tech arrival-time clocks and a computerized fare-card system. 
 That optimism vanished after Albany delivered a double-whammy: $143 million was cut from the authority's budget, and revenues from a dedicated payroll tax -- enacted in the spring to avert service cuts -- came in $100 million below expectations. Last week, a court ruled that the authority must also pay big raises to its unionized workers.
 So it was with some surprise that Mr. Walder found himself on Wednesday delivering a sober assessment of the authority's shortcomings. 
 ''In the two months that I've been here, it's apparent to me that we don't operate in a way that ensures that every taxpayer dollar that we receive is being used as effectively as possible,'' he said. ''In short, we need to take the place apart.''
 While Mr. Walder said he would seek savings by trimming overtime payments and material costs, the authority's overall finances remain at the whims of higher powers. The governor can choose to restore or withdraw funds in his revised budget next month. And swings in the housing market would play a big role, since the authority derives much of its revenue from taxes on real estate transactions.
 Speaking to reporters this week, Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg invoked his ill-fated congestion pricing proposal, which would have charged people to drive in parts of Manhattan, as an elegant solution to the authority's troubles. The idea was echoed by transit advocates, even as the program's supporters speculated that the mayor had simply been speaking off the cuff. 
 Asked about the plan on Wednesday, Governor Paterson said he had no specific plans to revive the issue next year. 
 ''This parade of horribles puts pressure on Albany,'' said Gene Russianoff, staff attorney for the Straphangers Campaign, a riders' advocacy group. ''What Albany does in response to that pressure is hard to predict.''

HEADLINE: Iran Test-Fires Upgraded Version of Its Most Advanced Missile

BYLINE: By MICHAEL SLACKMAN; Mona El-Naggar contributed reporting.

DATELINE: CAIRO 

 BODY:
Iran announced Wednesday that it had test-fired an improved version of its most advanced missile, one capable of reaching Israel and parts of Europe, a move that appeared aimed at discouraging a military attack on its nuclear sites and to defy Western pressure over its nuclear program.
 But the Pentagon said the test, on Tuesday, did not reveal anything ''particularly different'' about Iran's abilities. 
 ''I'm not going to get into the particulars of what our intelligence shows other than to say I don't think there was anything here that was particularly different than what we've seen in the past,'' said Geoff Morrell, the Pentagon press secretary, Reuters reported. 
 Still, the announcement provoked immediate rebukes from the White House and leaders in Europe, and appeared likely to intensify pressure from the United States and other Western powers to impose tougher economic sanctions on Iran.
 A White House spokesman, Mike Hammer, said that the test undermined Iran's claims that its nuclear program was peaceful, and said that it would ''increase the seriousness and resolve of the international community to hold Iran accountable'' for its provocations, Reuters reported. 
 The British prime minister, Gordon Brown, said the missile test ''does make the case for us moving further on sanctions,'' according to The Associated Press. 
 Iranian television gave a brief report on Wednesday of a successful test of the two-stage, solid-fuel missile called a Sejil-2. Iran's defense minister, Ahmad Vahidi, said that the new missile was faster, more accurate and harder to shoot down than earlier versions and that it increased ''the country's technical and tactical powers,'' according to Iran's official news agency.
 Iran was clearly sending a warning to the West and to Israel, regional experts said.
 ''It shows that Iran has the ability to stir unrest in the region and impact U.S. interests,'' said Mustafa el-Labbad, director of the East Center for Regional and Strategic Studies in Cairo. ''It can reach the oil fields on the other side of the gulf.''
 Iran's test worsened already tense relations with the West over the breakdown in efforts to diplomatically resolve a dispute over its nuclear program. A deal in which Iran was to ship most of its low-enriched uranium abroad to be returned as higher processed fuel for a medical reactor was announced in October, but quickly became a political liability inside Iran. The Iranian government has tried to reshape the deal to something that could be sold at home, issuing terms the West has already rejected.
 At the same time, Iran's military has put on a show of force. Last month, the military staged five days of war games specifically aimed at discouraging an Israeli attack on its nuclear sites, and officials warned they could hit Tel Aviv if they chose.
 The latest missile test raises the stakes for negotiators and for Iran's neighbors.
 ''This is the missile of greatest concern at this point,'' said Valerie Lincy, a senior associate at the Wisconsin Project on Nuclear Arms Control, a nonprofit organization working to stem the proliferation of unconventional weapons that operates under the auspices of the University of Wisconsin. ''So the fact that they're testing it now is worrisome in of itself and worrisome if you put it in the context of what's going on with the nuclear program.''
 Though the range of this rocket is comparable to the liquid-fueled Shahab III, which Iran first obtained from North Korea, a solid-fuel rocket is easier to use on short notice, easier to hide from attack, and more accurate, experts said. 
 Iran's Revolutionary Guards, an ideologically driven military, political and economic powerhouse, controls both the missile program and the nuclear program. The West has accused Iran of trying to build nuclear weapons, which it has denied, insisting that it is developing civilian nuclear technology. As that conflict has burned for years, the Revolutionary Guards has worked aggressively to enhance the missile program.
 The decision to make this test comes against a backdrop of Iran's own internal political crisis touched off by the disputed presidential election in June. The Revolutionary Guards has taken control of internal security and has been uncompromising domestically and internationally. Internally, the corps leaders have called for arresting leaders of the reform movement and internationally they have rejected any compromise on the nuclear program.
 Political analysts said that the Revolutionary Guards might benefit from heightened conflict with the West and even from tougher sanctions, allowing the force to protect its economic and political interests.
 ''Iran is rational,'' Mr. Labbad said. ''It likes to appear as though it's crazy. But they know very well to what level they are escalating this to.''

HEADLINE: That Tap Water Is Legal but May Be Unhealthy

BYLINE: By CHARLES DUHIGG

 BODY:
The 35-year-old federal law regulating tap water is so out of date that the water Americans drink can pose what scientists say are serious health risks -- and still be legal. 
 Only 91 contaminants are regulated by the Safe Drinking Water Act, yet more than 60,000 chemicals are used within the United States, according to Environmental Protection Agency estimates. Government and independent scientists have scrutinized thousands of those chemicals in recent decades, and identified hundreds associated with a risk of cancer and other diseases at small concentrations in drinking water, according to an analysis of government records by The New York Times.
But not one chemical has been added to the list of those regulated by the Safe Drinking Water Act since 2000. 
 Other recent studies have found that even some chemicals regulated by that law pose risks at much smaller concentrations than previously known. However, many of the act's standards for those chemicals have not been updated since the 1980s, and some remain essentially unchanged since the law was passed in 1974. 
 All told, more than 62 million Americans have been exposed since 2004 to drinking water that did not meet at least one commonly used government health guideline intended to help protect people from cancer or serious disease, according to an analysis by The Times of more than 19 million drinking-water test results from the District of Columbia and the 45 states that made data available. 
 In some cases, people have been exposed for years to water that did not meet those guidelines. 
 But because such guidelines were never incorporated into the Safe Drinking Water Act, the vast majority of that water never violated the law. 
 Some officials overseeing local water systems have tried to go above and beyond what is legally required. But they have encountered resistance, sometimes from the very residents they are trying to protect, who say that if their water is legal it must be safe. 
 Dr. Pankaj Parekh, director of the water quality division for the City of Los Angeles, has faced such criticism. The water in some city reservoirs has contained contaminants that become likely cancer-causing compounds when exposed to sunlight. 
 To stop the carcinogens from forming, the city covered the surface of reservoirs, including one in the upscale neighborhood of Silver Lake, with a blanket of black plastic balls that blocked the sun.
 Then complaints started from owners of expensive houses around the reservoir. ''They supposedly discovered these chemicals, and then they ruined the reservoir by putting black pimples all over it,'' said Laurie Pepper, whose home overlooks the manmade lake. ''If the water is so dangerous, why can't they tell us what laws it's violated?''
 Dr. Parekh has struggled to make his case. ''People don't understand that just because water is technically legal, it can still present health risks,'' he said. ''And so we encounter opposition that can become very personal.''
 Some federal regulators have tried to help officials like Dr. Parekh by pushing to tighten drinking water standards for chemicals like industrial solvents, as well as a rocket fuel additive that has polluted drinking water sources in Southern California and elsewhere. But those efforts have often been blocked by industry lobbying. 
 Drinking water that does not meet a federal health guideline will not necessarily make someone ill. Many contaminants are hazardous only if consumed for years. And some researchers argue that even toxic chemicals, when consumed at extremely low doses over long periods, pose few risks. Others argue that the cost of removing minute concentrations of chemicals from drinking water does not equal the benefits. 
 Moreover, many of the thousands of chemicals that have not been analyzed may be harmless. And researchers caution that such science is complicated, often based on extrapolations from animal studies, and sometimes hard to apply nationwide, particularly given that more than 57,400 water systems in this country each deliver, essentially, a different glass of water every day. 
 Government scientists now generally agree, however, that many chemicals commonly found in drinking water pose serious risks at low concentrations. 
 And independent studies in such journals as Reviews of Environmental Contamination and Toxicology; Environmental Health Perspectives; American Journal of Public Health; and Archives of Environmental and Occupational Health, as well as reports published by the National Academy of Sciences, suggest that millions of Americans become sick each year from drinking contaminated water, with maladies from upset stomachs to cancer and birth defects. 
 Those studies have tracked hospital admissions and disease patterns after chemicals were detected in water supplies. They found that various contaminants were often associated with increased incidents of disease. That research -- like all large-scale studies of human illnesses -- sometimes cannot definitively say that chemicals in drinking water were the sole cause of disease.
 But even the E.P.A., which has ultimate responsibility for the Safe Drinking Water Act, has concluded that millions of Americans have been exposed to drinking water that fails to meet a federal health benchmark, according to records analyzed by The Times. (Studies and E.P.A. summaries can be found in the Resources section of nytimes.com/water.)
 Communities where the drinking water has contained chemicals that are associated with health risks include Scottsdale, Ariz.; El Paso, Tex., and Reno, Nev. Test results analyzed by The Times show their drinking water has contained arsenic at concentrations that have been associated with cancer. But that contamination did not violate the Safe Drinking Water Act. 
 In Millville, N.J., Pleasantville, N.J., and Edmond, Okla., drinking water has contained traces of uranium, which can cause kidney damage. Those concentrations also did not violate the law. (Contaminant records for each of the 47,500 water systems that provided data are at nytimes.com/contaminants.) 
 ''If it doesn't violate the law, I don't really pay much attention to it,'' said Stephen Sorrell, executive director of Emerald Coast Utilities Authority, which serves Pensacola, Fla. Data show that his system has delivered water containing multiple chemicals at concentrations that research indicates are associated with health risks. The system has not violated the Safe Drinking Water Act during the last half-decade.
 The Times analysis was based on water test data collected by an advocacy organization, the Environmental Working Group. The data, which contain samples from 2004 to this year, are from water systems that were required by law to test for certain contaminants and report findings to regulators. The data were verified by comparing a randomly selected sample against millions of state records obtained by The Times through public records requests. 
 The Times examined concentrations of 335 chemicals that government agencies have determined were associated with serious health risks. The analysis counted only instances in which the same chemical was detected at least 10 times for a single water system since 2004, at a concentration that the government has said poses at least a 1-in-10,000 risk of causing disease. 
 That is roughly equivalent to the cancer risk posed by undergoing 100 X-rays. (More information on data sources is at nytimes.com/water-data.) 
 Some local regulators say gaps in the Safe Drinking Water Act can put them in almost untenable positions. Los Angeles regulators, for instance, test more than 25,000 samples a year looking for poisons, industrial chemicals and radioactive elements. The water that the system delivers to more than four million residents is cleaner than required by law, according to state data. Dr. Parekh has lobbied for millions of dollars to build reservoirs and buy new treatment systems.
 But some residents doubt his motives. People affiliated with groups protesting water rate hikes have printed leaflets accusing him and other officials of ''fooling us into thinking that our city's water is not safe to drink!'' 
 Though the city's water rates are among the lowest in the state -- the average household pays $41 a month -- other residents have included Dr. Parekh's name on a poster naming ''water officials who want to steal your money.'' 
 In a statement, the E.P.A. said that a top priority of Lisa P. Jackson, who took over the agency in January, was improving how regulators assessed and managed chemical hazards. 
 ''Since chemicals are ubiquitous in our economy, our environment, our water resources and our bodies, we need better authority so we can assure the public that any unacceptable risks have been eliminated,'' the E.P.A. wrote. ''But, under existing law, we cannot give that assurance.''
 Ms. Jackson has asked Congress to amend laws governing how the E.P.A. assesses chemicals, and has issued policies to insulate the agency's scientific reviews from outside pressures. 
 But for now, significant risks remain, say former regulators.
 ''For years, people said that America has the cleanest drinking water in the world,'' said William K. Reilly, the E.P.A. administrator under President George H. W. Bush. ''That was true 20 years ago. But people don't realize how many new chemicals have emerged and how much more pollution has occurred. If they did, we would see very different attitudes.''
 Accumulating Threats
 The Safe Drinking Water Act was passed in 1974 after tests discovered carcinogens, lead and dangerous bacteria flowing from faucets in New Orleans, Pittsburgh and Boston and elsewhere. 
 At the time, so little was known about the chemicals in American waters that the law required local systems to monitor only 20 substances. (Private wells are not regulated by the act.)
 Over the next two decades, researchers at the E.P.A. began testing hundreds of chemicals, and Congress passed amendments strengthening the act. Eventually, the list of regulated substances increased to 91.
 In 2000, the list stopped growing. Since then, the rate at which companies and other workplaces have dumped pollutants into lakes and rivers has significantly accelerated, according to an earlier analysis by The Times of the Clean Water Act. 
 Government scientists have evaluated 830 of the contaminants most often found in water supplies, according to a review of records from the E.P.A. and the United States Geological Survey. They have determined that many of them are associated with cancer or other diseases, even at small concentrations. 
 Yet almost none of those assessments have been incorporated into the Safe Drinking Water Act or other federal laws. (A complete list of drinking water standards and health guidelines is at nytimes.com/water-data.) 
 For instance, the drinking water standard for arsenic, a naturally occurring chemical used in semiconductor manufacturing and treated wood, is at a level where a community could drink perfectly legal water, and roughly one in every 600 residents would likely develop bladder cancer over their lifetimes, according to studies commissioned by the E.P.A. and analyzed by The Times. Many of those studies can be found in the Resources section of nytimes.com/water. 
 That level of exposure is roughly equivalent to the risk the community would face if every person received 1,664 X-rays.
 And in some places, tap water contains not just one contaminant, but dozens. More than half of the systems analyzed by The Times had at least seven chemicals in their water. But there is nothing in the law that addresses the cumulative risks of multiple pollutants in a single glass of water, as some public health advocates have urged. 
 In a statement, the E.P.A. said that a 2003 review of Safe Drinking Water Act standards found that advances in science or technology had made it possible to tighten regulations of some chemicals. However, at the time, ''the agency decided that changes to these standards would not provide a meaningful opportunity for health risk reduction.''
 Another review of drinking water standards is under way, and results will be released soon, the agency says.
 Because some of the diseases associated with drinking water contamination take so long to emerge, people who become ill from their water might never realize the source, say public health experts.
 ''These chemicals accumulate in body tissue. They affect developmental and hormonal systems in ways we don't understand, '' said Linda S. Birnbaum, who as director of the National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences is the government's top official for evaluating environmental health effects. 
 ''There's growing evidence that numerous chemicals are more dangerous than previously thought, but the E.P.A. still gives them a clean bill of health.''
 Skepticism From Residents
 After six years of helping to build treatment systems to cleanse water of parasites and human waste in nations like Gambia and Liberia, Dr. Parekh was ready for a more relaxing life. So in 1986 he returned to Los Angeles, where he had earned graduate degrees in public health and environmental engineering, and joined the city's Department of Water and Power. 
 At the time, almost all of its drinking water came from the pristine Eastern Sierra to the northeast. Until the 1970s, Los Angeles regulators hadn't even bothered to filter it.
 But when Los Angeles lost some of its rights to that water, the city began relying more on ground water from the nearby San Fernando Basin, Northern California and nearby states. 
 Soon, Dr. Parekh and his colleagues started seeing evidence that those new supplies were contaminated. The San Fernando Basin contains a huge Superfund site -- an area so polluted by industry that the federal government has cleanup oversight -- and as pollution spread underground, the city had to abandon 40 percent of the area's wells. 
 Then, in October 2007, Dr. Parekh received a troubling call. A local laboratory was using tap water for experiments and had discovered compounds called bromates, which studies have associated with cancer. 
 Bromates are regulated by the Safe Drinking Water Act, but officials are required to test for them only when water leaves a treatment plant. Even after it was treated, Los Angeles's water contained certain contaminants that, when combined with cleaning chemicals and exposed to sunlight in reservoirs, had formed bromates. Those bromate concentrations did not break federal rules, but city workers thought they were unhealthy and worried they could eventually violate the law unless action was taken.
 Dr. Parekh's colleagues released more than 600 million gallons of contaminated water into the ocean. Then a member of Dr. Parekh's staff had an idea: to protect the drinking water from sunlight, cover the reservoirs with plastic balls. 
 The city bought 6.5 million dark balls -- similar to the kind McDonald's uses for its playground pits -- for about $2 million, and dumped them into reservoirs. Angry residents began attacking the city's regulators on blogs and leaving profane phone messages. A spokesman for the Los Angeles Department of Water and Power said he believed such complaints were not widespread. 
 Today, Los Angeles is drawing up plans for underground storage tanks. And Dr. Parekh and others are designing a treatment system that may cost as much as $800 million. The city has not determined how to pay those costs. 
 ''I drink my tap water. My 86-year-old mother drinks tap water,'' Dr. Parekh said. ''We work very hard to give this city the cleanest water in the state. But water sources are getting more polluted. If we just do what's required, it's not enough.''
 Polluters Push Back
 Earlier this decade, scientists at the E.P.A. began telling top agency officials that more needed to be done. Dr. Peter W. Preuss, who in 2004 became head of the E.P.A.'s division analyzing environmental risks, was particularly concerned. 
 So his department started assessing a variety of contaminants often found in drinking water, including perchlorate, an unregulated rocket fuel additive, as well as two regulated compounds, trichloroethylene, a degreaser used in manufacturing, and perchloroethylene or perc, a dry-cleaning solvent. Research indicated that those chemicals posed risks at smaller concentrations than previously known. Links to that research can be found in the Resources section of nytimes.com/water.
 But when E.P.A. scientists produced assessments indicating those chemicals were more toxic -- the first step in setting a standard for perchlorate and tougher standards for the other two substances -- businesses fought back by lobbying lawmakers and regulators and making public attacks.
 Military contractors, for example, said that regulations on perchlorate, which has been associated with stunted central nervous system development, would cost them billions of dollars in cleanup costs. In 2003, an Air Force colonel, Daniel Rogers, called an E.P.A. assessment of the chemical ''biased, unrealistic and scientifically imbalanced.'' Military officials told E.P.A. scientists they were unpatriotic for suggesting that bases were contaminated, according to people who participated in those discussions.
 Property owners who had rented space to dry cleaners lobbied lawmakers and top E.P.A. officials to remove government scientists from research on perc, which has been associated with some kinds of tumors, according to interviews with lobbyists. (Trichloroethylene has been associated with liver and kidney damage and cancer.)
 Soon, Dr. Preuss was told by some superiors that he might be dismissed if he continued pushing for extensive assessments of certain chemicals, he said.
 ''It's hard for me to describe the level of anger and animosity directed at us for trying to publish sound, scientific research that met the highest standards,'' Dr. Preuss said. ''It went way beyond what would be considered professional behavior.''
 Today, the Safe Drinking Water Act still does not regulate perchlorate or more than two dozen other substances that Dr. Preuss's department has analyzed over the last eight years. And standards for acceptable levels of trichloroethylene and perc have not changed in 18 years. 
 Those two chemicals have been detected in drinking water in more than a dozen states, including California, Massachusetts, New York and Oregon. A study published last week by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention found traces of perchlorate in every person examined by researchers.
 A Department of Defense official, who asked not to be named because of the sensitivities regarding perchlorate, said the military's perspective on the chemical had changed since 2005, and it now deferred to the E.P.A.'s assessments. Colonel Rogers did not reply to e-mail messages and calls seeking comment.
 ''We need action,'' said Senator Barbara Boxer, a California Democrat and chairwoman of the Environment and Public Works Committee, which oversees the Safe Drinking Water Act. ''E.P.A. has the authority to set new standards, but it wasn't used over the last eight years. There are people at risk.''
 In a statement, the E.P.A. said that standards for trichloroethylene and perc were under examination, and that a decision regarding perchlorate would be issued next year. 
 Dr. Preuss's department has also written, but not yet published, a much tougher assessment of arsenic, the most common contaminant that companies are forced to clean up at Superfund sites. The chemical is a case study in the complexities of establishing risk levels and how industries fight regulatory efforts.
 In 2000, the E.P.A. proposed setting a limit on arsenic in drinking water at five parts per billion -- roughly equivalent to one drop in 50 drums of water. But water systems and industries that use arsenic complained, arguing that the science was uncertain and the chemical was expensive to remove. Regulators relented, doubling the arsenic limit to 10 parts per billion.
 Since then, new studies have emerged, and interviews with more than 30 researchers as well as reports by the National Academy of Sciences indicate there is a general consensus on the dangers of arsenic at low concentrations. Those studies can be found in the Resources section of nytimes.com/water. 
 Dr. Parekh estimates that arsenic poses more of a risk to Los Angeles residents than any other contaminant in drinking water. 
 A decade's worth of evidence also indicates that the costs of removing arsenic from drinking water have often been smaller than initially estimated.
 But there is still a scientific debate over the costs and benefits of lowering the arsenic standard in drinking water. Many of the scientists opposed to new regulation receive funding from industries that use arsenic. But they raise concerns that underscore the difficulties of evaluating such risks.
 ''I think most people would say that, from a health perspective, setting an arsenic limit as close to zero as possible is best,'' said Kenneth Cantor, who recently retired from the National Cancer Institute. ''But we can't do controlled experiments where we expose some people to two parts per billion, and other people to eight parts per billion, and see which ones get more cancer. So there is some uncertainty, just as there is uncertainty in every scientific conclusion.'' 
 Some industry groups have financed studies that highlight that uncertainty. And industry lobbyists have urged sympathetic lawmakers and officials to complain about tougher risk assessments, according to interviews and correspondence provided by E.P.A. employees or obtained through the Freedom of Information Act.
 Those lobbying efforts have succeeded, to a degree. Some officials from the Department of Agriculture and E.P.A. staff members have pushed back, and some said that a stricter arsenic assessment would have ''disastrous impacts,'' according to a confidential memo from one of the E.P.A.'s regional offices, and would present ''a severe challenge in communicating risk information'' to the public. The new assessment ''lacks common sense'' and is ''unexpected and bewildering,'' another memo argued. 
 Other critics have said that Dr. Preuss's assessment will affect not just water regulations, but also toxicity estimates for anything containing arsenic.
 ''If the science is uncertain, and there are enormous costs associated with more regulation, maybe we should wait for certainty,'' said Robert C. LaGasse, executive director of the Mulch and Soil Council, who has met with the E.P.A. on this issue. ''Arsenic naturally occurs in soils and fertilizer. This could have a chilling effect on gardening.'' 
 Dr. Preuss said such concerns should not shape scientific evaluations. ''It is our job to follow the science, and when a preponderance of evidence indicates there is a risk, we should say so,'' he said.
 In May, Ms. Jackson, the E.P.A. head, announced reforms to protect agency scientists like Dr. Preuss from outside pressures. Dr. Preuss said he was an enthusiastic supporter of Ms. Jackson's efforts, and believed the arsenic assessment would be published without interference.
 ''But there are still tens of thousands of chemicals we haven't assessed,'' he added. ''If you don't know what's dangerous, you can't write laws against it.''
 Risky -- and Legal
 The effects of pollution are clear throughout the Los Angeles area. In Santa Monica, officials have shut wells contaminated by a gasoline additive that is not regulated by the Safe Drinking Water Act. In Pomona, a collegetown to the east, water supplies contain chemicals dumped by manufacturing and agricultural companies.
 And in Maywood, a city of 30,000 just southeast of downtown Los Angeles, tap water is often brown and tastes bitter, say residents. Many people don't own white clothing, because they complain it becomes stained when it is washed. 
 Last month, Carlos Husman drew a bath for his 4-month-old granddaughter that was filled with what looked like particles of rust and dirt, staining the sides of the bathtub.
 Maywood is only one square mile, but has three water systems. All are privately owned, so local officials have no real power except forcing them to follow federal and state regulations. About three-quarters of the nation's water systems are private entities, beholden only to their shareholders and the law.
 Laboratory tests show Maywood's tap water has contained toxic levels of mercury, lead, manganese and other chemicals that have been associated with liver and kidney damage, neurological diseases or cancer.
 But when Maywood's residents asked for cleaner water, they were told what was flowing from the taps satisfied the Safe Drinking Water Act, and so the managers didn't have to do more. 
 Indeed, some of the chemicals in Mr. Husman's water -- like manganese, which has been associated with Parkinson's disease -- are essentially unregulated, and so the water system isn't required to remove them, even when particles float in a glass.
 ''When I shower in the morning, it looks like blood,'' Mr. Husman said. ''How can the government see this water, know it contains dangerous chemicals, and say it's legal?''
 When a city council member named Felipe Aguirre lobbied for cleaner water, anonymous leaflets arrived. ''Felipe Aguirre has deceived the citizens of Maywood!'' one reads. ''Felipe Aguirre does not care that Maywood residents will be paying more for water already safe to drink!'' another says. ''Do you want this liar and corrupt politician to decide the future of Maywood and its residents?''
 Water system managers say their water is safe. ''If it wasn't, the E.P.A. or the state would tell us to change,'' said Gustavo Villa, general manager of Maywood Mutual Water Company No. 2. Before taking his job in 2006, Mr. Villa drove 18-wheeler trucks, and had no experience running a water system. He said the system was trying to install machinery to remove some manganese, but halted construction because of missing permits.
 Lawmakers on Capitol Hill and in state legislatures have pursued options that could help Maywood and other cities. The California Legislature, for instance, this year passed a bill focused on Maywood that would revoke permits from the town's water systems if they cannot ''deliver safe, wholesome and potable drinking water.''
 In May, the Senate Environment and Public Works Committee passed the Water Infrastructure Financing Act, which, if approved by Congress and signed by President Obama, would authorize $14.7 billion in loans to help states improve their systems. 
 And the E.P.A. recently said it would analyze a host of chemicals -- known as endocrine disruptors -- that some scientists have associated with cancer and other diseases. Congress called for such tests in 1996, but the agency failed to meet deadlines for 13 years. 
 In the meantime, regulators struggle to explain to residents that even legal drinking water can pose risks. Some of them have recommended that people use home water filters.
 Most people don't comprehend the complicated scientific papers that describe cancer risks, Dr. Parekh said. ''And if the law is working, they don't have to,'' he added. ''But in this new world, where pollution is so much more common, they may have to learn to understand it.''

HEADLINE: Florida Governor Signs Bill To Expand Rail Service

BYLINE: By DAMIEN CAVE; Gary Fineout contributed reporting from Tallahassee, Fla.

DATELINE: MIAMI 

 BODY:
Gov. Charlie Crist signed a package of legislation into law on Wednesday that seeks to shore up commuter rail service in South Florida, add service in the state's center and win billions of dollars in federal money for a bullet train linking Tampa and Orlando. 
 At a news conference in Tallahassee, Mr. Crist said the measure would create a framework for future rail projects, modernize travel and energize Florida's economy. ''These rail projects mean more economic opportunity and more jobs for the people of Florida,'' he said. 
 The rail plan, however, has been controversial among the governor's fellow Republicans. Several lawmakers and Marco Rubio -- a former speaker of the Florida House who is challenging Mr. Crist for the Republican Senate nomination -- have questioned the plan's cost, as well as the governor's willingness to steer Florida toward President Obama's stimulus program.
 Mr. Crist did not mention the stimulus Wednesday. He has recently softened his support after criticism from conservative Republicans, including Mr. Rubio. 
 But an analysis of the bill by the Florida House says the State Department of Transportation is requesting $3.2 billion for four projects under a program that is part of the stimulus package.
 That includes $2.6 billion to build high-speed rail between Tampa and Orlando and $30 million to study extending the service to Miami. It also includes a request for $268 million to ''restore and enhance'' rail service along 350 miles of Florida's east coast between Jacksonville and Miami, and $270 million to subsidize the state's proposed purchase of track in central Florida for a commuter service known as SunRail. 
 The federal Transportation Department is expected to announce its awards this winter, and state lawmakers have said that was a catalyst for the special session this month that produced the rail legislation. 
 Supporters have said the package -- which adds $15 million for Tri-Rail in South Florida, and sets aside $60 million for rail statewide, starting in 2014 -- would promote ''smart growth'' and transform the state's economy. 
 But Alex Burgos, a spokesman for Mr. Rubio, criticized Mr. Crist for again ''putting his faith in government to create jobs instead of the private sector.'' 
 State Senator Paula Dockery, a Republican from central Florida who is running for governor, also condemned the bill. She said the state was using ''fuzzy math'' to promise thousands of jobs immediately, instead of spread over three decades. And, she said, the state is overpaying the railroad operator CSX for SunRail tracks, while opening itself up to liability for accidents caused by the company's freight trains. 
 Ms. Dockery is also at the center of a dispute over how the legislation was drafted. Her office filed a public records request last month for all e-mail related to the bill, and among the thousands of messages produced by the State Department of Transportation, three used breakfast foods in the subject line -- ''pancake,'' ''Pancakes'' and ''French Toast.'' 
 Each had no text, just attachments about the bill, leading Ms. Dockery to accuse state officials of ''using code words in an effort to disguise the true content.'' 
 Transportation Secretary Stephanie Kopelousos has said the subject lines were simply to get her attention, but Mr. Crist directed the state's chief inspector general Tuesday to investigate. 
 Ms. Dockery is still waiting on a follow-up request for all e-mail messages ''containing breakfast food related words, including but not limited to: pancake, French toast, bacon, egg, cereal, waffle, grits, and sausage.''

HEADLINE: A Legacy of Regret for a Saudi Diplomat

BYLINE: By MICHAEL SLACKMAN; Mona El-Naggar contributed reporting.

DATELINE: RIYADH, Saudi Arabia 

 BODY:
The year that Prince Saud al-Faisal was appointed foreign minister of Saudi Arabia, Gerald R. Ford was president of the United States, the Vietnam War ended and Microsoft had just opened its doors. 
 Prince Saud, a member of the ruling Saud family, is the world's longest-serving foreign minister. He was appointed in 1975, and for nearly 35 years he has represented a nation whose oil wealth and religious importance to Muslims remains unrivaled. And yet, he said that after all those years, his legacy might be defined more by profound disappointment than by success. His generation of Arab leaders failed, he said, to produce a Palestinian state.
 ''We have not yet seen moments of joy in all that time,'' the prince said in a recent interview in his office here in the Saudi capital. ''We have seen only moments of crisis; we have seen only moments of conflict, and how can you have any pleasure in anything that happens when you have people like the Palestinians living as they are?'' 
 This is a time of urgency not only for Prince Saud but also for most of the leaders of Saudi Arabia's ruling family. After decades in power, age and illness are forcing them to confront their mortality.
 King Abdullah is 85 years old, and while still appearing robust, he is old enough to have inspired talk of succession. Crown Prince Sultan, who became defense minister in 1962, returned home on Friday after treatment in the United States for cancer and a period of convalescence in Morocco. The expectation now is that the next king will be Prince Nayef, 76, the interior minister since 1975, who has close ties to the nation's conservative religious community.
 Prince Saud is 69 and was once seen as a potential candidate for monarch. But he, too, has serious health issues. He recently returned home after having surgery in California. While the details of his health problems remain private, his physical appearance has clearly diminished. A once vigorous man who commanded his gold-trimmed Arabian robes with flair, he now holds his gown wrapped tight like a blanket. He struggles to hold himself upright, while his head and neck tip forward. 
 His staff says that he is back to his relentless schedule, traveling the world, holding meetings, consulting with the king. In the interview he was precise, carefully choosing his words. His message was that the central factor in regional stability remained the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. 
 During his career, he has been the public face and voice of a nation that has preferred to remain in the background, pursing quiet diplomacy, using its oil wealth to spread its influence and agenda. But that approach, the Saudis' ties with Washington and a willingness to push for peace with Israel have also earned the nation enmity from around the region.
 ''When he comes to assess his 35 years as foreign minister, from the first day until today, what has he accomplished for the Palestinian cause? Nothing,'' said Emad Gad, an international affairs expert at the Ahram Center for Political and Strategic Studies in Cairo. ''And he is the foreign minister of the No. 1 or No. 2 country in the region for more than 30 years.'' 
 That assessment clearly stings for a man who has been well regarded for his poise and intellect in capitals around the world, but it is one he does not deny. 
 ''Peace until now has been like holding water or sand in your hand,'' the prince said. ''You see the amount of water, you think you can hold something in your hand, but it falls away. Sand is the same thing. So unless there is something to hold in your hand and to point to as a success and as an achievement, then you have done nothing.''
 His full name is Prince Saud bin Faisal bin Abdul Aziz al-Saud. His father, King Faisal, who forged the close ties between Riyadh and Washington, was assassinated in 1975 when a nephew shot him at point-blank range. One brother, Prince Turki, was the head of Saudi intelligence who went on to serve as ambassador to Britain and for a short time as ambassador to the United States. Another brother, Prince Khalid, is the governor of Mecca.
 Prince Saud has a degree in economics from Princeton, and his official profile says that he speaks seven languages. He is married, with six children, and is a warm man, with a sense of humor and a willingness uncommon within the royal family to speak publicly and to talk to reporters. As the representative of an absolute monarchy, he has influence, but not final say.
 ''The influence of individuals is limited because it is the vision of the king that prevails through his advisers,'' Mr. Gad said. ''Prince Saud served for three kings, with each having his own leanings. He is not a decision maker; he executes policies.''
 These days, he is promoting the king's initiative, which calls for Arab unity, a project that so far has gained attention but little traction. He also offered his thoughts on some of the hot topics of the day. He said that Lebanon could never be truly sovereign as long as the Shiite militia Hezbollah ''owns more arms than the military force of the country.'' 
 He said that Iran should never be allowed to have nuclear weapons, and that he was ''suspicious'' of Iranian claims to be pursuing a peaceful nuclear program. He said Israel also should be pressed to give up its nuclear arsenal.
 ''The danger of this is that there has never ever been a weapon that has been brought in this region but that has not been used,'' he said. 
 But as he pulled his robe close and reflected on his tenure as Saudi Arabia's chief diplomat, his thoughts returned to the Palestinians. The burning crisis, he said, has ruined Palestinian lives and left the region staggering from crisis to crisis.
 ''The absolute backing of the United States to Israel has had the effect that rather than making Israel safe for making peace, it has made Israel see the option of living in the area without the acceptance of the people of the area,'' he said, ''and this has led to many years of conflict between Israel and the Palestinians.''

HEADLINE: In Senate Health Showdown, Round Goes to G.O.P.

BYLINE: By ROBERT PEAR

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
On the 17th day of Senate debate on health legislation, it came down to this: A rock-ribbed conservative physician from Oklahoma squared off against a self-described democratic socialist from Vermont who was hoping for a full-throated debate on his proposal to establish a system of ''Medicare for all.'' The Oklahoman, Senator Tom Coburn, a Republican, had propounded a unanimous-consent request, stipulating that no amendment could be offered unless it had been publicly available for 72 hours, with an estimate of its costs.
 Senator Max Baucus, Democrat of Montana and chairman of the Finance Committee, objected. 
 Minutes later, Senator Bernard Sanders, independent of Vermont, called up his amendment. ''For the first time in American history,'' Mr. Sanders said, ''the Senate will debate a proposal to create a single-payer, Medicare-for-all health care system.''
 Not so fast.
 Mr. Coburn objected to Mr. Sanders's request to dispense with the reading of the 767-page amendment. 
 So a relay team of Senate clerks began reading the proposal. After nearly three hours, Mr. Sanders threw in the towel and withdrew his amendment.
 The conflict on Wednesday illustrated the frustration growing in both parties after more than two weeks of desultory debate, as Senate Democrats struggle to line up 60 votes and pass their health care bill before Christmas. 
 Democrats said Republicans were stalling and obstructing the most important social legislation in decades.
 Republicans said Mr. Sanders had candidly avowed a goal that many Democrats secretly shared: a government takeover of health care.
 ''I admire Senator Sanders for his willingness to fight publicly for what many advocate only privately: a single-payer health care system funded and controlled by bureaucrats and politicians in Washington,'' Mr. Coburn said.
 The No. 2 Democrat in the Senate, Richard J. Durbin of Illinois, said Mr. Coburn was pursuing a ''clear strategy'' with support from Senate Republican leaders. 
 ''What this is all about is to bring down health care reform,'' Mr. Durbin said.
 The delays jeopardize not only health care legislation, he said, but also a separate bill that provides money for the military and for extended unemployment insurance benefits.
 The Senate Republican leader, Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, said the Democrats, led by Senator Harry Reid of Nevada, were ''pressing ahead in a blind rush of frantic deal-making to find 60 votes by Christmas,'' even though opinion polls showed growing opposition to the bill.
 Senator Jim DeMint, Republican of South Carolina, said, ''If Senator Reid won't slow down this debate, we will do it for him.''
 Mr. Sanders was sputtering. ''The best the Republicans can do is to try to bring the United States government to a halt,'' he said. ''It's an outrage, a disgrace. It explains why so many people have contempt for Washington.''
 To win the elusive 60th vote, Mr. Reid on Wednesday stepped up efforts to work out a compromise restricting the use of federal money for insurance covering abortion. 
 Those efforts focused, in particular, on Senator Ben Nelson, Democrat of Nebraska, an opponent of abortion who said he had not decided how he would vote on the legislation.
 Aides to Mr. Nelson said he was studying a proposal on abortion that he received on Wednesday from Senator Bob Casey, Democrat of Pennsylvania, who had been asked by Democratic leaders to try to draft a compromise. 
 Mr. Nelson had no immediate comment on the proposal, but said: ''This is not an issue where you can split the difference. That's what makes it so challenging.''
 In an interview on Wednesday, Richard M. Doerflinger, a spokesman on abortion for the United States Conference of Catholic Bishops, said that the bishops appreciated the goals of some of Mr. Casey's proposals, but that none of the proposals addressed the fundamental concern of the use of taxpayer money to subsidize insurance that includes coverage of abortion. 
 Mr. Nelson dismissed suggestions that Democratic leaders had tried to win his support for the health care bill by offering several hundred million dollars for projects in Nebraska.
 ''My vote is not for sale,'' he said. He also said he was concerned that the bill would raise taxes, impose costly new requirements on states and reduce access to health care by curbing Medicare payments to some providers, including nursing homes and home-care agencies. 
 On the other hand, Mr. Nelson said, he wants to help people get affordable coverage, and the bill would do that.
 Senator Mary L. Landrieu, Democrat of Louisiana, said her reservations about the bill had been addressed with the decision to strip out a new government-run health plan and the proposed expansion of Medicare.
 Senate Democratic leaders said they would probably accept two contentious proposals by Senator John D. Rockefeller IV, Democrat of West Virginia. One would increase the powers of a proposed new agency to limit the growth of health spending, including payments to hospitals.
 The other proposal would require insurers to spend a specified share of premiums -- at least 85 percent -- on clinical services and activities that improve the quality of care. This would, in effect, limit the profits of insurers.

HEADLINE: Senator Lieberman and the Health Care Uproar

 BODY:
To the Editor:
 Re ''Lieberman Gets Ex-Party to Shift on Health Plan'' (front page, Dec. 15):
 Since Senator Joseph I. Lieberman and the health care lobby have succeeded in gutting the reform bill of anything resembling reform, I propose the following: 
 Kill the current Senate bill, as Howard Dean suggested (''Health Care Talks Show Sharp Democratic Divide,'' news article, Dec. 16). It is no longer health care reform, and with the mandates in place it represents a huge transfer from taxpayers to the health insurance industry.
 Then go back to the drawing board and pass a simpler health care reform package with the following components:
 First, lower the Medicare age to 55. Second, give Medicare serious bargaining power over the drug companies and health care providers. Finally, enact real tort reform.
 This is doable and more affordable than the Senate bill, and it would definitely start to ''bend the curve'' and reduce costs. It would also take a huge amount of pressure off American companies and help to jump-start the economy.
 Aaron Thomas Seattle, Dec. 16, 2009
 To the Editor:
 Re ''The Million-Dollar Man'' (editorial, Dec. 16):
 I'm old enough that I can remember when Senator Joseph I. Lieberman was generally considered a man of integrity. It is sad to see him descend to his current ''le Senat, c'est moi'' attitude. 
 Of course, as you note in your editorial, a million dollars can be persuasive. But I would not describe Mr. Lieberman as an independent. He is behaving like a wholly owned subsidiary of the insurance industry and bringing no credit on himself as he moves toward the end of his long career.

PERSON: F. William McCalpin 

HEADLINE: F. William McCalpin, Champion of Legal Aid to Poor, Dies at 88

BYLINE: By DENNIS HEVESI

 BODY:
F. William McCalpin, one of the earliest advocates and most vocal defenders of the Legal Services Corporation, a federal program that has provided legal aid to millions of poor people, died Dec. 9 at his home in St. Louis. He was 88.
 The cause was complications from a fall, his son William said. 
 Mr. McCalpin, who butted heads with the Reagan administration when it sought to eliminate the program he had long championed, was chairman of the corporation from 1979 through 1981 and a member of its board from 1993 to 2003.
 Legal Services was created by Congress in 1974 with the backing of President Richard M. Nixon and, with federal financing, today supports 137 organizations in all 50 states. The organizations offer legal representation to about one million poor people involved in noncriminal cases and legal advice to five million more. 
 In 1981, President Ronald Reagan tried to abolish the Legal Services Corporation by cutting its $321 million allocation from the federal budget. Reagan had long maintained that legal aid lawyers were activists too willing to pursue their own vision of the public interest. 
 Over the years, legal aid lawyers have filed many class-action and law-reform suits, among them efforts to force federal, state and local governments to pay benefits mandated by social welfare legislation, to improve hospital services for the poor and to improve prison conditions. The lawyers have spent most of their time, however, on routine matters like family disputes, disability claims and landlord-tenant problems.
 ''It is ironic -- no, tragic -- that this record of positive achievement is met with the most fundamental attack on the program since it was created,'' Mr. McCalpin said in March 1981 in testimony before a House Judiciary subcommittee.
 Eliminating the program, he said, would amount to a denial of the nation's commitment to equal justice under law, ''putting a price tag on justice, just like a Cadillac or a yacht.'' 
 Congress restored the corporation's financing.
 ''Bill was very proud to be a Republican,'' Victor M. Fortuno, the corporation's current vice president for legal affairs, said Monday in an interview. ''But he was also very supportive of the notion of equal access to justice and the availability of legal services to the poor. He stood for that and fought for that his entire professional career.''
 Mr. McCalpin was chairman of the American Bar Association's Committee on the Availability of Legal Services from 1965 to 1970; chairman of the bar association's Committee on Legal Aid and Indigent Defendants from 1973 to 1976, and again from 1983 to 1985; and chairman of its Commission on Legal Problems of the Elderly from 1996 to 2002.
 He was also director of the Legal Aid Society of St. Louis from 1965 to 1970; president of the Missouri Legal Aid Society in 1977 and 1978; and president of the National Legal Aid and Defender Association from 1989 to 1992. 
 ''He was one of the early leaders of the bar in the evolution of the movement, and acted with great principle in championing the rights of poor people,'' Carolyn B. Lamm, the president of the American Bar Association, said Tuesday.
 Francis William McCalpin was born in St. Louis on Nov. 8, 1921, one of three children of George and Marguerite Miles McCalpin. His father was a stockbroker. 
 Besides his son William, he is survived by his wife of 55 years, the former Margaret Wickes; another son, David; three daughters, Martha Staley, Katherine Winfrey and Lucy McCalpin; his brother, George; his sister, Mary Moss; and 18 grandchildren.
 Mr. McCalpin graduated from St. Louis University in 1942 with a bachelor's degree in economics, then served in the Marines in the Pacific. He was later recalled into the Marines during the Korean War.
 He received his law degree from Harvard in 1948 and was soon hired by a law firm in St. Louis.
 ''Early on in his legal career, he was assigned poor clients by the courts,'' William McCalpin said of his father. ''I remember one client, Gerald Thomas, who served time for burglary. My father bought Christmas presents, and we took them over to the family. He thought there should be a more organized way to represent poor people.''

HEADLINE: In South Carolina, House Panel Votes to Keep Embattled Governor

BYLINE: By SHAILA DEWAN

 BODY:
Gov. Mark Sanford of South Carolina may have lost his wife after his tearful confession that he had traveled to Argentina as part of a yearlong extramarital affair, but he almost certainly will not lose his office. 
 The state House Judiciary Committee voted, 18 to 6, on Wednesday to kill a resolution to impeach the embattled governor, less than a week after his wife, Jenny Sanford, announced that she had filed for divorce on grounds of adultery. She waited until after a special panel of lawmakers said last week that it would recommend against impeachment. 
 Governor Sanford, 49, a Republican, issued a statement after the committee vote thanking the committee for its ''deliberative approach'' and ''reasonable decision.'' 
 ''As we've consistently said, this administration has tried to be a stalwart ally of the taxpayer, and will remain so for the next 13 months,'' he said.
 The committee voted unanimously for a resolution to censure the governor for dereliction of duty, official misconduct and abuses of power that ''brought ridicule and dishonor to himself, the State of South Carolina, and to its citizens.'' 
 The censure resolution will go to the House floor when the Legislature convenes in January, but would have no practical effect on the governor, who had already been engaged in years of political warfare with the Republican-dominated Legislature when he admitted to the affair in June.
 ''I don't think he was effective before this occurred, and I don't think he'll be effective after this has passed,'' said State Representative Jim Harrison, a Republican and chairman of the Judiciary Committee.
 The committee's vote came after indications that the public was growing weary of the effort to impeach a governor with only one year left in office as the state faces a budget deficit and high unemployment. 
 Statewide polls have indicated that the zeal to remove the governor, never particularly high, was waning, and Representative Ralph Anderson, a Democrat, wrote on an op-ed page for a South Carolina newspaper, ''Our efforts should be directed at more urgent matters.''
 Still, some lawmakers warned that they were setting a dangerous precedent by failing to crack down on Mr. Sanford's conduct. Representative F. Gregory Delleney Jr., the Republican who wrote the impeachment resolution, said the governor had ''lost all moral authority.'' Mr. Delleney was one of two Republicans and four Democrats to vote in favor of impeachment. 
 The impeachment resolution said Mr. Sanford had ''directed members of his staff in a manner that caused them to deceive and mislead the public.'' Mr. Sanford's staff members had said that he was hiking the Appalachian Trail at the time he was visiting his mistress in Argentina.
 But a majority of the lawmakers felt the governor's actions did not rise to the level of ''serious crimes or serious misconduct'' that are grounds for impeachment in the State Constitution. 
 Mr. Sanford still faces charges before the State Ethics Commission alleging that he misused state airplanes, used taxpayer money to buy business-class airline tickets, and misspent campaign donations. And the state attorney general could still level criminal charges against him related to the ethics complaints.

HEADLINE: Economy Doesn't Slow Demand for Early Entry to College

BYLINE: By JACQUES STEINBERG

 BODY:
James S. Miller, the dean of admissions at Brown University, figured this could be the year that the frantic demand for admission under binding early-decision programs might begin to subside. After all, under such programs, admitted students cannot seek competing financial aid offers. 
 And yet, the Brown admissions office received nearly 500 more early applications this fall than it did last year, when the economic downturn was just beginning, an increase of 20 percent. 
 ''I wish I knew the answer why,'' Mr. Miller said in a telephone interview. ''The university president asked me, and I told her I just don't know.''
 Other institutions have experienced similar increases this fall. Duke, Northwestern, Cornell, Columbia, Johns Hopkins and Dartmouth said that they, too, received substantially more applications for their early-decision programs this year than they did last -- though Cornell, Brown and Hopkins said they had admitted fewer students early than they did a year ago.
 Other colleges, including Wesleyan, Emory, Pomona and Grinnell, drew about as many early applications this fall as they did last fall. Each of those programs requires students to withdraw all other applications and attend if admitted.
 ''The fear of not getting in is a trump card,'' said Jon Reider, director of college counseling at San Francisco University High School, a private school, and a former admissions officer at Stanford. ''That fear is more powerful than any piece of factual information, such as, 'Gee, colleges are having a hard time with financial aid, maybe we should cast our net fairly widely and not jump the gun and throw our eggs all in one basket.' ''
 Not all colleges held their ground, however. Yale and Williams saw a drop in early applications. 
 For the colleges, which sent notifications to early-admission applicants this week, the calculus appears to have been more complicated than for the applicants. While early-decision candidates are some of the savviest, most talented -- and, yes, financially flush -- students, the increase in early-decision applications did not necessarily translate into a surge of offers of admission. 
 Cornell, for example, received 136 more applications this fall for its binding early-decision program than it did last fall, but accepted 103 fewer students than last year.
 While nearly 40 percent of the seats in next year's freshman class at Cornell are now reserved, the university has still allowed itself much flexibility for the main round of admission, when most students will apply. Moreover, colleges like Cornell are committed to assembling the most diverse classes possible -- including racially and socio-economically diverse classes -- and many of those who apply early tend to be white and of some means.
 ''Colleges are hesitant to go beyond a certain line when it comes to the percentage of the incoming class that they obtain through early decision,'' said David Hawkins, director of public policy and research for the National Association for College Admission Counseling. ''They're aware of the research, and the potential inequities they might produce if they cross that line.''
 Still, it is difficult to find a clear theme in all the colleges' application figures for this fall. Williams, which has a binding early-admission program, received 73 fewer applications this fall, a drop of 13.5 percent. And Yale -- which has a nonbinding early program, but which requires that its early applicants apply to no other early programs -- received nearly 300 fewer applications, a drop of 5 percent.
 And yet, Stanford, which has a program similar to Yale's, got 183 more applications than last fall, an increase of 4 percent. And early applications to the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, another nonbinding program, surged by 13 percent.
 In response to criticisms of early programs in recent years as the province of the elite (and the plugged-in), Harvard and the University of Virginia are among a handful of institutions that have discontinued their early programs.
 Some college counselors -- including Bill McClintick, a counselor at Mercersburg Academy in Pennsylvania, and a former president of the National Association for College Admission Counseling -- said some students at his school had bypassed binding early programs this fall to preserve their financial options.
 Mr. Reider of San Francisco University High School said several of his students had made similar decisions to wait.
 ''I have to write a lot of recommendation letters now,'' he said.

HEADLINE: Cut by the M.T.A.: Free Rides for Students

 BODY:
To the Editor:
 Re ''M.T.A. Approves Big Service Cuts in Mass Transit'' (front page, Dec. 17):
 The cuts approved by the Metropolitan Transportation Authority are a disheartening sign of the priorities of New Yorkers. If the M.T.A. stops providing free student fares, it will cost families an additional $810 a student per year. This approaches 2 percent of the median yearly household income in New York City per child -- clearly a major burden for our low-income families. 
 The city, the state and the M.T.A. should dig deep to find other areas from which to trim to provide our children with the transportation necessary for their education. We must avoid a situation in which a lack of subway or bus fare becomes an excuse for missing school. 
 Cuts in service are acceptable in difficult economic times, but cuts into our children's future are not.
 Ryan Field New York, Dec. 17, 2009
 To the Editor:
 When the subway fare rose from 5 to 10 cents many years ago, parents were upset because it would make it more difficult for their children to get to school. It was then that the idea of the free ride for students was born. This was back in the days when most children, at least until high school, attended neighborhood schools within walking distance of their homes.
 Today, with charter schools and students no longer guaranteed seats in their local zoned schools, a large percentage of students must use public transportation. With the cost of a ride $2.25 each way, eliminating free rides for students makes the cost of getting them to school prohibitive, especially in families with several children. And with many people jobless, and unemployment benefits running out, having to come up with that kind of money may be impossible.
 School attendance should not be influenced by family economics! Let's find another way to balance the budget.
 Hannah S. Hess New York, Dec. 17, 2009

HEADLINE: As Good as Having an Uncle in the Business

BYLINE: By FELICIA R. LEE

 BODY:
ON a recent frigid Thursday night about 300 people sipped wine, knitted and tapped their feet as they listened to the music of the ZigZag Quartet. The evening was notable for the group's range -- from classical to jazz to Brazilian samba -- and because it took place at Lincoln Center's newest space, the David Rubenstein Atrium, which officially opened this week. And the price was right too. Nothing. ''Free is a big attraction,'' said Tuesday Brooks, a media consultant who had traveled with her husband and 7-year-old son from Harlem to the atrium, on Broadway between 62nd and 63rd Streets. ''When I mentioned to people I was coming here tonight, several people had already heard about it. Everyone is looking for a bargain.''
 Between the squeeze of the recession and the annual appetite for holiday entertainment, the hunt for a good, cheap evening out has reached new heights. And free, to quote Ms. Brooks, is a big attraction. With New Yorkers and tourists alike struggling to balance their budgets with their love for culture, this city is at once the home of sticker shock (a premium Broadway ticket can go for $300) as well as the bargain ticket, the freebie and the discount. 
 Despite the strains of the economy, attendance at cultural events is up across the board, Kate D. Levin, the city's cultural affairs commissioner, said. People are ''looking beyond marquee names'' and casting a wider net,'' she added. ''There is such an array of offerings at so many price points there is something for everyone. A lot of organizations with higher ticket prices have rush tickets or other discounts. It's a pretty robust picture out there.''
 NYC & Company, which promotes tourism to the city, compiles an extensive list of free events online at nycgo.com/free, while the Cultural Affairs Departrment's site, nyc.gov/nyculture, lists dozens of free and low-cost events and performances, by date and by category. This Saturday, for instance, you can take part in the annual Christmas Bird Count in Prospect Park or watch a performance of ''A Christmas Carol'' at the New York Public Library at 42nd Street and Fifth Avenue, presented at 3 p.m. by the Traveling Lantern Theater Company. Both are free. (Some of the best bargains in the city can be found at libraries in all five boroughs.)
 Target, which sponsored the 8:30 p.m. Rubenstein Atrium performance as part of a new Free Thursdays series there, also underwrites free programs at museums, including Friday nights at the Museum of Modern Art and First Saturdays at the Brooklyn Museum, which often include performances.
 If you have a taste for up-and-coming performers, most events at Juilliard (juilliard.edu) are free or have a nominal charge. More than 700 are offered during the academic year, including drama and dance division productions, Juilliard Orchestra performances (except concerts in Avery Fisher and Carnegie Halls), jazz concerts, recitals and master classes.
 Then there are performances whose cost might be described as ''next to nothing,'' especially compared with the top seats at holiday entertainments like New York City Ballet's ''Nutcracker,'' at the David H. Koch Theater ($215), or the Cirque du Soleil ''Wintuk'' show, at Madison Square Garden ($220). 
 Among the bargains: a 9:45 a.m. open rehearsal of the New York Philharmonic at Avery Fisher Hall ($16 a ticket) or a recent performance by the jazz trombonist Craig Harris at the new Dwyer Cultural Center in Harlem, at St. Nicholas Avenue and 123rd Street ($7 a ticket). 
 At the Philharmonic rehearsal, most of the almost 2,300 available seats were filled. The audience appeared to be mostly mature, but there was a sprinkling of younger people as well to watch and listen as David Fray, the French pianist, played the Ravel Piano Concerto in G with the orchestra. 
 Yoshiko Ono, a 34-year-old from Astoria, Queens, who said she had just gotten laid off from her job as an accountant, was an excited first-timer. She was there with her friend Naoko Mayuzumi from Toyko, who found out about the low-cost rehearsals through a popular Japanese guide for tourists. A schedule of the rehearsals is available at the Philharmonic's Web site (nyphil.org), and tickets can be purchased ahead of time. But at a special free open rehearsal on Sept. 16, with Renee Fleming, the ticket line formed at 5 a.m.
 Which brings us to the trade-offs for those low-price tickets. ''It takes a lot of effort to pay off in terms of time,'' said Ala Marie Shuman, a physical therapist enjoying the atmosphere the other night at the Rubenstein Atrium, where many of the seats were taken an hour before the set. 
 ''It's much more complicated than any year we've approached,'' said Cassandra Stubbs-Burton, a sixth-grade social studies teacher at M.S. 571 in Prospect Heights, Brooklyn, and the mother of an 11-year-old. She took her class to the Dwyer to see Mr. Harris the other day. Theater, dance, music and workshops are free or low-cost (under $10) and are listed on the Dwyer Web site (www.dwyercc.org); the popular free Saturday open house programs require reservations. ''Finding performance art is more difficult,'' Ms. Stubbs-Burton said. ''I look through the free parenting magazines. Places like Bryant Park have a lot of free events, and City Center does some Alvin Ailey for around $20. Brooklyn College has some performances with $6 or so seats -- they do ''The Nutcracker'' -- and New Victory does $10 seats.'' 
 But even the cultural big guns offer free and discounted tickets. At Carnegie Hall there are $10 day-of-concert seats and some partial view tickets for half price (carnegiehall.org/discounts). The Metropolitan Opera (metopera.org) offers $20 tickets Monday through Thursday if you're willing to be one of the first 200 people in line the day of the show. Otherwise tickets cost $15 to $275. 
 The new year brings new bargains. Starting on Jan. 7 same-day discount tickets, at 25 percent to 50 percent off regular prices, will be available for performances at Lincoln Center and all its constituent organizations (as well as the Big Apple Circus when it is in residence). They will be sold through a new box office at Rubenstein Atrium (closed Mondays). 
 To celebrate, Lincoln Center is offering a special deal for the first 20 days of the program: through Jan. 26 all tickets at the new box office will be just $20. Tickets will go on sale at noon every day and will be sold, two per person, on a first-come-first-served basis. (Expect lines.)
 Even at 50 percent or more, the discount tickets available at TKTS can make for a pricey evening on Broadway. But theatergoers can find a plethora of inexpensive Off Broadway and Off Off Broadway theater, including places like The Kitchen, La MaMa, Here Arts Center and Harlem Stage, which has music and other arts as well. It might not be too late to grab one of the full-price $10 tickets for ''Juan and John,'' created by Roger Guenveur Smith and part of the annual new play series, Public Lab, at the Public Theater through Sunday (publictheater.org). Also through Sunday there are $25 seats for the critically acclaimed ''Swimming to Spalding,'' inspired by Spalding Gray, at Here Arts Center (here.org). 
 Finally, for strapped balletomanes, during its season at the Koch Theater the New York City Ballet offers open working rehearsals four days a week, with free admission for any patron who makes an annual contribution of $90 or more. The number of rehearsals that can be attended depends on the level of giving: $90 gets you eight a year; for $1,000 you get unlimited access. Cheap? Not exactly. But maybe still a bargain.

HEADLINE: Together at Town Hall: A Holiday Celebration of the Power of Love

BYLINE: By STEVEN McELROY

 BODY:
TOGETHER AT TOWN HALL: A HOLIDAY CELEBRATION OF THE POWER OF LOVE
 Only a few months ago the board of directors of the New York City Gay Men's Chorus was nearly forced to silence the group, just before the start of its 30th-anniversary season. ''So many nonprofits had a difficult year,'' said Peter Criswell, the executive director of Big Apple Performing Arts, the umbrella organization for the chorus. ''But our members love it,'' he said. ''It's a cultural icon. People know it, and it's a part of New York.'' 
 Luckily for the chorus, above, and its fans, the organization has found some cash and will start the 30th season with its annual holiday concert on Sunday. 
 The depressed economy had caused a sharp decline in donations and therefore a serious budget shortfall, but the group's more than 200 members were inspired to save their chorus through an aggressive fund-raising campaign, Mr. Criswell said. ''Each member really had their own mini-campaign going,'' he said. ''Friends and family responded, and they really brought in donations.'' 
 The holiday concert has long been presented at Carnegie Hall, but this year it will take place at Town Hall, allowing the group to do two shows in one day and also to save on expenses. The theme of the program, which will feature holiday standards and both pop and classical works, is the celebration of family, community and love. Traditionally, the holiday concert includes special guest performers -- last year the cast of ''[title of show]'' participated -- and this year the Tony Award-winning actress Victoria Clark will join the group.
 ''She's going to do some fun numbers,'' Mr. Criswell said. 
 The holiday concert is only the first offering of the 30th-anniversary season, and as long as ticket sales are robust enough to finance the rest of it, Mr. Criswell said, the Gay Men's Chorus is not planning to pipe down anytime soon. He is hopeful that ''Big Gay Sing 2'' will happen in March and that ''High,'' a rock opera about crystal meth addiction, will follow in the summer. But for now, the focus is on the holidays, and this year the group has plenty to celebrate. (Sunday at 3 and 8 p.m., Town Hall, 123 West 43rd Street, Manhattan, 212-307-4100, nycgmc.org; $39.50 to $79.50.) STEVEN McELROY

HEADLINE: Chrysler May Challenge Dealer Legislation

BYLINE: By NICK BUNKLEY

DATELINE: AUBURN HILLS, Mich. 

 BODY:
Chrysler might challenge as unconstitutional legislative efforts aimed at restoring some of the 789 dealers it eliminated earlier this year, the carmaker's chief executive said on Thursday.
 The executive, Sergio Marchionne, said the company had not decided whether to ask the courts to stop Congress from forcing Chrysler and General Motors into arbitration with former dealers. The measure was included in a $446 billion spending bill that passed both houses of Congress this month and signed this week President Obama.
 Mr. Marchionne said that restoring large numbers of dealerships could ''cause havoc within Chrysler.'' G.M. and Chrysler proposed their own review processes last week in an effort to keep Congress from getting involved. 
 ''The offer that we made had all the elements of equity and fairness. It would have guaranteed a disgruntled dealer the opportunity to air its concern,'' Mr. Marchionne said. ''Having said this, if Congress wants it, Congress gets it. We'll live with the consequences.''
 A G.M. spokesman, Greg Martin, said the automaker had not decided how to proceed. ''We're taking a look at the practical application of the legislation,'' Mr. Martin said. G.M. did not renew franchise agreements with more than 1,100 dealers. 
 Mr. Marchionne said Chrysler would not follow G.M. in regard to paying back its loans to the federal government. G.M. recently said it would begin repaying $6.7 billion in loans this month and might pay off the entire balance at once.
 Chrysler, which borrowed $12.5 billion, intends to repay the loans by 2014, Mr. Marchionne said. But $4 billion of that amount remains in bankruptcy protection with other unwanted assets. Old Carco, the company liquidating those assets, said in court papers this week that it did not plan to pay back that portion.
 ''We are in completely different positions,'' he said. For G.M., which had about $42 billion in cash in September, paying back $6.7 billion ''is not a herculean effort,'' he said, ''but it would be for us.'' Chrysler had $5.7 billion in cash as of September.
 Mr. Marchionne also said G.M. was more focused on repaying the loans because the government owned 60 percent of that company but only 10 percent of Chrysler. Chrysler's majority shareholder is the United Automobile Workers union's retiree health care trust.
 Accordingly, monetizing the U.A.W.'s stake so the union can cover its health care obligations is a higher priority for Chrysler, he said.
 Mr. Marchionne, who is also chief executive of Chrysler's Italian partner, Fiat, was at Chrysler's headquarters Thursday to announce a $179 million investment in a Michigan engine factory. The five-year-old plant, about 60 miles southwest of Detroit, will build a four-cylinder engine for the Fiat 500 minicar, which is scheduled to be assembled in Mexico and go on sale in the United States in about a year. It will create up to 155 jobs.
 Chrysler's investment will give the company a fuel-efficient engine with ''nearly zero development costs, which is a prime example of how we expect this alliance to work,'' Mr. Marchionne said.
 He said Chrysler planned to make additional investments that would ''begin to provide jobs and other economic benefits that will validate the rationale behind the government support that we received.''
 Building a fuel-efficient engine with Fiat technology in the United States is one of three goals that each allow Fiat to gain an additional 5 percent of Chrysler. Fiat began its partnership in June with a 20 percent stake.

HEADLINE: Forecast of Economic Activity Rises for an Eighth Month

BYLINE: By THE ASSOCIATED PRESS

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
A forecast of economic activity rose for an eighth month in November, a private research group said, signaling the economic rebound would continue next year.
 But a second report offered some indication of the fits and starts that the labor market might experience during any recovery. 
 The Labor Department said Thursday that the number of new jobless claims rose to 480,000 last week, up 7,000 from the previous week. Economists had expected a decline to 465,000.
 The four-week average for claims, which smoothes out fluctuations, did fall, dipping to 467,500, the 15th consecutive decline. It was viewed as an encouraging sign that the labor market has been gradually improving. The four-week average is now at its lowest point since late September 2008.
 Unemployment claims have been on a downward trend since the summer. The improvement is seen as a sign that job cuts are slowing and hiring could pick up as soon as early next year. But the rise in weekly claims of 7,000 last week, which had followed an increase of 19,000 the previous week, shows that the improvement has been halting.
 Economists closely monitor jobless claims, which are considered a crucial gauge of the pace of layoffs, and continuing claims, viewed as an indication of how quickly laid off workers are getting new jobs.
 Analysts think that claims need to fall to about 425,000 for several weeks to signal the economy is beginning to add jobs.
 The government said that the number of people receiving regular benefits rose 5,000, to 5.19 million for the week ended Saturday. That figure does not include millions of people who have exhausted the regular 26 weeks of benefits typically provided by the state and are now receiving extended benefits for up to 73 additional weeks, paid by the federal government.
 The people receiving extended benefits jumped to 4.73 million for the week ended Nov. 28, an increase of 143,759 from the previous week. That big rise reflected the fact that 17 states are now processing claims for the extended benefits that Congress approved last month.
 In the report on economic activity, the Conference Board said its index of leading economic indicators rose 0.9 percent in November, up from 0.3 percent in October.
 The Conference Board said six of the 10 indicators it used for the index increased.
 A separate measurement of the growth rate forecast over the last six months has slowed, however. In the half-year through November, the index grew at a 4.7 percent pace, down from the 5.9 percent pace in the half-year through September and the 5.2 percent pace through October.

HEADLINE: Jobless Rate Falls to 10%, but 400,000 in City Are Still Seeking Work

BYLINE: By PATRICK McGEEHAN

 BODY:
New York City's unemployment rate dropped to 10 percent in November, as professional services like law and accounting firms hired more workers after many months of cutting jobs, the State Labor Department said Thursday.
 State officials took the drop in the city's rate, from a 16-year high of 10.3 percent in October, as a sign that the bulk of the job losses from the latest recession might have already occurred, though they were reluctant to predict a rebound in hiring anytime soon.
 The state's unemployment rate declined to 8.6 percent, from 9 percent. The state's rate has remained well below the national rate, which declined to 10 percent in November, while unemployment in the city has closely tracked the national trend in recent months. 
 ''It looks as though the hole's not being dug any deeper right now,'' said Bruce G. Herman, a deputy labor commissioner. ''But we're still in a very big hole.''
 Indeed, there still were slightly more than 400,000 city residents unable to find jobs last month, according to the state's figures, which were adjusted to account for seasonal fluctuations. But that was the lowest total recorded since July, according to James Brown, an analyst with the Labor Department.
 Employers in the city added about 10,700 jobs in October, but that was less than half the average increase in employment in the last 10 Novembers, Mr. Brown said. Some of that gain came in the retail sector, where stores have been adding to their holiday staffs more slowly and in smaller numbers than usual.
 ''So far, retail hiring is on pace to match last year's record low,'' Mr. Brown said.
 Hiring in the hotels and restaurants that make up most of the hospitality sector ''was actually flat, when you'd expect it to gain'' during the holiday season, Mr. Brown said.
 The gain in jobs in the city last month actually translated into a loss of more than 11,000 jobs from what would have been expected in a normal November, said Barbara Byrne Denham, chief economist for Eastern Consolidated, a real estate investment firm in Manhattan. Ms. Denham, who adjusts the numbers each month, noted that the seasonally adjusted loss equaled the loss of jobs in the entire nation in November, about 11,000.
 Mr. Brown said that one notable difference between the city and the rest of the state was the continued growth of the labor force in the city. The persistent influx of job seekers contributed to the higher unemployment rate in the city, he said.
 For the last few months, though, the city's labor force has shrunk, suggesting that some people have given up looking for jobs, said James Parrott, chief economist for the Fiscal Policy Institute, a liberal research group. The number of city residents with jobs has barely changed this fall, but the situation would be worse if the federal government had not pumped so much money into the economy through the stimulus program, he said.
 A report issued by the institute on Thursday estimated that the stimulus program had kept 419,000 New York State residents from falling into poverty this year by providing tax credits, additional food stamps and extended unemployment benefits. Mr. Parrott said more than 250,000 of those beneficiaries would have been city residents.
 Over all, New York State ''has fared better than many parts of the country,'' Mr. Herman said. But, he added, ''we still have many more New Yorkers unemployed than a year ago, and many of them unemployed for longer durations.''
 He said state officials were concerned about maintaining benefits for the long-term unemployed as some federal programs were scheduled to expire in the next several months. They also are troubled by big cutbacks in the offing at some large companies, including Pfizer and Penn Traffic. 
 Pfizer, the big drugmaker, is eliminating jobs at several sites in the state as it consolidates operations with Wyeth, another drugmaker it bought this year. Penn Traffic, which operates supermarkets across the state, has filed for bankruptcy protection for the third time, Mr. Herman said. Penn Traffic notified the state late last month that it might close 53 stores and lay off more than 4,000 workers.

HEADLINE: Projections Show U.S. As Less White And Older

BYLINE: By SAM ROBERTS

 BODY:
Without new immigrants, by the middle of the century the nation's population would begin to decline, the elderly would account for nearly one in four Americans and non-Hispanic whites would remain a majority, according to new projections by the Census Bureau. 
 But if immigration were to merely slow, rather than stop, non-Hispanic whites, who now account for nearly two-thirds of the population, would become a minority by 2050, according to the projections released Wednesday. If the pace of immigration increases, that benchmark could be reached as early as 2040. 
 Depending on the pace of international migration, the nation's population, currently at 308 million, could grow to as much as 458 million by midcentury, with immigrants accounting for up to 136 million of the increase.
 Since 2000, the population has been growing by just under one million immigrants annually. The bureau's lower estimates assume a range of 1.1 million to 1.8 million; the higher estimates range from 1.5 million to 2.4 million.
 Even if no new immigrants arrived, said William H. Frey, a demographer with the Brookings Institution, the Hispanic share of the population would rise from about 14 percent in 2010 to between 21 percent (with no further immigration) and 31 percent (with the highest projected immigration) in 2050. 
 Similarly, without any immigration, minorities would still constitute a majority of the population under age 5 in 2050, because of higher birth rates among Hispanic people already living here. If immigration continues, black, Hispanic and Asian children will become a majority of young children sometime between 2019 and 2023, according to the latest projections.
 People aged 65 and over would constitute more than one in five Americans by midcentury under all of the projections except for that of zero immigration. 
 Without immigration, the nation's labor force would decline by 7 million people, mostly between 2015 and 2035, as baby boomers start to retire. Continuing immigration would add 31 million to 64 million people to the labor force.
 ''The availability of work in agriculture, construction and manufacturing has attracted millions of low-skilled workers from Latin America, especially Mexico,'' said Mark Mather, the associate vice president for domestic programs of the Population Reference Bureau, a research group in Washington. ''However, immigration levels have dropped since the onset of the recession, mostly due to a decline in new arrivals, rather than immigrants' returning to their home countries.''
 Mr. Mather estimated that natural increase -- births over deaths -- has accounted for two-thirds of the nation's population growth in the past few years. Without any further immigration, deaths would begin to exceed births around 2048.

HEADLINE: In California's Capital, Dry Coffers Can Mean That Fires Burn Longer

BYLINE: By DAN BARRY

DATELINE: SACRAMENTO 

 BODY:
 At 7:56:59 on a Sunday night in November, a citizen known only as Steve called 911 to report a fire in the Curtis Park neighborhood. Flames were rising from the back porch of a handsome old house, burning so hot that the tall bamboo shoots in the backyard were popping like warning shots.
 The alarm abruptly ended the light after-dinner conversation inside Station 6, propelling its firefighters into another race against a voracious opponent that doubles in size every minute. But their race tonight would not include their best weapon, the station's water-bearing fire engine. To save money, it would remain idle. 
 This would turn out to be a routine house fire, if there is such a thing; no deaths, no injuries. But the fire occurred in Sacramento, the budget-challenged capital of budget-challenged California, where city officials have been forced at times to test the boundaries of a particular factor in their fiscal calculations: risk. 
 Even a routine fire, then, becomes a study in the worth of seconds.
 At 7:58:09, as Battalion Chief Marc Bentovoja, 49, rushed to the scene in his red S.U.V., the four firefighters assigned to Ladder Truck 6 hurried into their turnout gear. Jump into bunker pants. Slip flame-resistant Nomex hood over head. Put on heavy turnout coat. Sling radio across chest like a bandolier. Slip on tool belt holding, among other things, flashlight, vise grips, knife, door wedge and escape rope 50 feet long.
 The ideal is to be dressed and out the door in less than a minute. Seconds matter.
 Sacramento has 23 fire stations to cover about 144 square miles, with each station housing an engine -- the vehicle that carries water to a fire. The stations, particularly those in or near downtown, are located so that, ideally, any call can be answered in less than four minutes. Here's the rough calculus: If someone has stopped breathing, you might be able to save that person within four minutes. 
 Of those 23 stations, nine are equipped with both a fire engine and a ladder truck -- including Station 6. But as Capt. Rick Hudson, 41, and his three colleagues pulled out in their ladder truck, sirens wailing, the station's engine remained in its bay, unstaffed, the 500 gallons of water in its hold unused.
 In flush times not so long ago, Sacramento seemed ready to shed its unfair standing as San Francisco's dowdy sister. Its population, now around 480,000, was rapidly climbing. Developers were unveiling ambitious plans to redefine the city's skyline, and image. 
 Those days now seem like a dream. This city has suffered more than most in the recession, as foreclosures soar, as revenues from property and sales taxes plummet, as a three-days-a-month furlough for state workers stifles the city's Friday bustle. All that remains of a plan to build a skyscraping pair of condominium towers, 53 stories high, is a fenced-off downtown lot.
 The city is now in its third year of crisis management, which included the need to close a $58 million budget gap last year. The exceptionally busy Fire Department, which claims to be the oldest west of the Mississippi, got off lighter than other city agencies, but it still had to cut its budget by 4 percent.
 The city decided to institute rolling brownouts. Now, every 48 hours, one of those nine stations with both an engine and a ladder truck shuts its water-bearing engine down, leaving engines from other stations to answer calls in its area.
 Savings: about $2.1 million. 
 Risk: lost seconds.
 Truck 6 traced Chief Bentovoja's path down darkened streets, past a fish market, a small high school, a funeral home. On a normal night, Engine 6 would lead the way; on a normal night, the chief said later, ''the engine always gets there before the truck -- by at least a minute.''
 But not tonight.
 A neighbor, Rudy Martinez, 61, had already rushed across the street to make sure that two teenagers and a dog were out of the burning house, safe. Now, as the burning bamboo pop-pop-popped, he and two other neighbors were using garden hoses to water down the century-old house next door, owned by a couple who had left hours earlier on vacation.
 At 8:01:01, Chief Bentovoja arrived, followed a few seconds later by Truck 6. The firefighters saw an ominous glow through the attractive gray home's first-floor windows, licks of fire flicking over the back of its two stories, smoke pouring from the attic. 
 They first made certain that no one was inside. Then two firefighters climbed up to the roof with chain saws and cut a hole so that the hot smoke could escape, minimizing damage and increasing visibility. 
 ''Those guys were amazing,'' Mr. Martinez said. ''It looked like the rafters were going to collapse at any second.'' 
 The firefighters were controlling the fire, but without water, they could not stop the fire. ''That's the tough thing for me,'' Captain Hudson said.
 Flames engulfed a back corner of the house, while a side of that neighboring house received the intense heat radiating from a dozen feet away. Its windows cracked and burst. Its off-white paint blistered. Its attic inhaled hot, dangerous smoke.
 At 8:02:15 -- a solid five minutes after the initial 911 call -- two fire engines arrived from other neighborhoods, farther away. Here now was much-needed water, though at least a full minute later than if Engine 6 were online. ''That's 60 seconds less of a free-burning fire,'' Captain Hudson said. ''Less damage to the house. No damage to the neighbor's house.''
 Unraveled hoses swelled with the rush of glorious water. A nearby hydrant flowed. Other fire engines and trucks arrived. At 8:41:51, Chief Bentovoja relayed the code that essentially says: Fire out. 
 In the dangerous realm of house fires, this was a success: no deaths; no injuries; extensive damage, but structure salvageable.
 Gus Vina, the assistant city manager who oversees public safety issues, says resources are central to how a city manages risk -- and resources these days are tight. While no one wants brownouts, he said, they were considered more palatable than another option: shutting down one of the 23 firehouses.
 The brownouts, he said, are just one manifestation of a recession so severe that municipalities like Sacramento have to make fundamental decisions about what services they can no longer afford. ''We all sort of fell off the cliff at the same time'' with this recession, he said. ''It's very real, and there will be street-level impact.''
 In this economy, an uncomfortable truth is that precious seconds must be weighed against dollars. ''It is a risk calculation all the time,'' Mr. Vina said.
 The cause of the Curtis Park fire remains unclear. The home's owners have been unable to return, so extensive was the damage. The couple next door, John Mathews and Nicoletta Anselmo, learned of the fire just in time, aborted their vacation, and returned home to oversee the necessary repairs. In fact, they enlisted their heroic neighbor, Mr. Martinez, a glazier, to replace the windows that burst in the heat.
 Mr. Mathews, 59, whose hours at an engineering firm have been downsized to 32 from 40 a week, expressed awe for his neighbors, for fire, and for something the firefighters told him: ''We were one minute away from bursting into flames.''

HEADLINE: Firestone Teams Up With the Big Leagues

BYLINE: By TIM ARANGO

 BODY:
BASEBALL and Firestone, the big tire company, have a deep historical connection: in the 1920s Harvey Firestone built a ballpark in Akron, Ohio, for his employees, and Babe Ruth supposedly came and played.
 But until now, Major League Baseball and Firestone had done little business together.
 Firestone, which in the past has mainly limited its sports sponsorships to auto racing, has reached a five-year, multimillion-dollar deal with M.L.B. to become the official sponsor of the sport's All-Star balloting next season. The deal also includes national advertising during broadcasts and in print publications at stadiums. 
 For Firestone, it's the first nonracing sponsorship in 25 years, and for M.L.B the deal is reassurance that it can still sell big-time sponsorships amid the economic downturn, even as attendance slipped last season.
 ''I think what we saw was that there were two phases to the recession,'' said Tim Brosnan, M.L.B.'s executive vice president for business, who explained that the first half of the season was more severely affected by the economy. ''As baseball got toward its postseason, the business picked up markedly.'' The league, Mr. Brosnan said, responded to the downturn by beefing up its advertising sales force, while cutting expenses elsewhere.
 According to Baseball-Reference.com, about five million fewer fans attended big league baseball games in 2009, compared with 2008. Last season, total attendance was 73.4 million, down from 78.5 million in 2008. (In the early years of the Great Depression, attendance declined roughly 40 percent.)
 ''I would have expected attendance would have gone down more,'' said Vince Gennaro, a business consultant for several teams and the author of ''Diamond Dollars: the Economics of Winning in Baseball.''
 Mr. Gennaro noted that 10 Major League Baseball teams reduced ticket prices in 2009. ''So revenue may have been down at a rate greater than attendance,'' he said.
 The idea behind the partnership between Firestone and M.L.B. is to emphasize the deep roots each has in American life. ''From our perspective, the tradition of Firestone and the tradition of M.L.B. go together perfectly,'' said John Baratta, president of consumer tire replacement sales for Bridgestone Americas. Bridgestone, a Japanese company, owns the Firestone brand, having purchased the company in 1988.
 To dig into that history, M.L.B. asked a researcher at the National Baseball Hall of Fame in Cooperstown, N.Y., to find out details about Firestone Stadium, which opened in 1925. Luckily for the architects of the partnership between baseball and Firestone, the researcher found that Babe Ruth supposedly played at the ballpark during a barnstorming tour in the 1920s. (Today the ballpark is home to the Akron Acers of the women's National Pro Fastpitch Softball League.)
 ''We're about tradition, we're about history,'' said John Brody, a senior vice president at M.L.B., describing the marketing rationale for the deal. ''What we stand for to our fans is what Firestone stands for with their customer.''
 Mr. Brosnan added: ''At a very elementary level it is a partnership between two iconic American brands.''
 Firestone joins companies like General Motors, Taco Bell, State Farm and Bank of America that have wide-ranging sponsorship deals with M.L.B.
 ''This is typical of the kinds of sponsorships we do where you need to be 'all in,' '' said Mr. Brosnan. ''All in means you make a significant investment, and not just at our jewel events, but in TV advertising, in print publications, and you take it retail.'' 
 Firestone, which is in the process of producing two baseball-themed television commercials for next season, will also take the baseball connection to the local level. It will install in-store promotions related to baseball at its 7,500 outlets across the country, and the All Star balloting facet of the deal extends not just to the big league ballparks, but to more than 100 minor league ballparks as well. ''Every community has baseball, from Little League on up,'' said Mr. Baratta, the Bridgestone executive.
 In addition to playing up the linked history between baseball and Firestone for marketing purposes, Mr. Baratta said that going beyond auto racing would allow the company to broaden its reach. 
 ''The demographics of M.L.B. mirror the U.S. population closer than any other sports entity,'' he said.

HEADLINE: Cleaning Out Closets, Reuniting Old Friends

BYLINE: By HOLLAND COTTER

 BODY:
In these cash-crunching days museums are raiding their closets for shows and pulling out some terribly glamorous inventory. This is how the Metropolitan Museum of Art came up with ''5,000 Years of Japanese Art: Treasures From the Packard Collection,'' a survey of exceptional material, some of which has been in and out of storage since its arrival in town nearly 35 years ago. 
 To anyone who frequents the Japanese wing, some of the objects will be old friends. Two Buddhist wood guardian figures, as pumped up and pugnacious as SmackDown stars, are in the same spot they've occupied since the galleries opened in 1987. So is the 17th-century screen painting ''The Old Plum'' by Kano Sansetsu, a flagship presence in the museum's globalist roster back in place after a recent trip to Japan. 
 Certain other items, however, like scroll paintings on silk have been exhibited only sporadically. At least one spectacular six-panel screen is making its public debut with the show. And a textile piece is taking what is likely to be its final bow before a long -- possibly a generation long -- retirement. 
 The Packard collection of more than 400 objects landed at the Met, with a bump, in 1975. When the news got out that the museum's director, Thomas A. Hoving, had acquired it, in a half-gift, half-purchase arrangement, for $5.1 million, hysteria ensued. 
 The purchase was the museum's most expensive up to that time. The country was in a recession, the city on the verge of bankruptcy. Who, some people asked, was familiar enough with Japanese art to know what we were really getting with this stuff? 
 Harry G. C. Packard knew. He started learning about Japanese art in 1946, as a Navy officer in Tokyo with the United States occupation forces. Although trained as a civil engineer, on his return home he went to graduate school in art history, then headed back to Japan for hands-on study. He was almost 40 and had already begun buying Japanese art in bulk -- prints at first, then older things -- and selling some of it (the collector Avery Brundage was a client and friend) but keeping choice items for himself. 
 As with late-19th-century Americans who assembled the great Japanese holdings in the Museum of Fine Arts, Boston, time was on his side. Japan was enmeshed in political and cultural upheaval. Art was on no one's mind, so it was available and cheap. 
 Mr. Packard learned about it as he bought, and bought as he learned. Long before his death in 1991 he had compiled the largest Japanese collection in America, its contents dating from the Neolithic period to the 20th century. 
 The Met show, organized by Sinead Kehoe, an assistant curator of Japanese art, starts somewhere between the fifth and first millennium B.C., when Japan was remote from continental influences. An early island culture known as Jomon was producing wafer-thin body ornaments from animal bone, though their masterworks, to our eyes, are earthenware vessels with snakeskinlike textures and flanged lips with the wavy contours of aquatic plants. 
 The taste for abstracted organic forms is fundamental to the art of Japan, from Jomon pots to haniwa -- hollow clay tomb sculptures of doll-like soldiers and tender beasts -- from the 5th and 6th century A.D. to the fleshy, fungal shapes of stoneware jars and bowls revered by 16th-century tea ceremony devotees. 
 Contact with Korea and China brought a different aesthetic ideal, evident in Buddhist art. In a 13th-century Japanese hanging scroll, Kannon, the bodhisattva of mercy, glows slender and white, like a night-blooming flower. In another painting the Buddha himself descends to earth on a path of light to comfort a dying man and carries his soul to heaven like an infant in his arms. 
 Ming-period China provided the direct prototype for the small-format six-panel screen called ''One Hundred Boys'' by the 17th-century Japanese artist, Kano Eino. (One of show's few non-Packard inclusions, it was acquired by the Met this year.) But Chinese models were often radically altered in translation. ''The Old Plum,'' painted by Kano Eino's father, invests the Chinese-derived landscape motif of an ancient tree budding into fresh life with a sense of monstrous violence, as if nature were a force to fear rather than simply contemplate. 
 Japanese art doesn't tiptoe around big emotions like fury, erotic passion, grief and ecstasy. It revels in depictions of vengeful ghosts, unabashedly sensual women and nature as an emblem of personal heartbreak. A pretty little garden painting of birds and hibiscus flowers by Tsubaki Chinzan turns out to be imbedded with references to the Tang dynasty poem ''Song of Everlasting Sorrow,'' in which a hibiscus reminds a lover of his dead mistress's face. 
 And image after image of the natural world seems to have regret built in. We walk past the 16th-century screens called ''Bamboo in the Four Seasons'' by Tosa Mitsunobu, and a year speeds by, as slender spring shoots turn into dark summer stalks, and autumn trees are suddenly bending under winter snow. 
 And surely few visions of the world as a passing mirage can be subtler than the one suggested in a bamboo painting by the poet-artist Gion Nankai done directly on the surface of a white, silk satin robe. The trees are solid upright when the robe is laid flat; but when it was worn, they would have broken into rippling fragments, like reflections in water. 
 Commissioned by a friend of the artist as a gift for a mistress, the robe was preserved as a family heirloom and brought out now and then as bridal attire. Its re-emergings may be now at an end. So light-sensitive is the silk that the robe, from the early 18th century, is rarely shown, and may not be again once the show comes down. 
 Not all the Packard material is so fragile, and the Met installation winds down with hardier things. On the religious side there are rough-and-ready votive paintings of fantastical animals. Inscribed with requests for divine blessings, these vicious examples of popular art were left in Shinto shrines, a practice that continues today. 
 Spiritual and secular can be hard to sort out in a culture which holds so much of the real world in of reverence. So you can read what you will into two 19th-century scrolls fly-specked with bits of verse and sketches of fall flowers. 
 The scrolls were the equivalent of guest books passed around at parties for artists and poets, with the expectation that everyone would add something, if only a name. And the names are impressive: the painter Sakai Hoitsu signed one scroll, the printmaker Kitagawa Utamaro, the other. 
 Parties meant meals; meals meant dishes. The Packard collection has many: porcelain cups that bring to mind Fiestaware; platters brushed with Picassoid heads and twisty trees. An Oribe ware food tray, asparagus-green and shaped like a fan, will tickle connoisseurs of ceramics. 
 And fans of fan painting will adore the single example by Ike Gyokuran, one of the show's few female artists, whose diminutive hand-held landscapes were such a hit that she painted the same ones over and over. 
 And in a sense, over and over is the story of Japanese art, and of this show. Flowers spill over many surfaces. Birds, mists and bodhisattvas drift across skies. Spring comes, then summer, then autumn, then snow sifts over bamboo. Art appears, it disappears; it appears again if we're lucky. 
 At the Met, with its wide halls and deep storage, we are.

HEADLINE: Thousands Lose Rent Vouchers in Cutback

BYLINE: By MANNY FERNANDEZ

 BODY:
One of the key housing programs that helps low-income and other needy New Yorkers afford their apartments has been effectively cut off for thousands of families.
 City officials announced Thursday that they had stopped issuing new federal rent subsidy vouchers and were terminating the vouchers of 3,000 families who had yet to fully use them. They said they were taking those steps because of federal budget cuts and an increased demand for the vouchers in today's economy.
 The city's public housing agency, the New York City Housing Authority, typically gives out thousands of vouchers every year through the Section 8 program. Poor, elderly and disabled tenants who receive the vouchers live in private apartments and pay about 30 percent of their income toward rent, with federally funded vouchers making up the difference. 
 Agency officials said that the nearly 128,000 families currently on its Section 8 waiting list would remain there, but with a few exceptions no new vouchers would be given to them or anyone else in 2010 without additional federal financing. In addition, 3,018 families -- those who had received vouchers but were searching for an apartment or had identified an apartment but not yet completed the process and moved in -- would have their vouchers terminated. 
 Since May, the agency has limited vouchers to those in emergency situations, and has stopped giving them out to families who are not in crisis. As a result, a majority of the 3,018 voucher holders were in emergency situations, including those who had recently been homeless, victims of domestic violence and young people leaving foster care. 
 ''It's a difficult but unavoidable decision,'' the authority's chairman, John B. Rhea, said at a news conference on Thursday.
 Mr. Rhea said a ''perfect storm'' of factors was to blame.
 In 2008 and 2009, Congress and the Department of Housing and Urban Development instructed the agencies that administer Section 8 vouchers nationwide to use money in their reserves to fill shortfalls in federal financing. New York housing authority officials said they had anticipated a $10 million shortfall in 2009, but the amount turned out to be $58 million. ''We didn't know how large it would be,'' Mr. Rhea said.
 He also said the agency had already surpassed by 2,000 vouchers its annual allotment of 91,000.
 The authority was working with city officials to provide alternative rental assistance for many of the 3,000 voucher holders. Robert V. Hess, commissioner of the city's Department of Homeless Services, said his agency was working to extend a state supervised rental assistance program for hundreds of formerly homeless families who had their vouchers terminated. ''We don't think there's any cause for alarm at this point,'' he said.
 None of the families who are currently in an apartment and receiving the Section 8 subsidy are affected, officials said.
 Elected officials and advocates for low-income housing expressed outrage over the move and criticized the authority for failing to do enough to prevent 3,000 families from losing the vouchers they had been given. 
 ''It is shocking that the New York City Housing Authority is breaking its word to over 3,000 Section 8 voucher holders,'' said City Councilman Bill de Blasio, a Democrat from Brooklyn.
 Steven Banks, the attorney in chief for the Legal Aid Society, said the agency's actions would swell the city's family shelter system. 
 The Manhattan borough president, Scott M. Stringer, called for members of the authority's governing board to resign. ''I have a hunch that we're about to be dealing with 'Vouchergate,' which is why we need city legislative hearings immediately,'' Mr. Stringer said.

CORRECTION-DATE: January 7, 2010

 CORRECTION:
An article in some editions on Dec. 18 about the New York City Housing Authority's decision to stop issuing new federal rent subsidy vouchers to low-income New Yorkers because of budget cuts and increasing demand misstated the agency's annual voucher allotment. It is 99,000, not 91,000.

HEADLINE: Armory Shows Imperiled, While Other Fairs Adjust

BYLINE: By CAROL VOGEL

 BODY:
The annual Works on Paper fair, which was to take place at the Park Avenue Armory in February, is the latest victim of the recession. Sanford L. Smith, the veteran fair organizer who started the show in 1988, has postponed it this year. 
 ''I simply couldn't get the quality or the quantity of dealers,'' Mr. Smith said. ''It's the economy, and it's the enormous explosion of fairs all over the world.'' 
 Many dealers who took part in Art Basel Miami Beach this month said they noticed that the market had picked up, at least for contemporary art. But fair organizers, along with dealers specializing in everything from old masters to Impressionist and Modern art, have a more sober story to tell. 
 For instance, Mr. Smith said, dealers are short of cash these days and unable to replenish their inventories. Another issue at the armory is the cost of space. The Park Avenue Conservancy formally took over management of the building, a crenelated red brick landmark between 66th and 67th Streets, from New York State in December 2007, and it has increased the rent. The cost is now $30,000 a day, three times what it once was. 
 Another armory show, the high-end International Fine Art Fair, which is timed to coincide with the May Impressionist and Modern art auctions in New York, may also be canceled. ''We are currently in consultation with the exhibitors,'' said Magda Grigorian, a spokeswoman for that event's organizer, Haughton International Art and Antique Fairs, ''and no final decision has yet been made.'' 
 Still on the schedule, however, is the Art Dealers Association of America's annual Art Show of postwar and contemporary art. But rather than taking place in February, the show will be held March 3 through 7, timed to the Armory Show (March 4-7), which despite its name is held at Piers 92 and 94, at 12th Avenue and 55th Street, in Clinton. 
 ''I'm a big believer that more is more,'' said Lucy Mitchell Inness, president of the Art Dealers Association of America. ''Having critical mass creates a buzz, and that's a good thing.'' 
 The Art Show will feature 70 dealers, the same as last year. The Armory Show, however, will expand, with 267 galleries, 41 more than last year. But some dealers have been asking for smaller booths, Katelijne De Backer, director of that event, said. 
 This year the show will introduce Armory Focus, a section featuring a city or community that is especially vibrant. The inaugural section will center on Berlin, with 21 dealers from there. ''You have to keep changing to stay the same,'' Ms. De Backer said. 
 ASIA SOCIETY HELPS ASIA WEEK
 Last spring, when the International Asian Art Fair was canceled because of the recession, it left a hole in what has come to be known as Asia Week, the time in March when Sotheby's and Christie's hold their Asian art sales. Museum and gallery shows and smaller fairs are also scheduled then in hopes of drawing collectors to the auctions. 
 This year the Asia Society has taken on the task of coordinating all the activities that week and publishing them in a guide that includes a map and a calendar of exhibitions, lectures and other public programs. It will be free at the Asia Society and the other participants' spaces, and will also be posted on the society's Web site, AsiaSociety.org. ''We were the beneficiaries of the International Asian Art Fair's opening night,'' said Melissa Chiu, director of the society's museum. ''And it was important that everything be centralized. Asia Society's involvement is not commercial but educational.'' 
 IT'S RAINING SHIRTS AND PANTS 
 A crane rising five stories will drop more than 10 tons of used clothes into the cavernous drill hall of the Park Avenue Armory this spring. Rising out of this mass will be piles soaring as high as 40 feet. 
 Called ''No Man's Land,'' it is the creation of the French artist Christian Boltanski and will occupy the armory from May 12 through June 14. It is also the second commission initiated by the Park Avenue Armory. In May the Brazilian artist Ernesto Neto filled the space with giant, amorphous shapes of gossamer-thin fabric sacks resembling cow udders. They were not only tactile and visual but also aromatic. The membranelike sacs were each filled with 1,800 pounds of pungent spices. 
 ''That was the installation that loves you,'' said Tom Eccles, the armory's consulting curator and executive director of the Center for Curatorial Studies and Art in Contemporary Culture at Bard College. ''This is much tougher; it's a piece with political resonance. The clothing represents humanity, while the crane, man's capacity for inhumanity.''
 Since the 1960s, Mr. Boltanski has worked with ephemera, from found photography to rusted biscuit tins. This lost property, often from public spaces like railway stations, creates collections memorializing the unknown. He has also worked with piles of old clothes before: in a project organized by the Public Art Fund in 1993 for the Church of the Intercession in Harlem and the waiting room at Grand Central Terminal. 
 This is more ambitious: besides the noise of the crane, visitors will hear the loud pounding of human heartbeats. Beyond the drill hall, the artist also plans to work on several installations in some of the building's period rooms and corridors. 
 ''No Man's Land,'' which has been partly financed with a $200,000 Rockefeller innovation grant, includes educational programs. It is the second variation of a series, of which another work, ''Personnes,'' will be on view from mid-January to mid-February at the Grand Palais in Paris. 
 ''This is the first exhibition in an ongoing partnership between the Armory and the Grand Palais,'' Mr. Eccles said. ''Both of us have commissioning programs for two of the largest spaces in our respective cities, so it makes sense for us to work together.'' But at the Grand Palais, while the crane's claw and the used clothes are still the central elements, other garments will be laid out neatly, almost like graves in a cemetery. 
 All the pieces are being borrowed from local used-clothing distributors and will be returned once the projects have ended.

HEADLINE: Dow Slips for a Third Day, but the Dollar Strengthens

BYLINE: By JAVIER C. HERNANDEZ

 BODY:
Wall Street investors sold off on Thursday as light trading amplified concerns about foreign debt and a weaker-than-expected report on the labor market.
 As traders turned away from the risks of the stock market, the dollar strengthened, hitting a three-month high against the euro. 
 Losses in the financial sector also helped drag shares lower, pushing the Dow Jones industrial average down for a third day. Citigroup shares fell 7.25 percent, to $3.20, after the Treasury Department said it would delay plans to begin unwinding its stake despite the bank's desire to free itself of government support. Citigroup had priced its shares at $3.15, below the $3.25 at which the government assumed its one-third stake. 
 The dollar surged to its highest levels since September. It hovered slightly above $1.43 against the euro, after weeks of trading at or above $1.50.
 By the end of the day, the Dow Jones industrial average had fallen 132.86 points, or 1.27 percent, to 10,308.26. The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index dropped 13.10 points, or 1.18 percent, to 1,096.08, while the Nasdaq composite index declined 26.86 points, or 1.22 percent, to 2,180.05. Crude oil dropped a penny a barrel to settle at $72.65. 
 A light trading day exaggerated the declines, analysts said. In recent weeks, hedge fund managers and investment strategists have sold shares in an effort to cash in on profits.
 On Thursday, an unexpected increase in the number of people filing for unemployment benefits left investors turning to dollars as a safe haven. 
 The number of filings increased to 480,000 last week, 15,000 more than expected. Still, the job market has shown signs of improvement recently though at least 15.4 million Americans are still out of work.
 Traders are nervous about emerging markets, particularly after the debt crisis in Dubai. On Thursday, those concerns came to the fore when Standard & Poor's downgraded the credit rating of Greece, which has struggled to reduce its deficit. Some analysts worry that growing deficits could steer weak economies into fresh downturns.
 Investors appear to be backing off a rush to sell the dollar that dominated the markets for much of the year. Yields on Treasury bonds have steadily risen, and many investors say they believe an end is in sight to the near-zero interest rates imposed by the Fed, strengthening the dollar's appeal. Higher interest rates mean more lucrative returns for dollar holders.
 On Wednesday, the Fed said it would leave low rates in place for an ''extended period,'' which most analysts took to mean at least six months. But Brian Dolan, chief currency strategist at Forex.com, said rates could remain low even longer, keeping the dollar weak.
 ''It's not at all clear that the Fed is going to tighten rates in 2010,'' Mr. Dolan said. 
 As the recovery takes hold, investors seem to be finding reasons for restraint in each economic report. Signs of strength create worries that the Fed will raise interest rates; indications of a slow recovery make investors nervous about the risk for another downturn. 
 ''We're transitioning from an 'end of the world' outlook to a fragile recovery,'' said Stephen P. Wood, chief market strategist for Russell Investments.

HEADLINE: City Logic, Altered To Suit

BYLINE: By CLYDE HABERMAN. 
E-mail: haberman@nytimes.com

 BODY:
Even for a born-and-bred New Yorker, figuring out this city and some of its leaders can be tricky. Let's see if we've got some recent developments straight.
 News item: The City Council killed plans for a shopping mall inside the unused Kingsbridge Armory in the Bronx because it wanted the developer to guarantee that workers would be paid more than the bare minimum. Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg promised a veto. Public officials shouldn't be dictating to private industry in this manner, he said.
 Do we have this right? The Bloomberg administration considers it overly intrusive when government tells some businesses to pay their employees a living wage but not overly intrusive when government tells other businesses, like restaurants, what kinds of cooking oils they may use. 
 Got it.
 News item: A judge, acting on a request from the state's attorney general, Andrew M. Cuomo, ordered the United Homeless Organization to get rid of its sidewalk tables and those oversize jars used to collect dollars and coins from passers-by. That money, Mr. Cuomo said in a lawsuit, lines the pockets of the organization's officers, and doesn't go to those it is supposed to help.
 Let's see: It's outrageous that people on the street take your money and use it for their own purposes instead of giving it to poor souls in need. But it's business as usual when banks take taxpayer money for their own purposes instead of passing it to needy people in the form of loans that could help jump-start the economy.
 Got it.
 News item: Some leading political figures, including former Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani, objected to putting terror suspects on trial in New York. They feared, among other things, that this would increase the risk of another attack on the city, already the bad guys' No. 1 target.
 Hmm. We'll show the terrorists that they can't scare us by acting scared.
 Got it.
 News item: Politicians, including a long line of City Council members led by the speaker, Christine C. Quinn, pummeled the cash-starved Metropolitan Transportation Authority for deciding in desperation (and perhaps political gamesmanship) to phase out free transit fares for students. The mayor added his own statements of outrage.
 Uh, wasn't it the politicians who made the free fares vulnerable in the first place, by slicing and dicing government support for this program over many years? Doreen M. Frasca, an authority board member, nailed it by likening the city and the state to ''deadbeat dads.'' They are also reminiscent of a certain boy -- the one in the old chutzpah-defining joke who murders his parents and then begs the judge to have mercy on a poor orphan.
 Got it.
 News item: A judge upheld an arbitration decision to approve raises of 11.5 percent for transit workers over the next three years. The Metropolitan Transportation Authority protested the increases because of its money troubles, and Mr. Bloomberg took its side. But the 11.5 percent mirrored raises that the mayor, despite having budget headaches of his own, had given to municipal workers to ensure labor peace before he ran for re-election.
 O.K., so the moral is that when the city gives its workers salary increases that the budget cannot sustain, it's fine. When other workers get comparable raises that the budget cannot sustain, it's bad.
 Got it.
 News item: Mr. Bloomberg, who worries mightily about the environment, used his private jet to get to the climate talks in Copenhagen rather than take a scheduled commercial flight.
 So the way to save the planet from pollution is by further polluting it.
 Got it.
 News item: Senator Charles E. Schumer, friend of the workingman and -woman, had to apologize to a flight attendant after describing her with a vulgarity for having insisted that he turn off his cellphone before their plane took off. According to reports, the senator shut off his phone but couldn't resist arguing with the attendant that he knew the rules and was in the right.
 Uh-huh. Regular folks should not overreact just because some big shot hands them a line that borders on ''Do you know who I am?''
 Got it.
 Got it all.

HEADLINE: Shares of FedEx Fall After It Posts a 30% Decline in Profit

BYLINE: By THE ASSOCIATED PRESS

 BODY:
FedEx said on Thursday that its second-quarter profit fell 30 percent on a 10 percent decline in revenue and issued a disappointing forecast for the current period, setting off a 6 percent decline in its share price. 
 Although FedEx expects a modest economic recovery to continue next year, the company said ''there is some uncertainty regarding the sustainability of current demand trends after our peak shipping season.'' 
 The company predicted earnings of 50 to 70 cents a share in the current quarter, well under analysts' expectations of 84 cents a share. Despite the cautious near-term forecast, the company said many economic indicators appeared to be turning positive. 
 The chief executive, chairman and president, Frederick W. Smith, said in a conference call he believed that the nation's economy ''reached a turning point'' in recent months. Mr. Smith noted that industrial demand turned positive compared with last year and that manufacturers started buying again.
 In the quarter, FedEx earned $345 million, or $1.10 a share, compared with $493 million, or $1.58 a share, in the period a year earlier.
 Sales in the period, which ended Nov. 30 and was the second quarter of FedEx's fiscal year, fell to $8.6 billion, from $9.54 billion.
 Shares of FedEx, which is based in Memphis, fell $5.48, to $84.47.
 FedEx reported sales declines of more than 10 percent in major segments, including express, freight and services. But revenue in the company's ground segment rose 3 percent, mostly because of added volume from a partnership with the United States Postal Service and DHL's exit from the United States market.
 FedEx is adding more flight hours to meet international demand in the current quarter, which will increase its costs. The company cut flight hours by 6 percent during the last quarter as it used fewer and more fuel-efficient airplanes. But as package volume started picking up in the quarter, especially in Asia and Latin America, FedEx scheduled more flights.

HEADLINE: PGA Tour Remains Bullish on 2010

BYLINE: By LARRY DORMAN

 BODY:
PGA Tour Commissioner Tim Finchem opened a public relations campaign on Thursday, reiterating his support for the beleaguered Tiger Woods and disputing speculation that fallout from the Woods sex scandal -- including his self-imposed indefinite break from competition -- would damage the tour into 2010.
 ''We are going to be successful in '10,'' said Finchem, adding he had not spoken to Woods and did not know when Woods would resume playing golf. ''If Tiger is out for a couple of months or eight months or a year, we're going to have a successful year. 
 ''It won't be at the same levels without our No. 1 player, there's no question about that. No sport would be at the same level without its No. 1 player. But I think the doom and gloom needs to go away, and, frankly, it's misleading to our fans.'' 
 Finchem's defense of Woods coincided with indications that the sports media have already separated Woods's on-course prowess from his off-course predilections. Woods was voted male player of the year by the Golf Writers Association of America by an overwhelming margin over Steve Stricker, with most ballots returned after the scandal erupted.
 It was the 10th time Woods has won the award in his 13 years as a pro. Earlier, Woods was named Athlete of the Decade in an award voted upon by members of The Associated Press. Woods received 56 of the 142 votes cast, and more than half the ballots were returned after the Nov. 27 car accident outside his Florida home.
 Finchem came out swinging on CNBC's ''Squawk on the Street'' to address perceptions of sponsor unrest, taking the opportunity to announce to the business community that BMW had extended its sponsorship of the BMW Championship in Chicago through 2014 and that Sony had expanded its relationship with the tour to make the 2011 Sony Open in Hawaii the first event available for distribution in 3-D to select audiences.
 Finchem saw reason for optimism despite the struggling economy, saying he expected to see an increase in charitable donations to as much as $116 million from $109 million in 2009, with a slight increase in overall purses from $278 million in 2009 for the same number of events.
 Later, in a teleconference, Finchem said he was not concerned about the cloud of suspicion over Anthony Galea, the Canadian doctor who helped Woods with his rehabilitation from knee surgery last February and March. Galea was arrested in October after his assistant was detained at the United States-Canada border and found to be in possession of drugs that are illegal in the United States, including human growth hormone and Actovegin, a drug made from calves' blood that is closely monitored by the World Anti-Doping Agency. On Wednesday, the Canadian authorities filed four drug-related charges against Galea.
 The procedure that Galea performed up to four times on Woods at his home in Orlando, Fla., a platelet-rich plasma injection therapy known as blood-spinning, is not barred by the PGA Tour or by any other sports organization.
 ''I haven't been involved in it,'' Finchem said, ''but our antidoping people have looked at it and they've concluded that there's nothing about that procedure that would trigger any violation of our antidoping policy.''
 Because the test for H.G.H. requires a blood test, the PGA Tour is among the many sports organizations that do not test for it.
 Woods, who has been the subject of embarrassing revelations about affairs he has carried on with women other than his wife, has lost his corporate endorsement contract with Accenture and was removed from Gillette's television commercials for at least as long as he will be away from the tour. But Finchem said he did not believe the tour would lose any corporate sponsorship.
 ''Individual companies make individual marketing decisions,'' Finchem said, ''whether it relates to Tiger or anything else, for a range of reasons. I don't anticipate difficulties in that area whatsoever.''

HEADLINE: At Towering Japanese Cliffs, a Campaign to Combat Suicide

BYLINE: By MARTIN FACKLER

DATELINE: SAKAI, Japan 

 BODY:
The towering cliffs of Tojimbo, with their sheer drops into the raging, green Sea of Japan, are a top tourist destination, but Yukio Shige had no interest in the rugged scenery. Instead, he walked along the rocky crags searching for something else: a lone human figure, usually sitting hunched at the edge of the precipice.
 That is one of the telltale signs in people drawn here by Tojimbo's other, less glorious, distinction as one of the best known places to kill oneself in Japan, one of the world's most suicide-prone nations. Mr. Shige, a 65-year-old former policeman, has spent his five years since retirement on a mission to stop those who come here from jumping.
 His efforts have helped draw attention to the grim fact that Japan's suicide rate is again on the rise. Police figures show that the number of suicides this year could approach the country's record high of 34,427, reached in 2003, almost 95 suicides a day. The World Health Organization says that people in Japan are now almost three times as likely to kill themselves as are Americans. 
 Mr. Shige and a group of volunteers he put together have saved 222 people so far, a tally that has made Mr. Shige a national figure in a country that often seems apathetic about its high rate of self-destruction. But he has also met with criticism from a conformist society that can look dimly on people who draw attention by engaging in activism, even of the most humanitarian kind. 
 ''In Japan, we say the nail that sticks up gets hammered down,'' said Mr. Shige, who says he started the patrols after he grew angry at inaction by local authorities. ''But I'll keep sticking up. I tell them, hit me if you can!''
 In part, public health experts blame Japan's romanticized image of suicide as an honorable escape, going back to ritual self-disembowelment by medieval samurai, for the high suicide rate. But the main cause, they say, is the nation's long economic decline. Suicides first surged to their recent high levels in 1998, when traditional lifetime employment guarantees began to vanish, and they have remained high as salaries and job security continued to erode. 
 The situation has worsened during the recent global financial crisis, which is driving this year's increase, experts say. While Prime Minister Yukio Hatoyama, in his first policy speech in October, referred to Japan's suicide rate in calling for ''mutual support'' among Japanese, experts say the government's limited steps to deal with suicide have made little difference. 
 While preventing suicides is a universally difficult task, it is particularly challenging in Japan. Depression remains a taboo topic here, making it hard for those most at risk to seek the help of family and friends. Many Japanese view suicide as an issue of private choice rather than public health, and there are few efforts to highlight the problem.
 ''Americans raise awareness with grass-roots action, but Japanese just wait for the government to take care of them,'' said Yoshitomo Takahashi, a professor of behavioral science who researches suicide at the National Defense Medical College in Tokorozawa, Japan.
 Officials in Sakai, the small city in Fukui Prefecture, where Tojimbo is located, have installed outdoor lighting at the cliffs along with two pay phones and plenty of the 10-yen coins needed to dial up the national suicide hot line. 
 Nevertheless, city officials call this the grimmest year on record, with the police saying they know of more than 140 people who came here intending to commit suicide, twice the average in recent years. Most of them were stopped by the police or nearby tourists, or decided not to jump for other reasons, the police say.
 The police figure does not include the 54 people this year whom Mr. Shige says he and his group have stopped. City officials credit Mr. Shige with helping keep the number of deaths here down to 13 so far this year, about the same as the 15 suicides last year.
 Mr. Shige says his approach to stopping suicides is quite simple: when he finds a likely person, he walks up and gently begins a conversation. The person, usually a man, quickly breaks down in tears, happy to find someone to listen to his problems.
 ''They are just sitting there, alone, hoping someone will talk to them,'' Mr. Shige said.
 As an officer stationed at Tojimbo at the end of his 42-year career, he said he was appalled by all the bodies he had to pluck out of the sea. He said he once stopped an elderly couple from Tokyo from jumping and turned them over to city officials who he said gave them money and told them to buy a ticket to the next town. Days later he received a letter from the couple, mailed just before they committed suicide in a neighboring prefecture.
 ''The authorities' coldness outraged me,'' said Mr. Shige, whose cellphone rings to the tune of ''Amazing Grace,'' though he is not religious. He now has 77 volunteers patrolling the cliffs and providing food, lodging and assistance in finding work to those it helps. He said they tried to patrol two or three times a day. 
 On a recent afternoon, Mr. Shige checked three of the most popular sites for jumpers -- all with drops of at least 70 feet. He said the loners were easy to spot because most visitors moved in groups behind flag-waving guides. Speaking through bullhorns, the guides loudly describe the morbid fame of the cliffs, which were named for an evil Buddhist monk who was said to have fallen to his death there.
 One of those whom Mr. Shige stopped was Yutaka Yamaoka, 29, a factory worker who tried to commit suicide last year after being laid off. Mr. Yamaoka visited Mr. Shige's tiny office by the cliffs on a recent day to thank him and tell him that he had found a job. 
 When Mr. Shige found him last year, Mr. Yamaoka said, he was sitting silently near the cliffs clutching his knees. He said Mr. Shige spoke with him for two hours, then allowed him to stay in an apartment rent free for a month until he felt better. 
 ''I felt saved. I felt I could live,'' recalled Mr. Yamaoka, who spoke haltingly in a barely audible voice. ''My feelings of panic and unease just built up. I had no one to talk with.'' 
 Mr. Shige's efforts have stirred local resentment, particularly from a local tourist association that says his activities are bad for business. But Mr. Shige is not easily deterred.
 ''I will continue until the government finally gets its act together and takes over,'' he said. ''I can't let their inaction cost another precious life.''

HEADLINE: Mexico Deals a Blow to a Cartel but Warns of Continued Drug-Related Violence

BYLINE: By ELISABETH MALKIN; Antonio Betancourt contributed reporting.

DATELINE: MEXICO CITY 

 BODY:
Even by the gruesome standards of Mexico's drug lords, Arturo Beltran Leyva's capacity for violent revenge was especially brazen, officials in both the United States and Mexico say. His enforcement arm, called the Fuerzas Armadas de Arturo, or the Armed Forces of Arturo, is considered one of Mexico's most ruthless, according to the State Department. 
 Since September, he had been carrying out brutal retaliatory attacks against rivals, dumping decapitated heads and tortured bodies across two Mexican states, leaving notes from ''el jefe de jefes,'' the boss of bosses. 
 But on Wednesday, Mr. Beltran Leyva, one of Mexico's three most wanted drug kingpins, was killed during a battle with about 400 special forces troops from the navy and the army, who surrounded a complex in Cuernavaca, where he had an apartment.
 And although President Felipe Calderon on Thursday called the operation ''a convincing blow'' against the drug cartels, his government also warned that drug-related violence might not abate and could even get worse. 
 Mr. Beltran Leyva, 48, who was also wanted in the United States, was the highest-level drug lord to be killed since Mr. Calderon began his offensive against powerful drug gangs in 2006. 
 Six other people suspected of being drug gunmen, included one who committed suicide, and one sailor died in the firefight, the Mexican authorities said. 
 Mr. Beltran Leyva's death is a public relations victory for Mr. Calderon, who is facing criticism from the opposition over what they say is a lack of progress in his crackdown on drugs. Despite thousands of arrests and the capture of several gang leaders, drug violence keeps increasing. 
 Speaking from Copenhagen, where he is attending the United Nations climate talks, Mr. Calderon called Mr. Beltran Leyva's death ''a convincing blow against one of the most dangerous criminal organizations in Mexico and on the continent.''
 But Attorney General Arturo Chavez Chavez said that violence would continue. ''Getting the leader of a cartel is a very strong blow and this will surely force restructuring,'' Mr. Chavez Chavez said. ''Violence inside the cartel can't be ruled out until the chain of command is defined.'' 
 Jorge Chabat, a security expert at the Center for Research and Teaching in Economics, in Mexico City, said that Mr. Beltran Leyva's death was a step in the government's long-term strategy of fragmenting the cartels' power to limit their activity. 
 But not everyone agreed that the strategy was working. 
 ''The truth is that this is a type of thousand-headed hydra,'' said Jose Luis Pineiro, a researcher at the Autonomous Metropolitan University in Mexico City. ''You cut off one and another one emerges, but the government believes that this tactic of dismembering cartels is effective.'' 
 Still, the swift and effective operation on Wednesday sent a message, said Guillermo Zepeda, a security expert with the Cidac research group. ''By getting the most visible leaders, you send the message that you are ending the impunity of the big capos,'' he said. ''I think that these surgical strikes are the ones that are really worth the trouble.'' 
 Mr. Beltran Leyva's organization had expanded its control over states in the central part of the country, including lucrative smuggling through the Mexico City airport, according to Mexican and American officials. 
 Mexican authorities have said that the gang bribed several senior antidrug agents. Investigators believe that Mr. Beltran Leyva ordered the murder of an acting federal police chief in May 2008, after the chief fired the police chief at the airport to break up the smuggling operation there, Mr. Zepeda said.

HEADLINE: Amid Praise and Doubt, Senate Panel Approves Bernanke for 2nd Fed Term

BYLINE: By BRIAN KNOWLTON and JAVIER C. HERNANDEZ; Brian Knowlton reported from Washington, and Javier C. Hernandez from New York.

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
The Senate Banking Committee voted Thursday to approve the nomination of Ben S. Bernanke for a second four-year term as chairman of the Federal Reserve.
 The 16-to-7 vote, which came after flashes of populist anger erupted amid a sluggish and uneven economic recovery, was not unexpected. 
 President Obama has said the nomination would provide crucial continuity as the country works through its gravest economic challenges in decades. 
 But it represented a retreat from Mr. Bernanke's near-unanimous approval by the committee four years ago. Neither party's members voted as a bloc, and even some of Mr. Bernanke's supporters said they harbored reservations and might reconsider when the vote went to the Senate. 
 Even as Mr. Bernanke is widely credited for helping stabilize markets and averting economic calamity, outspoken critics, not all of them Republicans, have blamed him for enormously costly initiatives that have bolstered some Wall Street financial firms while leaving ordinary Americans staring at persistent double-digit jobless rates. 
 Mr. Bernanke, 56, has also been criticized for not doing more to prevent the financial crisis. He was originally named by President Bush in 2005 to succeed Alan Greenspan as the Fed chairman. 
 Senator Richard C. Shelby of Alabama, the committee's ranking Republican, said that Mr. Bernanke, first as a member of the board of governors and then as chairman, was complicit in creating an atmosphere that encouraged risk-taking and contributed to the disastrous housing price bubble -- signs of which, Mr. Shelby said, Mr. Bernanke had missed. 
 ''Our trust and confidence were misplaced,'' Mr. Shelby said, shortly before voting against the nominee.
 Senator Jeff Merkley, Democrat of Oregon, also opposed the nomination, saying that even if Mr. Bernanke ''has shown himself to be quite adroit with the fire hose'' since the crisis erupted, he bore some responsibility for its outbreak, and thus for the loss of jobs and depleted savings accounts.
 Some of the critics' complaints had merit, said the committee chairman, Senator Christopher J. Dodd of Connecticut. Still, Mr. Dodd added, ''Chairman Bernanke must also receive credit for the critical role he played in the events of last fall.'' Had he and others not acted, Mr. Dodd said, the nation probably would have faced ''utter economic catastrophe -- and I believe nothing short of that was at risk.'' 
 Instead, Mr. Dodd added, ''I believe better days do lie ahead.''
 A Republican, Senator Judd Gregg of New Hampshire, offered a strong endorsement of the nominee. While ''mistakes were made'' under his purview, Mr. Gregg said, Mr. Bernanke's swift reaction to the financial crisis had proved crucial. ''I tell you, it worked,'' he said. ''It's that simple.''
 But Senator Bernard Sanders, independent of Vermont, strongly opposes Mr. Bernanke's nomination because of his role in the bailouts and has put a hold on the nomination. That means it will require 60 votes, not a simple majority.
 Although his confirmation appears likely, a number of no votes are expected from members of both parties when the full Senate votes and if Mr. Bernanke is not confirmed by Jan. 31, when his term ends, then the Fed's vice chairman, Donald L. Kohn, would temporarily take over. 
 President Obama, in announcing his nomination of Mr. Bernanke in August, said he had led the Fed through ''one of the worst financial crises that this nation and this world have ever faced'' and, because of his background, his expertise on the Depression and his unflappable personality, was ideally suited to help lead the recovery.
 During his four years, Mr. Bernanke has emerged as a favorite target of liberals and conservatives alike. Critics have tried to portray him as cozy with Wall Street elites and slow to react to signs that the financial system was on the brink of collapse.
 Mr. Bernanke, a former professor at Princeton, was initially criticized as too academic, but he has since spearheaded some of the most interventionist actions by the Fed in its history. 
 At a hearing earlier this month, Mr. Bernanke acknowledged mistakes by the Fed in the runup to the financial crisis. But Mr. Bernanke adamantly defended the Fed's response to the crisis, particularly its efforts to crack down on banks, subprime mortgages, credit card fees and executive compensation. 
 Mr. Bernanke has often been forced to navigate the line between doing too much and too little, and he has faced the constant danger of pushing the economy into a deeper downturn if the central bank's extraordinary measures were withdrawn too quickly.
 At the hearing earlier this month, Mr. Bernanke bristled at proposals to strip the Fed of its power, saying the central bank had unique expertise and knew the inner workings of major financial institutions better than any entity.
 Adding to the intensity surrounding Mr. Bernanke's appointment, Time Magazine named him this week as its Person of the Year, citing his role in leading the economic recovery. Mr. Bernanke's visage appears on the magazine's cover, superimposed on a dollar.
 When the Senate Banking Committee took a voice vote on Mr. Bernanke's first nomination as Fed chairman, only one senator opposed the nominee: Senator Jim Bunning, Republican of Kentucky. 
 On Thursday, Mr. Bunning, who has one of the most conservative voting records in the Senate, remained a thorn in the chairman's side. 
 In delivering his criticism, he cited a blogger's remark that giving Mr. Bernanke the Person of the Year citation was like rewarding the captain of the Titanic.

HEADLINE: At White House, Holidays Are Both Treat and Test

BYLINE: By RACHEL L. SWARNS

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
For many in this town, December is a magical season of flickering menorahs and sparkling pine trees, spicy eggnog and savory latkes. But at the White House it is also a grueling whirlwind of nonstop parties and receptions -- the biggest test yet of the Obamas' entertaining endurance and party-hosting prowess.
 The White House is holding 17 parties and 11 open houses, all over the course of about three weeks. President Obama and his wife, Michelle, are throwing open the doors to more than 50,000 visitors -- supporters, lawmakers, rabbis, soldiers, generals, journalists, White House staff members and ordinary people -- who will ogle the decorations and angle for coveted close encounters with the president and first lady. 
 While this public display of power entertaining is an annual tradition, the Obamas have put their stamp on the festivities by highlighting their eco-friendly decorations, an understated decor to reflect the difficult economic times, and a buffet menu that showcases healthful fare like salmon, fresh vegetables and sushi. 
 Unlike their predecessors, the Obamas face heightened scrutiny as the White House puts in place tougher measures to prevent security breaches like the one in November, when a couple seeking a spot on a reality television show crashed the state dinner for the prime minister of India. 
 ''It's a massive, massive undertaking,'' said Kim Merlin, the Chicago floral consultant who helped coordinate the White House's holiday decor with Simon Doonan, the creative director of Barneys New York.
 Ms. Merlin said the planning required ''an army of people,'' including aides from the social secretary's office, florists, chefs, electricians, butlers, welders, carpenters and volunteers. There are 27 Christmas trees, 129 wreaths, 2,700 yards of ribbon and a 390-pound gingerbread White House (with Bo, the first dog, depicted in marzipan), not to mention some 48,000 sweets for guests. 
 So far, the Obamas have played down the organizational weightlifting required. 
 ''It is just absolutely magical,'' Mrs. Obama told Oprah Winfrey in an interview about Christmas in the White House that was broadcast Sunday on ABC. 
 And during a seemingly endless receiving line at one of the two holiday parties for journalists this week, Mr. Obama chuckled and dismissed questions about his party stamina. ''We don't get tired,'' he said.
 But Anita McBride, who was Laura Bush's chief of staff during the second Bush term, said White House staff members, particularly those in the East Wing, had always viewed the holiday season with a sense of eager anticipation and some dread. 
 ''It's beautiful; it's a special time,'' Ms. McBride said. ''But at the beginning of the season, you would look at the calendar and say, 'How are we going to get through this?' There was a part of you that really was bracing yourself for being on your feet so long.''
 The Obamas have opted not to stand as much, abandoning the practice of shaking hands and posing for photographs with every guest at every party, a custom embraced (though perhaps a bit wearily) by other presidents and first ladies. Their aides say the Obamas prefer smaller gatherings where they can mix and mingle, but some guests have expressed dismay.
 ''People who didn't know were disappointed,'' said Dee Dee Myers, a former press secretary to President Bill Clinton, who attended the party that included Democratic donors and party officials and described the glum chatter there. ''I totally understand that doing receiving lines is exhausting, yet people have come to expect it. It means a lot to them.'' 
 There are other changes, too. The Obamas are having fewer parties than the Bushes did and none on weekends, aides say, perhaps reflecting that the White House is also home to their daughters, Malia and Sasha.
 As for the decor, Mrs. Obama decided to display fewer trees and wreaths. There is no artificial snow and no Santa Claus, who was displayed in the East Garden Room last year. Aides said the choices reflected the Obamas' personal taste and their empathy for the hardships facing many Americans. 
 ''It should be beautiful and refined, but it also should be restrained, because it's a difficult time,'' Ms. Merlin said, describing the principles that guided her mission.
 So the more than 800 ornaments adorning the Christmas tree in the Blue Room were recycled from earlier administrations but updated with new designs by community groups across the country. 
 The cranberry Christmas tree in the Red Room -- a holiday staple since the Reagan administration -- is gone, but cranberry garlands are on the mantle.
 As for security, visitors' names were being checked twice before they entered the White House this week. Guests were also being asked to show photo identification at two separate checkpoints, and Desiree Rogers, the social secretary, was on hand to welcome the invitees.
 Meanwhile, like other first ladies, Mrs. Obama is also making time in her hectic social schedule to help the needy, organizing a toy drive for poor children and urging Americans to help the hungry by volunteering in food banks and delivering meals to the homebound.
 ''That's what America is all about, people already sacrificing, stepping up and doing a little bit more,'' Mrs. Obama said this week as she delivered toys to the Toys for Tots warehouse in Virginia.

HEADLINE: Liberal Revolt on Health Care Stings White House

BYLINE: By SHERYL GAY STOLBERG

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
In the great health care debate of 2009, President Obama has cast himself as a cold-eyed pragmatist, willing to compromise in exchange for votes. Now ideology -- an uprising on the Democratic left -- is smacking the pragmatic president in the face.
 Stung by the intense White House effort to court the votes of moderate holdouts like Senator Joseph I. Lieberman, independent of Connecticut, and Senator Ben Nelson, Democrat of Nebraska, liberals are signaling that they have compromised enough. Grass-roots groups are balking, liberal commentators are becoming more critical of the president, some unions are threatening to withhold support and Howard Dean, the former Democratic Party chief, is urging the Senate to kill its health bill. 
 The White House scrambled Thursday to tamp down the revolt, which has been simmering for weeks but boiled over when the Senate Democratic leadership, bowing to Mr. Lieberman, scrapped language allowing people as young as 55 to buy into Medicare. 
 David Axelrod, Mr. Obama's senior adviser, began the day by calling in to MSNBC to urge the party to hold together, warning of a ''tragic outcome'' if Democrats failed to pass a bill that the White House says would expand health coverage while reining in costs. 
 ''I don't think you want this moment to pass,'' Mr. Axelrod said. ''It will not come back again.''
 Former President Bill Clinton echoed the theme, issuing a statement in which he urged fellow Democrats to ''take it from someone who knows: these chances don't come around every day.'' Mr. Clinton's former chief of staff, John Podesta, a close Obama ally, pushed back against Mr. Dean on the Internet and on television.
 The backlash is building as Mr. Obama is under increasing pressure from his party's left flank on issues ranging from the economy to Afghanistan. This week alone, the House speaker, Nancy Pelosi, declared that she would not insist that her caucus vote to finance Mr. Obama's troop buildup, while Senator Bernard Sanders, the Vermont independent and self-avowed democratic socialist, chastised the president for reappointing Ben S. Bernanke as chairman of the Federal Reserve. 
 The left's disenchantment with Mr. Obama on health care harks back to his decision, before he became president, not to try to replace the current private insurance system with a single-payer, government-run ''Medicare for all'' system. Throughout the year, at town-hall-style meetings and other public appearances, he has been dogged by advocates who have complained that he has sold out.
 Instead, the president proposed what he called the public option, a government-run insurance plan that would coexist with private plans on a new health insurance exchange. For many on the left who are also dissatisfied with a deal the White House cut with the pharmaceutical industry, the public option was itself a compromise. 
 Now that the Senate Democratic leadership has stripped the last vestige of the public option -- the Medicare buy-in provision -- from its bill, progressives are feeling doubly betrayed.
 ''It's time for the president to get his hands dirty,'' Representative Anthony Weiner, Democrat of New York, said in a statement this week. ''Some of us have compromised our compromised compromise. We need the president to stand up for the values our party shares.''
 The passion is most intense in the House, but it appears to be spilling over to the Senate. In an interview on Thursday, Mr. Sanders, another advocate of a single-payer system, said he was not certain how he would vote on the bill, though Democratic leaders have been assuming he would back it in the end. 
 ''I don't sleep well,'' Mr. Sanders said. ''I am struggling with this issue very hard, trying to sort out what is positive in this bill, what is negative in the bill, what it means for our country if there is no health insurance legislation, when we will come back to it.''
 The senator added, ''And I have to combine that with the fact that I absolutely know that the insurance companies and the drug companies will be laughing all the way to the bank the day after this is passed.''
 The White House insists that is not the case. Aides to Mr. Obama argue that the bill includes a variety of consumer protections -- like ending lifetime coverage caps and the practice of refusing patients with pre-existing conditions -- that will make insurers unhappy. 
 ''People need to put this in perspective,'' Dan Pfeiffer, Mr. Obama's communications director, said in an interview on Thursday. ''Two years ago, the Democratic Party would have done anything for the opportunity to pass a health care reform like this. Let's realize how far we've come, and how close we are to making history.''

HEADLINE: Nike's Profit Improves After Cutting Costs

BYLINE: By REUTERS

 BODY:
Nike reported better-than-expected second-quarter earnings Thursday as cost-cutting and a steadier order book helped offset weak sales in mature markets, and its shares rose more than 3 percent. 
 Nike has countered declines in consumer spending mainly by cutting costs, streamlining operations and reducing marketing. It has slashed 5 percent of its global workforce, or some 1,750 jobs.
 Orders for goods to be delivered from now until April fell 1 percent on a constant currency basis. That was better than some analysts had expected and an improvement from a 4 percent decline in the first quarter.
 A sampling of analysts had forecast a range of flat to down 6 percent in the second quarter for the gauge.
 Second-quarter net income fell 4 percent to $375 million, or 76 cents a share, from $391 million, or 80 cents a share, a year earlier. That was better than analysts' average forecast of earnings of 71 cents per share, according to Thomson Reuters.
 Revenue slipped 4 percent, to $4.4 billion, with sales down in every geographical area except for Nike's emerging markets.
 Revenue slid 4 percent in North America, 6 percent in Western Europe and 24 percent in Central and Eastern Europe. In China, a market with double-digit growth last year, sales fell 3 percent.
 Revenues were up 1 percent in the historically fast-growing unit that sells non-Nike-branded goods.
 Gross margins fell to 44.5 percent from 44.7 percent in the year-ago quarter, caused by higher discounting and foreign exchange impacts.
 Nike's sales have been under pressure in recent quarters as consumers in the United States and Europe have spent conservatively and mall-based retailers have cut back on orders and carry less inventory.
 Stock in Nike, which is based in Beaverton, Ore., rose 3.3 percent to $65.33 a share after closing at $63.25 on the New York Stock Exchange.

FILM SERIES
 'CITY LIGHTS' AND 'MODERN TIMES' (Monday through Wednesday) This series features Charlie Chaplin's last two films without spoken dialogue (with their elaborate scores and sound effects, they are hardly silent), released (in 1931 and 1936) long after the rest of Hollywood had given up on the silent cinema. Both films are deeply engaged in the social and economic realities of the Great Depression, which, if anything, makes them timelier today. In ''City Lights'' Chaplin is a citizen of the streets who goes from sleeping in the arms of a civic statue to fighting back his impossible love for a blind flower girl. ''Modern Times'' imagines him almost literally as a cog in the gigantic machine of American capitalism, a factory worker who befriends an orphan (Paulette Goddard) and dreams of the open road. Walter Reade Theater, 165 West 65th Street, Lincoln Center , (212) 975-5600, filmlinc.org. Single tickets: $11; $8 for 62+; $7 for students and children. Both films: $15; $11 for 62+; $9 for students and children. (Dave Kehr)20091217 
 'HIS GIRL FRIDAY' (Friday through Thursday) I'm not sure what qualifies Howard Hawks's endlessly entertaining reconfiguration of ''The Front Page'' as a holiday movie -- probably not its message of ''good will toward men'' -- but any excuse to see this comic masterpiece with an audience is a good one. Cary Grant (editor) and Rosalind Russell (ace reporter) are the recently divorced tabloid colleagues who find, in the impending execution of a mild-mannered anarchist (John Qualen), the perfect opportunity to relive and perhaps repair their relationship. BAM Rose Cinemas, 30 Lafayette Avenue, at Ashland Place, Fort Greene, Brooklyn , (718) 636-4100, bam.org; $11. (Kehr)20091217
 'IT'S A WONDERFUL LIFE' (Friday through Thursday) What, you thought you were going to get away without seeing it this year? Fat chance. Frank Capra's Christmas chestnut (with its grim, film noir underpinnings) returns for a weeklong run, strewing artificial snow and Zuzu's petals in its path. IFC Center, 323 Avenue of the Americas, at Third Street, Greenwich Village , (212) 924-7771, ifccenter.com; $12.50; $8.50 for children and 62+. (Kehr)20091217
 'SEVEN BRIDES FOR SEVEN BROTHERS' (Friday) Nov. 10 was the centenary of the birth of the lyricist Johnny Mercer, an event to be celebrated by a screening of the 1954 musical, directed by Stanley Donen, that was probably Mercer's most ambitious project for the movies. Howard Keel, Jane Powell, Russ Tamblyn and Julie Newmar star in this athletic adaptation of ''The Sabine Women,'' with the action transposed to a 19th-century lumber camp in the Pacific Northwest. At 7 p.m., Museum of Modern Art Roy and Niuta Titus Theaters , (212) 708-9400, moma.org; $10; $8 for 65+; $6 for students. (Kehr)20091217
 MOVIE LISTINGS
 Ratings and running times are in parentheses; foreign films have English subtitles. Full reviews of all current releases, movie trailers, showtimes and tickets: nytimes.com/movies. 
 'ANTICHRIST' (No rating, 1:49) Women: evil or just misunderstood? Leave it to Lars von Trier to ask the tough question, and to provide answers that are both incoherent and appalling. (A. O. Scott)20091217
 'ARMORED' (PG-13, 1:28) A blunt little B movie about a heist gone wrong. Not brilliant, but not bad either. (Scott)20091217
 'BAD LIEUTENANT: PORT OF CALL NEW ORLEANS' (R, 2:01) Werner Herzog's pungent, pulpy cop story is, above all, the vehicle for a sustained display of marvelously inventive acting from Nicolas Cage, who plays the title character -- a New Orleans detective with serious problems -- with nearly lunatic bravura. (Scott)20091217
 'BIG RIVER MAN' (No rating, 1:40) John Maringouin directs this richly textured, funny, strange and poignant documentary about an outsize Slovenian, Martin Strel, who, well into adulthood, began swimming some of the longest rivers in the world, including the Amazon. (Manohla Dargis)20091217
 'THE BLIND SIDE' (PG-13, 2:00) Sandra Bullock does good, and then does good some more in this true story of a rich white Memphis family that adopts a homeless young African-American football prodigy. (Scott)20091217
 'BRIGHT STAR' (PG, 1:59) Jane Campion, following the biographical record closely, tells the story of John Keats (Ben Whishaw) and Fanny Brawne (Abbie Cornish), star-crossed literary lovers of the Regency period. Thanks to the passionate performances and the director's rough, almost breathless style, what might have been a prettified period drama becomes a seething, swooning inquiry into the nature of love. (Scott)20091217
 'BROKEN EMBRACES' (R, 2:08, in Spanish) Exuberant melancholy from Pedro Almodovar. A blind writer (Lluis Homar) is pulled back into his past, when he was a filmmaker in an ill-fated love affair with an actress played by Penelope Cruz. (Scott)20091217
 'BROTHERS' (R, 1:50) In Jim Sheridan's remake of Susanne Bier's 2004 film, Tommy (Jake Gyllenhaal) is back from prison just in time to see his brother, Sam (Tobey Maguire), go off to war, leaving behind a wife (Natalie Portman) and two young daughters. An earnest melodrama ensues, at times affecting but never entirely convincing. (Scott)20091217
 'COCO BEFORE CHANEL' (PG-13, 1:10, in French) Less a biopic than a study in the manners and morals of a bygone era, Anne Fontaine's film follows the complicated love life and budding ambition of Gabrielle Chanel (Audrey Tautou) on her path from early poverty and heartbreak through independence toward eventual fame. Ms. Tautou, wary and astringent, is excellent, as is Benoit Poelvoorde, who plays Coco's aristocratic lover, Etienne Balsan. (Scott)20091217
 'DISNEY'S A CHRISTMAS CAROL' (PG, 1:35) A big, 3-D spectacle, directed by Robert Zemeckis and starring Jim Carrey as Ebenezer Scrooge (and also as some of the ghosts who haunt him), this film has a magic that lies not in its effects but in its fidelity to the language and mood of Charles Dickens's immortal tale of greed and grace. (Scott)20091217
 'AN EDUCATION' (PG-13, 1:40) Jenny, a London schoolgirl in the early 1960s -- played with verve and brass by Carey Mulligan -- learns the ways of the world at the hands of an older gentleman (Peter Sarsgaard), who turns out to be sleazier and less worldly than he seems at first. Adapted by Nick Hornby from a memoir by Lynn Bradley and directed by Lone Scherfig, this film is a bit too charmed by its own period atmosphere to take account of the uglier implications of the story it tells. (Scott)20091217
 'EVERYBODY'S FINE' (PG-13, 1:40) The only credible scenes in this Christmas weepie starring Robert De Niro as a widowed retired father of four grown children belong to Sam Rockwell, who plays one of his two sons. Otherwise, the movie, adapted from a 1990 film by Giuseppe Tornatore, is false to the core. (Stephen Holden)20091217
 'FANTASTIC MR. FOX' (PG, 1:28) A children's adventure story or a Wes Anderson movie. Both, of course, and Mr. Anderson, using a painstakingly old-fashioned stop-motion animation technique, turns Roald Dahl's slender fable into his most satisfying film since ''Rushmore.'' (Scott)20091217
 'THE FOURTH KIND' (PG-13, 1:38) This supernatural thriller may be humorless, paranoid nonsense, but its biggest failure is its inability to scare. (Holden)20091217
 'THE HURT LOCKER' (R, 2:10) In this tense, insightful film about a United States Army bomb-disposal squad in Iraq, Kathryn Bigelow has made a crackerjack action picture that is also a drama of character, psychology and ideas. Jeremy Renner, as a soldier who approaches danger with the conviction of an artist and the compulsiveness of an addict, is simply amazing, and the rest of the cast, notably Brian Geraghty and Anthony Mackie, is nearly as strong. (Scott)20091217
 'LA DANSE: THE PARIS OPERA BALLET' (No rating, 2:38, in English and French) Frederick Wiseman, master of the long-form, fly-on-the-wall documentary, watches dancers and choreographers, marketers and managers, and the result is a blissful immersion in the world of ballet, which feels by the end like the only world worth knowing. (Scott)20091217
 'LOOT' (No rating, 1:26, in English and German) Moving from a jungle in the Philippines to an Austrian field at twilight, Darius Marder's engrossing and exquisitely shot documentary tags along with Lance Larson, a Utah car dealer and human magpie. Hunting buried treasure from World War II, Mr. Larson befriends two veterans whose long-suppressed recollections drive the film in unexpected directions. But as the film's frustrating lack of focus becomes an organic embrace of life's unpredictability, what begins as a treasure hunt transforms into a meditation on conscience, memory and the terrible legacies of war. (Jeannette Catsoulis)20091217
 'THE MAID' (No rating, 1:35, in Spanish) Catalina Saavedra plays the title character in this Chilean movie about a live-in maid whose constricted world begins to crack, allowing life and air to slip in through the fissures. Sebastian Silva directs, slyly. (Dargis)20091217
 'ME AND ORSON WELLES' (PG-13, 1:53) A charming and modest backstage tale set in 1937, when Orson Welles (Christian MacKay) was preparing a revolutionary modern-dress production of ''Julius Caesar'' at the Mercury Theater on Broadway. Zac Efron is the teenager who falls in with Welles's company, and in love with Sonja (Claire Danes), the backstage manager. (Scott)20091217
 'THE MESSENGER' (R, 1:45) Ben Foster and Woody Harrelson are Army officers with the grim task of informing the families of soldiers that their loved ones have died overseas. Samantha Morton plays a widow who takes the news with calm sorrow. The terrific performances complement Oren Moverman's sensitive, understated direction and the rich, observant script he wrote with Alessandro Camon. (Scott)20091217
 'MY SON, MY SON WHAT HAVE YE DONE' (R, 1:31) Werner Herzog directs Michael Shannon in a true-to-life if truer-to-Herzog story about a Southern California man who one morning did in his mother. Chloe Sevigny, Willem Dafoe and Grace Zabriskie add some extra tang. (Dargis)20091217
 'NINJA ASSASSIN' (R, 1:36) World governments are hiring ninjas to do their dirtiest deeds, and only a rogue ninja (played by Rain, the South Korean former boy-band member) and an Interpol-style cop (Naomie Harris) can expose them. Perhaps in homage to his rippling star, the director, James McTeigue, drenches the film in water; but not even some lovely flashbacks -- first love, first wounds, first downpour -- can redeem a movie more committed to bloodletting than to any of its characters. (Catsoulis)20091217
 'OLD DOGS' (PG, 1:35) Not even the combined talents of John Travolta and Robin Williams can breathe levity into this incoherent family comedy: the worst major studio movie of 2009. (Holden)20091217
 'PAA' (No rating, 2:13, in Hindi) Amitabh Bachchan stars with his son, Abhishek, in this Hindi film with an I'm-my-own-grandpa twist. Amitabh, in a sometimes creepy feat of stunt acting, plays Abhishek's son, a boy with progeria, a rare disease that makes him age way too fast. The movie, though, is less about the disease than about India, itself simultaneously young and ancient. (Rachel Saltz)20091217
 'PIRATE RADIO' (R, 1:55) A fanciful fiction from Richard Curtis about rebel broadcasters (played by Philip Seymour Hoffman, among others) who, in the mid-1960s, blasted British airwaves and eardrums with the Kinks and other youth-quaking greats of the era. (Dargis)20091217
 'PLANET 51' (PG, 1:31) Almost every element of this animated film about an American astronaut who lands on a distant planet populated by ''Shrek''-like little green men and women is borrowed from earlier movies, then tweaked (and invariably softened) to become a reference rather than a copy. (Holden)20091217
 'PRECIOUS: BASED ON THE NOVEL ''PUSH'' BY SAPPHIRE' (R, 1:49) This potent blend of naturalism and melodrama, directed by Lee Daniels, unites a cast that includes the pop stars Mariah Carey and Lenny Kravitz, the comedian Mo'Nique and a fearless newcomer named Gabourey Sidibe in the story of an abused Harlem teenager struggling for dignity and survival. Ms. Sidibe, in the title role, is the key to the film, and her steady, moving performance is a revelation. (Scott)20091217
 'THE PRINCESS AND THE FROG' (G, 1:35) It's not easy being green, as the heroine of this polished animated fairy tale -- the first from Disney with a black heroine -- discovers on kissing a frog. But to judge from how this period movie deals with race, it is a lot more difficult to be black. (Dargis)20091217
 'THE PRIVATE LIVES OF PIPPA LEE' (R, 1:33) If Rebecca Miller's film fits into the dreaded category known as the dysfunctional-family drama, it steers away from the weepy cliches and quasi-therapeutic mumbo-jumbo that have given the genre a bad name. (Holden)20091217
 'RED CLIFF' (R, 2:28, in Mandarin) The seminal action director John Woo returns after a six-year layoff with this tale of warring kingdoms, set in the third century A.D., which reunites him with the marvelous Hong Kong actor Tony Leung. While handsome and intelligent and perfectly easy to sit through, it never really approaches the visceral tug of Mr. Woo's crime dramas of the 1980s and '90s. (Mike Hale)20091217
 'THE ROAD' (R, 1:59) How does the world end? Not with a bang or a whimper, but with polite applause for this noble, earnest adaptation of Cormac McCarthy's novel, and something stronger for Viggo Mortensen's performance as a father trying to help his young son survive a postapocalyptic nightmare. (Scott)20091217
 'ROCKET SINGH: SALESMAN OF THE YEAR' (No rating, 2:20, in Hindi) This well-made and unusually focused Bollywood film (no big production numbers, barely any romance) features Ranbir Kapoor as a salesman whose biggest problem is that he's honest. The villain here? Business as usual. Shimit Amin (''Chak De! India'') directed. (Saltz)20091217
 'A SERIOUS MAN' (R, 1:45) Old Testament mishigas from Joel and Ethan Coen, who retell the Book of Job as a suburban shaggy-dog story about a harmless physics professor (Michael Stuhlbarg) whose life comes unraveled. The usual Coen brothers' whimsy, with its edge of nihilism, takes on a surprising metaphysical resonance. You don't have to be Jewish to like this movie, but it will hurt more if you are. (Scott)20091217
 'A SINGLE MAN' (No rating, 1:39) Colin Firth, with a magnificent depth of feeling, plays the grieving, closeted gay professor of the film's title in Tom Ford's ambitious and touching adaptation of the 1964 landmark novel by Christopher Isherwood. (Dargis)20091217
 'THE SUN' (No rating, 1:50, in English and Japanese) A beautiful and eccentric act of historical imagination from the Russian director Alexander Sokurov about the emperor Hirohito during the period leading up to and following Japan's surrender to the United States in 1945. (Dargis)20091217
 '2012' (PG-13, 2:38) Roland Emmerich serves up Old Testament-style destruction with a smile. (Dargis)20091217
 'THE TWILIGHT SAGA: NEW MOON' (PG-13, 2:10) Ready, set, squeal! Chris Weitz directs, Kristen Stewart mopes, Robert Pattison sparkles and Taylor Lautner growls. (Dargis)20091217
 'UNTIL THE LIGHT TAKES US' (No rating, 1:33) Aaron Aites and Audrey Ewell's absorbing documentary about the Norwegian black-metal music scene examines how a few musicians hijacked an obscure offshoot of heavy metal, and made it world famous, by moving from clown paint and anti-Christian imagery into vandalism, church burning and killing. It also fillsin the Norwegian context -- cold and dark, liberal but ultraconformist, increasingly globalized -- in which these diffident, smart young men came to feel so alienated. (Hale)20091217
 'UP IN THE AIR' (R, 1:47) A laugh-infused stealth tragedy from Jason Reitman about a corporate assassin (George Clooney) whose life is upended both by a no-nonsense colleague (Anna Kendrick) and a seductively high-flying female executive (Vera Farmiga). (Dargis)20091217
 'WHERE THE WILD THINGS ARE' (PG, 1:40) Spike Jonze directs this alternately perfect and imperfect if always beautiful live-action adaptation of the Maurice Sendak children's book about a solitary boy, Max (Max Records), liberated by his imagination. The film has been pitched to a distinctly older audience than the picture book's original readers, and some younger children might be scared by the snuffling, growling wild things (voiced by James Gandolfini, among others). (Dargis)20091217
 'WILLIAM KUNSTLER: DISTURBING THE UNIVERSE' (No rating, 1:25) A refresher course on the history of American left-wing politics in the 1960s and '70s, as well as an affectionate personal biography of the left-wing political lawyer, this documentary portrays Kunstler as a heroic crusader for justice, but is not entirely uncritical. (Holden)20091217

HEADLINE: The Hardest Call

BYLINE: By DAVID BROOKS

 BODY:
The first reason to support the Senate health care bill is that it would provide insurance to 30 million more Americans.
 The second reason to support the bill is that its authors took the deficit issue seriously. Compared with, say, the prescription drug benefit from a few years ago, this bill is a model of fiscal rectitude. It spends a lot of money to cover the uninsured, but to help pay for it, it also includes serious Medicare cuts and whopping tax increases -- the tax on high-cost insurance plans alone will raise $1.3 trillion in the second decade.
 The bill is not really deficit-neutral. It's politically inconceivable that Congress will really make all the spending cuts that are there on paper. But the bill won't explode the deficit, and that's an accomplishment. 
 The third reason to support the bill is that the authors have thrown in a million little ideas in an effort to reduce health care inflation. The fact is, nobody knows how to reduce cost growth within the current system. The authors of this bill are willing to try anything. You might even call this a Burkean approach. They are not fundamentally disrupting the status quo, but they are experimenting with dozens of gradual programs that might bend the cost curve.
 If you've ever heard about it, it's in there -- improved insurance exchanges, payment innovations, an independent commission to cap Medicare payment rates, an innovation center, comparative effectiveness research. There's at least a pilot program for every promising idea.
 The fourth reason to support the bill is that if this fails, it will take a long time to get back to health reform. Clinton failed. Obama will have failed. No one will touch this. Meanwhile, health costs will continue their inexorable march upward, strangling the nation.
 The first reason to oppose this bill is that it does not fundamentally reform health care. The current system is rotten to the bone with opaque pricing and insane incentives. Consumers are insulated from the costs of their decisions and providers are punished for efficiency. Burkean gradualism is fine if you've got a cold. But if you've got cancer, you want surgery, not nasal spray.
 If this bill passes, you'll have 500 experts in Washington trying to hold down costs and 300 million Americans with the same old incentives to get more and more care. The Congressional Budget Office and most of the experts I talk to (including many who support the bill) do not believe it will seriously bend the cost curve.
 The second reason to oppose this bill is that, according to the chief actuary for Medicare, it will cause national health care spending to increase faster. Health care spending is already zooming past 17 percent of G.D.P. to 22 percent and beyond. If these pressures mount even faster, health care will squeeze out everything else, especially on the state level. We'll shovel more money into insurance companies and you can kiss goodbye programs like expanded preschool that would have a bigger social impact.
 Third, if passed, the bill sets up a politically unsustainable situation. Over its first several years, the demand for health care will rise sharply. The supply will not. Providers will have the same perverse incentives. As a result, prices will skyrocket while efficiencies will not. There will be a bipartisan rush to gut reform.
 This country has reduced health inflation in short bursts, but it has not sustained cost control over the long term because the deep flaws in the system produce horrific political pressures that gut restraint.
 Fourth, you can't centrally regulate 17 percent of the U.S. economy without a raft of unintended consequences.
 Fifth, it will slow innovation. Government regulators don't do well with disruptive new technologies.
 Sixth, if this passes, we will never get back to cost control. The basic political deal was, we get to have dessert (expanding coverage) but we have to eat our spinach (cost control), too. If we eat dessert now, we'll never come back to the spinach.
 So what's my verdict? I have to confess, I flip-flop week to week and day to day. It's a guess. Does this put us on a path toward the real reform, or does it head us down a valley in which real reform will be less likely?
 If I were a senator forced to vote today, I'd vote no. If you pass a health care bill without systemic incentives reform, you set up a political vortex in which the few good parts of the bill will get stripped out and the expensive and wasteful parts will be entrenched. 
 Defenders say we can't do real reform because the politics won't allow it. The truth is the reverse. Unless you get the fundamental incentives right, the politics will be terrible forever and ever.

HEADLINE: In Turning to Video Gaming, the State Chases Fool's Gold

BYLINE: By JAMES WARREN. 
James Warren is a longtime Chicago journalist and the publisher of The Chicago Reader.

 BODY:
Gov. Patrick J. Quinn saw the premiere this week of ''American Buffalo,'' the fine revival by the Steppenwolf Theatre Company of David Mamet's melancholy journey into a Chicago basement junkshop and the lives of three petty criminals.
 I hope the governor understood that it is a tale about chasing fool's gold. That is just what he and the Illinois General Assembly are doing by legalizing video gambling. 
In July, Mr. Quinn -- the reform-minded accidental successor to the disgraced former Gov. Rod R. Blagojevich -- proved as desperate and banal as any official nationwide. After ditching his initial tax plan, Mr. Quinn signed the Video Gaming Act as a key to pay for a $31 billion capital improvement bill. Illinois had lacked a capital program since the incarcerated former Gov. George Ryan was in office, and now we turn to video poker, blackjack and other games draining the paychecks and jobless benefits of the poor -- all supposedly to produce jobs and deal with crumbling roads, dilapidated schools and rickety buses.
 The law could result in the installation of an estimated 45,000 machines wherever booze is consumed: bars, restaurants, truck stops and fraternal and veterans organizations. The independent Illinois Gaming Board, which made clear its inability to oversee the law due to inadequate resources, was belatedly aided by the pinstriped Darth Vader of Springfield -- the House speaker, Michael Madigan -- who allocated $4.4 million for hiring, drafting rules and searching for a central computer system to link all the machines.
 Mr. Madigan took care of many of his allies, a reminder of the political Augean stables that is state government. For example, Joseph Berrios, who is running for Cook County assessor, is chairman of the Cook County Democratic Party and a lobbyist for both the Illinois Coin Machine Operators Association and Illinois Licensed Beverage Association. Mr. Berrios is also a member of the Cook County Board of Review, crucial to the lucrative commercial real estate tax appeals practice of Mr. Madigan's law firm. As the political commentator Michael Kinsley said of Washington, the real scandals are what is legal.
 This might make you wonder, too: Aaron Jaffe, a retired judge who is chairman of the gaming board, says he wasn't consulted about the bill. It's ''filled with loopholes,'' Mr. Jaffe said, and he is ''very apprehensive about organized crime, especially with our limited staff'' and the history of some local police officials looking the other way with illegal video gambling. ''We'll try our darndest,'' he said, ''but, in all probability, it will be impossible to keep the mob out.''
 One need not be a finger-wagging bluenose to be doubtful about video gambling. In joining six other states that allow it, Illinois is encouraging an industry that preys mainly on the poor, inspires addictive behavior and crime, lures the same bad guys who make money off illegal machines and perhaps does not even generate the anticipated revenue, especially with gaming down nationwide and with 50 cities and towns around the state already putting in bans. The Cook County Board of Commissioners voted against the machines, but that just affects unincorporated areas outside Chicago.
 Interestingly, the city already bans video gambling, and it would have to lift the prohibition if it wanted the machines. What will Mayor Richard M. Daley do? His tenure has brought a precipitous drop in bars, which he, and many neighborhoods, have often viewed as linked to drugs and violence. So while Mr. Daley has been an enabler for antitavern forces, economic necessity may prompt him to shift his position on gambling, with jobs-hungry organized labor cheering him on.
 Governor Quinn does deserve modest kudos for insisting on the ''opt-out'' provision, allowing governments to say no. He thus gives them the right not to have citizens downing three shots and four Old Styles and wasting rent money on video poker. But he also deserves reminders of his Blago-era insistence that any gambling expansion be subject to a statewide referendum.
 As for ''American Buffalo,'' Steppenwolf's artistic director, Martha Lavey, says the three sleazy protagonists ''feel they have an opportunity to make big dough by stealing a coin collection and that it will make them lots of money and kick them into a different league.'' 
 ''But,'' Ms. Lavey continues, ''they're in the social basement and will never get out by chasing small-time heists.''
 In the end, the moral standing of Mr. Quinn, Mr. Madigan and the legislature resembles that of the play's Donny, Bobby and Teach, who ruin their friendship in illusory pursuit of filthy lucre.

HEADLINE: Home Health Care Costs

 BODY:
To the Editor:
 Re ''Finding the Nerve to Cut Costs,'' by David Leonhardt (Economic Scene column, Business Day, Dec. 9):
 Home health care has received much attention lately as part of the national health reform debate -- and rightly so. These services are a vital component of the health system, caring for the elderly, people with disabilities and the chronically ill, and helping patients avoid higher cost service use, like acute-care emergency room visits, lengthier inpatient stays or premature nursing home admission. 
 Unfortunately, and ironically, even though home care is a proven cost-saver, federal health reform measures would cut disproportionately from in-home services. At approximately 4 percent of overall Medicare spending, home care is slated for cuts as high as 10 percent under the House and Senate plans. 
 Mr. Leonhardt claims that home care profits warrant such enormous cuts. Not so in states like New York, where a recent analysis of independently certified financial statements found that an alarming two-thirds of home care agencies are now operating in the red. For the last seven years in a row, these agencies have been losing money treating Medicare beneficiaries because Medicare has underreimbursed home care services. 
 In many respects, home care is a victim of its own success, self-innovation and responsiveness to health delivery trends. The level and types of services delivered in the home today are increasingly complex. Providers have also witnessed a significantly greater number of patients with intensive health needs; more home care patients today are aged 85 or older, require skilled services, suffer from chronic conditions and exhibit cognitive deficits. 
 These trends, while having increased our reliance on home care, have also shortened hospital lengths of stay, averted acute-care E.R. visits and allowed people to remain in their own homes -- all at a significant savings to health care, and to the benefit of patient health and well-being.

HEADLINE: A Break at the Gas Pump

BYLINE: By CLIFFORD KRAUSS and JAD MOUAWAD; Clifford Krauss reported from Houston, and Jad Mouawad from New York.

DATELINE: HOUSTON 

 BODY:
This holiday season, consumers can expect a gift that should ease their burdens a bit: modestly lower gasoline prices.
 Retail gas prices have been slipping gradually for weeks, thanks to the recent fall in oil prices. Some experts think the national average price for a gallon of gas -- now $2.59 -- could fall another nickel by Christmas.
 ''It couldn't be more timely; it's welcome news,'' said Brian Bethune, chief United States financial economist for IHS Global Insight, who predicts that gas prices will drop to $2.50 a gallon by early next year. ''The recent drop in gasoline prices has clearly contributed to an overall improvement in consumer confidence and right now that looks like it could build over the month.'' 
 Economists note that a drop of a few cents a gallon will not make a big difference in the buying power of consumers, who on average spend about 3 percent of their disposable income on gasoline. But gasoline prices pack a psychological punch, in part because gas is the one consumer good whose price is advertised on street corners all over the country. 
 The recent decline in oil and gasoline prices comes less than two months after a price spike. In late October, crude oil prices rose above $80 a barrel and the national price of a gallon of regular gasoline soared by nearly 12 cents in a single week. Since October, oil prices dropped to about $70, then rose a bit in recent days to just under $73. 
 Gasoline prices still have not caught up with the initial decline, and they continue to slide, by about 4 cents a gallon in the last week.
 Tom Kloza, chief oil analyst at the Oil Price Information Service, said the decline would most likely continue, despite the modest jump in oil prices in recent days. ''I still think retail prices will fall by 5 to 10 cents by the end of the year,'' he said. Noting that gasoline demand traditionally drops in January, he added, ''Over the next 45 days, customers will get relief.''
 Maribel Alvarez, a 42-year-old Houston homemaker, said the lower gasoline prices were ''making a real difference'' for her this holiday season. As she left a department store in the Galleria mall this week with a shopping bag full of sweaters, she added, ''I can drive from place to place looking for bargains and it costs me less. Before, I was just shopping around my house.'' 
 Oil analysts say the lower prices reflect the weak fundamentals of the world oil markets. 
 The demand for petroleum products dropped sharply this year as American and European consumers and businesses used less fuel because of the economic slowdown. Meanwhile, fuel inventories swelled, filling up storage facilities around the United States and forcing some oil companies to charter oil tankers for storage. 
 Oil demand typically rises in the winter, because of the higher demand for heating fuels. This year, however, the decline has been marked. 
 Over the last four weeks the nation's oil consumption fell to 18.77 million barrels a day, nearly a million barrels fewer than over the same period last year and more than two million fewer than during the equivalent period in 2007, according to the Energy Department.
 Gasoline consumption has rebounded from its lows reached during last year's crisis, in December 2008, but it is still down by about 3 percent from two years ago.
 The expectation of lower gasoline prices should be welcome news for retailers as they market holiday goods to consumers.
 ''If gasoline prices continue to go down from here, even modestly, it can only be a positive,'' said Michael P. Niemira, chief economist for the International Council of Shopping Centers. But Mr. Niemira cautioned that gasoline prices were ''not on people's minds like they were when gasoline prices were much higher.''
 He also noted that gas was about a dollar a gallon higher than this time last year, when the shock of the financial crisis sent oil and gasoline prices tumbling.
 Projections by analysts of where oil and gasoline prices are going beyond the next few months range widely, which is not surprising since prices have been a roller-coaster ride in recent years.
 Gasoline prices started the year at about $1.70 a gallon but climbed back to nearly $2.70 by June. Since then, national average prices have remained between $2.50 and $2.67.
 According to a recent investment report from Commerzbank, a German bank, oil is poised to test a lower trading level around $65 a barrel. If that comes to pass, gasoline prices would probably fall further.
 But JPMorgan Chase expects oil prices to turn around by the end of the first quarter next year. Over a longer period, that firm's analysts see oil rising to $120 a barrel by 2013. 
 The rise and fall of fuel prices can have at least a short-term impact on economic activity. Larry Goldstein, a director of the Energy Policy Research Foundation, estimates that total economic output drops a half percent for every $10 increase in the price of a barrel of crude oil. 
 And Mr. Bethune of IHS Global Insight notes that since American consumers spend around $333 billion a year on gasoline for personal consumption, a 4 percent decline can mean about $13 billion in annual savings.

HEADLINE: At Climate Talks, Trade Pressures Mount

BYLINE: ; Andrew C. Revkin contributed reporting from Copenhagen.

 BODY:
COPENHAGEN - Could a legacy of the Copenhagen climate conference turn out to be higher tariffs?
 With little prospect of an agreement at the talks this week bringing immediate and binding emissions limits on the developing world, pressures are mounting in Europe and the United States to impose restrictions, called border adjustments, on imports from low-cost producers like China and India that are resisting cutting greenhouse gases.
 ''The shadow of border adjustments hangs over these talks,'' said David G. Victor, a professor of international relations and an expert in environmental issues at the University of California at San Diego. ''Unions and heavy industry are deeply worried about climate policies that could make them less competitive, especially with the Chinese, and nothing in Copenhagen will change that fact.'' 
 The prospect that climate policy could become entangled in trade issues has been looming for years.
 The United States refused to ratify the Kyoto Protocol on the grounds that it gives manufacturers in nations like China and India an unfair advantage because they do not face restrictions on their emissions under that treaty.
 More recently, organized labor in the United States has demanded keeping border adjustments as part of their support for the Obama administration on passing climate legislation, leading some commentators to warn that plans to cap and trade greenhouse gases will trigger what they have described as a ''green trade war.''
 In Copenhagen, the simmering battle over trade warmed up late last week, with the United States pushing for the right to impose border adjustments in a version of a draft deal, while powerful emerging economies are seeking to outlaw the practice in a competing version of a deal.
 ''We are totally against it -- totally against it,'' said Jairam Ramesh, the chief negotiator for India, speaking about border adjustments Monday.
 A trade war ''is what we are doing our best to try to avoid,'' he said. Border adjustments are essentially import fees levied by carbon-taxing countries on goods manufactured in non-carbon-taxing countries.
 With the issue threatening agreement between the most important emitters at the conference, Connie Hedegaard, the Danish minister who is overseeing the proceedings, asked negotiators from Norway and Singapore to study the issue early this week.
 Trade experts said Ms. Hedegaard's selection reflected the role those two nations had played in resolving issues at the World Trade Organization in the past.
 In more negotiations on border adjustments Tuesday afternoon, Australia, the United States and the European Union firmly resisted calls by developing countries to renounce any use of such tariffs as part of their climate control plans, according to a diplomat at the meeting.
 Even so, in a concession to the developing countries, Australia, the United States and China reaffirmed a principle from previous climate agreements not to hide protectionism behind climate objectives, said the diplomat, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because of the sensitivity of the talks.>> In a sign of the sensitivities around the issue of border adjustments, a draft agreement circulating Tuesday afternoon said ''provisions on trade measures'' were still ''to be elaborated.''
 The provisions would aim to protect cement, steel and products made by other industries that expect to face higher costs under emissions caps in advanced economies like the E.U. and the United States.
 According to many trade law experts, the measures could -- depending on how they are drafted and imposed -- be compatible with W.T.O. rules that allow states to take measures to protect the environment.
 But importers and multinational corporations are skeptical they would be legal in practice. They also warn that there could be a backlash from key trading partners like China and India that could, in the end, trigger tit-for-tat actions that would hurt exporters and, ultimately, harm consumers. Mr. Ramesh, the Indian negotiator, promised Monday that his nation would appeal the imposition of any border adjustments by the United States or the E.U. at the W.T.O.
 And on Tuesday, Yu Quingtai, the Chinese special representative on climate change, warned that his country would ''always oppose the actions by any countries to make use of protection of the environment or climate as a pretext to conduct trade protectionism.''
 Pascal Lamy, the director general of the W.T.O., has been pushing for months for governments to hammer out their own rules on border adjustments -- and minimizing the prospect he will have to intervene in an issue that already is creating fissures in one area of regulation.
 Keith Rockwell, a spokesman for the W.T.O., said Tuesday, ''It's very important that governments reach a decision on these measures multilaterally at Copenhagen as any individual action taken may ruffle feathers.''
 Issues that would be particularly thorny for the W.T.O. to resolve include measuring the amount of greenhouse gases involved in the manufacture of some goods, like cars and electronics, that use complex supply chains, and deciding which country should be responsible for those emissions.
 Border taxes could mean years of litigation because of ''immense complexities over how CO2 emissions are actually measured and whether these will be accurate,'' said Michel Taly, a partner at Arsene Taxand, a tax advisory firm in Paris and an expert in the issue of border adjustments.
 Despite threats that border adjustments pose to the global trading system, the provisions continue to fit well with domestic politics in the United States and European countries like France and Italy, particularly at a time when major economies are still reeling from the worst downturn in decades.
 In the United States, a House bill allows for the imposition of tariffs on goods from countries that do not constrain their carbon output.
 In the E.U., President Nicolas Sarkozy of France has led calls in favor of imposing a carbon tax at the bloc's border to protect industries and jobs.
 Mr. Sarkozy has underlined that he and Chancellor Angela Merkel of Germany are proceeding with plans for a ''border adjustment tax'' on imports from countries without targets and trading systems comparable to those in Europe.
 Even so, Mr. Victor warned that ''a danger was that once countries start applying border adjustments, they will use these policies to pander to parochial national interests.'' He said ''some kind of scheme to discipline border adjustments will be needed.'''

PERSON: Howard W. Johnson 

HEADLINE: Howard W. Johnson, President of M.I.T. During Vietnam War Protests, Dies at 88

BYLINE: By DENNIS HEVESI

 BODY:
Howard W. Johnson, who as president of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology brought a degree of calm and conciliation to the campus at the height of the Vietnam War protests, died Saturday at his home in Lexington, Mass. He was 88.
 He died after a long illness, his son Stephen said. 
 M.I.T., in Cambridge, Mass., became a focus of protest in the late 1960s because several of its laboratories were receiving millions of dollars for secret research under contracts with the Department of Defense. One laboratory worked on the development of long-range missile guidance systems. 
 In the winter of 1969-70, militant groups including Students for a Democratic Society and the Black Panthers staged a series of demonstrations on the campus, at one point occupying Mr. Johnson's office and leaving it in shambles. In November 1969, police officers dispersed approximately 350 demonstrators who were blocking the entrance to one of the laboratories; the protesters offered little resistance. 
 ''He guided M.I.T. through its most turbulent chapter,'' the university's current president, Susan Hockfield, said of Mr. Johnson in a written statement. 
 An expert in personnel and management relations, Mr. Johnson brought his mediation skills and a sense of humor to that tense time. He chuckled at the nickname by which students referred to him, HoJo, and its obvious reference to the restaurant chain known for its 28 flavors of ice cream. 
 But as Time magazine wrote in November 1969, ''Johnson's success was above all a triumph of face-to-face communication.''
 ''When he learned that militants were planning disruptions, he immediately began canvassing students and faculty -- in dormitories, at informal 'rap' sessions and on the street,'' the Time article continued. ''Patiently explaining his position, he gathered support for a plan that will gradually shift a large portion of M.I.T.'s research from military to social needs.''
 Acknowledging that the protests had some validity, Mr. Johnson instituted programs directed at urban problems like transportation, housing and community development. And in May 1970, M.I.T. divested itself of the Charles Stark Draper Laboratory, where guidance systems for the Poseidon missile and the Apollo spacecraft were being developed. It did, however, retain its other military research facility, the Lincoln Laboratory in Lexington, Mass.
 ''This institute must constantly try to relate technology to man's purposes,'' Mr. Johnson said at the time, ''and that means basic research for defense as well as a larger concern for other human needs.''
 Howard Wesley Johnson was born in Chicago on July 2, 1922, one of four children of Albert and Laura Hansen Johnson. His father was an accountant for a steel company.
 Mr. Johnson graduated from Central College in Chicago in 1943 with a degree in business. After serving in the Army in Europe during World War II, he received a master's degree in economics from the University of Chicago. He taught there from 1948 to 1955, then joined the M.I.T. faculty as an associate professor of management. In 1959 he became dean of the Sloan School of Management at M.I.T., and in 1966 he was appointed the university's 12th president. He was president until 1971, when he became chairman of the M.I.T. Corporation. 
 Besides his son Stephen, Mr. Johnson is survived by his wife of 59 years, the former Elizabeth Weed; another son, Bruce; his daughter, Laura Johnson; his brother, Richard; his sister, Evelyn Harvey; and three grandchildren.
 In his memoir, ''Holding the Center: Memoirs of a Life in Higher Education'' (1999), Mr. Johnson wrote of the tumult at M.I.T.
 ''Students have told me, and I agree with them, that they found the institute to be academically vibrant during that time despite the uproar,'' he wrote. ''Much that was positive emerged from the upheaval.''

HEADLINE: OBAMA HAS GOAL TO WREST A DEAL IN CLIMATE TALKS

BYLINE: By JOHN M. BRODER and ELISABETH ROSENTHAL; Andrew C. Revkin contributed reporting from Copenhagen.

DATELINE: COPENHAGEN 

 BODY:
President Obama arrives here on Friday morning bent on applying a combination of muscle and personal charm to secure a climate change agreement involving nearly 200 countries.
 He injects himself into a multilayered negotiation that has been far more chaotic and contentious than anticipated -- frozen by longstanding divisions between rich and poor nations and a legacy of mistrust of the United States, which has long refused to accept any binding limits on its greenhouse gas emissions.
 The world is looking to Mr. Obama to wrest some credible success from this process. And on Thursday, with almost 120 heads of state and government in attendance, there were some signs that a meaningful political deal might be at hand, including a slight shift in China's position and a pledge by the United States to help the poorest nations cope financially with global warming.
 But top negotiators here said that the talks could also prove a humiliating failure, because China and the United States, the world's two largest emitters, remain deeply divided over a number of difficult problems. 
 Mr. Obama is putting a measure of his and the nation's prestige on the line by entering a debate with so much still unresolved. It was only 11 weeks ago that he left this same city empty-handed after pleading for Chicago to be selected as the site of the 2016 Olympics. 
 But the maneuvering and brinksmanship that have characterized the final week of the talks are also a sign of their seriousness; never before have global leaders come so close to a meaningful agreement to reduce the greenhouse gases linked to warming the planet.
 The administration provided the talks with a palpable boost on Thursday when Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton declared that the United States would contribute its share of $100 billion a year in long-term financing to help poor nations adapt to climate change.
 The administration had remained silent for months as other major economic powers came forward with similar or even more generous financial proposals.
 A senior Obama administration official said the announcement was carefully timed to resuscitate the talks before Mr. Obama's arrival. 
 ''It's a negotiation,'' he explained.
 But Mrs. Clinton's offer came with two significant conditions. First, the 192 nations involved in the talks here must reach a comprehensive political agreement that takes effect immediately. Second, and more critically, all nations must agree to some form of verification -- she repeatedly used the term ''transparency'' -- to ensure they are meeting their environmental promises. 
 China, the world's largest producer of greenhouse gases, has brought the talks to a virtual standstill all week over this issue, which its leaders claim to be an affront to national sovereignty.
 But the Chinese balkiness on the issue is matched in large measure by Mr. Obama's own constraints. The Senate has not yet acted on a climate bill that the president needs to make good on his promises of emissions reductions and on the financial support that he has now promised the rest of the world.
 ''The president and his team have been doing everything possible to create a deal that is fair to the U.S. and facilitates international agreement,'' said Paul Bledsoe of the National Commission on Energy Policy, a bipartisan advisory group. ''But if the Chinese will not accept monitoring of emissions, then a deal is not worth doing.''
 China appeared to crack the door a bit toward a system of reporting its emissions and its actions to reduce them on Thursday. He Yafei, the vice foreign minister, repeated China's opposition to any intrusive international monitoring regime in a news conference on Thursday. But he said his country would consider voluntary ''international exchanges'' of information on its climate programs.
 Administration officials here were not ready to publicly declare any breakthroughs in their talks with China and other nations on verification measures.
 ''We're making progress on all the outstanding issues with the Chinese,'' a senior administration official said in a conference call with reporters. ''But it's still a very challenging task. It's impossible to anticipate where this will end.''
 Detailed talks were still continuing Thursday afternoon among at least 16 different subgroups on a range of issues, including finance for developing countries and mechanisms to preserve forests -- even on whether to keep the Kyoto Protocol or commit to rolling that treaty into a new agreement.
 A contingent of Democratic leaders in Congress flew in Thursday to highlight support for the administration's position at the summit meeting. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and a number of House committee chairmen declared that the climate change bill they passed in June would provide a large share of the money needed to redeem the administration's promises. They met privately with a number of delegations to urge them to encourage China and a number of other nations in the so-called Group of 77 developing countries to drop their objections to the proposed agreement.
 ''I believe the leaders appreciate the magnitude of the challenge they're facing and will come to an agreement by the end of the week,'' said Representative Edward J. Markey, Democrat of Massachusetts. ''And the $100 billion really does help with the concerns of the G-77. And now we're left with China.''
 Republicans mounted a counteroffensive. Senator James M. Inhofe, Republican of Oklahoma and Congress's most vocal climate change skeptic, showed up in the press area of the Bella Center early on Thursday to deliver what he called a reality check to the proceedings here. 
 ''There is going to be no cap and trade or binding legislation in the United States,'' he said. ''It's dead. It's not going to happen.''
 Somewhat more substantively, in Washington, a group of House Republicans said they planned to introduce a resolution formally disapproving of the Environmental Protection Agency's finding that greenhouse gases endangered public health and safety, a step that could lead to economy-wide regulation of such emissions.
 The Republicans said the finding would lead to job losses and take money out of the pockets of consumers ''so that radical environmentalists can wage a war against nature.''
 The resolution, if it passes, will not have the force of law. 
 The $100 billion figure proposed by Mrs. Clinton is similar to estimates by the European Union of the needed contributions, although the amount is below the $150 billion or so that experts at the European Union have pushed for.
 Mrs. Clinton said the money would be a mix of public and private funds, including ''alternative sources of finance,'' but declined to explain what that might mean. Nor did she say what the American share of the fund would be, although typically in such multilateral financial efforts the United States contributes about 20 percent. She said the money should contain billions of dollars to slow deforestation, which contributes to concentrations of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere.
 Some delegates and observers said that Mrs. Clinton's announcement might weaken the solidarity of the G-77 developing countries with China.
 Apparently attempting to appeal to these divisions, the United States Congressional delegation immediately went into a meeting with Indian officials, focusing on verification of emissions reductions programs, Ms. Pelosi said.
 Prime Minister Wen Jiabao, meanwhile, appeared focused on consolidating China's G-77 ties, meeting with representatives of Brazil, Bangladesh, Trinidad, Ethiopia and Sudan since his arrival on Wednesday night.
 The head of Brazil's delegation, Dilma Rousseff, said her country, too, objected to ''intrusive verification,'' and felt strongly that the Kyoto track should be maintained, for now anyway. 
 ''No one is going to give up a bird in the hand for a bird that hasn't been introduced to us yet,'' she said.
 Fander Falconi, Ecuador's foreign minister, was skeptical of the American financial offer.
 ''What we really need are firm mechanisms to reduce emissions from industrialized countries,'' he said. ''Financial mechanisms are useful, but not central, not a solution.''

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
As foreign investors once again try to buy American industrial assets, the Obama administration is grappling with how to protect national security while promoting economic recovery.
 In recent days, the administration has threatened to block the proposed takeover by the Chinese government of a tiny Nevada gold mining company, according to executives for the company, Firstgold. 
 Administration officials have also raised questions about a bid by a United Arab Emirates-controlled company to buy a large stake of Virgin Galactic, which is trying to build the world's first commercial carrier to take tourists into space. 
 The issues involved are serious enough that the companies involved in the Virgin Galactic deal have agreed to withdraw the application to provide more time for them to be addressed.
 ''Foreign investments in the U.S. are critical to economic growth and job creation here at home, but we have an obligation to prioritize national security,'' the deputy Treasury secretary, Neal S. Wolin, said in a statement released Thursday, in response to questions about the scrutiny of proposed deals.
 Foreign investments in certain American industries, particularly those with critical technologies or military or homeland security assets, are reviewed by a federal panel and sometimes sent for approval by the president. Those decisions can set off political firestorms. The Bush administration came under attack for allowing a Dubai company to buy control of a dozen American port terminals. The plan was eventually scuttled.
 After a lull in foreign investment during the global recession in the last year, applications before the panel, the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States, have increased in recent months. About 60 applications have been submitted for such transactions this year, compared with 155 in 2008, a former administration official said. The panel's decisions are not publicly released, though the companies can disclose them.
 The Obama administration has approved most of the requests, including the proposed purchase by a French government-controlled company of a minority stake in nuclear power plants owned by Constellation Energy, which is based in Baltimore.
 But the administration has alerted those involved in the Nevada gold mine deal that it will not approve the plan. 
 ''This is very difficult news to receive,'' Terry Lynch, chief executive of Firstgold, said Thursday.
 He and other backers of the deal say the administration risks sending the wrong message to foreign investors, particularly China, by balking at such transactions. In that case, China's giant Northwest Nonferrous International Investment Company wants to buy 51 percent of Firstgold, its first purchase of a mine operator in the United States.
 Washington officials, however, are increasingly concerned about Chinese dominance in the global precious metals marketplace. The Nevada mines are also close to military installations, including the Fallon Naval Air Station, complicating the deal, according to written summaries of meetings with Obama administration officials obtained by The New York Times.
 Under the proposed Firstgold transaction, Northwest Nonferrous would gain majority control of mining leases Firstgold has on 8,300 acres of mostly federal government property in Nevada, at four locations. The most important site is the so-called Relief Canyon in Lovelock, about 110 miles northeast of Reno.
 The federal review ''raised serious and significant and consequential national security risks'' associated with the proposed transaction at all four sites, pointing both to Fallon Naval Air Station and adjacent military facilities it did not name that most likely are classified, according to a summary prepared by lawyers for the mining companies.
 In questions it submitted to Firstgold, the administration also seemed to be concerned with what minerals other than gold a Chinese-controlled company might dig up at the Nevada sites or try to export.
 Only once since 1990 has a president formally blocked a foreign acquisition. Typically, applications are withdrawn once serious objections are raised.
 Firstgold and Northwest have until Monday to withdraw their application, or the recommendation of a denial will go to President Obama. ''This smacks of anti-Chinese protectionism at a time when we need to be encouraging foreign investment to create jobs and expand our economy,'' said Mark Nordlicht, managing partner at Platinum Management, one of the Firstgold investors. 
 Executives at Virgin Galactic, by comparison, say they remain confident they can clear up government concerns about the proposed sale of 32 percent of their venture to Aabar Investments of Abu Dhabi, which is controlled by the government there.
 Virgin Galactic, created by the British entrepreneur Richard Branson and Burt Rutan, an aerospace engineer, has proposed building a spaceport in New Mexico, where a new generation of spacecraft would carry tourists into space and commercial payloads into orbit.
 National security officials participating in the review have questioned whether sensitive rocket and missile launching and fabrication technology might be shared with foreign governments as a result of the transaction, according to executives involved in the deal who asked not to be identified because details of the transaction are confidential.
 The administration also sought to make sure that the deal would not violate an international agreement called the Missile Technology Control Regime that is intended to prevent the global spread of missile-based weapons delivery systems. 
 As a result, the companies involved have agreed to resubmit their application for government approval, restarting the 90-day clock the government has to accept or reject the proposal.
 ''Aabar and Virgin Galactic remain committed to the transaction,'' Jackie McQuillan, a Virgin Galactic spokeswoman, said in a statement. ''Both companies are working together to secure the necessary regulatory approvals, and expect to close the transaction as contemplated.''
 The review of these and other cases is also been complicated by the fact that at the Treasury and Commerce Departments, which both play a central role in the foreign investor review process, the two top political appointees who are supposed to oversee the effort are still awaiting Senate approval. They are Marisa Lago, nominated to serve as the assistant Treasury secretary for international markets, and Francisco J. Sanchez, Commerce under secretary for international trade.

HEADLINE: Scientist Is Crucial to the Bay Area's Role in Stem Cell Research

BYLINE: By SABIN RUSSELL

 BODY:
When Dr. Shinya Yamanaka arrived in the United States from Japan in 1993, he recalled recently, he was ''half a scientist, half a failed surgeon.'' A disaffected doctor with a newly minted Ph.D. in pharmacology, he had but one job offer, from the Gladstone Institutes, wedged into crowded laboratories by San Francisco General Hospital.
 There, he began transforming mice, cloning genetically engineered rodents in a quest to understand the molecular biology of cholesterol. Those experiments, like many scientific endeavors, failed to pan out. But the discoveries he did make, and his expertise in working with mice, fired his passion for the emerging field of stem cell science.
Today, at 47, Dr. Yamanaka is a leading member of the 21st-century fraternity of stem cell alchemists. Three years ago, he showed he could transform ordinary cells from skin into stem cells, those rare packets of microscopic life that can convert into almost any tissue in the body. His discovery transformed the entire field. It has already changed the focus of research and is likely to steer billions of dollars in future research grants in a new directions. 
 ''He is the rock star of stem cell science,'' said Dr. Deepak Srivastava, the director of the Gladstone Institute of Cardiovascular Disease. ''Everybody now recognizes that he transformed the stem cell field, almost single-handedly.''
 Dr. Yamanaka's story is emblematic of the Bay Area's role in one of the most active, promising and potentially lucrative fields in medicine. His career was incubated here, before he returned to Japan. Now he commutes between Kyoto, where he also has a stem cell institute and is a professor at Kyoto University, and Gladstone's bright headquarters in Mission Bay, where he works one week a month. He is a one-man symbol of the area's economic and scientific links to Asia and its place at the intersection of science and venture capital. 
 Dr. Yamanaka's defining contribution to the field was to show that ordinary skin cells could be coaxed into behaving like embryonic stem cells -- living microscopic engines that can morph into virtually any cell or tissue, blood, bone, muscle or nerve. First he did it with mice. Then he repeated his reprogramming technique with human skin cells.
 Dr. Alan O. Trounson, the president of the California Institute for Regenerative Medicine, said in a recent interview that the reprogramming method was already a focus of 15 percent of his agency's grants. ''I think it is leading to magnificent new science,'' Dr. Trounson said. 
 The institute, which has its headquarters in San Francisco, will distribute $3 billion for stem cell research, as authorized by California voters in 2004. Of the $1 billion awarded so far, more than a third -- $358 million -- flows to Bay Area laboratories. These include those at the University of California, San Francisco, with which Gladstone is affiliated; Stanford University; Children's Hospital in Oakland; San Jose State University; and the Buck Institute in Novato. 
 Connections to the profit-making future are gradually being forged. Gladstone, with an initial push from Dr. Yamanaka, has been instrumental in the start of iPierian in South San Francisco. In 2007, Kleiner Perkins Caufield & Byers, a venture capital firm based in Menlo Park, led a group of investors who put $31.5 million into the company.
 Dr. Yamanaka, meanwhile, is racing with scientists around the world to build on his discoveries.
 Biologically powerful and politically explosive, embryonic stem cells have the potential to rejuvenate severed spinal nerves, cure diabetes, regenerate damaged hearts and replenish missing chemicals in ailing brains. But because they are derived from human embryos, the research outrages opponents of abortion. 
 Dr. Yamanaka's work points a way out of that dilemma. ''It vaporizes the political and ethical baggage of working with stem cells,'' said Dr. Kevin Kit Parker, of the Wyss Institute at Harvard. ''That's a very big deal.''
 Dr. Yamanaka's insight was to find a way to reprogram these ordinary cells by sprinkling them with genes that act like switches. He confounded skeptics when he proved it could be done with a cocktail of just four genes.
 ''Reprogramming is an incredibly important find,'' said Dr. James Thomson, the University of Wisconsin researcher who first cultured a line of stem cells from human embryos in 1998. 
 Dr. Thomson's own team was working on a similar technique using human skin cells, but Dr. Yamanaka refined his method using mice, which took less time. Both scientists independently announced success with human cells in papers published simultaneously in November 2007. 
 ''It's like a tie, but it is not,'' Dr. Thomson said. ''His mouse paper really changed people's perception of what was possible.''
 While treating diseases with these stem cells is still many years away, Dr. Yamanaka's techniques are on a fast track for use as laboratory tools. They can be used to test experimental drugs for toxicities -- a prospect that could save lives and save drug makers from investing millions in products destined for failure. 
 Alternatively, organ tissue created by induced pluripotent stem cells, or iPS cells, in a lab dish may also be used to model human diseases like cancer. These tissues can be exposed to a vast library of chemical compounds to test them as potential drugs.
 In September, Dr. Yamanaka was named a 2009 recipient of the Lasker Award, one of medicine's highest international honors. Winning the Lasker places him among an elite group of scientists, 79 of whom have gone on to win a Nobel Prize. 
 Interviewed in his Gladstone office, Dr. Yamanaka said that he was discomforted by the use of embryonic stem cells but that his own research would have been impossible without it. As for the cells with which he now works, iPS cells, many hurdles remain before they are truly as versatile as the embryonic stem cells they mimic. ''Embryonic stem cells are not safe,'' he said. ''But at the moment, iPS cells are more dangerous.'' 
 For instance, many skin cells only partly complete the transition to stem cells, and there are no reliable markers yet to flag those that are incomplete. Embryonic stem cells also tend to form benign tumors made of a mix of muscle, bone and other cell types. For unknown reasons, Dr. Yamanaka's stem cells are more prone to produce them. One of the trigger genes can cause cancer, and the viruses that ferry the transforming genes into a target skin cell may not deliver them where they are needed.
 Dr. Yamanaka is nevertheless confident that researchers in his laboratory, and elsewhere, will solve these problems in just a few years. Harvard researchers have already cloned a mouse using just one of the genes -- a noncancerous one -- in a culture of nerve cells.
 With a technology this powerful, the stakes are high, and patent litigation often lurks. Rival teams have submitted patent claims. So far, only Dr. Yamanaka has been awarded one in Japan. 
 ''I really hope we will not have battles over intellectual property that will slow down everything,'' he said. 
 Efforts are under way to cure diseases using Dr. Yamanaka's technique. At Stanford, a team led by Dr. Alfred Lane won a $11.7 million grant from the California Institute for Regenerative Medicine to use iPS cells to treat epidermolysis bullosa, an inherited condition that causes skin to form blisters and slough off with the slightest trauma.
 ''The disease is just horrible,'' said Dr. Anthony E. Oro, a co-leader of the project, which hopes to bring a treatment to human clinical trials in four years. ''It is a lifetime of blisters. The children live like burn patients, wrapped up like mummies.''
 For Dr. Yamanaka, returning to Gladstone was, in some measure, an act of appreciation for its early support. His three years there had left a profound mark. 
 ''I flew to Tokyo,'' Dr. Srivastava said. ''He took a train from Kyoto. We met at a sushi bar at the hotel. After 10 minutes, we shook hands.''

Fourteen of them are gold. 
        
As stock markets plunged and credit markets around the globe seized up, Treasury Secretary _________ and the chairman of the Federal Reserve, _________, came up with a proposal for a sweeping_________ of the nation's financial institutions. They acted after a series of ad-hoc bailouts and government-brokered sale of investment banks like Bear Stearns and Merril Lynch and of giant lenders like Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac earlier that year had failed to stem growing fears on Wall Street. Those fears had turned to near-panic after the failure of _________ and the government rescue of the American International Group within days of each other. Mr. Paulson's proposal, labeled the _________, was backed by President George W. Bush, both presidential candidates and the Democratic leadership in Congress, but opposed by most Republicans.

That may be the best explanation for the growing popularity of the _________ , the new video game system that has players jumping, punching and swinging, giving them an aerobic workout right in front of their television sets. 
        
Down to the last hours of his doomed bid for the White House, _________ repeated to himself a familiar admonition. It was the same mantra he had called upon to steel himself for moments of conflict as a collegiate boxer at the Naval Academy, a prisoner of war bracing for interrogation, a legislator twisting arms for votes or a candidate exhorting crowds in the final rallies of his failed Republican presidential primary campaign eight years ago. 
        
_________ has become perhaps the most complicated issue facing world leaders. On the one hand, warnings from the scientific community are becoming louder, as an increasing body of science points to rising dangers from the ongoing buildup of human-related _________ - produced mainly by the burning of fossil fuels and forests.

President Bush signed into law antiterrorism measures that he said would ''help law enforcement to identify, to dismantle, to disrupt and to punish terrorists before they strike.'' In a White House ceremony, Mr. Bush praised several provisions of the bill, including its efforts to attack money-laundering and to allow information sharing between law enforcement and intelligence authorities. He also cited new powers for roving wiretaps across the country and for the surveillance of computers and electronic mail. [This law is known as the _________.]
        
Capt. _________ is the US Airways pilot who landed an Airbus A320 in the Hudson River when the plane lost power after taking off from LaGuardia Airport, possibly because of a collision with a flock of birds. [He] was hailed for his quick thinking and piloting skills that led to a smooth landing on the water, and for taking charge of an evacuation that ended with all 155 people on board brought to safety. 
        
_________ had been selected to give the keynote speech at the Democratic convention and he managed to set the place on fire with his youthful energy and lilting rhetoric...by the time he was sworn into the U.S. Senate, he was already a megawatt celebrity. [He] was sworn in as the _________th president of the United States on Jan. 20, 2009.

_________, by some measurements the most popular social network with more than 200 million active users worldwide, is one of the fastest-growing and best-known sites on the Internet today. The company, founded by a Harvard sophomore, Mark Zuckerberg, began life catering first to Harvard students and then to all high school and college students. 
        
_________ had a tumultuous tenure as President Bush's first-term secretary of state, when he was frequently undercut by Vice President _________ and _________, the secretary of defense, in the period before the Iraq war. Although [this person] had major misgivings about the war and what he considered the inadequate number of troops, he not only agreed to the invasion but also made the administration's case for war in a presentation to the _________. Much of what he said is now known to be based on false information provided by the Central Intelligence Agency. 
        
In an extraordinary sweep of the 76th Academy Awards, _________, the last in a trilogy based on the epic fantasy by J. R. R. Tolkien, won all 11 Oscars for which it was nominated, including best picture.

HEADLINE: Few Laughs Left in a Catskill Town Struggling to Revive

BYLINE: By JENNIFER MASCIA

DATELINE: MONTICELLO, N.Y. 

 BODY:
In the film ''Dirty Dancing,'' set in 1963, Max Kellerman, the proprietor of a fictional Catskill resort, laments that the golden era of borscht belt resorts is over. 
 ''You think kids want to come with their parents and take fox-trot lessons?'' he gripes. ''Trips to Europe, that's what the kids want.''
 It was a prescient utterance. Of course, the film -- released decades after the Catskill summer resort culture began its decline -- benefited from hindsight. But as the strain of recession continues into its second winter, how is the economy of the Route 17 corridor faring? 
 ''We have an economy?'' asked Scott Garvin, a security supervisor at the Monticello Gaming and Raceway. Once the area's main attraction -- a horse race could draw 12,000 spectators in the 1980s -- the raceway has suffered as business has been siphoned off by competitors in Tioga County and Pennsylvania. On a recent Sunday evening, a football game on a large-screen plasma television played to a handful of onlookers while the slot machines were largely the territory of the elderly and the half-asleep.
 ''Ever since the hotels closed down, the entire economy has been in the toilet,'' Mr. Garvin said, surveying the scene. 
 Nubia Quintero-Edwards, 39, a caseworker at Catholic Charities of the Archdiocese of New York, in Sullivan County, estimates that 80 percent of her caseload now includes recipients of unemployment benefits, a noticeable increase since the summer. 
 ''They tell me, 'I have three kids, and I need oil,' '' she said. ''The economy is really not good here, and it's getting worse,'' a development that has kept her busy. 
 ''I'm tired,'' she said with a sigh. 
 It's a far cry from the area's auspicious beginnings. In the 19th century, Orange, Sullivan and Ulster Counties developed a robust farming economy, and farmers in search of extra income opened small boarding houses. Businessmen who passed through the area took notice of this nascent hospitality industry and purchased and expanded the rooming houses, giving birth to behemoths like Grossinger's in Liberty and the Concord in Kiamesha Lake. 
 These resorts, which boasted top-flight entertainment -- Woody Allen, Mel Brooks and Don Rickles were among the comedians who sharpened their wit on area stages -- attracted upper-middle-class Jewish New Yorkers, nearly a million of whom migrated north as soon as the humidity hit to mambo in the mountain air. 
 But starting in the 1960s, the lure of cheap air travel punctured the local economy, and the 50 or 60 resorts that dotted the mountainside dwindled precipitously. 
 ''There is no real influx of industry or jobs the young people can go to school for, so they leave the area,'' said Roger Edwards, 66, Ms. Quintero-Edwards's father-in-law and a lifelong resident of Neversink. 
 ''Those who want a good job have nothing to choose from,'' said Mr. Edwards, a former copier technician at Xerox, whose ancestors settled the area after the Revolutionary War. The best chances for employment, he added, lie in the sprawling prison system, government agencies, hospitals and schools, ''and there's nothing in between.''
 That brain drain takes a toll on teachers-in-waiting, too, like Laura Privitera. A server at a T.G.I. Friday's in Middletown, Ms. Privitera, 30, is biding her time until a teaching position materializes. 
 She is willing to relocate. Not long ago she applied for a public school teaching job in the ailing town of Liberty -- along with 627 others.
 ''Anyone who had their bachelor's was applying,'' she said. She wasn't hired. Her younger brother took a job in White Plains, and Ms. Privitera, who graduated from the State University of New York at New Paltz a year ago, doesn't yet know if she will do the same.
 ''I never thought I'd start the year without my own classroom,'' she said. 
 Assemblywoman Aileen M. Gunther, who represents Sullivan and Orange Counties, pointed to bright spots in the area: Bethel Woods Center for the Arts, at the site of the Woodstock Festival of 1969, and the Center for Discovery, an education complex for children with disabilities in Harris that employs 1,500. But she conceded that high property taxes and a dearth of federal stimulus money were taking a toll on her district. 
 ''What we really need is an injection of cash to create jobs,'' she said, adding that bailout money ''is not going to the right places, and not quick enough.'' The second-home market has picked up in the last couple of years, she said, but agriculture, particularly dairy farming, has shown the most promise.
 ''For every dollar we spend on agriculture, we get three back,'' she said. 
 But it is hard to see a silver lining in downtown Monticello. A trip down Broadway, the nearly deserted main strip, reveals the carcasses of a Cantonese restaurant, a real estate office, a Marine recruiting station. Drug use in town is rampant, and gang members stake out their territory.
 The developer Louis R. Cappelli has tried to revitalize the area's three biggest lures of old -- Kutsher's Country Club, Grossinger's and the Concord -- with varying degrees of success. But since a 2008 Interior Department ruling barred Mr. Cappelli and the St. Regis Mohawk tribe from opening a full-fledged casino at the Raceway, many have given up on the idea that the region could become a new Atlantic City.
 ''I don't know what's going to come first -- gambling or the messiah,'' cracked Tania Grossinger, a cousin of the hotel proprietor Jennie Grossinger and the author of ''Growing Up at Grossinger's.'' ''It's been so many years, and there's been so many promises, so many false hopes, and nothing has happened.''
 ''At this point, he needs to get his funding in place,'' Ms. Gunther said, referring to Mr. Cappelli. But she is hopeful.
 ''We're ready to start dancing the dirty dance again,'' she said.

HEADLINE: Lean Times, But No Rise In Adoptions

BYLINE: By SUSAN DOMINUS. 
E-mail: susan.dominus@nytimes.com

 BODY:
Just over a year ago, when the economy first took a nose dive, snatching the stability of countless families with it, the people who run Spence-Chapin Adoption Services, a New York-based adoption agency, prepared themselves for an influx of pregnant women seeking their help. 
 They were fully aware that finances were not the only reason women placed their children with adoptive families, but they knew that it was a big one, and so it seemed likely that widespread job losses might influence some women's thinking about their future. Had their own financing not been so tight, recalled Helene Lauffer, associate executive director at Spence-Chapin, she might even have fought to hire another person to handle the anticipated uptick. 
 But that uptick, so logical, so seemingly inevitable, never came to pass. ''We're somewhat surprised,'' she said. ''But the numbers haven't gone up.'' 
 If anything, Ms. Lauffer said, even fewer pregnant women have sought the agency's services this year. For domestic adoptions, the agency works with only as many adoptive families as it thinks it can help within a reasonable time frame, and she is finding that prospective parents have been forced to wait longer than usual just to begin the process.
 At Friends in Adoption, a Vermont-based agency that works mostly with would-be adoptive families from New York, various board members predicted that the economy would increase the availability of babies. Dawn Smith-Pliner, who founded the agency in 1982, told them they were wrong. She was right. The number of placements made by Friends in Adoption has been on the low end of average. 
 ''It's like the longest pregnancy ever,'' said Lynne Berman, a Friends client who lives in New Jersey and has been waiting for more than two years. ''You set these ultimatums. You think, 'This will be the last Mother's Day, or the last Thanksgiving.' But then another one rolls around.''
 Ms. Smith-Pliner said the slight reduction in adoptions was consistent with other recessions over the past 30 years. And to some degree, the trend seems consistent with the pairing of poverty, generally speaking, and high birth rates. The dampening of a certain kind of hope can drive a fervor for motherhood.
 ''I think if some of these pregnant women felt their lives could be improved upon by being able to get on their feet and do well by themselves,'' Ms. Smith-Pliner explained, ''and have the baby they placed be proud of what they'd been able to accomplish, then it's a different decision. It's a difficult decision, but something about it might feel good.
 ''But if the achievable goal, a half-decent job, isn't an option to work toward, then I might as well keep the baby -- that's tangible,'' she continued. ''You wake up every morning and there's that beautiful baby.'' 
 Although Ms. Lauffer did not rule out Ms. Smith-Pliner's theory, she imagined the possibility of broader factors at work. With every passing year, she pointed out, single motherhood grows more socially acceptable; the declining numbers at Spence-Chapin, she further allowed, could be a matter of a changing marketplace. 
 ''More and more people are connecting on the Internet, and, in some of those situations, people who are looking to adopt are offering to pay expenses for birth mothers in fuller ways than a nonprofit agency could do,'' she said. ''There may be an increase in women looking at those options in this economic time.'' 
 Spence-Chapin, Friends and Bethany Christian Services, an agency that places 600 to 700 children a year, all said that the number of parents seeking to adopt had held steady.
 ''Even though the economic difficulty is there, family takes on an incredible definition, more than before,'' said Cindi Fabozzi, director of Bethany Christian's office in Clifton Park, N.Y. ''I hear families talking about how they want more than the big-screen TV, how they want to invest in family.'' 
 Those who work in the industry ultimately shrug their shoulders at trying to understand the fluctuations in supply and demand of such a personal transaction. ''It's basically a mystery to most of us who work in adoption, and we're used to that,'' Ms. Lauffer said.
 And in a way, even that make sense: If the market apparently cannot be counted on to follow rational market dynamics, certainly families, the messiest, most emotionally driven, desperately desired units of human interaction, can't either.

HEADLINE: 'Avatar' Arrived, But Will It Deliver?

BYLINE: By BROOKS BARNES

DATELINE: LOS ANGELES 

 BODY:
For weeks this movie capital has crackled with speculation on a lone topic: Will James Cameron's ''Avatar,'' one of the biggest motion pictures -- in budget and scope -- ever made, soar or sputter at the box office?
 The first multiplex tea leaves for the movie arrived on Friday morning. In midnight screenings ''Avatar,'' a futuristic 3-D spectacle about love and war set on a distant moon, sold about $3.5 million in tickets at theaters in the United States and Canada, said 20th Century Fox, the studio behind the film. 
 That total is on a par with movies that are not built around pre-existing brands. But it falls short of expectations for such a buzzed-about picture, given its higher 3-D ticket prices, positive reviews and Mr. Cameron's resume.
 ''The midnights are not what some people dreamed they might be, but they are totally fine,'' said Paul Dergarabedian, president of the box office division of Hollywood.com, a tracking service. ''This is a long-term play.''
 Fox says it expects ''Avatar'' to gross between $50 million and $60 million for the weekend in North America, with more than 100 foreign countries easily bringing in $100 million more. The studio was concerned on Friday that a major snowstorm forecast this weekend for the East Coast could keep moviegoers at home.
 It is a frequent Hollywood practice, of course, to tamp down expectations by low-balling estimates. Film executives dread Monday headlines about softer-than-anticipated opening weekends, especially for Christmas movies, which historically hold up better than summer blockbusters in subsequent weekends.
 Industry expectations for ''Avatar'' are much higher. Rival studios say that audience-tracking surveys indicate that weekend ticket sales in North America will total about $80 million. The film is playing in 3,452 theaters, about 60 percent of which are charging an additional $3 to $5 for the 3-D presentation.
 ''I Am Legend,'' the post-apocalyptic Will Smith picture from 2007, holds the record for a December opening weekend with $77.2 million. It went on to sell $585.3 million in tickets at the global box office.
 How many tickets ''Avatar'' will sell is no small question for Fox and its financing partners, Dune Entertainment and Ingenious Film Partners. ''Avatar'' cost Fox around $310 million to produce -- although tax credits will shave about $30 million off that bill -- and an estimated $150 million to market. 
 To what degree word of mouth and positive reviews will push up the sales total is still unknown. A burst of upbeat chatter appeared on social-networking Web sites after the midnight shows. And critics have cheered the film with a voraciousness rarely seen for effects-driven extravaganzas; more than 90 percent of top critics have given ''Avatar'' positive marks, according to the review aggregation site Rottentomatoes.com.
 ''Avatar'' has presented Fox with many marketing headaches. Initial reaction to a conventional trailer was flat, and response to a 3-D Imax preview provoked doubts about whether the picture was really a cinematic game-changer. 
 To succeed ''Avatar'' needs to attract moviegoers of all ages. Advance ticket sales have been strong, particularly among older men, but younger audiences -- notably teenage girls -- appear more skeptical. Online ticket sellers like Fandango.com say advance interest in ''Avatar'' has been stronger than for some recent blockbusters, among them ''Star Trek'' and ''2012.'' But it is lagging behind the year's big sequels, including ''Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen.''
 Expectations are also high for ''Avatar'' because it is Mr. Cameron's first feature film since the Oscar-winning ''Titanic,'' which opened in 1997 and became one of the best-selling movies in history. 
 Fox can take comfort in knowing that for its opening weekend, ''Titanic'' brought in just $45 million, when adjusted for inflation, and it went on to make $1.8 billion at the worldwide box office.

HEADLINE: For Inauguration No. 3, Mayor Will Go Without a Fancy Gala

BYLINE: By DAVID W. CHEN

 BODY:
In 2002, Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg celebrated his inauguration by holding a traditional reception at the former Tweed Courthouse. Four years later, it was a splashier affair at a bank near City Hall, with thousands of doughnuts and cupcakes, all paid for by him, as well as a performance by Liza Minnelli. But this time, the billionaire mayor is having none of that. 
 Mr. Bloomberg has decided to scrap the traditional ceremony after his inaugural address on New Year's Day, according to city officials briefed on the plans. Instead, he plans to spend the day participating in public service projects across the city to help promote his N.Y.C. Service initiative. One of his projects, for instance, will be putting together care packages at Staten Island Borough Hall for local troops stationed abroad.
 The mayor's office declined to comment on his plans. But city officials close to the administration said that Mr. Bloomberg was cognizant that any kind of an inaugural gala would seem excessive or out of place during a time of economic anxiety, in a city struggling with double-digit unemployment and facing extensive cuts in subway service.
 Mr. Bloomberg, the wealthiest person in the city, just spent more than $100 million to win a third term by a margin that was smaller than had been anticipated. And part of the reason that margin was smaller, political analysts say, is that a sizable portion of New Yorkers felt that the mayor had not been responsive to their complaints about middle-class pocketbook issues, like higher taxes and parking fees.
 Mr. Bloomberg spent a total of more than $4 million on his first two inaugural celebrations, which featured comfort foods like mini-hamburgers, hot dogs, grilled cheese sandwiches, apple cider and beer.

HEADLINE: Museum in Los Angeles Adds 3 Board Members

BYLINE: Compiled by CAROL VOGEL

 BODY:
The Museum of Contemporary Art in Los Angeles has increased its financial muscle with the addition of three new board members: the Ukrainian billionaire Victor Pinchuk, right; the newsprint magnate Peter Brant and the financier Steven T. Mnuchin. This brings the total of new trustees added to the board to 10 this year. All of the trustees have agreed to give the institution a minimum of $75,000 annually with additional contributions their first year. The institution needs all the help it can get. Last year, having spent its reserves on operating expenses, it was on the brink of financial collapse before the Los Angeles financier Eli Broad pledged $30 million to the museum. Since then it has been slowly climbing its way back to solvency. And when it comes to the art world's elite, they seem to be loyal to each other's causes. Last week, for example, Mr. Pinchuk announced the formation of a new $100,000 international prize for artists under the age of 35, with Mr. Broad a board member.

HEADLINE: Jobless Rate Improved In Most States In November

BYLINE: By REUTERS

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
Unemployment rates eased in most states in November, although many continued to shed jobs, the Labor Department said Friday.
 Eight states registered increases in unemployment rates over the month, while 36 states and the District of Columbia reported decreases, and the rest were unchanged. 
 Still, over the year, jobless rates increased in all 50 states and the nation's capital.
 Michigan continued to have the highest unemployment rate in the country, although it edged down to 14.7 percent in November, from 15.1 percent in October. Michigan's jobless rate has been dropping since hitting a high of 15.3 percent in September.
 The number of jobs increased in 19 states and dropped in 31 states and the District of Columbia. The largest increase was in Texas, which gained 17,300 jobs, and the biggest drop was in Florida, which lost 16,700 jobs.
 According to the Florida labor department, the state has been losing jobs since August 2007, with health care the only growth sector for much of 2009. Most of Florida's job loss has been in construction, trades, transportation, utilities and professional services.
 Because unemployment affects states on two levels -- through dropping tax revenue and increased demands for assistance -- states measure recessions and recoveries by changes in their work forces.
 Michigan's unemployment rate is now at its lowest level since May. That is encouraging for a state that has suffered the worst unemployment during the recession that started in 2007, mostly because of the downturn in the automobile industry.
 ''The Michigan jobless rate remains high but has stabilized,'' said Rick Waclawek, director of information at Michigan's labor department. ''However, employment continues to trend downward, as payroll jobs have fallen in nine of the first 11 months of 2009.''
 The economic storms hitting workers nationally may be abating. A report earlier this month showed that the national unemployment rate eased to 10 percent, from 10.2 percent in October, and the country lost 11,000 jobs last month, many fewer than expected.

HEADLINE: A Lament for Saab, Quirky but Loved

BYLINE: By MICHELINE MAYNARD

 BODY:
The ignition was in the floor. It had a rear hatchback, not a trunk. The hood was hinged at the front, so it opened away from the windshield. And many of its owners -- including Jerry Seinfeld's character on his long-running sitcom -- were intensely loyal. 
 Auto enthusiasts across the country were dismayed by the news Friday that General Motors was planning to shut down Saab, the Swedish carmaker it bought two decades ago, after a deal to sell it fell apart. 
 Even with its modest and steadily declining sales, Saab long stood out as a powerful brand in spite of itself. 
 ''It wasn't designed to be a fashion statement,'' said Ron Pinelli, president of Autodata, which tracks industry statistics. ''It was designed to provide transportation under miserable weather conditions.''
 But in the process, Saab became a statement of its own. The American competition had floaty rides and Japanese cars were tight on space. By contrast, a Saab had taut steering, requiring drivers to actively guide the car as it powered through ice and snow. 
 Priced several thousand dollars above Japanese rivals, Saabs featured front-wheel drive and turbo-charged engines, and many were sold with manual transmissions. 
 Saab sales were always strongest in the Northeast, home for a time to the company's American headquarters in Connecticut. Many Saab owners consider the brand's glory days to be the 1980s, when Americans began buying cars again after a recession and energy crisis.
 Mr. Pinelli, who was selling Volvos at the time, said he admired his Swedish rival. ''The cars were communicative,'' he said. ''They didn't try to numb the experience like cars do today.''
 The cars had odd touches. Swedish engineers assumed drivers would be wearing gloves, so they designed big buttons for the dashboard, Mr. Pinelli said. Though the cars were compact, with long hoods and short rear ends, there was plenty of headroom inside. 
 ''They were quirky; they were strange,'' said Ray Wert III, editor in chief of Jalopnik.com, a Web site for auto enthusiasts. 
 American sales for Saab peaked at 48,250 in 1986, when it added the larger Saab 9000 to a lineup focused on its bread and butter car, the Saab 900. 
 Saab, as well as Volvo, gained a yuppie following, leading the Detroit car companies, which were eager to win over younger consumers, to buy them. 
 The Ford Motor Company acquired Volvo in 1999. G.M. bought half of Saab in 1990 and took management control after Saab's auto business was split from Scania, the Swedish maker of big trucks. G.M. took full ownership in 2000. 
 Rather than preserve its Swedish underpinnings, however, G.M. made Saab part of a strategy to share engineering with the rest of its operations. 
 It expanded the lineup, building Saabs from the same platforms as Opels, Chevrolets and Buicks, and it even enlisted Subaru of Japan to produce some cars.
 The strategy led to a sales revival of sorts from the late 1990s, when Mr. Seinfeld drove a black 1996 Saab 900 SE convertible on his show, until the middle of this decade, with sales helped by rebates and inexpensive lease deals. 
 The blanket approach ''seemed to make sense to General Motors,'' Mr. Wert said. ''Unfortunately, it killed what made Saab Saab.''
 Saab sales plummeted in 2008 when it became clear that G.M. was looking to cut Saab loose. Saab sold fewer than 22,000 cars in the United States last year and has managed sales of just 7,812 in all of 2009 -- fewer than Buick alone sold last month.
 Now Saab, a brand that once had one of the clearest identities in the industry, seems headed for extinction just as automakers are searching for more distinctive designs to help set them apart.
 ''It's a shame that Saab is a victim,'' Mr. Pinelli said.

HEADLINE: A Town's Hopes (and Doubts) Ride on a New Marina

BYLINE: By DAMIEN CAVE

DATELINE: PAHOKEE, Fla. 

 BODY:
When Palm Beach County announced a few months ago that unemployment in this small farm town had reached ''depression levels'' of more than 30 percent, residents were not surprised. Pahokee these days produces two things: college football prospects and nostalgia for a time when work was plentiful. 
 But just past the shuttered stores downtown, and over the 33-foot dike keeping Lake Okeechobee in check, sits both a dream of prosperity and a culture clash in the making. It may look like just a marina and a campground, but with construction nearly completed, the Lake Okeechobee Outpost has become a test of whether the exuberance of coastal Florida can find a home in the state's agricultural heart. 
 Hal Stankard is the outpost's general manager. In a town of muddy pickups, he drives a Toyota Prius, wears golf shirts the color of citrus and sees the marina as a stopover for the hundreds of boaters who use the lake to cross from one Florida coast to the other. 
 ''This is going to be the introduction of economic help for the whole area,'' Mr. Stankard said recently, staring at the marina from an empty building that will be a Tiki bar and upscale restaurant in a few months. ''Think about what it will be like if we can fill this place with 80, 90 boats, yachts even.''
 The main lobby looked ready, with its new oil paintings of cowboys and a flat-screen television tuned to Fox News. But there were only three small boats in the marina. At least one was owned by the police. 
 Mr. Stankard said more would come when the bar's taps started flowing and a dredging project near the lake's shore was finished, but many here seem unable to share his vision. 
 William Moe, 71, a longtime resident who was fishing at the marina with a rod that had no reel, said he doubted the project would do much good. 
 ''I think it's a crazy idea,'' he said. ''There ain't nothing in this town. You can't buy a pair of socks in this town. You ever been to a town where you can't buy a pair of socks?''
 Like many here, Mr. Moe, with his molasses drawl and deep wrinkles, seemed broken by the consequences of economic decline. He said his grandson had been shot and killed outside a convenience store about a month ago, part of an increase in crime that has generally tracked with the recession. 
 It was not always so rough, Mr. Moe and others said. For much of the 20th century, Pahokee -- derived from Pa-Hay-Okee, which means ''grassy water'' in Seminole -- had been one of the many towns in Central Florida that thrived because of its nutrient-rich, ink-dark soil known as muck. The town was labeled ''the winter vegetable capital of the world'' at one point, and as recently as a generation ago, most of Pahokee's roughly 6,000 residents seemed to have a job, at least during the harvest. 
 ''Everybody was working,'' said Henry Crawford, Pahokee's vice mayor, who has lived here most of his life, except for a tour in Vietnam. ''In the '60s and '70s, it was Christmas every day.''
 Agricultural mechanization changed all that. Sugar replaced vegetables, and machines replaced workers. In the 1990s, the last wave of Caribbean workers stopped showing up for the harvest, and the local economy collapsed. In 2000, the census showed, a third of Pahokee lived below the poverty line. 
 Standing outside a trailer that serves as City Hall, Mr. Crawford ticked off the closed businesses as if they were dead relatives: ''A Ford dealership, Chevrolet, restaurants -- a Burger King, a KFC -- filling stations,'' he said. ''We had everything.'' 
 City, county and state officials have pushed repeatedly for the town's revival, and the marina has become a cornerstone of that effort. Their ambitions are visible in the signs at the entrance that list public officials below proud declarations like ''American jobs, American values'' and ''higher-skill, higher-wage job opportunities in your community.'' 
 The signs, however, are from 2006. Three years later, plywood peeks out from behind the paint and Mr. Stankard has 11 employees -- nine from Pahokee, he said, and most in maintenance. 
 He said the company he works for, Seven Kings Holdings Inc., which owns 10 other marinas in Florida, had been trying to reach out. The outpost will host its second annual free Christmas dinner on Saturday night for around 700 needy residents. But whether such efforts -- along with the tax revenue from the marina and its cottages and campground -- will be enough to keep people happy is an open question. 
 From the start, residents in this mostly black town have expressed fears that the upgraded site (''like Disney but rustic,'' Mr. Stankard said) would be only for wealthier outsiders. When a group of residents were told to stop fishing near the edge of the marina a few months ago, it seemed to confirm some people's fears of being pushed aside. 
 But Diane Harvey, 53, one of the people asked to move along, said that it was because of work being done on the dike, and that some of her neighbors' fears were misguided. ''I can obey the rules,'' she said. ''It's for the betterment of the town.''
 Mr. Crawford said most people had come around to a similar view, once they learned that the marina was on public land, for use by all. Generally though, Pahokee residents seem resigned to having little choice but to compete for the same tourists and snowbirds as the rest of the state. 
 ''It'll be for the higher-up group, not the people in Pahokee,'' said Georgia Jones, 66, the owner of Poppa Jimmy's Catfish and More. ''But that's all we got to hope for -- pulling people in.''

HEADLINE: Economists See a Lift in 2010 Census

BYLINE: By MICHAEL LUO

 BODY:
Next year's census will not only count people, it will also put money in millions of pockets and potentially create a well-timed economic spark.
 Not in more than a half-century has the United States census been conducted amid such high rates of joblessness. The 1.2 million census-taking jobs may be temporary, but they pay well, and economists say they will provide a significant lift.
 The jobs will amount to a $2.3 billion injection into the economy at a critical juncture, a bridge between the moment when many economists believe the private sector will finally stop shedding jobs and when it ultimately begins to add them. 
 ''These are real jobs with good solid hourly pay,'' said Mark Zandi, chief economist for Moody's Economy.com. 
 Mr. Zandi added: ''It's a form of stimulus. It's like infrastructure spending, or W.P.A. in the Depression. It effectively does the same thing. It's not on the same scale, but it is large enough, and it will make a difference.''
 Recruiting is just beginning for the jobs. The Census Bureau began adding temporary offices across the country in the fall and has recently been holding open houses to encourage people to sign up for a half-hour test that is the first step to a job. It has also set up a Web site with information for job seekers. About 13,000 workers were hired this month. 
 The peak of the bureau's hiring, however, will be in late April and early May when about 800,000 people are expected to be on its payroll, most of them as field workers, knocking on doors to follow up with households that did not return census forms mailed in March. The positions vary in length and pay, but the average job is 20 hours a week for six weeks, paying $10 to $25 an hour.
 Rebecca Blank, the under secretary for economic affairs at the Department of Commerce, whose responsibilities include the Census Bureau, was cautious about the ultimate impact on the monthly unemployment rate, because of a variety of complicating factors in how it is calculated. 
 ''My guess is it's going to be less than one-half of 1 percent,'' Ms. Blank said. 
 Nevertheless, the boost to total employment nationwide, she said, will be significant. And the timing, in some ways, could not be better. 
 Mr. Zandi, along with many other economists, believes the nation will stop shedding jobs in the spring, and by the time these census jobs wind down over the summer, the private sector will be poised to begin adding jobs again.
 ''When we look back historically, the census will mark the end of the downdraft of employment,'' he said.
 Census officials across the country, however, sounded a note of caution for those desperate for the temporary jobs. Many may wind up being turned away. In part, that is because of the extraordinary demand during a smaller spate of earlier census hiring.
 The bureau hired about 140,000 people this year for its address canvassing campaign, in which workers walked block by block to make sure the government's address lists and maps were updated.
 Lee Ann Morning, office manager of the bureau's Denver office, said her staff was caught off guard after an open house last December that received some news coverage. 
 Every phone in the office was ringing, and additional staff members were called in to handle the volume. Hundreds of calls rolled over to voicemail, which quickly filled up. Many callers were unable to get through.
 ''It was that kind of overwhelming response,'' Ms. Morning said.
 Similar scenes across the country surprised census officials. Besides the volume, the caliber of the applicants was unprecedented.
 ''We saw certainly college degrees, master's degrees, Ph.D.'s, doctors, all kinds of people you wouldn't think would be looking for a temporary part-time position,'' Ms. Morning said.
 The Census Bureau had planned on recruiting 700,000 applicants by April for address canvassing. It wound up getting 1.2 million by early February, prompting officials to mostly call off recruiting across the country. The deluge left them with databases already bursting with recruits, especially in large metropolitan areas.
 ''We're trying not to give the public out there a false sense there's all these jobs out there,'' said Tony Farthing, the bureau's New York regional director, who is being especially cautious in his area about advertising too widely. 
 The need varies across the country, depending on geography, the local unemployment rate and other considerations. In many areas, especially rural and urban ones, the bureau still needs to recruit aggressively. One of its top priorities is hiring from the communities where census takers will be working, making sure they are familiar with its nuances and even speak the language. 
 There is a greater need for workers in areas where the mail-in response rate to the census form has traditionally been lower. So in many areas where there may be the most interest in census jobs, like certain suburbs, the need might be lower.
 ''The interest will not match perfectly with where you believe the work is going to be,'' said Dwight Dean, the Detroit regional director for the bureau.
 There is little doubt, however, that jobs will affect those in need. Mina Lopez, 43, of Chandler, Ariz., was laid off in March 2008 from her position as a human resources specialist when Arizona State University slashed its budget. 
 Ms. Lopez, a single of mother of three who holds two master's degrees, depleted her savings and was forced to hold garage sales every other week to raise cash.
 But she landed a part-time $15-an-hour census position last April, as part of the bureau's address canvassing campaign. It lasted only five weeks but helped arrest her financial freefall. She landed another part-time census position shortly after that and was eventually promoted to be an assistant manager for administration in the Phoenix office, making $19.25 an hour. 
 ''It's saved me and given me hope that I'm going to dig out of this hole,'' she said.

HEADLINE: These Days, Countries in Misery Have Lots of Company

BYLINE: By FLOYD NORRIS. 
Floyd Norris comments on finance and economics in his blog at nytimes.com/norris.

 BODY:
SOMETIMES economies can be too good.
 That is one lesson from the history of a new ''misery index,'' created by Pierre Cailleteau, an economist and sovereign risk analyst at Moody's.
 The index adds together a country's budget deficit, as a percentage of gross domestic product, and its unemployment rate. It captures the current conundrum for many countries: their economies need stimulus, but their budgets may not be able to afford it.
 The unfortunate leader in that misery index among the countries cited by Moody's is Spain, with an index of 30, thanks to an unemployment rate of 20 percent and a deficit of 10 percent of G.D.P. The figures are Moody's estimates for 2010. 
 While Spain is extreme, the indexes are high for many countries, with the United States and Britain both expected to score over 20 next year.
 In 2005, as can be seen in the accompanying graphic featuring 13 European countries and the United States and Iceland, the two countries with the highest misery indexes were Hungary and Greece, at 15.1, or just more than half Spain's current figure. In 2010, only three countries are expected to be lower than 15.1 -- the Czech Republic, Germany and Italy.
 In the glory days for the world economy, when no one would have thought to put together this index, two countries managed to have negative figures, which can happen if budget surpluses are large and unemployment rates are minuscule.
 Iceland, whose economy was once viewed as a testament to the strength that could come if a country cultivated a strong and expanding financial industry, had a negative misery index in 2000 and again from 2005 through 2007.
 Ireland, which also had a growing banking system and seemed to have positioned itself as the economic star of the euro zone, had an index reading of less than 5 for nine consecutive years, from 1999 to 2007, including a negative reading in 2000.
 Those countries have been among the worst hit by the financial crisis. Both had property booms that left prices dangerously overextended, and both have been forced to sharply cut government spending despite rising unemployment.
 The original misery index, created by the economist Arthur M. Okun, added together a country's unemployment rate and its inflation rate. That index came to symbolize stagflation, a significant problem of the 1970s, when consumer prices continued to rise even as economies stagnated and unemployment rose.
 The new index could prove to be an indicator of the dilemma facing many developed countries in coming years. If economies do not recover quickly, there will a strong case for fiscal stimulus to bring down unemployment. But there are limits to the budget deficits that some countries can run, providing a counterargument against such stimulus.
 A lesson of the stagflation era -- one taught by Paul A. Volcker in the United States -- was that countries sometimes had to get inflation under control even if it did prolong economic pain and raise unemployment. It would have been much better, in the long run, if inflation had been attacked earlier.
 This new misery index serves to highlight the risks the world took by not being afraid of the inflation of recent years -- inflation not in consumer prices but in real estate and financial assets. Instead, gains in those areas were taken as proof of excellent economic policies. Now, the world is paying for that excess, and finding the price to be high.

HEADLINE: Big Web Attack on Twitter Is Third Assault This Year

BYLINE: By JENNA WORTHAM and NICK BILTON; Claire Cain Miller contributed reporting.

 BODY:
An online attack Friday morning on Twitter was the result of the simplest of security breaches: someone got the password to enter the master directory of Twitter's Internet addresses and then redirected users to an alternate site instead.
 No user information appears to have been stolen in the attack. But the security breach -- the third major one at Twitter this year -- underscores the continuing weakness of the company's systems as its micro-blogging service is becoming more important to business and even global politics.
 The incident also highlights a basic vulnerability in the way life is lived as it becomes increasingly digital: With so much vital information stored on the Web, people are only as safe as their passwords.
 During the assault, which security analysts said began about 1 a.m. and lasted roughly an hour, hackers tinkered with Twitter's domain name servers, which are hosted by a Manchester, N.H., company called Dyn. When Web surfers tried to reach Twitter's pages, they were sent instead to a site for the ''Iranian Cyber Army,'' which claimed responsibility for the attack. 
 The domain names were eventually fixed and redirected back to the correct servers at about 2 a.m., but because of time the reset took, Twitter's Web site was not fully functional again until an hour later, according to Rod Rasmussen, president of Internet Identity, an Internet security company, who watched the attacks unfold in real time through a new technology his company is building.
 Twitter, which is based in San Francisco, declined to discuss details of the attack, and it was not clear how its security was compromised. 
 But Dan Kaminsky, director of penetration testing with the security firm IOActive, said that ''in terms of this sort'' of domain name server attack, ''this is easily one of the most common hacks.'' He said that a recent report by Verizon Communications found that 61 percent of Internet security breaches happen through simple password failures.
 Security specialists say it will be extremely difficult to determine who was behind the attack. There was some indication that the attack came from within the United States, but authorities are still investigating. 
 Beth Jones, a senior threat researcher at the Internet security firm Sophos, said the attack did not look very sophisticated and probably was not the effort of a Web terrorist or other professional. ''It could have been any number of people doing it,'' she said. 
 Ms. Jones said the incident may have been ''hacktivism,'' an attack with a social or political motivation. ''The point could purely be just to prove the site is insecure,'' she said. 
 Although the attack did not appear malicious, it easily could have been, Ms. Jones said.
 ''Instead of throwing up a banner to cover the site, what if it had been an exact replica of the home page?'' she said. ''If this attack had been a phishing page instead, who knows how many millions of credentials they could have gotten?''
 The attack was another black eye for Twitter, which had two major security breaches this summer. 
 In July, the technology blog TechCrunch published internal Twitter documents that had been stolen by an unidentified hacker who apparently figured out an employee's e-mail password.
 In August, unidentified attackers bombarded several social networking sites, including Facebook, YouTube and Twitter, with millions of junk e-mail messages in an attempt to block the Web pages of a 34-year-old economics professor who was writing about a skirmish between Russia and the republic of Georgia. The other sites withstood the assault, one of the most common types of Internet attacks, but Twitter struggled with its service for days.
 Roel Schouwenberg, a senior antivirus researcher at Kaspersky Lab, an Internet security company in Woburn, Mass., said the latest incident was an embarrassment to Twitter. ''Even if it was the fault of the hosting company, Twitter has a track record this year of having weak passwords and being compromised,'' he said.
 In September, Twitter raised $100 million from investors, adding $55 million it had raised. Despite all that new money, ''Twitter still doesn't seem to invest all that much in security,'' Mr. Schouwenberg said.
 In a blog post Friday afternoon, Biz Stone, a co-founder of Twitter, confirmed that the hijacking occurred. ''The motive for this attack appears to have been focused on defacing our site, not aimed at users,'' he said. ''We don't believe any accounts were compromised.'' 
 Mr. Stone and other company officials declined requests for interviews.
 Twitter's vulnerability appears to have increased as it has grown in popularity. ''As soon as you become high profile, you are a much more interesting target to people,'' Mr. Schouwenberg said.
 In November Twitter.com had more than 19 million unique visitors, an increase of 500 percent from Novemer 2008, according to Nielsen Mobile.
 The company's failures have not had a major impact on users, even businesses who are using it to communicate with customers or conduct transactions. From its very beginning, Twitter has experienced short failures, although they have become less frequent over the last year.
 Tony Hsieh, chief executive of the shoe retailer Zappos.com and an avid user of Twitter on company matters, said Friday's breach ''didn't concern me. I didn't even know about it.''
 Richard Binhammer an executive at Dell, which has generated $6.5 million in sales through Twitter, said that Twitter conversations tend to be sporadic anyway.
 ''It's not like you're on it all the time, depending on it for everything,'' said Mr. Binhammer, who is active on the computer maker's Twitter accounts. ''So when all of a sudden they have an outage, I'll pick up later, just like everybody else.'' 
 Other companies said that they were watching Twitter's performance closely to make sure they could depend on it to meet their customer service needs.
 Andy Dunn, chief executive of Bonobos, an e-commerce company, said he hoped to someday use Twitter as his primary way of communication with customers and others, replacing e-mail.
 But the service would need to be more reliable to do so. ''We're not there yet,'' he said.
 Laura Fitton, founder and chief executive of Oneforty, a start-up that aggregates listings of third-party Twitter services, is willing to be patient. ''Twitter's been around for three years and been dealt some pretty heavy blows,'' she said. ''And they're still standing. Each time, they still come out on top.''

HEADLINE: Executive At Barclays Defends Pay

BYLINE: By LANDON THOMAS Jr.

DATELINE: LONDON 

 BODY:
''If you really love working for Barclays, why do you need that huge incentive to do the job you are paid to do anyway?''
 The question for Robert E. Diamond Jr., the president of Barclays Capital and recipient of bonuses of $:15.2 million, or what was about $30 million, in 2006 and $:21 million in 2007, came out of the blue.
 Mr. Diamond, a forceful American who masterminded the takeover by Barclays of Lehman Brothers' United States business, had come last week to Chatham House, a leading British research center, to offer a defense of the risks that large, multifaceted banks take on a daily basis. 
 But on the same day that the government announced it would impose a 50 percent tax on bank bonuses, it was Mr. Diamond's compensation, not his views on risk and regulation, that drew the sharpest reaction among the 300 or so people who came to hear him speak.
 The British taxpayer had bailed out the banks, and now, as Mr. Diamond's questioner put it, ''you are paying yourselves enormous sums of money.''
 The question was tough but fair, Mr. Diamond acknowledged. As other bank executives have done, Mr. Diamond admitted that Barclays had made mistakes and said that banks now ''get it.''
 But many say they believe now that if Barclays and other banks that have profited from the recovery reward their top performers in a fashion similar to the one before the crisis, that may suggest that they actually don't get it.
 The government's decision to force banks to pay a 50 percent tax on bonuses above $:25,000 (about $40,700) this year was aimed more at preventing such payouts than raising badly needed tax revenue.
 But as banks and their armies of lawyers and accountants have had more than a week to ponder the bonus tax, it is becoming clear that instead of showing restraint they are going to pay their people a market rate, thumbing their nose, in effect, at the government.
 ''The banks are looking at this as a payroll tax -- a cost of doing business,'' said Sean Drury, a partner at PricewaterhouseCoopers who advises investment banks on compensation strategies.
 The chief executives of banks here have derided the measure as crassly political -- and a prelude to a migration of London-based bankers to New York, Hong Kong and Geneva.
 But for a British public still suffering from the effects of the country's worst recession since the depression, it has found a deep well of support that extends even to such rarefied outlets as Chatham House lectures.
 It is not just the man on the street who sees the threats by banks to pull up stakes as being a bit rich.
 On Friday, in an interview with the BBC, Andrew G. Haldane, who oversees financial stability for the Bank of England, said such a migration abroad would be ''unfortunate, but given the costs of carrying that financial system around, it may be a price worth paying.''
 Mr. Haldane also took a direct shot at Mr. Diamond's contention that universal banks like Barclays were crucial to the health of the broader economy, saying, ''There is not so much as a scintilla of evidence of bigger being better in banking.''
 Such pointed remarks are just the latest volleys in an increasingly bitter standoff between banks, emboldened by a return to profitability, and the wider public, which is still paying the costs of the roughly $:1 trillion bailout of the financial sector.
 When asked publicly about whether he deserved his large payouts, Mr. Diamond has not shied away from defending himself. In an interview earlier this year, he said that his mix of cash and deferred stock was ''appropriate for someone as senior as myself,'' citing Barclays policy of paying for performance. Mr. Diamond, along with John Varley, the chief executive of Barclays, took no bonus in 2008, although Mr. Diamond did receive $:14 million in cash and stock from a previous award plan.
 Last week, Mr. Diamond gave a more detailed response to the question about why top bankers needed large financial incentives.
 He reminded the crowd that Barclays solved its financing problems by reaching out to private investors and not the government, and also referred to two deals that he was largely responsible for.
 One was the bank's $13.5 billion sale of a controlling stake in Barclays Global Investors and the other its earlier purchase of Lehman Brothers' United States-based operations.
 The deals ''transformed our business,'' Mr. Diamond said. Gains from Barclays Capital's high-risk, high-reward investment banking business now make up about half of Barclays' overall profits.
 ''We are a stronger bank today than we were,'' he continued. ''We are more valuable to the U.K. today than we were, and we didn't take any direct government money and we weren't a burden to the taxpayers.''
 Mr. Diamond declined a request to discuss his views on compensation beyond his public remarks. A spokesman for Barclays Capital said: ''Barclays' remuneration committee, comprised of independent nonexecutive board directors, has not yet determined the compensation for any executive director for 2009 and will not do so until the year has been completed. Any speculation on compensation is therefore ill informed.''
 Mr. Drury from PricewaterhouseCoopers estimates that by paying the tax instead of reducing bonuses, the government take from the levy will be as much as $:2.5 billion, far above the $:550 million forecast by Alistair Darling, the chancellor of the Exchequer.
 That does not mollify critics, though.
 ''No one in the banking sector deserves a big bonus in this or any other year,'' said Richard Portes, a professor of economics at the London Business School. ''Barclays didn't get direct aid -- so what? It got enormous public assistance in the form of very cheap liquidity or it too would have crashed.''
 Like everyone, Mr. Diamond accepts that government intervention saved the day. As to how much his own personal benefit will be, only time will tell.
 ''I am very honest, we all benefited from the financial system,'' he said, in concluding his response to the question about his pay. ''All of us.''

HEADLINE: As Deal Fails, Saab Is Likely To Shut Down

BYLINE: By NELSON D. SCHWARTZ; Nick Bunkley and Walter Gibbs contributed reporting.

 BODY:
Saab, which earned a loyal following over six decades with its stylish but idiosyncratic cars, failed to attract the buyer it needed most -- a new owner for the company -- leaving General Motors little choice but to announce Friday that it would shut down the brand.
 Bigger car companies, which have been struggling with steep losses of their own, showed no interest because Saab was too small even though the brand is well regarded. 
 The last hope for Saab, which General Motors took control of in 1990, had been Spyker Cars, a tiny Dutch maker of high-end sports cars. 
 But some G.M. officials said that Spyker's reliance on Russian financing for the Saab deal was a major factor in its decision to walk away. 
 ''We discovered this week that there were issues that couldn't be resolved and no additional time would overcome that,'' said John F. Smith, a General Motors executive vice president.
 He added that G.M. would still be willing to consider selling Saab if a new buyer were to emerge. If that does not occur, the process of winding down Saab will begin in January. 
 ''I can't rule it out, but the clock starts now,'' he added. 
 Saab, which filed for bankruptcy protection in Sweden in February, has been a perennial money-loser. 
 It is among G.M.'s smallest brands, with sales of 93,000 vehicles worldwide last year, with just under 22,000 in the United States. G.M. also closed its Pontiac and Saturn brands this year.
 Besides throwing the fate of some 3,500 Saab workers in Trollhattan, Sweden, into doubt, Saab's expected closing also was more troubling news for Sweden's industrial base. 
 Another famous Swedish automaker, Volvo, is being sold by Ford to Zhejiang Geely Holding of China. Both Volvo and Saab are based in the west of Sweden, and the region has a deep network of suppliers and contractors that will also be affected. 
 ''This is of course a major blow to Sweden, though it wasn't unexpected,'' said Cecilia Werner, communications director for the Swedish Agency for Economic and Regional Growth. 
 She said there were nearly as many Swedes whose jobs were indirectly dependent on Saab as there were Saab employees. Moreover, she said, the company's long history and distinctive automobile designs have made it part of the Swedish identity, especially overseas. 
 ''They say 'Ikea, Abba, Volvo and Saab,' '' Ms. Werner said. ''This company has been a part of Swedish pride, along with Volvo.''
 In the auto world, as in Sweden, the announcement Friday was greeted more with sadness than with surprise. 
 Besides losing money for years, Saab was always on the periphery of G.M.'s empire. In the last year, management in Detroit had made it clear it wanted to dispose of the company.
 In a conference call, Mr. Smith repeatedly declined to specify what problems came up during the due diligence process at Spyker. 
 An earlier deal to sell Saab to Koenigsegg, a Swedish maker of specialty sports cars, collapsed last month. 
 According to people close to the negotiations, G.M. was concerned about Spyker's Russian financial backers as well as the fate of G.M.'s technology and other intellectual property under Spyker. The people declined to be identified because they were not authorized to speak publicly about the talks. 
 The main investor in Spyker is the Russian bank Convers Group, which is controlled by Alexander Antonov, a Russian tycoon. His son Vladimir, a 34-year-old banker who is a top executive at Convers, is chairman of Spyker. 
 Last month, G.M. pulled out of a deal to sell its European Opel and Vauxhall operations to a consortium led by Magna International, a Canadian maker of auto parts. The consortium was backed by the Russian state-controlled bank Sberbank.
 ''They'd been down the road with Russian investors before and that gave them reason for caution,'' said one official, who insisted on anonymity because he was not authorized to speak publicly. ''There was no visibility on when that might have been resolved.'' 
 Another snag was the question of whether Spyker could qualify for a 400 million euro ($573 million) loan from the European Investment Bank that was part of the earlier deal to sell Saab to Koenigsegg. 
 A spokesman for Spyker declined to comment on the question of the company's Russian ties, as did a spokesman for G.M. 
 In a statement, the chief executive of Spyker, Victor Muller, seemed to put the blame on G.M. for dragging its feet. 
 ''We sincerely regret that we are not able to complete this transaction with G.M.,'' Mr. Muller said. ''We worked 24/7 for three weeks, but the complexity of the transaction in combination with the strict deadline simply did not allow us to complete the transaction.'' 
 Saab will continue to honor warranties, while providing service and spare parts to current Saab owners around the world. 
 Nick Reilly, the president of G.M.'s European operations, said that the move was not a bankruptcy or forced liquidation, so he expected Saab to pay its debts, including those of suppliers. In all, 1,100 dealerships worldwide will be affected, including about 200 in the United States.
 G.M. is taking other steps to further clean up its balance sheet. On Friday, it said it began repaying the money it owes to the American and Canadian governments. It paid $1 billion to the United States Treasury, toward a balance of $6.7 billion, and $192 million to Canada, which is owed $1.4 billion.
 G.M.'s chief executive, Edward E. Whitacre Jr., said the company would continue making installments through June, when it would repay the entire balance, ''assuming no downturn in the economy or business.''
 Most of the $50 billion that G.M. borrowed from the Treasury's Troubled Asset Relief Program was converted to a 60 percent ownership stake, which the government plans to sell in a public stock offering as soon as next year.
 G.M. initially bought half of Saab in 1990 for $600 million, acquiring the rest in 2000 for $125 million. Under G.M.'s stewardship, Saab lost a large part of its Swedish identity as well as the technical prowess that earned it a loyal following in the 1980s.
 ''People will say they're sad to see it go, but what they're lamenting is the Saabs from the '70s and '80s,'' said James Bell, executive market analyst for Kelley Blue Book.
 ''Since the mid-'90s it's been a pretty irrelevant brand,'' Mr. Bell said. ''The only reason people would be excited about buying a Saab would be if someone was an enthusiast of the brand. And I think Saab was even pushing their patience.''

HEADLINE: 5 NATIONS FORGE PACT ON CLIMATE; GOALS GO UNMET

BYLINE: By JOHN M. BRODER; Reporting was contributed by Andrew C. Revkin, Elisabeth Rosenthal, Tom Zeller Jr., James Kanter and Helene Cooper.

DATELINE: COPENHAGEN 

 BODY:
President Obama announced here on Friday night that five major nations, including the United States, had together forged a climate deal. He called it ''an unprecedented breakthrough'' but acknowledged that it still fell short of what was required to combat global warming. 
 The agreement addresses many of the issues that leaders came here to settle. But it has left many of the participants in the climate talks unhappy, from the Europeans, who now have the only binding carbon control regime in the world, to the delegates from the poorest nations, who objected to being left out of the critical negotiations.
 By the early hours of Saturday, representatives of the 193 countries who have negotiated here for nearly two weeks had not yet approved the deal and there were signs they might not. But Mr. Obama, who left before the conference considered the accord because of a major storm descending on Washington, noted that the agreement was merely a political statement and not a legally binding treaty and might not need ratification by the entire conference.
 The three-page accord that Mr. Obama negotiated with the leaders of China, India, Brazil and South Africa and then presented to the conference did not meet even the modest expectations that leaders set for this meeting, notably by failing to set a 2010 goal for reaching a binding international treaty to seal the provisions of the accord. 
 Nor does the plan firmly commit the industrialized nations or the developing nations to firm targets for midterm or long-term greenhouse gas emissions reductions. The accord is nonetheless significant in that it codifies the commitments of individual nations to act on their own to tackle global warming. 
 ''For the first time in history,'' Mr. Obama said, ''all major economies have come together to accept their responsibility to take action to confront the threat of climate change.''
 The accord provides a system for monitoring and reporting progress toward those national pollution-reduction goals, a compromise on an issue over which China bargained hard. It calls for hundreds of billions of dollars to flow from wealthy nations to those countries most vulnerable to a changing climate. And it sets a goal of limiting the global temperature rise to 2 degrees Celsius above preindustrial levels by 2050, implying deep cuts in climate-altering emissions over the next four decades.
 But it was an equivocal agreement that was, to many, a disappointing conclusion to a two-year process that had the goal of producing a comprehensive and enforceable action plan for addressing dangerous changes to the global climate. The messy compromise mirrored the chaotic nature of the conference, which virtually all participants said had been badly organized and run. 
 In a news conference, Mr. Obama said the accord was only a tentative start down a long road.
 ''This progress did not come easily,'' he said, ''and we know that this progress alone is not enough.''
 The accord sets no goal for concluding a binding international treaty, which leaves the implementation of its provisions uncertain. It is likely to undergo many months, perhaps years, of additional negotiations before it emerges in any internationally enforceable form.
 Mr. Obama said before he left Copenhagen that he was confident that a final accord would be reached here. He looked weary and his eyes were bloodshot as he left the conference center for his motorcade to the airport.
 Some environmental groups gave a cautious nod of approval to the agreement as a good start.
 ''The world's nations have come together and concluded a historic -- if incomplete -- agreement to begin tackling global warming,'' said Carl Pope, executive director of the Sierra Club. ''Tonight's announcement is but a first step and much work remains to be done in the days and months ahead in order to seal a final international climate deal that is fair, binding and ambitious. It is imperative that negotiations resume as soon as possible.''
 Senator John Kerry, Democrat of Massachusetts, chairman of the Foreign Relations Committee and lead author of the Senate's climate change bill, said the accord would drive the Congress to pass climate change legislation early next year. 
 ''This can be a catalyzing moment,'' he said. ''President Obama's hands-on engagement broke through the bickering and sets the stage for a final deal and for Senate passage this spring of major legislation at home.''
 But there were serious rumblings of discontent that could yet scuttle the deal. 
 Lumumba Stanislaus Di-Aping, a Sudanese diplomat who has been representing the Group of 77 developing countries, denounced the accord.
 ''The developed countries have decided that damage to developing countries is acceptable,'' he told reporters, saying that the 2-degree target would ''result in massive devastation to Africa and small island states.'' He and many other representatives of the most vulnerable countries wanted a target of 1.5 degrees.
 ''Today's events, which really are a continuation of the history of the negotiations for the last two years, represent the worst development in climate change negotiations in history,'' Mr. Di-Aping said.
 Mr. Obama's announcement came late in a day that began with his 11-minute address to world leaders shortly after noon, and that was filled with brinksmanship and 11th-hour negotiations. Mr. Obama, whose speech included remarks that appeared pointed at China's resistance to mechanisms for monitoring emissions reductions, met privately with Prime Minister Wen Jiabao afterward. But Mr. Wen did not attend two smaller, impromptu meetings during the day that Mr. Obama and United States officials conducted with the leaders of other world powers, an apparent snub that infuriated administration officials and their European counterparts. 
 The deal eventually came together after a dramatic moment in which Mr. Obama and Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton burst into a meeting of the Chinese, Indian and Brazilian leaders, according to senior administration officials. Mr. Obama said he did not want them negotiating in secret. 
 The intrusion led to new talks that cemented central terms of the deal, American officials said. 
 Sergio Serra, Brazil's senior climate negotiator here, confirmed that Mr. Obama had joined a meeting of Brazilian, Indian, Chinese and other officials, although he did not say that Mr. Obama walked in uninvited. 
 ''After several discussions had taken place, they were joined by President Barack Obama,'' Mr. Serra said. ''Several important decisions were taken -- not a few due to Brazilian mediation -- that we hope will bring a result, if not what we expected, that may be a way of salvaging something and pave the way to another meeting or series of meetings to get the full result of this proceeding.''
 Jian Xiaoyan, a press officer with the Chinese government, said there was no one available to comment Friday night. 
 The agreement apparently grew out of a document that was being edited by high-ranking officials from some two dozen countries throughout the day. But many specifics that were included in earlier versions were excised in the document left on the table when Mr. Obama made his announcement, and many parties considered it at best a work in progress. The agreement contains several enumerated points asserting a general commitment to the idea that ''climate change is one of the greatest challenges of our time'' and asserts that ''deep cuts'' in global emissions were required. 
 In at least one earlier version, the deal included a collective agreement among nations to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 50 percent by 2050 -- with developed nations pledging as a bloc to reduce emissions by 80 percent over the same period. Those numbers were no longer in the version circulated after Mr. Obama's announcement.
 Also dropped from earlier drafts was language calling for a binding accord ''as soon as possible,'' and no later than at the next meeting of the parties, in Mexico City next November. The deal presented Friday evening said only that the agreement should be reviewed and put in place by 2015. 
 The document does lay out a framework for verification of emissions commitments by developing countries and for establishing a ''high-level panel'' to assess financial contributions by rich nations to help poor countries adapt to climate change and limit their emissions.
 Many of the specifics remained to be negotiated, however.
 Mr. Serra, the Brazilian diplomat, said that the process left many alienated, particularly the smaller countries that have little influence in a major international negotiation. Many involved in the process here suggested this would be the last time that 193 nations would gather in this way to negotiate such a complex accord.
 ''Certain groups like G-77 are not happy when a few people make decisions,'' Mr. Serra said. ''It's not an inclusive exercise. Perhaps it can't be.''

CORRECTION-DATE: December 30, 2009

 CORRECTION:
An article on Dec. 19 about the announcement of a climate deal signed by the United States, China, India, Brazil and South Africa at talks in Copenhagen referred incorrectly in some copies to a Sudanese diplomat who was sharply critical of the accord's limitations. The diplomat, Lumumba Stanislaus Di-Aping, is Mr. Di-Aping on second and subsequent references -- not Mr. Lumumba.

HEADLINE: Defense Bill Clears Senate Hurdle

BYLINE: By CARL HULSE

 BODY:
WASHINGTON The Senate voted early Friday morning to force final action on a Pentagon spending measure as Democrats broke a Republican attempt to use the military money to stall action on the health care overhaul.
 In an unusual dead-of-night session that opened just after midnight, senators voted 63 to 33 to shut off debate on the $626 billion plan, which is the last spending measure due to pass this year and was easily passed by the House earlier this week. A final vote is expected early Saturday.
 Democrats had to struggle to line up all 60 of their members in support of a key procedural vote to overcome anticipated Republican opposition to a bill Republicans would normally rally behind and have criticized Democrats for politicizing in the past. 
 Senator Russ Feingold, the anti-war Wisconsin Democrat, was the key for Democrats after he agreed to vote for the measure, citing Republican tactics to hold the Pentagon money hostage in the fight over health care. His initial resistance left Democrats one vote short and his colleagues cheered him when he announced his reversal in a closed-door party meeting Thursday evening.
 ''I am against continued funding for the wars in Afghanistan and Iraq,'' said Mr. Feingold, who was personally encouraged by President Obama to vote with the party. ''But it became apparent that this was really an effort to slow down a bill they were going to vote for anyway to destroy health care and that is not something I wanted to see happen.''
 Once Democrats had the 60 votes in hand, three Republicans joined them in voting to end the filibuster rather than go on the record voting against the Pentagon money.
 With Democrats trying to inch toward a final vote on the health care plan before Christmas, Republicans are using every tactic at their disposal to try to thwart progress. Delaying a final vote on the Pentagon measure was just the latest and probably not the last.
 Republicans acknowledged their resistance to the Pentagon measure was due to their desire to prolong the debate over the Democratic health care overhaul.
 ''Most of us are going to support the Department of Defense appropriations bill when the time is right, but I think it is very important to have the opportunity to talk about the health care bill,'' said Senator Kay Bailey Hutchison, Republican of Texas. 
 Asked if he would vote for the defense bill, which Republicans routinely support, Senator Sam Brownback Republican of Kansas, replied bluntly: ''No. I don't want health care.'' 
 The Senate needed to dispose of the Pentagon measure to clear the decks for an effort to overcome a series of procedural hurdles and try to pass a health care measure before leaving for the holidays. 
 Money for military operations is due to run out Friday under a stop-gap bill and the Senate needs to either complete the bill or pass another extension while the spending bill is completed.
 The Pentagon measure also includes a two-month extension of unemployment benefits and health insurance for out-of-work Americans as well as temporary renewals of several expiring federal programs and laws.
 Democrats chided Republicans for forcing the procedural vote on a measure they would normally support, saying it was a flawed strategy to slow down Pentagon money in their anger over health care.
 ''There is no more important bill for the safety of our troops,'' said Senator Richard J. Durbin of Illinois, the No. 2 Senate Democrat. ''I think they picked the wrong bill.''

HEADLINE: It's Crunch Time on Health Care

 BODY:
To the Editor:
 Re the Dec. 18 columns about health care by Paul Krugman (''Pass the Bill'') and David Brooks (''The Hardest Call''):
 I am devastated by the harm Senators Joseph I. Lieberman, Ben Nelson and others have done to real health reform. Without a public option, there is nothing to keep insurers from continuing to raise premiums. Even with subsidies, the insurers will continue to price people out of the market -- including people like me who earn too much to qualify for the subsidies.
 I am a 52-year-old woman with two serious chronic illnesses who had to give up a career as a trial lawyer because of my disabilities. These days I run a small nonprofit that provides free insurance and legal assistance to patients with chronic illnesses. 
 Every day, I speak to people all over America who can't get health insurance -- any health insurance at any cost -- because of pre-existing conditions. Every day, I hear tragic stories: people choosing between food and health care, people in intractable pain who cannot get medication, people literally dying.
 Until you have heard these voices, you cannot fully appreciate the horrors of the status quo. And so I thank Paul Krugman for being the voice of reason. 
 I know we have lost a real opportunity to do even more, and I grieve over that. But we must not let what might have been overshadow the good that even this half-loaf will do.

 Unless something very surprising and significant happens in the next week, the Senate health care bill, and likely the entire health care reform effort, can only be termed a colossal failure. Addresses rising costs? Nope. Expands choice? Nope. Holds insurers accountable? Nope. Expands access? Yes, because more money needs to be funneled to insurance companies somehow! 
 Despite holding both the White House and an overwhelming majority in both houses -- a situation that comes along once every few decades -- the Democrats have again failed miserably.
 Health reform turns out to be a gift for insurers and a knife in the backs of the American people. How embarrassing for President Obama and Senator Harry Reid, and how depressing for the rest of us.
 Chad Friesen Brooklyn, Dec. 18, 2009
 To the Editor:
 In an opinion article in The Washington Post in August, Paul Begala, a former adviser to President Bill Clinton, lamented the absolutist position on health insurance reform he encouraged the Democratic president to take in 1994. 
 Now advocating incremental reform, Mr. Begala noted that the 1935 Social Security Act excluded surviving spouses, agricultural and domestic workers, and employees of local and state government, railroads and nonprofit organizations -- all later piecemeal additions, like the disability benefits and inflation-adjusted cost-of-living increases.
 As a physician who would prefer single-payer insurance and would settle for a public option, I am willing to stomach even this imperfect bill. Democrats are unlikely to have the 60-vote majority needed to pass any comparable health reform after the 2010 elections. 
 It would be tragic to forgo extending access to lifesaving medical care to tens of millions, while prohibiting insurers' abusive coverage exclusions, limiting their nonmedical administrative costs (including profits) and providing mechanisms to constrain Medicare costs.
 Frederick A. Smith Garden City, N.Y., Dec. 16, 2009
 To the Editor:
 Whether they've been naughty or nice, health care insurance companies are getting everything they want this holiday season. Thanks to senators like Joseph I. Lieberman, nearly everything objectionable to insurers is being surgically removed from the bill.
 Mandatory health insurance for everyone should be a win-win. But if they're successful at putting up roadblocks to real competition (by eliminating single-payer and public option plans), it's a win only for insurance companies. 
 It's obvious that there is no way that the Democrats will ever get 60 votes in the Senate until the insurance companies get every single concession that they want. Now is the time for the parliamentary procedure known as reconciliation, which requires only 51 votes. Now is the time to give up on doing it the ''nice'' way and to ram the best parts through -- before it's too late.
 John Fineberg St. Paul, Dec. 18, 2009
 To the Editor:
 As important as Paul Krugman's column about health care reform is, its most important point is that ''it's time to revise the rules'' around the filibuster. 
 Whatever value the Senate may have as a ''cooling saucer'' for wildly popular but possibly unwise legislation, permitting a minority of 40 senators to permanently block a vote is intolerable. The tradition of the Senate's more deliberative pace can be preserved by changing the rules to encourage thorough and even lengthy debate, but to eventually permit a simple majority of senators to bring a matter to a vote.
 If only one Republican senator would let statesmanship triumph over partisanship and agree that a bill he or she deeply opposes should nevertheless be voted on, the minority's ability to permanently obstruct votes would be ended. Otherwise, gridlock will continue to be the norm, to the detriment of the nation as a whole.

HEADLINE: Key Democrat Reports Progress in Health Bill Talks

BYLINE: By ROBERT PEAR and DAVID M. HERSZENHORN

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
Senator Ben Nelson, a pivotal figure in the health care debate, said Friday that he and Senate Democratic leaders had made ''real progress'' in negotiations on abortion that could clear the way for a Senate vote on sweeping health legislation.
 But he said there was no final agreement. 
 ''This is one of those situations where it's probably best for everybody to sleep on it,'' Mr. Nelson, a Nebraska Democrat, said as he left the office of the Senate majority leader, Harry Reid, Democrat of Nevada, at 9:40 p.m.
 Senate Democratic leaders and White House officials met through the day with Mr. Nelson, whom they see as the indispensable 60th vote for the legislation.
 One of their goals was to tighten restrictions on the use of federal money to subsidize insurance that includes coverage for abortions. 
 Republicans have said they will use every tool to block the bill. Under Senate rules, Mr. Reid must finish writing the legislation by Saturday, or it would be virtually impossible for Democrats to get the bill approved by their self-imposed Christmas deadline.
 ''We are still talking and will have some more conversations tomorrow,'' Mr. Nelson said Friday night. At this stage, there is ''certainly nothing final,'' he said, but, ''sure, there is progress.''
 James P. Manley, a spokesman for Mr. Reid, said: ''Today was a day of long, hard negotiations involving a number of issues and a number of senators. We have made great progress and are pleased with how the discussions have proceeded.''
 Senator Barbara Boxer, Democrat of California, a leading proponent of abortion rights, was also in the talks.
 Mr. Nelson said his concerns went beyond abortion and included other provisions, like cuts in Medicare payments to nursing homes and home care agencies.
 The talks played out in an atmosphere embittered by a dispute over a military spending bill. 
 Democrats said the Republicans had forced a lengthy debate on the Defense Department bill, in part because they wanted to block the health bill, which is next in line for a Senate vote. Republicans said Democrats were trying to jam the health bill through the Senate before anyone had read its new provisions.
 Senator Bob Casey, Democrat of Pennsylvania, has been trying for several days to work out a compromise on abortion. Under his proposal, some health plans receiving federal subsidies could offer coverage for abortion, but they could not use federal money to pay for the procedure. They would have to use money taken from premiums paid by subscribers and would have to keep it separate from federal money. 
 Mr. Nelson and the United States Conference of Catholic Bishops said Thursday that they could not accept Mr. Casey's initial proposal, in part because they saw money from the government and premiums as fungible.
 The White House tried Friday to suggest that religious groups were divided, and that some Roman Catholic organizations were more flexible and more willing to compromise than the bishops.
 Sister Carol Keehan, president of the Catholic Health Association, which represents Catholic hospitals, praised Mr. Casey's efforts. ''As we understand it, the Senate intends to keep the president's commitment that no federal funds will pay for abortions,'' she said. ''We are increasingly confident that Senator Casey's language can achieve the objective of no federal funding for abortion.''
 But Richard M. Doerflinger, a spokesman on abortion for the bishops' conference, called the proposed compromise unacceptable. ''I do not see anything to address the core problem, which is the use of federal funds to subsidize health plans that include coverage of abortion,'' he said.
 The bishops' position, he said, is that ''if a health plan receives federal money, it cannot cover elective abortion.''
 Cardinal Daniel N. DiNardo, the archbishop of Galveston-Houston and chairman of the bishops' anti-abortion committee, said, ''We continue to oppose, and urge others to oppose, the Senate bill unless and until this fundamental failure is remedied.''
 Several Democratic senators said they were rethinking Mr. Reid's Christmas deadline for action on the health care bill.
 Senator John Kerry, Democrat of Massachusetts, said he would be pleased if the Senate made significant progress toward passage of the bill, or approved ''critical components,'' by Christmas. He said he was confident that the Senate would eventually approve the bill.
 Democrats in Congress and the administration want Congress to finish work on the bill before the president gives his State of the Union address in January , so they can pivot to an emphasis on jobs and the economy.
 Senator Olympia J. Snowe, a Maine Republican being courted by the White House, said she had concerns about several of the bill's provisions, including an increase in the Medicare payroll tax and the creation of a federal insurance program for long-term care. Given these concerns, Ms. Snowe said, it is ''totally unrealistic'' for Senate Democratic leaders to insist on passing the bill by Christmas.
 ''Why are we rushing to get this done?'' Ms. Snowe asked. ''We should take a pause, cool the passions and work deliberately through a number of these issues.''
 Labor unions said the Senate bill needed major changes.
 Richard L. Trumka, president of the A.F.L.-C.I.O., said the bill was ''inadequate -- too kind to the insurance industry.'' He deplored the Democrats' decision to jettison a government-run health plan that would compete with private insurers.
 Andy Stern, president of the Service Employees International Union, urged President Obama to fight for improvements in the Senate bill. 
 Mr. Stern praised provisions that would provide coverage to more than 30 million uninsured people. But in a letter to members of his union, he also said: ''For many people, care will still be too expensive to afford. Some of you would face an additional burden because your health insurance benefits would be taxed.''
 Some Democrats have suggested that the Senate should pass the bill next week and fix problems in negotiations with the House. But the Senate Republican leader, Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, said: ''The bill is beyond fixing. It's not fixable.''
 Moreover, Mr. McConnell said: ''There's a good chance the Democrats will not be able to get their members to lock arms and walk off the cliff in obvious defiance of the American people, who are virtually screaming at us, 'Please do not pass this bill.' ''

HEADLINE: The Zhu Zhu Strategy

BYLINE: By STEPHANIE ROSENBLOOM

 BODY:
Long before stockings were hung and Christmas trees twinkled in windows, the chief of Toys ''R'' Us threw his company's weight behind an odd bet. 
 It was early summer, and Gerald L. Storch had a fake hamster on his desk. His buyers, the executives who study and order merchandise, were predicting it would be a holiday hit. Mr. Storch laughed as the rodent scurried around and plopped off a table, then he turned serious: ''How big can we make it?'' 
 So big, it turned out, that mothers are now lying in wait in Toys ''R'' Us parking lots all over the nation, desperately hoping to score fake hamsters for Christmas. 
 Mr. Storch's big order for Zhu Zhu Pets was the latest achievement for a man who, in the midst of a recession, has begun to pull off a retailing turnaround. Only five years ago, Toys ''R'' Us was in grave trouble. Sales had shrunk and the chain had fallen under the shadow of Wal-Mart, the behemoth discounter. Retailing professionals said the beleaguered toy industry was losing ground to flashy electronic gadgets. 
 When Toys ''R'' Us was sold, in 2005, for $6.6 billion to two private equity firms and a real estate developer, analysts thought it was only a matter of time before the chain would be carved up and sold.
 They were wrong. The toy company's new owners hired the bespectacled Mr. Storch, a longtime Target executive, to help Toys ''R'' Us get its sparkle back.
 In the last year, Mr. Storch has taken bold steps. He snapped up nearly every well-known specialty toy chain and Web site, including F. A. O Schwarz and KB Toys. As mall retailers went out of business, Mr. Storch opened more than 80 temporary holiday toy shops in their vacant storefronts. He is opening supercenters, with Toys ''R'' Us and Babies ''R'' Us stores together under one roof. And he kicked off the holiday shopping season earlier than ever, opening his stores at just after midnight on the Friday after Thanksgiving, instead of hours later. 
 Recently, Mr. Storch stood at the flagship Toys ''R'' Us store in Manhattan and gazed at a replica of the Empire State Building made of Legos. ''While it would be easy to get into a very defensive hunker-down mode during these economic times,'' he said, ''history has shown that the future rewards companies which are aggressive during economic downturns.''
 Toys ''R'' Us has not gone unscathed in this economy; the chain said in its most recent reporting period that sales declined from last year. Even so, Mr. Storch has managed to make it the last big specialty toy retailer left in the nation, and one whose prospects are looking up. 
 Where consumers used to shop at KB Toys in malls throughout the country, they are now shopping at Toys ''R'' Us holiday boutiques. When tourists buy wide-eyed dolls at F. A. O. Schwarz, their dollars go into the coffers of Toys ''R'' Us. Even a search for the word ''toys'' on the Internet inevitably leads to a Web site owned by Toys ''R'' Us: Toys.com, eToys.com, BabyUniverse.com, FAO.com or ePregnancy.com.
 Wal-Mart overtook Toys ''R'' Us as the largest toy seller in the country more than a decade ago. Mr. Storch's fundamental strategy is not to try to compete by matching Wal-Mart's prices, a battle he would surely lose. Instead he is trying to outfox Wal-Mart by focusing on service and especially on selection, perceiving the next hot toy trend and locking in big orders before his competitors even see it coming.
 ''Now our competitors are left competing purely by making price claims,'' Mr. Storch said, adding that he would not reinforce ''a rush to the cheap.'' He pointed out that his competitors could not cut prices on toys they did not have.
 Mr. Storch, 53, joined Toys ''R'' Us after 12 years at Target, where he rose to vice chairman and was widely considered to be one of two contenders for the top job. But in 2005 he abruptly left the company, never giving a reason. Retailing professionals said they think it became clear inside Target that Mr. Storch, known as more of an operations man than someone with a flair for merchandising, was not going to ascend to chief executive. 
 Four months after leaving Target, Mr. Storch was named chairman and chief executive of Toys ''R'' Us, where from his early days he held the chain accountable for its poor results and invoked the mantra, ''We are not victims.'' 
 Industry veterans praised Mr. Storch for his intelligence (he has a bachelor of arts, a master's and a law degree from Harvard), and for bringing Toys ''R'' Us back from the brink. At the same time, Mr. Storch has been described as being obstinate and of not having a particularly warm personality. Industry professionals said he had gone through several senior executives.
 At Target, Mr. Storch worked in areas as varied as supply chain operations and financial services, and led the development of the company's grocery strategy and its Target.com business. ''I remember when I was giving a presentation,'' said Mr. Storch, ''one of the board members saying, 'Well, we can't do a Web site at Target because, you know, you have to be specialized in something the way eToys is.' ''
 Today, Toys ''R'' Us owns eToys. All of the recent acquisitions are meant to differentiate Toys ''R'' Us from its value-priced rivals, especially the purchase of F. A. O Schwarz, which enabled Toys ''R'' Us to offer exclusive, high-end toys. 
 Toys ''R'' Us posted a loss of $67 million for the three months ended Oct. 31, an improvement over a loss of $104 million last year. The company typically makes large investments in the third quarter to prepare for the holidays. Net sales were $2.7 billion, down from $2.8 billion last year. Sales at United States stores open at least a year declined 9.3 percent year-over-year. Still, Sean McGowan, a toy industry analyst with Needham & Company, said Toys ''R'' Us had lately gained market share. 
 ''The profitability of the company is better than it's been in a decade,'' he said.
 Also, Toys ''R'' Us, which is owned by the private equity firms Kohlberg Kravis Roberts and Bain Capital, and a real estate developer, Vornado Realty Trust, refinanced its debt so that no major payments are due for two years. Last month, Moody's Investors Service upgraded the chain's outlook. 
 Retailing professionals said Toys ''R'' Us -- which has 849 Toys ''R'' Us and Babies ''R'' Us stores in the United States and more than 700 international stores -- will probably file for a public stock offering in the next year or so. Toys ''R'' Us declined to comment on that.
 Buyers at Toys ''R'' Us were first introduced to fake hamsters, known as Zhu Zhu Pets, almost a year ago, at the Hong Kong Toys and Games Fair. 
 ''We saw the potential,'' said Lisa Harnisch, a vice president and divisional merchandise manager for Toys ''R'' Us. Ms. Harnisch and her colleagues knew children adored hamsters -- and they sensed that mothers would like fake hamsters that required no care. 
 By May, Toys ''R'' Us had partnered with Cepia, the small company that created the hamsters, to do a test run in a few stores in Arizona. Sales were off the charts. ''At that point we knew this was going to be really big,'' said Ms. Harnisch, adding that Mr. Storch trusted her and her team to find the season's hottest toys but ''at the same time he's very challenging and he's very aggressive.'' 
 ''From his perspective it was less about that item,'' she continued, and more about ''how do we make it big for Christmas?''
 Toy's ''R'' Us spent the summer talking to Cepia about how many fake hamsters could be manufactured and what exclusive variations could be made for Toys ''R'' Us. In August the chain began placing orders for the holidays. This week, Toys ''R'' Us promised it would have more than a million Zhu Zhu Pets and accessories available through Christmas eve.
 Mr. Storch boasts ''vastly more Zhu Zhu inventory than anyone else,'' and other people in the toy trade confirm that claim. That buzz is what has mothers camping out in the parking lots of Toys ''R'' Us.
 ''It will sell out, regardless,'' Mr. Storch said. ''But if you will find it anywhere, you will find it at Toys ''R'' Us.''

HEADLINE: Off To The Races

BYLINE: By THOMAS L. FRIEDMAN. 
The public editor is off today.

DATELINE: Copenhagen 

 BODY:
 I've long believed there are two basic strategies for dealing with climate change -- the ''Earth Day'' strategy and the ''Earth Race'' strategy. This Copenhagen climate summit was based on the Earth Day strategy. It was not very impressive. This conference produced a series of limited, conditional, messy compromises, which it is not at all clear will get us any closer to mitigating climate change at the speed and scale we need.
 Indeed, anyone who watched the chaotic way this conference was ''organized,'' and the bickering by delegates with which it finished, has to ask whether this 17-year U.N. process to build a global framework to roll back global warming is broken: too many countries -- 193 -- and too many moving parts. I leave here feeling more strongly than ever that America needs to focus on its own Earth Race strategy instead. Let me explain. 
 The Earth Day strategy said that the biggest threat to mankind is climate change, and we as a global community have to hold hands and attack this problem with a collective global mechanism for codifying and verifying everyone's carbon-dioxide emissions and reductions and to transfer billions of dollars in clean technologies to developing countries to help them take part. 
 But as President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva of Brazil told this conference, this Earth Day framework only works ''if countries take responsibility to meet their targets'' and if the rich nations really help the poor ones buy clean power sources.
 That was never going to happen at scale in the present global economic climate. The only way it might happen is if we had ''a perfect storm'' -- a storm big enough to finally end the global warming debate but not so big that it ended the world.
 Absent such a storm that literally parts the Red Sea again and drives home to all the doubters that catastrophic climate change is a clear and present danger, the domestic pressures in every country to avoid legally binding and verifiable carbon reductions will remain very powerful. 
 Does that mean this whole Earth Day strategy is a waste? No. The scientific understanding about the climate that this U.N. process has generated and the general spur to action it provides is valuable. And the mechanism this conference put in place to enable developed countries and companies to offset their emissions by funding protection of tropical rain forests, if it works, would be hugely valuable.
 Still, I am an Earth Race guy. I believe that averting catastrophic climate change is a huge scale issue. The only engine big enough to impact Mother Nature is Father Greed: the Market. Only a market, shaped by regulations and incentives to stimulate massive innovation in clean, emission-free power sources can make a dent in global warming. And no market can do that better than America's.
 Therefore, the goal of Earth Racers is to focus on getting the U.S. Senate to pass an energy bill, with a long-term price on carbon that will really stimulate America to become the world leader in clean-tech. If we lead by example, more people will follow us by emulation than by compulsion of some U.N. treaty. 
 In the cold war, we had the space race: who could be the first to put a man on the moon. Only two countries competed, and there could be only one winner. Today, we need the Earth Race: who can be the first to invent the most clean technologies so men and women can live safely here on Earth. 
 Maybe the best thing President Obama could have done here in Copenhagen was to make clear that America intends to win that race. All he needed to do in his speech was to look China's prime minister in the eye and say: ''I am going to get our Senate to pass an energy bill with a price on carbon so we can clean your clock in clean-tech. This is my moon shot. Game on.''
 Because once we get America racing China, China racing Europe, Europe racing Japan, Japan racing Brazil, we can quickly move down the innovation-manufacturing curve and shrink the cost of electric cars, batteries, solar and wind so these are no longer luxury products for the wealthy nations but commodity items the third world can use and even produce.
 If you start the conversation with ''climate'' you might get half of America to sign up for action. If you start the conversation with giving birth to a ''whole new industry'' -- one that will make us more energy independent, prosperous, secure, innovative, respected and able to out-green China in the next great global industry -- you get the country. 
 For good reason: Even if the world never warms another degree, population is projected to rise from 6.7 billion to 9 billion between now and 2050, and more and more of those people will want to live like Americans. In this world, demand for clean power and energy efficient cars and buildings will go through the roof.
 An Earth Race led by America -- built on markets, economic competition, national self-interest and strategic advantage -- is a much more self-sustaining way to reduce carbon emissions than a festival of voluntary, nonbinding commitments at a U.N. conference. Let the Earth Race begin.

HEADLINE: Clear-Cutting the Truth About Trees

BYLINE: By BERND HEINRICH. 
Bernd Heinrich, emeritus professor at the University of Vermont, is the author of the forthcoming ''Nesting Season.''

DATELINE: Burlington, Vt. 

 BODY:
 THE Copenhagen climate-change summit meeting is behind us, and did not achieve what was hoped for. There was no lack of good intentions, but they generated conflicts rather than solutions, and the product was a weak agreement to disagree in the future. Forests were part of the discussion, and several things were understood: carbon dioxide is a potentially world-altering lethal pollutant, fossil fuels are the problem, biofuels are part of the solution. But exactly how to pare down the use of fossil fuels and switch to energy sources derived from plant material? That is the problem.
 Biofuels are the indirect use of solar energy packaged into plants by the best solar-panel technology that has ever been invented, and it is far easier to grow green power than to build nuclear plants, dam our waterways and put windmills on our scenic mountaintops. Yet our current plans to shift to green energy -- centered on so-called carbon offsets and cap-and-trade systems -- are in some applications sorely misguided. 
 Contrary to what you might hear from energy companies and environmentally conscious celebrities, offsets don't magically make carbon emissions disappear. Worse, relying on them to stem global warming may devastate our vital forest ecosystems. 
 On the industrial scale, carbon trading works like this: Limits (caps) are set on carbon emissions so that the true costs of our energy use are not just passed on to our descendants or people in some distant country. As an incentive to help the planet, savings of carbon emissions that one achieves below the designated cap can then be traded, as offsets, to another polluter who can then go over his cap by an equal amount. While carbon credits can be generated by switching to cleaner technology or nonpolluting sources in energy production, they can also be gained by unrelated steps, like planting trees, that are said to deter global warming. 
 Thus, if I burn coal in my business, I can plant pines in Chile and earn an offset, which will then allow me to burn even more coal. On a smaller scale, Al Gore purchases carbon offsets that he says make up for the emissions from the jets he uses in spreading his message of conservation. All this may seem logical, and energy companies would have you believe it works in the real world. But it is actually terrible for the planet, which is governed by the dictates of physics and biology.
 Part of the problem is the public misunderstanding of how forests and carbon relate. Trees are often called a ''carbon sink'' -- implying that they will sop up carbon from the atmosphere for all eternity. This is not true: the carbon they take up when they are alive is released after they die, whether from natural causes or by the hand of man. The only true solution to achieving global ''carbon balance'' is to leave the fossil carbon where it is -- underground. 
 Beyond that, planting more trees is decidedly not the same thing as saving our forests. Instead, planting trees invariably means using them as a sustainable crop, which leads not only to a continuous cycle of carbon releases, but also to the increased destruction of our natural environment. 
 A few environmental groups in Copenhagen were considered unwelcome guests for loudly pointing out that the carbon-trading proposals bandied about at the meetings subsidize forest destruction and will lead to large-scale destruction of ecosystems and unprecedented ''land grabs.'' (Disclosure: my wife is a researcher for one of those groups.) But such claims are correct. More than anything, carbon offsets will allow rich countries to burn ever more fossil fuels under the ''clean development mechanism'' of the Kyoto Protocol, the system that sets the values, in terms of tons of carbon equivalent, of emission-reduction efforts. 
 In fact, most of the problems with the system can be traced back to the Kyoto Protocol, which was adopted in 1997. After much political wrangling, the Kyoto delegates decided that there would be no carbon-reduction credits for saving existing forests. Since planting new trees does get one credits, Kyoto actually created a rationale for clear-cutting old growth. 
 This is horrifying. The world's forests are a key to our survival, and that of millions of other species. Not only are they critical to providing us with building material, paper, food, recreation and oxygen, they also ground us spiritually and connect us to our primal past. Never before in earth's history have our forests been under such attack. And the global-warming folks at Copenhagen seem oblivious, buying into the corporate view of forests as an exploitable resource. 
 A forest is an ecosystem. It is not something planted. A forest grows on its own. There are many kinds of forests that will grow practically anywhere, each under its own special local conditions. When a tree falls, the race is on immediately to replace it. In the forests I study, there so many seeds and seedlings that if a square foot of ground space opens up, more than a hundred trees of many different species compete to grow there.
 So if you want to plant a specific species of tree for lumber or for offsets, you'll have to apply an (petroleum-based) herbicide repeatedly over its lifespan. If you hope to make a profit, you will plant a tree genetically engineered to grow quickly and resist disease. This is the path to domestication of a plant that needs to be ever coddled with fertilizers, herbicides, pesticides and fungicides. And not coincidentally, there will then be a market for its seeds, and all the chemicals needed to coddle the crop. 
 In the end, what was originally intended as a mechanism for slowing global warming has created huge economic pressure for ecocide. And there will be no objections from easily duped bleeding- heart ''environmentalists,'' who absolutely love tree planting because it sounds so ''green.''
 To preserve something it first has to be valued, and the most effective means of valuing it is to have a practical use for it. If the discussions in Copenhagen were any indication, mankind sees little value in forests, but much in tree plantations. (On the other hand, I admit that those of us who really do care about forests have not exactly been helpful. We have not encouraged selective harvesting from naturally occurring stands, which may be necessary.) 
 It is easy to scream bloody murder against tree planting as a means for biomass energy and industrial fiber production, but there then has to be an alternative (aside from the obvious one of energy conservation). We need either vastly fewer people or vastly more forests, along with a new definition of earth-friendly reforestation. 
 These new stands of growth -- if managed as true forest rather than as a single-species, single-aged crops -- would contain a mixture of mature and transitional-growth trees. Any tree cut down would immediately generate a race of others to replace it at that spot, and the winner will emerge from a natural selection of seeds and seedlings most suited to grow there. No, this isn't the fastest way to build up carbon credits. But it is the only real way to preserve the planet, and ourselves.

HEADLINE: A Two-Stroke Revival, Without the Blue Haze

BYLINE: By DON SHERMAN

DATELINE: Detroit 

 BODY:
 NO new car marketed in the United States has been powered by a two-stroke engine since Saab phased out its hard-to-housebreak 3-cylinder in the late 1960s, when federal air pollution laws were taking hold. And with images from Eastern Europe of belching Trabants still fresh, there hasn't been much of a clamor for a two-stroke revival, either.
 Simple and inexpensive, yet powerful for their size, two-stroke engines held great appeal in the years before fuel economy and exhaust emissions became primary concerns. But now, with the technology of conventional four-stroke engines quite mature, there is renewed interest in taming the two-stroke to compete with diesels, hybrids and electrics as part of the solution to meeting future mileage standards.
 Though two-strokes have largely faded from motorcycles and may be endangered even in applications like lawn trimmers, news of recent progress in research programs has emerged in Europe and the United States. For instance, EcoMotors International, based in Troy, Mich., has had encouraging results in tests of its experimental engines, which the company hopes will be used to power everything from stationary generators to tractor-trailer rigs. 
 Last year a collaborative effort in Britain of Lotus Engineering, Jaguar and Queen's University Belfast began developing a two-stroke engine called Omnivore, for its ability to run on a variety of fuels. The direct-injection engine has the ability to vary its compression ratio from 8:1 to 40:1 by changing the volume of the combustion chamber. On Dec. 9, Lotus released test results that it termed successful for fuel economy and exhaust emissions.
 And in Chapman, Kan., impressively credentialed scientists, engineers and investors are developing what they call the Grail Engine, a reference to their quest for a power plant beyond current levels of efficiency and greenness. 
 The Grail Engine differs from two-stroke convention in the use of an intake valve positioned in the top of the piston to admit the fresh charge of air for combustion. It also has an overhead exhaust valve, surrounded by three spark plugs, and a fuel injector at the top of the combustion chamber. The project's goals are to exceed 100 miles per gallon and 100 horsepower from a clean-burning 1-liter engine. While there is no running prototype, interest in its approach has brought a visit by research engineers from Honda Motor. 
 In simplest terms, the strength of the two-stroke engine lies in its delivery of a power pulse with every revolution of the crankshaft; the familiar four-stroke piston engine in today's cars fires each cylinder on every other revolution. 
 Both types of engines use a four-step combustion cycle that converts fuel and air to power: intake, compression, ignition and exhaust. But the two-stroke does it all with just two sweeps of the piston through the cylinder, one up and one down. The four-stroke design takes twice as many trips of the piston up and down the cylinder, allowing more time for each step and placing less stress on the engine.
 Today's gasoline piston engines trace their roots to Nikolaus Otto, a German inventor. Though patents covering his breakthrough were not issued until 1877, Otto and his partners began manufacturing and selling four-stroke engines in 1864. It was a lucrative business that immediately stirred competition. 
 A two-stroke alternative was championed by Karl Benz and others. Two-stroke engines have generally been lighter, cheaper and simpler because they did not need an intricate system of valves that open and close to direct air and fuel into the cylinders and to let burned gases exit. Instead, the piston takes on this job, along with a handful of other tasks. 
 One drawback of the familiar, simple two-stroke engine designs is that some unburned fuel and most of the lubricating oil are swept out the exhaust pipe. Decades ago, the blue clouds trailing a '60s Saab were deemed tolerable, but no longer.
 In spite of its shortcomings, the two-stroke never died. Instead, improved designs, electronic fuel injection and automatic oil-metering systems kept it practical for chainsaws, outboard motors and snowmobiles.
 Donald L. Runkle, who was appointed chief executive of EcoMotors last September, spent 31 years at General Motors in top engineering posts. He can barely conceal his enthusiasm for the two-stroke his company is pursuing. ''Our OPOC design is the cellphone of power sources,'' he said. The two-stroke operating cycle is just one of several unusual aspects of the EcoMotors engine. It also has an opposed-piston, opposed-cylinder layout -- the source of its OPOC name -- and an electrically assisted turbocharger. The first-generation version runs on diesel fuel.
 Peter Hofbauer, chairman and chief technical officer of EcoMotors, conceived this engine in 1997. The idea grew out of his 20-year tenure at Volkswagen, where he developed VW's first diesel engines and the unusual narrow-angle VR6.
 The opposed-cylinder layout -- paired horizontal cylinders with a crankshaft down the middle -- was the key to the VW Beetle engine's small size and smoothness. In the late 1970s, while developing a water-cooled version of that engine, Mr. Hofbauer investigated the opposed-piston concept, which had been used in a variety of military, aircraft, marine and industrial engines. The opposed-piston engine has two pistons that move like clapping hands inside each cylinder. Outboard pistons are attached to the crankshaft through long tension rods while the inboard pistons have conventional connecting rods. 
 As the outboard piston nears the end of its motion away from the crankshaft, it uncovers ports -- essentially the window opening of a passageway in the cylinder wall -- that admit fresh air to the cylinder. When the twin pistons move toward each other, two injectors deliver fuel to the cylinder, initiating combustion. The rising pressure drives the pistons apart. EcoMotors calls the process inside each cylinder a Direct Gas Exchange Cycle, because the air and fuel mixture moves in only one direction. 
 Mr. Hofbauer says the EcoMotors engine has twice the power density -- the output on a per-pound, or per-cylinder-displacement basis -- of conventional engines. The production cost is 20 percent less, he said, because the engine has only half the parts of a conventional power plant. Ganging modules together and using an electric clutch to shut down one module when its power isn't needed yields a 45 percent gain in efficiency over conventional engines. Mr. Hofbauer said a hybrid configuration, with two power modules assisted by a motor-generator, would raise efficiency an additional 10 percent.
 According to Mr. Runkle, the OPOC engine has already cleared two big hurdles in its initial development: it is capable of meeting future gas and diesel emission standards while operating more efficiently -- by 15 to 60 percent -- than conventional engines. Mr. Runkle has his eye on a shuttered factory in Livonia, Mich., not far from the EcoMotors headquarters. His dream is to put the Motor City back on the map as the world's pre-eminent source of clean, cost-effective and fuel-efficient engines.

HEADLINE: Agent or No Agent?

BYLINE: By HARVEY ARATON

 BODY:
SIDE BY SIDE on a quiet South Nyack street with striking Hudson River views, Jeanette Corvino and Jeffrey Hall have each been trying to sell expensive houses in a challenging market. But the similarity of their neighboring situations ends there. 
 Ms. Corvino has a four-unit Italianate Victorian that she bought as an investment property more than four years ago and now needs to unload before a balloon payment on a second mortgage comes due. 
 Mr. Hall and his wife, Sharon, have a colonial revival and are empty nesters with more than a quarter-century's worth of equity.
 After listing her property with a real estate agent for almost a year for $892,000, Ms. Corvino decided in June that she could not afford to pay a broker's fee on the sale and is now trying to sell the house on her own for $840,000. 
 For his part, Mr. Hall picked up the telephone and called the same agent who sold him and his wife their house 26 years ago. They have set an asking price of $899,000.
 ''It would never even occur to me not to use an agent,'' he said. ''But I'm a restoration architect. I live in the past.''
 Are real estate brokers -- like travel agents and other middlemen coping with the increasingly digital culture -- in danger of becoming expensive anachronisms?
 After all, it is only logical that as people feel more empowered based on their access to information and their ability to connect without help, they are at least questioning the wisdom of the conventional way of buying and selling a home.
 According to the National Association of Realtors, the percentage of homes sold nationally by their owners has actually declined, from 14 percent in 2004 to 11 percent in 2009. But Real Trends, a company that monitors the residential brokerage industry, considers those findings to be low, and estimates that the number of for-sale-by-owner, or FSBO, homes was almost one in five three years ago, when it stopped tracking them.
 ''I've been in this business for 33 years and I've always wondered why more people didn't say, 'I'm going to take a shot at this myself,' '' said Steve Murray, the editor of Real Trends' reports. ''Now, with the technology available, that would seem to be inevitable. We tracked FSBO numbers through 2006 -- before the market collapsed -- and we were already seeing substantial differences between the attitudes and habits of people under 35 and those over 50.''
 Younger people, he said, are far more likely to embrace the multitasking and risk taking involved in selling their own homes. If the decision to use an agent is becoming generational as well as situational, that would not augur well for real estate agents. 
 ''This is going to sound bad, but I just don't give a lot of credence to what brokers do,'' said Cynthia LeStar, who is selling her studio apartment on the Upper East Side. ''I mean, what do they do that I can't do on my own?''
 Ms. LeStar, 30, moved to New York from Cincinnati on Sept. 9, 2001, and was on a PATH train to the World Trade Center station from Hoboken for an interview with JPMorgan on the morning of Sept. 11. Despite her parents' pleas to come home, she took the job and, after a few years, decided to buy instead of rent. But she was laid off last spring, and recently concluded that she could no longer carry her studio while changing careers -- to acting. 
 Ms. LeStar consulted streeteasy.com for comparable neighborhood sales and settled on an asking price of $444,000. She placed an ad on craigslist.com and expanded her search for buyers by gaining access to ASmallWorld, a private international online community that she likened to a celebrity Facebook. Marketing her apartment has cost her nothing.
 Ms. LeStar's background in finance made her comfortable in representing herself. ''Even when I was buying, I would have preferred cutting out the middleman,'' she said. ''I felt out of the loop. I love negotiating.'' 
 Like Ms. LeStar, Ms. Corvino, 35, was undaunted by the prospect of catering to potential buyers. She says that she has not seen any appreciable difference in the amount of traffic now that she is in charge. 
 Ms. Corvino bought the house hoping to turn it into a bed-and-breakfast. But when the economy tanked, she needed the income from renting all four units.
 ''Selling in this market is difficult, because it takes a special person to buy a large home like this one,'' she said. ''Not to mention that right now it's a rental property.''
 To appear more businesslike, she hired a graphic artist to produce a sign that ''didn't look like those chintzy red ones that say For Sale By Owner.''
 Ms. Corvino also created a Web site for the 4,600-square-foot house, 46Voorhis.com, where she posted 43 color photos taken by a professional photographer. She placed ads at craigslist.com and loopnet.com, a commercial real estate site. A sales manager for a wine wholesaler and importer, Ms. Corvino monitors responses via her mobile phone and has been able to break away from her job to show the house. 
 Factoring in the minimal cost of open houses, she estimates that she has spent $1,000 thus far, a far cry from the $40,000 to $50,000 broker's fee that she would have to pay if she sold for near her asking price.
 ''I think if you go about it the right way, you don't need an agent,'' Ms. Corvino said. ''But that's if you can take all the calls, answer all the e-mails and be at the house at 3 o'clock in the afternoon.''
 Next door, Mr. Hall said he and his wife, who works in the Nyack school district, do not have the time, inclination or technical expertise to sell their own house. 
 ''I wouldn't call myself Internet savvy,'' said Mr. Hall, 55. ''I don't have an iPhone. I wouldn't know what avenues to use. I also think the personal touch is important, though the younger generation probably feels that Facebook is a human relationship.''
 When the Halls decided to sell their house last July, there was no question that they would list it with Suzanne Blaisdell Grant of Wright Bros. Real Estate in Nyack. Mr. Hall has served on town boards with Mrs. Grant's husband and considers them old friends. 
 Mrs. Grant cited her longstanding relationship with the Halls as a prime example of why real estate brokers are not endangered and why what they do cannot be compared to selling a stock or booking a vacation.
 ''I can understand why people would say, 'Why would I pay someone to sell my house? It's a lovely house. I'll just put a sign out,' '' Mrs. Grant said. 
 ''But it's so much more than that, much more than selling a stock or buying a car on Craigslist. It's being honest with the seller in staging the house, getting it ready. It's giving the seller distance, because people who are emotionally involved in a purchase or sale of something as big and life-shaping as a home aren't necessarily in the best position to be objective.''
 Jennifer Juergens of Manhattan and her four brothers and two sisters came to that conclusion after their mother died in 2007 and they put her Tudor-style house in Larchmont up for sale.
 ''It needed some work, but the market at the time was strong and Larchmont is a very desirable town,'' said Ms. Juergens, 48, a former magazine editor who now works in public relations. ''My brother said he thought we didn't need a broker, we could sell it by ourselves. So we put an ad on Craigslist and listed it for $1 million. The first guy that came to see it with his wife, before it was even cleaned up, told my brother John, 'Oh, we love it; we'll give you $1 million.'
 ''But,'' Ms. Juergens continued, ''he also wanted his father to see it. The dad came over and said, 'We're going to start with the asking price and work our way down.' They went room to room and he kept saying, 'Well, this needs replacing, this is old, this isn't good.' Everything negative. This was the house we'd grown up in. Our mother had just died. Emotions were high. My brother got so upset he just asked them to leave.''
 Now supporting Mrs. Grant's contention that there is no better buffer than a broker, the family hired Keller Williams Realty of Scarsdale and embarked upon a cleanup plan. The house is listed at $899,000. 
 Linda West Eckhardt, an author of cookbooks, has her Dutch colonial in Maplewood, N.J., on the market for $345,000. She has sold homes in Texas, Oregon and California, and is firmly in the get-an-agent camp -- with a caveat. 
 Having worked with agents who were ''indifferent, incompetent and otherwise disappointing,'' she said, ''I feel about real estate agents the way I feel about literary agents -- those areas are filled with peril.'' But, she added, ''I believe they'll get you more than enough to make up for their fee.''
 So Ms. West Eckhardt's advice is to ''interview, interview, interview'' brokers. But this time around, serendipity played a role in her selection. At a party in Maplewood, she met Joanne Douds, who works for Sotheby's International Realty in Fort Lee, N.J. 
 ''She says the hard things to me, like 'Your house smells like dogs,' '' Ms. West Eckhardt said. ''On the day of the open house, she walked in with her makeup and eyelashes six inches in front of her face and Prada shoes, took one look at what I considered neat and clean, rolled up her sleeves and said, 'Get me the vacuum cleaner.' ''
 Ms. West Eckhardt said that at 70, she is more eager to churn out several more books than to spend time extolling the Maplewood-South Orange school district to a trail of bright-eyed couples. 
 But as Ms. LeStar has discovered while showing her Upper East Side studio, there is not that much extolling to do. ''The buyers walk in and they know as much about the apartment as you do,'' she said. 
 Technology has made it much easier for people to educate themselves, a trend that agents have had to acknowledge and adjust to. 
 ''It's not like it was 10 years ago, where you might show someone eight houses in a day,'' said Russ Woolley, the president of Wright Bros. Real Estate. ''They have already been online and know what they like and don't like. They may have seen 20 pictures of one house.'' Potential buyers, he said, now arrive with specific houses in mind. 
 Dan Murray, a firefighter in the South Bronx, is hedging his bets and working both ends of the real estate equation. 
 To market their three-bedroom condominium in Riverdale, Mr. Murray and his wife, Diana, placed ads online and paid a one-time fee of $300 to forsalebyowner.com, which placed the property with the Westchester-Putnam Multiple Listings Service. 
 Mr. Murray, 40, is prepared to pay the agent who delivers a buyer 2 percent of the selling price, substantially less than the standard industry fee of 5 percent to 6 percent.
 Meanwhile, in his search for a new home in northern Westchester County, he is using Google maps and satellite photos, while scouring the same sites he is advertising on for a FSBO.
 ''I would think anyone who is comfortable with the Internet would prefer to do it this way,'' Mr. Murray said. ''Eventually, who won't be?''

HEADLINE: Convenience and Value Top the Assets List

BYLINE: By DAVE CALDWELL

 BODY:
EVERY day, thousands of motorists tear through Union Township, using Interstate 78, Route 22 or the Garden State Parkway, to get someplace else, fast. 
 Then there are people like Al and JoAnn Cernadas, who are having a hard time leaving.
 Seven years ago, Mr. Cernadas, the first assistant prosecutor for Union County, and his wife paid $235,000 for a three-bedroom split-level house built in 1960 on a quiet street in the Battle Hill neighborhood. They poured in another $175,000. 
 ''We remodeled the whole thing and gutted it to the studs,'' Mrs. Cernadas said.
 Mr. Cernadas was born and raised in the township and graduated from Union High School, and both dearly wanted to stay. But because of an illness in the family, they have spent the last year weighing whether to move away. They first put their house on the market last year, receiving two offers within a month but turning both down. 
 Now they have definitively made the decision to leave, and the house, which has a renovated kitchen, has been listed at $574,900. They will miss an old-fashioned downtown that still plays host to an annual St. Patrick's Day parade; they will also miss Union's convenience. 
 ''I have a bittersweet feeling,'' Mr. Cernadas said. ''It is so centrally located. It's all there, in this one town. You don't have to go anywhere else.''
 About 57,000 people -- 58 percent white, 27 percent black -- live in Union, a nine-square-mile oblong that is home to Kean University, and not to be confused with Union, Hunterdon County; Union City, Hudson County; or Union Beach, Monmouth County.
 The population is socioeconomically diverse, but becoming more white-collar. About the time the Cernadases moved into their house in 2002, a New Jersey Transit station on the Raritan Valley Line opened near the Kean main campus, on the eastern edge of town.
 Now commuters must change trains at Pennsylvania Station in Newark for the ride into New York. But a new tunnel will provide direct service to New York by 2016.
 Frank Bradley, the township administrator, projects an increase in housing stock. ''We see that as a great economic stimulus,'' Mr. Bradley said.
 A year ago, Money magazine ranked Union as the 75th-best small city in America to live. Many of its residents tend to stay, and many natives, like Mr. Cernadas, move away and come back.
 One selling point is that houses are generally less expensive than in such surrounding towns as Maplewood, Springfield and Millburn.
 Constance Hellhake, an agent with Re/Max Properties, based in Summit, said of a house in Union that ''if it would be anywhere else but Union, it would be $100,000 higher.'' Even tax bills tend to be lower than those in nearby counties like Essex. That said, however, Union Township neighborhoods are somewhat less pristine than those in nearby towns, which brokers say accounts for the price differential. 
 Michelle Pais, a Union native who is an agent for Coldwell Banker, put it this way: ''Union is a lot more affordable, and with the economy being what it is, you can buy more house for your money. And a lot of these residents have been here for years. It's not a town that has constantly turned over.'' 
 WHAT YOU'LL FIND
 Union Township is less than 20 miles west of Lower Manhattan. Interstate 78, wide and usually fast, and Route 22, a six-lane thoroughfare that includes almost every chain store imaginable, run east and west and divide the township roughly into thirds. The Garden State Parkway runs north-south through the eastern end.
 To the north of I-78 is the Union neighborhood of Vauxhall, which abuts Maplewood and Essex County. The main drag through Union is Route 82, Morris Avenue, which connects Springfield and points west to Elizabeth in the east.
 Morris Avenue is lined with an eclectic Jersey mix of diners, lumberyards, supermarkets and gas stations until it enters Union Center, the downtown area. Here, Morris Avenue divides -- the sidewalk is lined with flagpoles, each carrying an American flag -- and to the right looms Town Hall, a colonial brick building with white columns.
 Union Center is the site of a venerable old bank, as well as shops, pubs and restaurants, dominated by Italian but with options like Filipino. There are also a few vacant storefronts. And some residential streets are named to honor those who served in the military, Connecticut Farms Presbyterian Church, a stone building, is just south of the downtown area.
 Rows of wood-frame and split-level houses stand close together on small lots with sidewalks; the general effect is tidy. ''It's extremely quiet,'' Mrs. Cernadas said. ''And I am so going to miss the convenience here.'' 
 WHAT YOU'LL PAY
 A recent look at the Garden State Municipal Listing Service (gsmls.com) showed 256 residential properties for sale, ranging from a one-bedroom condominium available through an estate sale for $114,900, to a two-year-old five-bedroom brick colonial for $695,000. The annual tax bill for the latter is $9,719.Nearly half of the properties for sale are listed at $250,000 to $350,000. 
 In September, Doug and Carol Denton, longtime residents of Union, listed Mrs. Denton's mother's three-bedroom one-and-a-half-bath Cape Cod for $275,000. The house in the northeast corner of town, which Mrs. Denton's parents bought new about 50 years ago, sold the next day for $270,000. 
 ''Basically, the people who bought it don't have to do anything but change the paint,'' said Mr. Denton, a former ironworker who works for the township's Department of Public Works.
 According to figures compiled by the township's tax assessor's office, 333 houses sold in Union in 2008 for an average of $312,000. In 2007, 474 houses sold in Union for an average of $350,000.
 According to Trulia.com, a real estate search site, the median sale price in Union Township between September and November was $294,900, or 1.7 percent lower than the median price during the corresponding period in 2008.
 THE SCHOOLS
 The system has five schools for prekindergarten through Grade 4, with the Jefferson School for Grade 5. Burnet and Kawameeh Middle Schools are for Grades 6, 7 and 8; Union High School has about 2,500 students enrolled in Grades 9 through 12.
 SAT averages last year were 463 in math, 450 in reading and 444 in writing, versus 514, 492 and 494 statewide. The class of 2008 had a 98.4 percent graduation rate, versus 92.8 percent statewide.
 WHAT TO DO
 Route 22 has plenty of chains, both for shopping and dining. In fact, name a fast-food or restaurant chain, and it is probably on 22. The high-end Mall at Short Hillsis about a 15-minute drive from the western edge. Many residents take advantage of Union's proximity to New York on the weekends. 
 At the eastern end is Kean University, a public institution with an undergraduate enrollment of about 11,000, and Liberty Hall Museum, which was built in 1772 as the home of William Livingston, New Jersey's first elected governor. The museum holds letters written by Thomas Jefferson and two centuries' worth of other artifacts.
 There are a number of parks. Between the Kean campus and the city of Elizabeth is Phil Rizzuto Park, a small county-run area named after the former Yankees shortstop. The private Suburban Golf Club, with a course dating to 1922, is in the middle of town.
 Mr. Bradley says 900 children take part in the youth soccer program. There are also recreational programs for football, basketball and softball. Union High School, whose teams are known as the Farmers, is traditionally good in sports.
 THE COMMUTE
 The station, on the New Jersey Transit Raritan Valley line, links New York-bound commuters to a transfer point at Newark's Penn Station. A monthly pass is $154. Eight trains make the 38- to 47-minute total trip to New York on weekdays from 5 to 9 a.m., and eight trains go to Union from 4 to 8 p.m.
 There are two permit parking lots near the train station, providing a total of about 450 spaces, with no waiting list. The fee is $180 for three months.
 Additionally, New Jersey Transit operates the No. 114 bus line from a stop at Morris and Stuyvesant Avenues to the Port Authority in Midtown. There are 22 buses between 5 and 9 a.m. that make only one other stop before going to New York. One-way trips take about 35 minutes; a monthly pass is $146.
 THE HISTORY
 In 1961, a Newark group called the Four Lovers failed an audition at a cocktail lounge at a bowling alley in Union. The group decided to adopt the name of the bowling alley: the Four Seasons.
 Led by Frankie Valli, the Four Seasons were inducted into the Rock 'n' Roll Hall of Fame in 1990 and inspired the Broadway play ''Jersey Boys.'' In 2008, West Chestnut Street was renamed Four Seasons Lane. The bowling alley has been torn down and is now a Costco parking lot.

HEADLINE: Show Us the E-Mail

BYLINE: By ELIOT SPITZER, FRANK PARTNOY and WILLIAM BLACK. 
Eliot Spitzer is a former attorney general and governor of New York. Frank Partnoy is a professor of law at the University of San Diego. William Black is a professor of economics and law at the University of Missouri-Kansas City.

 BODY:
WE end this extraordinary financial year with news that the Treasury is in discussions with American International Group about selling the taxpayers' 80 percent ownership stake in that company. The government recently permitted several banks to break free of its potential oversight by repaying loans made during the rescue. But with respect to A.I.G., the Treasury should not move so fast. There is one job left to do.
 A.I.G. was at the center of the web of bad business judgments, opaque financial derivatives, failed economics and questionable political relationships that set off the economic cataclysm of the past two years. When A.I.G.'s financial products division collapsed -- ultimately requiring a federal bailout of $180 billion -- those who had been prospering from A.I.G.'s schemes scurried for taxpayer cover. Yet, more than a year after the rescue began, crucial questions remain unanswered. Who knew what, and when? Who benefited, and by exactly how much? Would A.I.G.'s counterparties have failed without taxpayer support? 
 The three of us, as experienced investigators and prosecutors of financial fraud, cannot answer these questions now. But we know where the answers are. They are in the trove of e-mail messages still backed up on A.I.G. servers, as well as in the key internal accounting documents and financial models generated by A.I.G. during the past decade. Before releasing its regulatory clutches, the government should insist that the company immediately make these materials public. By putting the evidence online, the government could establish a new form of ''open source'' investigation.
 Once the documents are available for everyone to inspect, a thousand journalistic flowers can bloom, as reporters, victims and angry citizens have a chance to piece together the story. In past cases of financial fraud -- from the complex swaps that Bankers Trust sold to Procter & Gamble in the early 1990s to the I.P.O. kickback schemes of the late 1990s to the fall of Enron -- e-mail messages and internal documents became the central exhibits in our collective understanding of what happened, and why. 
 So far, prosecutors and regulators have been unable to build such evidence into anything resembling a persuasive case against any financial institution. Most recently, a jury acquitted Bear Stearns employees of fraud related to the collapse of the subprime mortgage market, in part because available e-mail messages suggested the employees had done nothing wrong.
 Perhaps A.I.G.'s employees would also be judged not guilty. But we would like to see the record to find out. As fraud investigators, we would like to examine the trading patterns of A.I.G.'s financial products division, and its communications with Goldman Sachs and other bank counterparties who benefited from the bailout. We would like to understand whether the leaders of A.I.G. understood that they were approaching a financial Armageddon, and whether they alerted their counterparties, regulators and shareholders to the impending calamity. 
 We would like to see how A.I.G. was able to pay huge bonuses to its officers based on the short-term income they received from counterparties for selling guarantees that, lacking adequate loss reserves, the companies would never be able to honor. We would also like to know what regulators knew, and what they did with the information they had obtained.
 Congress wants answers, too. This month, during hearings on Ben Bernanke's nomination to a second term as chairman of the Federal Reserve, several senators fumed about being denied access to his A.I.G.-related documents. 
 No doubt, some of the e-mail messages contain privileged conversations among lawyers. Others probably include private information that is irrelevant to A.I.G.'s role in the crisis. But the vast majority of these documents could be made public without legal concern. So why haven't the Treasury and the Federal Reserve already made sure the public could see this information? Do they want to protect A.I.G., or do they worry about shining too much sunlight on their own performance leading up to and during the crisis?
 A.I.G.'s board of directors, a distinguished group of senior business executives, holds the power to decide whether to publish the e-mail messages and other documents. But those directors serve at the behest of A.I.G.'s shareholders. And while small shareholders of public corporations generally do not have the right to force publication of internal documents, in this case one shareholder -- the taxpayer -- holds an 80 percent stake. Anyone with such substantial ownership has effective control over corporate decisions, even if the corporation is a large public one. 
 Our stake is held by something called the A.I.G. Credit Facility Trust, whose three trustees are Jill M. Considine, a former chairman of the Depository Trust Company and a former director of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York; Chester B. Feldberg, a former New York Fed official who was chairman of Barclays Americas from 2000 to 2008; and Douglas L. Foshee, chief executive of the El Paso Corporation and chairman of the Houston branch of the Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas. 
 Ultimately, these three trustees wield all the power at A.I.G., and have the right to vote out the 11 directors if the directors are unwilling to publish the e-mail messages. In other words, if these three people ask A.I.G.'s board to post the messages and other documents, the board will have no choice but to comply. Ms. Considine, Mr. Feldberg and Mr. Foshee have the opportunity to be among the most effective and influential investor advocates in history. Before A.I.G. escapes, they should demand the evidence. 
 The longer it remains hidden, the less likely we will be to answer many questions about the A.I.G. collapse and the larger economic crisis -- including the most important one: how do we prevent a repeat? Time is the enemy of effective investigation; records disappear, memories fade. The documents should be released -- without excuses, or delay.

HEADLINE: Steal These Books

BYLINE: By MARGO RABB. 
Margo Rabb is the author of ''Cures for Heartbreak.'' Her new novel, ''Mad, Mad Love,'' will be published in 2011.

 BODY:
Like many teenagers, I went through a brief shoplifting phase, pilfering a Maybelline Kissing Potion, a pack of Adams Sour Apple Gum and, as my final heist, a Toffifay candy bar. But I never would've considered stealing a book. Books, I believed, were sacred.
 Apparently, not everyone shares this idea. With the recession, shoplifting is on the rise, according to booksellers. At BookPeople in Austin, Tex., the rate of theft has increased to approximately one book per hour. I asked Steve Bercu, BookPeople's owner, what the most frequently stolen title was.
 ''The Bible,'' he said, without pausing.
 Apparently the thieves have not yet read the ''Thou shalt not steal'' part -- or maybe they believe that Bibles don't need to be paid for. ''Some people think the word of God should be free,'' Bercu said. As it turns out, Bibles are snatched even at the Parable Christian Store in Springfield, Ore., the manager told me, despite the fact that if a person asks for a Bible, they'll be given a copy without charge. 
 But this holiday season, the Good Book is hardly the only title in danger of being filched. At independent bookstores, thieves are as likely to be taking orders from Abbie Hoffman's ''Steal This Book'' as from Exodus.
 Fiction is the most commonly poached genre at St. Mark's Bookshop in the East Village of Manhattan; the titles that continually disappear are moved to the X-Case, safely ensconced behind the counter. This library of temptation includes books by Martin Amis, Charles Bukowski, William S. Burroughs, Raymond Carver, Don DeLillo and Jack Kerouac, among others. Sometimes the staff isn't sure whether an author is still popular to swipe until they return their books to the main floor. ''Amis went out and came right back,'' Michael Russo, the manager, told me.
 At BookPeople in Austin, titles displayed with staff recommendation cards are a darling among thieves. ''It's so bad lately that I feel like our staff recommendation cards should read: 'BookPeople Bookseller recommends that you steal ----------------.' Apparently the criminal element in Austin shares our literary tastes, or are very prone to suggestion,'' Elizabeth Jordan, the head book buyer, wrote in an e-mail message.
 As it turns out, the list of most-purloined fiction authors at many stores resembles the contents of the X-Case; it's a list that is predominantly -- and often exclusively -- male. Why are thieves shunning the distaff?
 ''It's mostly younger men stealing the books,'' Zack Zook, the general manager of BookCourt in Brooklyn, suggested. ''They think it's an existential rite of passage to steal their homeboy.''
 Neil Strandberg, the manager of operations at the Tattered Cover in Denver seconded this bit of reader profiling. ''Our arrest record is very male,'' he said.
 There is a certain hip factor to stealing a book, said Mark Z. Danielewski, whose novel ''House of Leaves'' is commonly shoplifted at Vroman's Bookstore in Pasadena, Calif., according to Allison Hill, the store's president and chief operating officer. ''In 'The Savage Detectives,' Roberto Bolano writes about visiting various bookstores and stealing books,'' Danielewski said. ''I never stole a book, though. I always found there was a pleasure, weirdly enough, in saving for and paying for something.''
 Some authors don't share that pleasure, however. At Boulder Book Store in Boulder, Colo., one writer was even busted stealing his own books. Christopher Ohman, who was a manager at the time, said: ''I think he felt somewhat entitled to the copies. In some ways I can kind of understand that logic. I mean, it's a commonly held misconception that authors get as many copies of their books as they want, and that's not always the case.'' (Ohman conceded that the author's alcohol problem may also have had something to do with it.)
 Although there's no hard statistical evidence on most-stolen titles, The Telegraph of London reported last year that Jeffrey Eugenides's novel ''The Virgin Suicides'' was said to be ''the most shoplifted book of modern times.'' Eugenides had heard this for many years. ''I just assumed that the book appealed to the young and sticky-fingered to a certain extent,'' he told me, with some amusement. Years ago, Eugenides was at a literary conference with Paul Auster, another top choice among literary thieves. ''Paul and I argued about whose book was stolen more,'' Eugenides said. ''He claimed he was stolen a lot, I claimed I was stolen a lot. Back and forth. It was one of those deep intellectual conversations.''
 Were there fisticuffs?
 ''No, no,'' he said. ''We had no way of adjudicating the argument. That was the problem.''
 Auster, for his part, isn't sure why his books are popular to steal. ''It could be that my work appeals to the criminal element,'' he told me. ''When I was young many of my friends stole books from bookstores. They'd wear trench coats with lots of pockets, and they'd jam them in like Harpo Marx. Of course they didn't understand that these stores were important resources.'' He lamented the demise of Bookforum, formerly located near Columbia University. ''I'm just so worried about bookstores in general right now. I don't want any more of them to fold up.''
 Books are not the only items disappearing from stores. Allison Hill of Vroman's in Pasadena recalled the time someone tried to take a security camera. Ohman, the former manager at Boulder Book Store, remembered full-size framed art prints mysteriously vanishing from the bathroom walls. ''There's nothing in here that no one's tried to steal,'' said Bercu of Austin's BookPeople. ''Plants, chairs, lights -- if you can touch it, someone will steal it, or attempt to.'' 
 E-books open up a whole other arena for thievery. Neil De Young, the director of digital media at Hachette Book Group, the publisher of ''Twilight,'' said digital piracy is a ''constant problem.'' Many publishers and authors fear that piracy, and the general transition from print to digital media, will cause irreparable harm to the book industry, as it has in the music world. The writer Sherman Alexie, who has refused to make his fiction available in digital form, agrees. ''The open source culture is coming for us,'' he told me, ''and there's nothing we can do to stop it.''
 John Palfrey, a co-director of the Berkman Center for Internet and Society at Harvard University and the author of ''Born Digital,'' is more optimistic. ''The way young people enjoy music is very different from the way they enjoy books, and I don't think that we'll see the same pattern of piracy emerge that we've seen in the music industry -- at least not in the near future,'' he said.
 But this doesn't mean that every reader is contributing to the bottom line. Only 40 percent of books that are read are paid for, and only 28 percent are purchased new, said Peter Hildick-Smith of the Codex Group, a consultant to the publishing industry. The rest are shared, borrowed, given away -- or stolen.
 I asked Eugenides what book he would steal if he had no money. ''If I was down to my last cent I could see stealing the Bible . . . or a Martin Amis book.''
 Which one would he choose?
 He laughed. ''Amis,'' he said.

HEADLINE: The Last Decision

BYLINE: By DARSHAK SANGHAVI. 
Darshak Sanghavi, the chief of pediatric cardiology at the University of Massachusetts Medical School, is Slate's health care columnist and the author of ''A Map of the Child: A Pediatrician's Tour of the Body.''

 BODY:
Robin Beaulieu was telling me about her daughter's bike accident. It was an event that would force Beaulieu not only to confront the death of her child but also to embrace a new way of dying. We were sitting last spring in the kitchen of her small apartment in Manchester, N.H. Beaulieu took a drag on a Marlboro, poured a cup of coffee and told me that her daughter, Amanda Panzini, had been a rambunctious, bighearted teenager. She loved animals, even ''flea-ridden, mangy dogs,'' Beaulieu said, and was a fiercely loyal friend. When confronted by the possibility of donating her brain-injured daughter's organs after the accident, Beaulieu never doubted that Amanda would have wanted them to go to someone who needed them. But Amanda first had to be declared dead, and in her case, the only way that could happen was if her parents chose a precisely choreographed death -- one conducted by medical personnel in a hospital procedure meant to allow Amanda to die while preserving her organs. From this, the doctors and Beaulieu hoped, would come new life. 
 The last time Beaulieu talked to her daughter was on the morning of June 21, 2008, a Saturday. Amanda attended an eighth-grade dance the night before; she told her mother that she had her first kiss there. After Beaulieu left for work at a nearby minimart, Amanda decided to ride her bike a few blocks to her friend Kate's house. She didn't take her helmet. At the crossing of Taylor and Young Streets, a Ford F-150 pickup truck slammed into Amanda and threw her into the street. When the paramedics arrived, Amanda wasn't breathing. They inserted a tube into her windpipe and rushed her to Elliot Hospital nearby. Beaulieu received an emergency call at the minimart; the paramedics had identified Amanda by the name engraved on her iPod.
 The rest of the afternoon passed in a harrowing blur. Beaulieu remembers a concerned doctor trying to prepare her to see Amanda. She remembers seeing her child's swollen face in the emergency room and then being loaded with her onto a trauma helicopter for transport to Children's Hospital in Boston. Though the lighted monitors showed stable vital signs, Beaulieu sensed, as she hovered in the sky, that her child had died. Doctors in Boston performed emergency neurosurgery to decompress her skull, but it was not successful. Amanda was then admitted to an intensive-care unit and put on life support. Monica Kleinman, the clinical director of the unit, examined Amanda the next morning. The girl's cerebral cortex -- the part of the brain where desires, fears and hopes are created -- was irreversibly damaged. In her 20 years of practice (I worked with her as a pediatrics resident years ago), Kleinman has treated dozens of similar injuries. Few of these patients ever left the hospital; those who did were in vegetative or otherwise neurologically devastated states. 
 Beaulieu, Kleinman recalls, digested the news and ''immediately got it.'' Amanda was never coming back. Beaulieu decided to take her off the ventilator and asked to donate her daughter's organs. But there was an obstacle. When Kleinman examined Amanda, she noticed that some primitive and reflexive neurons of the brainstem were still working. Amanda gagged a bit when the back of her throat was tickled, and one of her pupils budged slightly when a flashlight was shined on it. The significance of this information was immediately apparent to Kleinman: Amanda was not brain-dead.
 Organ transplantation must abide by the so-called dead-donor rule: a person has to be declared dead before any vital organs can be removed. Yet organs have to be alive if there is any hope of successful transfer to a recipient. Medical professionals have handled this paradoxical situation -- finding a dead body with live organs -- by fashioning a category of people with beating hearts who are said to be brain-dead, usually after a traumatic head injury, and who are considered just as dead as if they had rigor mortis.
 To diagnose brain death, doctors typically go through a checklist of about a dozen items, including assessing reflexes like blinking, coughing and breathing, which are all controlled by the brainstem. The criteria are extremely strict, and only a tiny fraction of severely brain-injured people meet them. Kleinman realized that Amanda, despite her severe brain damage, was not one of them. There was, Kleinman told Beaulieu, another option -- one that was still controversial and had never been pursued successfully at Children's Hospital. The procedure was called donation after cardiac death, or D.C.D., and it would exploit the other way the law defines death: as the ''irreversible cessation'' of the heartbeat. 
 D.C.D. requires doctors to confront the shadowy question of exactly when somebody dies after the heart stops. To authorize D.C.D., doctors must follow a strict procedure. Amanda would be taken, technically alive, to an operating room, where her breathing tube would be removed. If her breathing ceased naturally and her heart stopped quickly (within an hour), she would be moved to an adjacent operating room and Kleinman would count off precisely five minutes, during which time Amanda would be prepped for surgery with antiseptics and surgical drapes, while Kleinman carefully watched for signs of a returning heartbeat. If there were none, Amanda would be declared legally dead; the stoppage would then be considered ''irreversible.'' Before her organs were seriously damaged by the lack of oxygen (every minute counts), the surgeons would rapidly open Amanda's torso and remove them for transplant. 
 There was a chance none of this would work. If the comatose girl didn't stop breathing in the operating room, she would be returned to the intensive-care unit, though not put back on life support. Once taken off the ventilator Amanda would most likely die, but it might take hours or days, during which time her organs would deteriorate and would be unfit for transplantation.
 Four days after Amanda's accident, Beaulieu and Amanda's father, Dan Panzini, sat in a darkened operating room and said their goodbyes as Amanda was disconnected from her ventilator. To Beaulieu's relief, she didn't breathe on her own, and her heart gradually slowed. ''Amanda's heart has stopped,'' Kleinman soon said. Amanda's heart never started again, and the surgeons took her liver, kidneys and pancreas.
 In procuring organs from patients like Amanda, doctors have created a new class of potential organ donors who are not dead but dying. By arbitrarily drawing a line between death and life -- five minutes after the heart stops -- they have raised difficult ethical questions. Are they merely acknowledging death or hastening it in their zeal to save others' lives? 
 With modern technology like respirators and tube feedings with synthetic formulas, Beaulieu might have kept her unconscious, brain-damaged child alive indefinitely. But as she sipped coffee in her apartment from a mug reading ''#1 Mom,'' Beaulieu told me that if Amanda had lived, she could ''never bike, rollerblade or go out with friends, and she'd never want that.'' If people with no hope for meaningful recovery can be kept alive artificially, shouldn't they also be permitted to die artificially?
 Since the inception of organ transplantation a half-century ago, defining death has taken on both medical and ethical urgency. Before Joseph Murray performed the world's first successful kidney transplant in 1954 and showed that organs could be put to productive use outside their original host, doctors waited until the deceased was blue and stiff to declare death. Identifying a precise moment of death was a diversion for eccentric researchers like Duncan MacDougall, who, in the early 1900s, placed dying patients on a scale in order to determine when death occurred: the moment they lost three-quarters of an ounce, the presumed weight of the soul. 
 The paradox of needing a dead donor with a live body was first addressed in 1968. Henry Beecher, a Harvard anesthesiologist and medical ethicist, convened a 13-member committee to write a definition of ''irreversible coma,'' or brain death, for The Journal of the American Medical Association. Not everyone accepted the four-page report's conclusions. After Norman Shumway, a Stanford University surgeon, performed the first American heart transplant from a brain-dead donor, he was threatened with prosecution by the Santa Clara County coroner. As a result of the widespread disagreement over the meaning of ''brain death,'' President Jimmy Carter asked a blue-ribbon commission to examine the issue. The commission culminated in the Uniform Determination of Death Act in 1981, which defined death as ''irreversible cessation of all functions of the entire brain, including the brainstem.'' The procedure to diagnose brain death, however, was never codified into law, and as a result, it varies from hospital to hospital. In 1987, the nation's pediatrics authorities tried to standardize the diagnosis, listing 14 different criteria to confirm brain death, like the absence of reflexes, and requiring, under certain conditions, additional X-rays and tests for brain-wave activity. Last year, in the journal Pediatrics, researchers from Loma Linda University reported that of 277 brain-dead children in California who were referred to the regional organ bank over many years, only a single child received the full set of diagnostic tests. 
 In 2008, a young Oklahoman named Zack Dunlap was declared brain-dead after an all-terrain-vehicle accident and was considered for organ donation. Then, suddenly, he recovered. He later appeared on NBC's ''Today'' show. The precise medical details of the case are not public, but it is possible that a diagnostic error was made because a checklist was not followed. Dr. Wiley Hall, the director of neurocritical care at the University of Massachusetts Medical School, where I am the chief of pediatric cardiology, told me about a similar case last year in Massachusetts; it turned out that a brain scan had been performed improperly.
 Such sloppiness is potentially tragic, but it is also exceedingly rare. Whether or not a checklist is followed, by the time a neurologist is consulted to assess a critically ill patient for brain death, the odds of recovery are already minuscule. Doctors see that these patients have begun dying, and the uncertainty is not about whether it will happen but when. The families of dying patients often realize this, too, and ask to donate their relative's organs. Dr. Robert Truog, a professor of medical ethics at Harvard Medical School, says he believes this is a situation where ''all the ethical vectors are lined up,'' since the patient's family, the doctors and the recipient's family all want to proceed with organ donation. The holdup is that the patient is not legally dead.
 The current shortage of organs gives urgency to any new avenue for donation. The United Network for Organ Sharing, a nonprofit, coordinates the nation's system of organ transplantation. Its Web site maintains a continuously updated count of people waiting for transplants. As of early this month, 105,172 men, women and children were in line. On an average day, the organization estimates, 18 people on the list die because they don't receive an organ in time. Despite widespread campaigns to encourage donation, availability has changed only modestly over the past decade -- last year there were fewer than 8,000 deceased donors -- while waiting lists have doubled in size. 
 The small number isn't because of refusal -- to give one example, 85 percent of eligible brain-dead patients' families in central Massachusetts chose to donate last year -- but because of the rarity of brain death. According to Kevin O'Connor, a senior vice president at the New England Organ Bank, improved public-safety laws -- automobile safety belts, bicycle helmets -- along with fewer violent crimes, have meant there simply aren't many people showing up in hospitals with severe head injuries and otherwise healthy bodies. At the University of Massachusetts, 238 people were on a transplant waiting list last year, yet our medical center, a leading source of donated organs in the state, recorded only 19 deceased donors. 
 A lack of organs because of better safety and lives saved is, unquestionably, a good thing. But it means that transplant doctors and patients are forced to think beyond brain-dead donors. The 1981 Uniform Determination of Death Act also defines death as the ''irreversible cessation of circulatory and respiratory functions,'' which left an opening for another source of donors. In 1997, the federal government asked the Institute of Medicine, an independent advisory body, to gather experts to determine how a dying donor might be treated. The experts ended up endorsing the procedure for donation after cardiac death, in which death occurs through a process of withdrawing life support and allowing the heart to develop ''irreversible cessation.'' 
 There were two crucial conditions. First, families could not be pressured to stop life support; they had to come to the decision on their own, in consultation with their relative's doctor. No member of the organ-procurement team could participate in the family's decision or declare death. Second, ''irreversible cessation'' of cardiac function meant that at least five minutes had to pass without a heartbeat. That interval was arbitrary -- the panel of experts made no reference to supporting research -- and they admitted that ''this recommendation is only an expert judgment.'' 
 The Institute of Medicine created a new class of potential organ donors: living patients with little hope of recovery who could be declared dead soon after life-support removal. Within a decade, the number of such donors increased tenfold; they now account for 8 percent of organ transplants nationwide, up to 20 percent in certain areas. Still, many hospitals were slow to adopt the practice. 
 The case of Children's Hospital in Boston is instructive. In 2005, Children's convened a 17-member task force of doctors, lawyers and health care professionals to explore the ethics of allowing D.C.D. After two years of regular meetings, the group was unable to reach a consensus. ''The more we talked about it, the more polarized we became,'' recalls Dr. Peter Laussen, a committee co-chairman. Supporters of D.C.D. argued that the practice was legal and compatible with families' wishes. Those opposed worried that caregivers would see critically ill patients merely as organ donors, and their end-of-life care could be compromised. 
 At a certain point in the committee's debate, members were asked to mark where they stood on D.C.D. on a continuum, with one end signifying ''totally disagree'' and the other ''totally agree.'' The participants almost uniformly chose one extreme or the other. There was no middle ground. And then a few days before Christmas in 2007, an 8-year-old girl named Jaiden Tlapa ended up in the Children's Hospital intensive-care unit.
 The snow was coming down quickly in Milford, N.H., and school had been canceled. Holleigh Tlapa baked cookies for her three children, and then they decided to play outside. There was a path to the yard, and Holleigh got out the snowblower to clear it.
 I visited Tlapa last April. As she started telling me what happened that day, her voice cracked. She got a box of tissues and continued talking. She had started the snowblower and the powder began flying. Then -- she doesn't know exactly what happened -- Jaiden somehow lost her footing and fell into the path of the blower. Instantly, Jaiden was pulled into the powerful machine, and the strings from her hood tangled tightly around her neck. Tlapa couldn't free her daughter no matter how she struggled and pulled. Frantic, she called 911. It seemed like an eternity before the paramedics arrived. It took them several minutes to cut Jaiden free. Placed on a respirator, the comatose child was later taken by ambulance to Children's Hospital in Boston. 
 For a moment on Christmas Eve, Jaiden opened her eyes, but her parents recall that they were ''vacant.'' She never opened them again. The weeks rolled by. Repeated brain scans showed severe brain shrinkage. Despite her devastating cortical injury, however, Jaiden had a few primitive brainstem reflexes that kept her from being classified as brain-dead. ''She looked normal, so you would assume consciousness, but that was misleading,'' Tlapa told me. 
 Over time Holleigh Tlapa and her husband, Paul, realized Jaiden wouldn't get better, and they asked about organ donation. Because she wasn't brain-dead, D.C.D. was the only option. Although the task force at Children's disagreed about D.C.D., the hospital drafted a protocol. The Tlapas were told about the disagreement, but they chose to proceed. On Jan. 13, 2008, a dying but not dead organ donor was brought to the operating room and prepped for withdrawal of support for the first time in the hospital's history. Holleigh and Paul lay in their daughter's bed and played Jaiden's favorite Miley Cyrus song as the breathing tube was removed. They held their daughter and waited.
 There's something remarkable about such families. I've known hundreds of parents whose children are stricken by terrible diseases. For many, the gravity of the situation is so overwhelming that they withdraw into themselves, letting no emotion escape, and then suddenly explode into a supernova of blame and anger. But there are others on whom this terrible pressure exerts a metamorphic power that turns some of their sadness into a compassion that is strong and diamond-brilliant.
 Though her gasps were irregular, Jaiden didn't stop breathing entirely. After an hour her heart hadn't stopped, and, in this situation, the hospital protocol called for the patient to be returned to the intensive-care unit. The chance to donate her organs was over. Jaiden continued to take shallow breaths into the next morning, and then her heart finally stopped. She was legally dead. ''It was so hurtful that she died so soon after,'' Tlapa said, disappointed that Jaiden's organs died with her. Still, she finds solace in knowing that Jaiden at least helped change some attitudes among skeptics and paved the way for the first successful D.C.D. procedure at Children's Hospital -- the one involving Amanda Panzini. (Holleigh also founded a charity to help families facing similar decisions.) 
 Paul has some difficulty understanding why, if Jaiden was going to die anyway, she could not have been put under general anesthesia, undergone surgery to donate her organs, and then been declared dead. Removing the breathing tube to attempt D.C.D. had the same effect, only it took much longer and Jaiden breathed irregularly for many hours, which seemed to Paul more distressing. ''If it was all up to me,'' he explained, ''I would have said, 'Take her organs.' '' 
 As Gary Greenberg wrote in The New Yorker, donating organs in such a manner, deliberately and with anesthesia, could simply be ''a particular way to finish our dying, at the hands of a surgeon, after some uncertain border has been crossed.'' But Francis Delmonico, a professor of surgery at Harvard Medical School and a national leader in organ transplantation, fervently defends the need to establish death before removing organs. ''I understand a family's anguish and inability to have consolation when a child doesn't die after removal of life support,'' he explains, ''but I don't see this as a patients'-rights issue. It's a matter of public trust in the system.'' 
 Donation after cardiac death already arouses suspicion. Just as transplant surgeons like Norman Shumway were once harassed for procuring organs from brain-dead donors, a California-based surgeon, Hootan Roozrokh, was tried for dependent-adult abuse, a felony, after participating in an attempted D.C.D. A nurse who objected to the proceedings later registered a complaint about how painkillers were administered to the patient. Prosecutors charged him with trying to hasten the patient's death. Though none of this held up in court -- Roozrokh was acquitted last year -- the trial left many transplant surgeons shaken. Just think of the outcry, Delmonico cautions, if families and doctors also decided it was acceptable to euthanize patients to procure their organs. ''You would destroy organ donation in this country,'' he said. 
 Delmonico certainly has a point about the importance of maintaining the public's trust, but it's hard to witness an actual D.C.D. procedure without conceding that the process of declaring death in any setting is inherently arbitrary. I saw this myself when I was permitted to observe a D.C.D. procedure at the University of Massachusetts hospital. The patient was a middle-aged woman with no close family ties who had been committed years before to a psychiatric hospital. Found unconscious after choking on French toast, she received CPR and came to the UMass intensive-care unit. She remained comatose with severe brain injury for days but was not brain-dead. Following hospital regulations, the doctors reported an ''impending death'' to the New England Organ Bank, which agreed she would be a suitable donor. (These reports are mandatory, on the theory that they ensure no donation opportunities are missed.) Faced with the grave prognosis from the woman's doctors, her state-appointed guardian consented to donation after cardiac death. 
 The woman was wheeled to the step-down unit next to the operating rooms, prepped for surgery and covered with sterile sheets. With a medical student, a representative from the organ bank and me looking on, a nurse practitioner from the intensive-care unit supervised the removal of the breathing tube at 9:16 p.m. The patient didn't breathe. We gazed intently at the portable monitor at the foot of her bed, which showed her heart's electrical rhythm, oxygen level and blood pressure. By 9:18, her oxygen level fell from 95 percent to 60 percent. By 9:21, the oxygen level fell further to 22 percent, but her heart rate stayed normal at 74 beats per minute. At 9:25, her blood pressure dipped a little, her oxygen level was zero -- which meant her blood was becoming acidic and possibly harming her organs -- but her heart rate was still 62 beats per minute. 
 Watching someone die, observing her heart struggle and ultimately fail over the course of a half-hour, brought home how death occurs in its own way, at its own idiosyncratic pace. There is no escaping the tragedy of the moment. I thought about Jaiden and Amanda, and their stories together with this woman's seemed an endless loop of sorrow. 
 At 9:32, the woman's heart still beat 60 times per minute, though she was blue and unresponsive. At 9:38 her heart rate was 20, and then she flat-lined. Immediately, a stopwatch was started to count the five minutes before death could be declared. 
 The woman was wheeled to the operating room, where the surgeons were assembled. Three minutes passed without any heartbeat, and then four, then four and a half. There was silence. It was the nurse practitioner's sole responsibility to declare death without any interference from the transplant surgeon. Suddenly, there was a single blip on the heart monitor. The blip was almost certainly an artifact of some outside electrical interference and not a true heartbeat, but it was hard to tell for sure. Five minutes had passed, and every delay meant the organs were more starved for oxygen. 
 The nurse practitioner hesitated as she considered whether to call the death or restart the five-minute count, and then she made her decision. She looked at her watch and called out, ''Time of death was 21:44.'' A flurry of activity began as the surgeons called for their instruments and the operating room sprang to life. There was no anesthesiologist at the head of the bed, so I stood there as the team prepared to make the incision. Suddenly, Dr. Adel Bozorgzadeh, the attending transplant surgeon, raised his hands. ''Let us take a moment of silence and consider the gift that is being given on this day,'' he said. A few seconds passed. Then he brought the knife down. 
 Like Amanda Panzini, the teenager hit by the truck, the patient I observed bequeathed several abdominal organs, but not her heart. Although the liver and kidneys are relatively hardy and can withstand the five minutes of oxygen starvation before removal, the wait seriously damages the more delicate heart and renders it unusable. Heart transplants thus call only for brain-dead donors, whose hearts are still beating until just moments before they're removed.
 This, it was thought, was the only way to get a viable heart. But a pediatric cardiologist named Mark Boucek at Denver Children's Hospital was growing tired of watching young children with incurable heart defects die. In 2004, financed by a federal grant, Boucek wrote a far more aggressive D.C.D. protocol that would save the heart, which was adopted after going through the hospital's review process. His version had two key innovations. First, large intravenous lines would be placed in the donor's groin before death, to enable the donor's entire blood volume to be replaced with a refrigerated salt preservative when it was time to remove the heart. Second, and most controversially, Boucek, who has since died from pancreatic cancer, rejected the five-minute rule imposed by the Institute of Medicine and initially picked three minutes instead; after all, no law had codified a particular time period. But David Campbell, the pediatric cardiac surgeon at Denver who procured the first heart using the protocol, realized that even three minutes was too long. ''When we opened the chest and pericardium, the heart was distended and blue,'' he told me. Upon transfer to the recipient, the heart failed to work well initially and required the child to remain on a dangerous heart-lung bypass machine for several days. ''That's why I asked that we move the time down lower,'' Campbell said. In reviewing the medical literature, Boucek found the longest recorded time that a heart had ever stopped and then spontaneously restarted without medical intervention was 65 seconds. If the law required ''irreversible'' cessation of heart function, Boucek concluded, there was no reason to wait much longer than that. 
 Waiting just over a minute after cardiac arrest to declare death was unprecedented. Last year, when the Denver specialists published their provocative case reports in The New England Journal of Medicine, many observers assailed their work and called it a back-door method of performing euthanasia. Robert Veatch, a professor of medical ethics at Georgetown University, calls the Denver doctors ''lone wolves,'' and he categorically rejects heart transplantation using D.C.D. because he maintains that a donor heart cannot have ''irreversible'' cessation. After all, it works fine after it's transplanted. Veatch is especially concerned about a potential public outrcry against organ donation. ''I spent all morning today dealing with conservative right-to-life scholars all worked up about stem cells,'' he told me recently, adding that he could only imagine their reaction to taking hearts from ''helpless little babies.''
 The first baby whose heart was donated under the much-shortened wait period was a newborn girl named Addison Grooms in 2007. Her parents, David and Jill Grooms, have no tolerance for Veatch's viewpoint. Addison's brain was severely damaged in a complication from delivery. ''There was no chance at all that our daughter was going to survive,'' says David, whose brother died of a malformed heart as a baby. ''I can follow the ethicist's argument, but it seems totally ludicrous.'' Had the couple found out another child died because they weren't allowed to donate Addison's heart, it would be ''like another slap in our faces.'' Further, both parents would have permitted simply taking out Addison's heart under complete general anesthesia -- without the intermediate process of the choreographed death -- which would have been a painless way to end their child's life, had it been legal. 
 Three months after Addison's death, a neuroscientist named Lori Driscoll gave birth to a son, Liam, with a catastrophic injury similar to Addison's, and he was also transferred to Denver Children's. Testing showed that almost every part of Liam's brain was destroyed, though some primitive reflexes remained. Lori and her husband consented to Boucek's novel protocol. They accompanied Liam to the operating room, where the breathing tube was removed. They held his hand for 10 minutes until his heart stopped. 
 Moving past a binary concept of life and death is, for most of us, an uncomfortable process. It's worth considering how various cultures think about the beginning of life. Tibetan monks believe a new life begins around the time of a mating couple's orgasm; many Catholics posit that it starts at the union of an egg and sperm; Roe v. Wade effectively established a legal threshold of life at 24 weeks of fetal gestation; some consider meaningful life to begin at birth; the Navajo think a baby is fully human when it laughs for the first time. If the emergence of life occurs on a continuum, perhaps the same is true of life's recession. 
 Still, preserving the notion that the transition from life to death can be clearly defined may be a fundamentally necessary fiction. Though no religious organizations or right-to-life groups have yet mounted any opposition to D.C.D., including the Denver protocol, it is important to change practices in deliberate steps that give decision makers clear rules of action and establish gradual consensus. 
 Lori Driscoll, for one, is grateful for the changes Boucek made to the D.C.D. protocol. After her baby Liam died, she was told that a 3-month-old girl received his heart. That infant was prepped for surgery for her new heart in the room adjacent to the one where Liam died. The surgery went well. Months later, Driscoll learned that recipient was a girl with the uncommon first name Annika. She did some sleuthing and found Annika's mother's MySpace page. The women exchanged photos, arranging to meet last year. Driscoll fantasized about running up to Annika, holding her close and placing her ear over the toddler's chest to again hear her son's steady heartbeat and feel his presence. But something unexpected happened when she met the girl. ''It was the most amazing thing to see her thriving,'' she said, and her initial emotional rush ''had nothing to do with Liam.'' For a moment, the weight of the past was forgotten as Driscoll marveled at the healthy little person before her.

HEADLINE: Time Warps in the Climate Clash

BYLINE: By ANAND GIRIDHARADAS

 BODY:
CAMBRIDGE, Mass. -- Imagine that the climate summit conference in Copenhagen this weekend was not a gathering of nations. Imagine a gathering of delegates from the many ages of a single nation. The fault lines would not be India and China versus the global rich, but rather China 1800 versus China 1978 versus China 2100. It would be a negotiation not between different lands but between different historical facts, different levels of survivalism.
 The Copenhagen meeting is an unimaginably complex negotiation among countries; the difficulties it has faced in reaching for broad approval of a global agreement are hard to overstate. But if the conference were interpreted through a chronological, not geopolitical, lens, those difficulties could perhaps come more into focus -- as a contest between the rival ideas of life and obligation that societies possess at different moments in their modernizing odysseys. Sitting at one side of the negotiating table are Western great powers at the postmodern edge of modernization. Sitting across are developing nations decades, even centuries, behind in affluence, nutrition, literacy and urbanization; striving to catch up, they are less enthusiastic about crimping economic growth to cool a warming planet. 
 But wait. Two developing countries -- India and China -- also possess, by sheer size, great-power status. Never before, perhaps, have there been two nations so powerful in aggregate-income terms that are so poor relative to others at a per-person level. China is the third-richest nation over all, but it is poorer than 132 countries in per-person terms; India is fifth-richest over all, but poorer than 166 others per person.
 Together, that is $11.3 trillion worth of power being steered, if you divide income by population, by a $4,500-a-year mentality. The result is that India and China face enormous pressure to think like the Western great powers of 2009 and, simultaneously, to think like those great powers did 100 years ago, when they were much more focused on economic development and much less interested in global justice.
 On geopolitical issues like climate change, India and China are encouraged to balance their internal duties as developing countries with their external responsibilities as emerging giants. They are told to short-circuit history, to avoid tactics for growth that the West now sees as errors, to assume obligations that rich lands took on only when they became much wealthier.
 At times, they resist this pressure. At times, they warm to it, as seen in China's efforts to reassure the world that its ambitious nuclear-power-plant program meets sophisticated safety standards. And when they sell high-end technology or bid for the Olympics, India and China want their phase of history to be ignored. Then they want simply to ''leapfrog.''
 This pressure to get with the global program -- whether delivered in climate talks or through the subtler cultural pressure of satellite television -- can bring strange results. The leapfrogging dream can tempt countries to engage in kitsch development, to mimic modern ways without building structures to support them.
 If getting with the global program means sacrificing growth for greenness, it involves similarly wrenching tradeoffs in other spheres. In developing countries, a new globalized (and essentially Western) vision of the parent-child relationship is coming, in which the purpose of each generation is to go its own way, leave ancestors to their devices, find one's own truth.
 But the idea can feel borrowed. It comes from places whose structures support it: places with nursing homes, social security, handicapped bathrooms. It arrives in places without that support. So the young agonize about their obligations to the old and the old languish, trapped between an old world that has gone and a new one that hasn't set in. India's leaders try to cope by criminalizing neglect of one's parents.
 Globalized values similarly encourage sexual liberty. Hookup culture comes to societies without the institutions that make it safe and possible elsewhere: accessible contraceptives, regulated abortion clinics, tolerant parents, police officers willing to investigate rape.
 This pressure to be global-modern and yet simultaneously of one's own place is described in stark terms by Seyran Ates, a German-Turkish writer whose recent book is called ''Islam Needs a Sexual Revolution.'' In it she details the way that many young Muslim women, without having overthrown patriarchy, have leapfrogged over it. Many engage in anal sex, she told the German magazine Der Spiegel, to preserve the hymen and, with it, the illusion of virginity.
 Thanks to leapfrogging, global culture is increasingly simultaneous on the surface. But there is a ''lack of simultaneity,'' as Ms. Ates puts it, in the reality underneath.
 This mirage of simultaneity may illuminate the American challenge in Afghanistan. The language American politicians use for their agenda there is the language Americans use for themselves: Afghanistan needs governance, a loyal army, a rooting out of corruption, centralization.
 But critics accuse the Americans of committing a basic psychological error: ''mirror imaging'' -- judging the other guys by where you stand and not by where they stand.
 Critics of such mirror imaging remind us that those who now commend modernity to Afghanistan won it slowly themselves. They enslaved, then emancipated; segregated, then integrated; regulated, then deregulated. They fought their religious and ideological wars, then learned, achingly, not to fight them. What they did not do, those that went first on this journey, was copy the answers from the back of the book.

HEADLINE: A Crystal Ball, With Caveats and Corrections

BYLINE: By JEFF SOMMER

 BODY:
IT has been a wonderful stretch for the stock market, especially if you disregard last winter's steep plunge, to say nothing of the dismal year that preceded it.
 Since the market turned around on March 9, the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index has gained more than 60 percent, making this one of the most powerful rallies on record. But will the current bull market continue long enough for investors to fully repair portfolios that still bear the brunt of earlier carnage?
 Investment professionals have strong opinions on the subject, and very few are entirely upbeat. 
 Doug Ramsey, research director of the Leuthold Group in Minneapolis, for example, is fairly optimistic about the market -- for the short term. His firm sets a target for the S.& P. 500 in the range of 1,300 to 1,350 -- which represents a gain of roughly 20 percent from the current level.
 He says that the market is likely to get there in the next few months -- but that stock prices will have then outstripped earnings, setting up investors for a fall.
 ''The current bull market is a lot older than it looks,'' he said. Sometime in 2010, he said, there is likely to be a correction -- a market decline of more than 10 percent, and probably in the range of 20 or 25 percent.
 ''Buy-and-hold investors may be willing to say, 'No big deal, I can ride a decline of that size out, considering the moves we've had in the last two years,' '' Mr. Ramsey said. Still, he added, ''another decline is going to really hurt'' people who were stung by last year's losses and haven't rebalanced their portfolios.
 This clouded outlook, even from market bulls, is in itself reason for optimism, in the contrarian view of Laszlo Birinyi Jr., president of Birinyi Associates, a stock market research firm in Westport, Conn. Mr. Birinyi predicted the onset of this bull market and remains convinced that it will continue for some time. 
 ''I think that as far as the market goes, the negative case is always more articulate, more intelligent, more compelling, because it's focused on what you can see now -- on what's right in front of you,'' he said. ''The market, meanwhile, is telling you what's ahead of you.'' That, he said, is probably a strong economy and rapidly growing corporate earnings. 
 Byron R. Wien, a Wall Street veteran who is now vice chairman of the Blackstone Group, has also been bullish for many months. Fundamentally, he said, the economy is recovering, credit markets are improving and earnings are beginning to rebound. 
 ''The market is more likely to increase in value next year than decrease,'' he said. ''It won't go up in a straight line, but I expect it will go up for several years.''
 After the run it's already had, though, Mr. Wien said that a short-term decline of 10 percent or more has become more likely. ''A correction of some sort wouldn't be unexpected now,'' he said. ''It could be a healthy thing.''
 Until now, the market rally has received considerable help from extraordinary government intervention in the credit markets and the economy. If the economy continues to grow, central banks, fearing inflation, are likely to tighten their monetary policy. In the United States, at some point in 2010, the Federal Reserve will begin ''draining liquidity from the financial system, as opposed to the quantitative easing that we have seen,'' and interest rates will start to rise, said Barry Knapp, United States equity strategist at Barclays Capital.
 The Fed's maneuver will be fraught with risk; if handled deftly, it will deal only a temporary setback to the stock market, he said.
 Long-term Treasury yields are likely to rise, and bond prices, which move in the opposite direction, are likely to fall, many analysts say. ''I would definitely avoid the Treasury market,'' Mr. Knapp said.
 He predicted that there would probably be a stock market correction, then a resumption of the rally. When all is said and done, Barclays estimates that the S.& P. will stand at 1,120 at the end of 2010 -- not far from where it is now.
 For this to happen, Mr. Knapp said, ''the sectors that drove the market forward will have to change.'' Financial stocks will no longer lead the rally's next phase, he said.
 Technology and industrial shares may do so ultimately, but in the short term, it may make sense to move into more ''defensive'' areas, like consumer staples and even health care. Impending federal health care legislation ''isn't likely to have as negative an effect on this sector as the market has assumed,'' he said.
 FOR his part, Mr. Birinyi said bets on broad sectors or on the overall market might not be as profitable in the coming months because so many people have already adopted the gospel of index mutual funds and exchange-traded funds.
 Instead, Mr. Birinyi recommended ''bottom-up stock-picking,'' citing an eclectic mix of industry ''leaders,'' like Apple, Goldman Sachs, U.S. Steel, Oshkosh and Green Mountain as some of his current favorites. 
 Don't just stick to the domestic market, said Mr. Ramsey at the Leuthold Group. Investors would do well if they had some money in developed foreign markets, he said, where overall valuations are now significantly cheaper than in the United States. 
 In these markets, he said, ''I think you've got a better chance for stronger growth.''

BYLINE: By SAM ROBERTS

 BODY:
More adults play video games than take education courses. Americans drink more bottled water than alcohol. One in 10 male students said they carried a weapon to school within the previous month. And while abortion rates keep declining, one in three births are to an unmarried woman. 
 Those and 1,400 other tables add up to a profile by numbers of the United States, as defined by the Census Bureau and other government agencies in the 2010 Statistical Abstract of the United States. They quantify everything from the impact of the technological revolution to the effects of the latest recession. 
 An estimated 110 billion text messages were sent on cellphones in December 2008, more than double the 48 billion in the previous December. The value of retail sales online soared from $24 billion when the decade began to $128 billion in 2007.
 Meanwhile, the number of pieces of mail delivered by the Postal Service, which began declining in 2007, dipped in 2008 to the lowest in a decade. The number of daily newspapers dropped to 1,408 in 2008 from 1,480 in 2000; circulation plunged to 48.6 million copies from 55.8 million.
 Women, already a majority among new recipients of bachelor's and master's degrees, pulled even with men among new recipients of doctoral degrees in 2007 for the first time.
 About 3 in 10 people who married in the early 1990s did not stay married long enough to celebrate their 10th anniversary.
 Last year, employers ordered 8,263 mass layoffs (defined as when an employer has at least 50 unemployment insurance claims pending at least 31 days) compared with 5,363 the year before. For the first time since 2000, retail sales declined; spending on lottery tickets increased.
 More Americans spent their leisure time hunting with firearms than playing baseball. Twice as many bowl as play golf.
 Americans are consuming more fish, wine and watermelon, more Italian cheese than American cheese, and they are drinking less milk but raising more milk cows.
 If you are thinking of moving to Harare, Zimbabwe, it has the highest cost of living for Americans working for private companies abroad -- 143 percent higher than Washington, D.C. 
 La Paz, Bolivia, and Tegucigalpa, Honduras, are bargains at 16 percent of Washington's living costs.

HEADLINE: Logjam in the A.F.C. Is the Dolphins' to Untangle

BYLINE: By MIKE TANIER. 
Mike Tanier of FootballOutsiders.com is a co-author of ''Football Outsiders Almanac 2009'' and a contributor to The Fifth Down blog.

 BODY:
The Colts have clinched a playoff berth, the Chargers and the Bengals are just a win away. The Patriots are the likely winners of the American Football Conference East, and the Broncos face the Raiders and the Chiefs in coming weeks, making them wild-card favorites. That leaves seven teams vying for one playoff berth in the A.F.C. It will be a mad, mad, mad, mad scramble.
 The Miami Dolphins (7-6) are in better position than most of the other hopefuls, flying over much of the competition like Sid Caesar in a biplane. They have head-to-head tie-breaker victories against the Jaguars and the Jets, and they face three straight bubble brethren. The Tennessee Titans (6-7), with a weaker conference record, are more like Jonathan Winters on a bicycle. 
 The Titans were 0-6 before Vince Young's resurrection, and Kerry Collins looked refreshed in relief of the injured Young last week. The Dolphins keep cobbling offense together out of Ricky Williams and guys named Brian Hartline and Lousaka Polite. They were up to their old tricks against last week, rushing 40 times and crawling down the field at 10 yards per minute. 
 The Titans have become a tough team to run against in the second half of the season, which gives them a big edge this week. It may be too little, too late for the playoff chase. 
 1 p.m. Line: Dolphins by 3
 Bengals (9-4) at Chargers (10-3)
 Cincinnati has battled bad news all season. The defensive coordinator Mike Zimmer's wife died two months ago. Now, the team is coping with the death of Chris Henry days before one of the most important games in franchise history. Henry's on-field contributions this season were minimal (he broke his forearm in November), but his significance to the organization was great. Henry was emblematic of the type of second-chance player the Bengals often acquire, usually to great criticism. He was one of several players who appeared to be turning around his career while playing for the Bengals, and Henry-like players -- troubled, misunderstood, too-quickly judged by some critics -- are largely responsible for the team's success this season.
 On the field, the Bengals match up well with San Diego. They run the ball 52 percent of the time, so they can limit opportunities for the quick-strike Chargers offense. Cornerbacks Leon Hall and Johnathan Joseph are the best twosome in the league -- with all due respect to Darrelle Revis and Anyone Available -- allowing the Bengals to contain Chargers receivers, who average a league-high 13.7 yards per catch. It is callous to speculate on the motivation factor in this game, yet foolish to overlook it. A win clinches a postseason berth for either team. Suddenly, that seems trivial. 4:05 p.m. Line: Chargers by 6 1/2
 Packers (9-4) at Steelers (6-7)
 Green Bay and Pittsburgh switched places Nov. 15. Before that day, the Packers were like the smart kid who never studied: brilliant in bursts, foolish at the worst times, always defeating themselves with sacks and penalties. The Steelers were diligent students: reliable, resourceful, capable of a B-plus effort every week and an A on the February final exam.
 The Packers are 5-0 since Nov. 15. They still find a way to commit pass interference on an extra point, but the Packers have allowed only 10 sacks in five games, and their blitz-happy defense has forced enough mistakes to offset the occasional (frequent, incessant) flags. The Steelers are 0-5, with three losses to bad opponents. Their offensive game plans are predictable, their special teams are awful and, most shockingly, their blitzes have become easy to pick up and exploit.
 4:15 p.m. Line: Steelers by 1 1/2
 49ers (6-7) at Eagles (9-4)
 Philadelphia leads the N.F.L. with 18 passing plays of 40 or more yards, as many as the 49ers, the Raiders, the Browns, the Bengals and the Rams combined. Only three of those passes came against the Giants, though it felt like many more, and the Eagles are finally learning to score at the goal line as easily as they can from midfield. San Francisco is still in the playoff chase, and it will ride a Lions-Rams waterslide in the final two weeks. The 49ers' defense turns Kurt Warner into Shaky Kurt (seven sacks and four interceptions in two games), so it will try to use the same tactics to transform Donovan McNabb into Shaky Donovan, the guy who lost to the Raiders. 
 4:15 p.m. Line: Eagles by 9
 Falcons (6-7) at Jets (7-6)
 Jets quarterback Mark Sanchez practiced with braces on both knees last week; any more injuries and he will be fitted for an exoskeleton. Coaches Rex Ryan and Mike Smith, former co-workers, spent the week ribbing each other through the news media.
 A quick rooting guide for Jets fans: you want the Titans to beat the Dolphins, because the Jets hold a tie breaker against the Titans. You want the Bengals to win, because that means they may have less to play for in Week 17. You can root for the Raiders and the Rams if you enjoy frustration, and you can hope that Randy Moss sails back to Gold Brick Island for another week, because there is still a slim chance of a division title. 1 p.m. Line: Jets by 6
 Patriots (8-5) at Bills (5-8)
 Randy Moss used to play Tetris instead of blocking for running plays and carried a double latte out of the huddle when he was not the primary receiver for a pass. The only thing surprising about his latest work-ethic recession has been the reaction: the criticism has been shrill, and his supporters have protested too much. That is a lot of undue attention, and no one craves attention like Terrell Owens, now consigned to a part of the world that merits national headlines only when the snowfall measures in the decameters (Sunday's forecast calls for flurries). Owens may take a pillow onto the field and sleep through a series, just to steal a few headlines. Moss caught 12 passes against Buffalo in the season opener. 1 p.m. Line: Patriots by 7
 Bears (5-8) at Ravens (7-6)
 The Ravens' elfin playmakers survived brief scares Sunday. Ray Rice (5 feet 8 inches, counting his cleats) missed the end of the Lions game, and Derrick Mason (5-10, rounded up) had the wind knocked out of him during a 62-yard touchdown reception. They are ready to play this week, and Baltimore's relatively easy late-season schedule -- the Raiders and the Steelers come after Chicago -- gives it an inside edge among the A.F.C. bubble buddies. The Bears are eliminated from playoff contention, but they have a bright future: none of their players who scored offensive touchdowns are older than 26. Jay Cutler does not turn 27 until April, though at the rate he is going, he will throw his 100th interception before his 30th birthday.
 4:15 p.m. Line: Ravens by 10 1/2
 Cardinals (8-5) at Lions (2-11)
 Forgive the Cardinals. They backpedal into the playoffs because they do not know any better. Last season, they were like 21-year-olds entering their first trendy nightclub. They are only a little more savvy this year; they still survey the room sheepishly, spill their drinks and fumble over their words when they are not just fumbling. Wins against Detroit and the Rams over the next few weeks will give Arizona two shots of confidence and a chance to rest its banged-up stars Larry Fitzgerald and Kurt Warner. Matthew Stafford's status for the Lions will not be certain until kickoff. If he cannot play, the reanimated Daunte Culpepper zombie gets one more start. 1 p.m. Line: Cardinals by 12
 Raiders (4-9) at Broncos (8-5)
 Next season, the NFL Network may replace Red Zone with Josh Zone, a three-hour close-up of Josh McDaniels as he interacts with players, officials and opponents. Viewer discretion is advised. McDaniels's blue-language bromides are a lip-reader's delight and they make Broncos losses as entertaining as their wins, but McDaniels has little to curse about. Visits by the Raiders and the Chiefs will give Denver the 10 wins it needs to rise above the conference pack. What's more, the Broncos will be facing the Raiders at a bad time. Oakland quarterback Bruce Gradkowski, ever the overachiever, tore ligaments in his knees last week. The third stringer Charlie Frye takes the helm, and Frye needs a cutoff man to reach any receiver more than 30 yards downfield. The Broncos should win, but they cannot afford to coast: if they try to feed Brandon Marshall 21 more passes, Nnamdi Asomugha could record history's first 10-interception game.4:05 p.m. Line: Broncos by 14
 Vikings (11-2) at Panthers (5-8)
 Carolina allows 28 yards per kickoff return, the worst average in the league. Minnesota's kickoff return average of 24.4 appears ordinary, but opponents sometimes squib kicks away from Percy Harvin (30.7 yards per return, 2 touchdowns), so blockers like Jeff Dugan often have 4-yard returns to the 35-yard line. Harvin was limited all week with migraines, but if he plays, he will make an easy win easier by giving the Vikings' offense the ball near midfield. The Panthers will be counting on several youngsters: quarterback Matt Moore, right tackle Geoff Schwartz and cornerback/privateer Captain Munnerlyn, who is a huge Brett Favre fan. ''If I intercept the ball from him, I'll probably ask him to sign it,'' Munnerlyn said during the week. For the record, Favre has not signed an interception since Corey Webster stole his pen. 8:20 p.m. Line: Vikings by 9
 Browns (2-11) at Chiefs (3-10)
 Meet the new Browns; same as the old Browns. There is running back Chris Jennings, who was on the Montreal Alouettes until August and gained 75 yards (68.6 meters) against the Steelers. There is Evan Moore, a former Stanford wide receiver turned pass-catching tight end, in contrast to Robert Royal, who is Cleveland's pass-dropping tight end. Wide receiver/safety Mike Furrey plays both ways, neither of them well. If Josh Cribbs is ever hurt, Furrey will return punts poorly and run the Wildcat ineffectively, all for the minimum wage. It is a lovable, ragtag bunch, and after their win against the Steelers, no other bottom feeder is safe. There are plenty of tickets available in Kansas City for this game; the Chiefs are trying to convey that message without sounding desperate. 1 p.m. Line: Chiefs by 1 1/2
 Buccaneers (1-12) at Seahawks (5-8)
 These teams combined for 17 drives of three plays or fewer last week; their play-by-play charts can only be read in waltz time. When Tampa Bay and Seattle first met as expansion teams in 1976, officials called 35 penalties. ''It got to be we weren't so much blocking and tackling, but just looking to see who the penalty was on,'' said Seahawks Coach Jack Patera, who earned the franchise's first win that day. If 35 flags are thrown Sunday, a) no one will see them, b) Jim Mora will send a Britannica-length missive to league offices, and c) we will know which crew gets to officiate the Packers' wild-card game.4:15 p.m. Line: Seahawks by 7
 Texans (6-7) at Rams (1-12)
 Houston is still mathematically alive for the playoffs, a sign that math can prove anything, and this is a must-win game for a team that finishes its schedule against the Patriots and the Dolphins. Keith Null, St. Louis's third-string rookie quarterback, threw five interceptions last week, but Coach Steve Spagnuolo gave him a vote of confidence. ''Under the circumstances and how it all went down, I thought he handled himself well in the huddle,'' he said. Film review backs the coach up: Null did not throw a single interception from the huddle. 
 1 p.m. Line: Texans by 11
 Giants (7-6) at Redskins (4-9)
 The comedy team of Daniel Snyder and Vinny Cerrato has broken up, which means no more Bob Hope-Bing Crosby road comedies during scouting season. The twosome visited the Big 12 championship game just two weeks ago to check out Texas quarterback Colt McCoy. Armchair scouting is a fun hobby for people who do not have the money or power to do serious damage; letting Snyder and Cerrato do their own scouting was like letting teenagers take a bullet train for a joyride. 
 Monday, 8:30 p.m. Line: Giants by 3

HEADLINE: Developers Reconsider The 'Condotel'

BYLINE: By ALISON GREGOR

 BODY:
IN the new home financing landscape created in this recession, certain categories of high-rise development are apparently on the verge of dying out, and one is the ''condotel.''
 Popular in Las Vegas and Miami, condotels were catching on New York City when the credit crunch hit in 2008. A combination of a hotel and condominiums in one building, the condotel, or condo-hotel, gives condo buyers access to hotel services, but often restricts their occupancy during the year.
During periods when the owner is not in residence, the hotel rents out the condo, providing the owner with income. 
 Examples of the condotel are the ritzy Plaza Hotel residences at 768 Fifth Avenue and 59th Street, and several Trump buildings, including the new Trump SoHoat 246 Spring Street and Varick Street, which will open to residents in February.
 The problem is that banks have been unwilling to finance buyers in condotels.
 Rodrigo Nino, the president of Prodigy Network, which is marketing the 391-unit Trump SoHo, said he believes the financing problem struck as early as the end of 2007. The Trump SoHo began sales in September 2007, and now that it is almost time for buyers to close, many are having difficulty obtaining financing.
 ''There is no financing for condo-hotels, so people have to buy in cash,'' Mr. Nino said. ''What we think is, out of the original sales, we're going to lose 10 to 15 percent of the people who won't be able to close because of lack of financing.''
 Mr. Nino said more than 55 percent of the units in the Trump SoHo's first phase were in contract, but would not say how many units that was. 
 The developers of the Pieds-a-Terre at the Plaza said they had sold about half of the 152 condos at the condotel. The first recorded sales were in early 2006. Developers indicated that they had worked out financing in some form, but didn't offer details.
 ''Our banks recognize that the Plaza's Pieds-a-Terre are a distinctive product,'' said Thomas Elliott, the executive vice president for sales and marketing for the owner, El-Ad Properties, in an e-mail message. ''They are prepared to respond to potential purchasers to craft creative deals on the merits and on an individual basis at this extraordinary location.''
 Raphael De Niro, a managing director at Prudential Douglas Elliman, was planning a 205-unit Manhattan condotel called the Nobu Hotel and Residences with his father, the actor and real estate developer Robert De Niro. That deal fell through, for reasons other than the financing.
 ''There are condo-hotels that developers do to get around commercial zoning,'' the younger Mr. De Niro said, ''and those are like the Trump SoHo, where buyers can only use the unit 90 or 120 days, and then it gets thrown into a rental pool. Those types of condo-hotels are proving to not be successful.''
 The De Niros now plan to open a different version of a condotel, in South Beach, in Miami. Here, the buyers can stay as long as they like, but the hotel will not rent out the units when they are not there. Condo owners will have access to hotel services, much as they do at the Residences at the Ritz-Carlton at 10 West Street in Battery Park City.
 Like the De Niros, the developers of the 346-unit 75 Wall Street Condominiums in the financial district, which are in the same building as Hyatt's soon-to-open Andaz Wall Street, decided to forgo the typical condotel model. 
 ''Fannie Mae will not approve a condo-hotel under their guidelines,'' said Larry Kruysman, the sales director for 75 Wall Street, which is being marketed by the Corcoran Sunshine Marketing Group. ''In today's market, all the banks want to do loans that are approved by Fannie Mae, so they can sell them on the secondary market in the future.''
 Mr. Kruysman said 75 Wall Street, which sells hotel services to condo buyers a la carte, is a Fannie Mae-approved project. Because 75 Wall Street allows its condos to be subleased for a term of three months -- unusual for condo developments, which typically require lease terms of a year -- the development has attracted foreign buyers. 
 Foreign buyers are often drawn to condotels. Intending to use the unit infrequently, they don't mind the restrictions on occupancy, and like the convenience and income.
 Mr. Kruysman says they either pay in cash or use bank financing that he found after much searching.
 ''Lloyds TSB International will do loans in New York,'' he said. ''I've done several of those for foreign nationals. But one thing that isn't appealing for people is that it's almost a floating interest rate. By year's end, the rate may have changed many times, which makes it hard to judge if it makes sense for you as an investment vehicle.''
 The Four Seasons at 99 Church Street in the financial district is another condotel that got held up by the credit crunch. But the developer, Silverstein Properties, is seeking construction financing, said Dara McQuillan, a spokesman.
 ''Look for it in 2012,'' he said, and laughed. ''We'll be doing the type of condo-hotel where buyers can get financing.''

HEADLINE: Tiger Woods, Person of the Year

BYLINE: By FRANK RICH

 BODY:
AS we say farewell to a dreadful year and decade, this much we can agree upon: The person of the year is not Ben Bernanke, no matter how insistently Time magazine tries to hype him into its pantheon. The Fed chairman was just as big a schnook as every other magical thinker in Washington and on Wall Street who believed that housing prices would go up in perpetuity to support an economy leveraged past the hilt. Unlike most of the others, it was Bernanke's job to be ahead of the curve. Yet as recently as June of last year he could be found minimizing the possibility of a substantial economic downturn. And now we're supposed to applaud him for putting his finger in the dike after disaster struck? This is defining American leadership down. 
 If there's been a consistent narrative to this year and every other in this decade, it's that most of us, Bernanke included, have been so easily bamboozled. The men who played us for suckers, whether at Citigroup or Fannie Mae, at the White House or Ted Haggard's megachurch, are the real movers and shakers of this century's history so far. That's why the obvious person of the year is Tiger Woods. His sham beatific image, questioned by almost no one until it collapsed, is nothing if not the farcical reductio ad absurdum of the decade's flimflams, from the cancerous (the subprime mortgage) to the inane (balloon boy).
 As of Friday, the Tiger saga had appeared on 20 consecutive New York Post covers. For The Post, his calamity has become as big a story as 9/11. And the paper may well have it right. We've rarely questioned our assumption that 9/11, ''the day that changed everything,'' was the decade's defining event. But in retrospect it may not have been. A con like Tiger's may be more typical of our time than a one-off domestic terrorist attack, however devastating.
 Indeed, if we go back to late 2001, the most revealing news story may have been unfolding not in New York but Houston -- the site of the Enron scandal. That energy company convinced financial titans, the press and countless investors that it was a business deity. It did so even though very few of its worshipers knew what its business was. Enron is the template for the decade of successful ruses that followed, Tiger's included.
 What makes the golfing superstar's tale compelling, after all, is not that he's another celebrity in trouble or another fallen athletic ''role model'' in a decade lousy with them. His scandal has nothing to tell us about race, and nothing new to say about hypocrisy. The conflict between Tiger's picture-perfect family life and his marathon womanizing is the oldest of morality tales.
 What's striking instead is the exceptional, Enron-sized gap between this golfer's public image as a paragon of businesslike discipline and focus and the maniacally reckless life we now know he led. What's equally striking, if not shocking, is that the American establishment and news media -- all of it, not just golf writers or celebrity tabloids -- fell for the Woods myth as hard as any fan and actively helped sustain and enhance it.
 People wanted to believe what they wanted to believe. Tiger's off-the-links elusiveness was no more questioned than Enron's impenetrable balance sheets, with their ''special-purpose entities'' named after ''Star Wars'' characters. Fortune magazine named Enron as America's ''most innovative company'' six years in a row. In the January issue of Golf Digest, still on the stands, some of the best and most hardheaded writers in America offer ''tips Obama can take from Tiger,'' who is typically characterized as so without human frailties that he ''never does anything that would make him look ridiculous.''
 Perhaps the most conspicuous player in the Tiger hagiography business has been a company called Accenture, one of his lustrous stable of corporate sponsors. In a hilarious Times article, Brian Stelter described the extreme efforts this outfit is now making to erase its six-year association with its prized spokesman. Alas, the many billboards with slogans like ''Go On. Be a Tiger'' are not so easily dismantled, and collectors' items like ''Accenture Match Play Tiger Woods Caddy Bib'' are a growth commodity on eBay. 
 From what I can tell, Accenture is a solid company. But the Daily News columnist Mike Lupica raised a good point when I spoke with him last week: ''If Tiger Woods was so important to Accenture, how come I didn't know what Accenture did when they fired him?'' According to its Web site, Accenture is ''a global management consulting, technology services and outsourcing company,'' but who cared about any fine print? It was Tiger, and Tiger was it, and no one was to worry about the details behind the mutually advantageous image-mongering. One would like to assume that Accenture's failure to see or heed any warning signs about a man appearing in 83 percent of its advertising is an anomalous lapse. One would like to believe that business and government clients didn't hire Accenture just because it had Tiger's imprimatur. But in a culture where so many smart people have been taken so often, we can't assume anything.
 As cons go, Woods's fraudulent image as an immaculate exemplar of superhuman steeliness is benign. His fall will damage his family, closest friends, Accenture and the golf industry much more than the rest of us. But the syndrome it epitomizes is not harmless. We keep being fooled by leaders in all sectors of American life, over and over. A decade that began with the ''reality'' television craze exemplified by ''American Idol'' and ''Survivor'' -- both blissfully devoid of any reality whatsoever -- spiraled into a wholesale flight from truth.
 The most lethal example, of course, were the two illusions marketed to us on the way to Iraq -- that Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction and some link to Al Qaeda. That history has since been rewritten by Bush alumni, Democratic politicians who supported the Iraq invasion and some of the news media that purveyed the White House fictions (especially the television press, which rarely owned up to its failure as print journalists have). It was exclusively ''bad intelligence,'' we're now told, that pushed us into the fiasco. But contradictions to that ''bad intelligence'' were in plain sight during the run-up to the war -- even sometimes in the press. Yet we wanted to suspend disbelief. Much of the country, regardless of party, didn't want to question its leaders, no matter how obviously they were hyping any misleading shred of intelligence that could fit their predetermined march to war. It's the same impulse that kept many from questioning how Mark McGwire's and Barry Bonds's outlandishly cartoonish physiques could possibly be steroid-free. 
 In the political realm, our bipartisan credulousness has also been on steroids in this decade, even by our national standards. Many Democrats didn't want to see the snake-oil salesman in John Edwards, blatant as his ''Two America'' self-contradictions were if you cared merely to look at him on YouTube. Republicans incessantly fell for family values preacher politicians like David Vitter, John Ensign and Larry Craig. Fred Thompson was seen by many, in the press as well as his party, as the second coming of Ronald Reagan. Karl Rove was widely hailed as a mastermind who would assemble a permanent Republican majority. Bernie Kerik was considered a plausible secretary of homeland security. Eliot Spitzer was viewed as a crusader of uncompromising principle.
 But these scam artists are pikers next to the financial hucksters. I'm not just talking about Bernie Madoff and Enron's Ken Lay, but about those titans who legally created and sold the securities that gamed and then wrecked the system. You'd think after Enron's collapse that financial leaders and government overseers would question the contents of ''exotic'' investments that could not be explained in plain English. But only a few years after Enron's very public and extensively dissected crimes, the same bankers, federal regulatory agencies and securities-rating companies were giving toxic ''assets'' a pass. We were only too eager to go along for the lucrative ride until it crashed like Tiger's Escalade.
 After his ''indefinite break'' from golf, Woods will surely be back on the links once the next celebrity scandal drowns his out. But after a decade in which two true national catastrophes, a wasteful war and a near-ruinous financial collapse, were both in part byproducts of the ease with which our leaders bamboozled us, we can't so easily move on. 
 This can be seen in the increasingly urgent political plight of Barack Obama. Though the American left and right don't agree on much, they are both now coalescing around the suspicion that Obama's brilliant presidential campaign was as hollow as Tiger's public image -- a marketing scam designed to camouflage either his covert anti-American radicalism (as the right sees it) or spineless timidity (as the left sees it). The truth may well be neither, but after a decade of being spun silly, Americans can't be blamed for being cynical about any leader trying to sell anything. As we say goodbye to the year of Tiger Woods, it is the country, sad to say, that is left mired in a sand trap with no obvious way out.

HEADLINE: A President Who Loves Deadlines ...

BYLINE: By SHERYL GAY STOLBERG

 BODY:
WASHINGTON --Barack Obama had been in office just two days when he established himself as the Deadline President.
 On that day, Jan. 22, Mr. Obama affixed his curlicue signature to an executive order requiring him to close the prison at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, within one year -- a hard and fast date, set down in black and white for every American to see. In the 11 months since, the president has employed deadlines and timetables on issues ranging from health care to Iran -- and watched many of them slip away.
 Now, as his first year in office draws to a close, the man who campaigned on the ''fierce urgency of now'' is confronting a painful reality: the not-so-fierce urgency of next year. 
 On Capitol Hill, Mr. Obama set what his senior adviser,David Axelrod, calls ''a very aggressive calendar,'' only to discover that Congress does not necessarily respond to a presidential kick in the pants. He prodded lawmakers to pass energy legislation and a financial regulatory overhaul by the end of 2009. (The House has; the Senate hasn't.) He demanded Congressional committees finish work on their health bills by August. (Four out of five did; that's 80 percent -- a solid B.) He said he would sign a bill by year's end. (Unlikely.) Now, he is pressing for the Senate to pass its measure by Christmas. (The clock is ticking.)
 In foreign affairs, Mr. Obama vowed to sign a new arms control treaty with Russia by Dec. 5. (The deadline expired, but after meeting PresidentDmitri Medvedev in Copenhagen on Friday, Mr. Obama said a deal was ''quite close.'') He warned Iran to respond to diplomatic overtures on its nuclear program by year's end. (Iran thumbed its nose; the administration is threatening sanctions.) On Afghanistan, Mr. Obama imposed a kind of squishy deadline, saying he would withdraw troops beginning in July 2011, without providing an end date.
 Historians say they cannot remember a modern president who has used deadlines and timetables as aggressively as Mr. Obama. Presidents tend to urge, cajole and exhort. But unless they are issuing threats to foreign adversaries (as Mr. Obama did with Iran, and as former PresidentGeorge W. Bush did with the Iraqi dictator,Saddam Hussein), they try generally to avoid boxing themselves into corners with dates certain.
 Some scholars wonder about the wisdom of it, and whether Mr. Obama will pay a price.
 Charles O. Jones, a professor emeritus of political science at the University of Wisconsin, put it this way: ''Dick Neustadt, the greatest of presidential scholars and now deceased, had a principal rule: always be attentive, in making a decision, to the effects of that decision on your prospects for future power. The point being that if you are going to set a deadline then you'd better meet it. Otherwise, the judgment will be that you made a mistake.''
 But as everyone knows, there are deadlines -- and then there are deadlines.Ronald Reagan gave striking air traffic controllers a deadline to return to work; they called his bluff and he fired 11,000 of them in an episode that contributed to his aura of toughness. Mr. Obama, of course, cannot fire lawmakers for failing to meet his deadlines for passing bills. So on Capitol Hill at least, his deadlines carry less weight.
 ''When you hear 'deadline' you should immediately translate it into 'guideline,' '' said Ross K. Baker of Rutgers, who studies the relationship between the president and Congress. ''Presidents understand that the time for legislative achievement is early in their administrations, and the longer they have been in office, the harder it is to get things done. But barring a national emergency, it is very difficult to get Congress to operate on a presidential timetable.''
 Thus, Congress moved quickly to pass Mr. Obama's economic recovery package early this year, even as it dragged its feet on his other priorities. Still, Mr. Axelrod, the senior adviser, makes the case that the deadlines are useful; without them, he insists, Mr. Obama's domestic agenda would not be nearly as far along as it is. ''This is a town that needs deadlines,'' he said. ''If you don't set them, there's no urgency.''
 The risk is that if Congress continues to ignore Mr. Obama's timetables, lawmakers will not believe he is serious when he sets new ones. Meanwhile, Republicans like SenatorCharles E. Grassley of Iowa, who negotiated with the administration on health care until their talks went sour over the summer, are complaining.
 ''I think these arbitrary deadlines were not appreciative of the fact that it's a very complicated issue,'' Mr. Grassley said, adding that by sticking to them, Mr. Obama had done ''a lot of damage to the cause of bipartisanship.''
 In foreign affairs, deadlines are that much trickier. Peter Feaver, who advised Mr. Bush on national security, talks of the ''multiple audience problem,'' the deadline that sounds different to different ears. Some deadlines, he said, are useful in prodding the bureaucracy to get moving but can hurt a president if they are made public. (He puts Guantanamo in this category.) Others might please Americans but anger allies.
 Mr. Bush was confronted with the question of deadlines in Iraq, and refused to set any for withdrawal, even though many Americans were clamoring for one. Mr. Feaver said the administration did have a ''strategic horizon,'' but found it difficult to explain to the public and allies. ''It was hard to figure out how to say it without it sounding like a deadline,'' Mr. Feaver said, ''which is what we didn't want to convey.''
 For Mr. Obama, perhaps no deadline has been as problematic as the first, the one to shut Guantanamo. In issuing the order, he put off the tough decision of what to do with the terrorism suspects housed there -- a problem Mr. Axelrod conceded ''proved far more complex than we might have anticipated.'' Mr. Jones said he could hardly believe his ears when he first heard of the order. ''I kept thinking, 'Surely that's not going to be a pattern,' '' he said.
 The White House conceded months ago that the president would not be able to meet his own timetable. So by last week, when the administration announced it would relocate the detainees to a maximum security prison in Illinois, the question was obvious: When would Guantanamo close? The White House press secretary,Robert Gibbs, made clear that on one issue at least, the Obama administration was out of the deadline business: ''I don't have a date certain.''

BYLINE: By DAVID SEGAL

DATELINE: CHAPPAQUA, N.Y. 

 BODY:
 FOR decades, the Reader's Digest Association owned one of the world's great corporate collections of fine art, and the good stuff was never stashed in a vault. It hung in the hallways and meeting rooms of the company's vast, collegiate-looking offices in this suburban hamlet about 40 miles north of Midtown Manhattan.
 Paintings by Picasso, Monet, Degas, Matisse, Renoir and van Gogh -- museum-worthy decor was just another perk of working for a publishing phenomenon, one that sold millions of magazines and books a year, a readership rivaled only by the Bible. Although comparing sales of the scriptures to those of Reader's Digest has always been unfair, because, as The New Yorker noted in 1945, ''the Bible had a head start.''
 The masterpieces are long gone, most sold at auction to raise millions of badly needed dollars. Now, two years after a private equity deal saddled Reader's Digest with $2.2 billion in debt, and three months after it filed for bankruptcy, the walls are dominated by inexpensive prints and lots of corporate propaganda. 
 That's right: corporate propaganda. Posters in the corridors of this mostly empty building trumpet something called the FACE plan, an acronym for fast, accountable, candid and engaged. One poster offers simplistic how-tos for running a meeting. (''Ensure that the right people are at the table.'') Another is headed with the words ''Vision Statement'' and uses lots of empty white space to underscore the point: ''We will create the world's largest multiplatform communities based on branded content.''
 That mantra, and all the posters, are the brainchild of Mary Berner, the kinetic former president of Fairchild Publications who landed here with the backing of Ripplewood Holdings, the Manhattan private equity firm that orchestrated the debt-fueled takeover of Reader's Digest.
 Since March 2007, Ms. Berner has been reconfiguring the innards of the company -- and trying to overhaul its public image, too. If you hear ''Reader's Digest'' and think only of a cheery, waiting-room magazine -- the one with the jokes, the lists, and the homespun stories like ''Nobody Cares About Grandfather's Clock but Grandma'' -- well, Ms. Berner would like to have a word with you.
 She would like you to know that Reader's Digest has modernized and, for the first time in its history, won the National Magazine Award this year, the industry's most coveted prize. (Recent articles have included ''Disposable Income: How to Make a Quick Buck on the Treasures -- and Trash -- in Your Closets'' and ''Simple Till 6: An Eating Plan for Busy People.'') And she would like you to know that said magazine is but a small part of a soon-to-be-renamed company, with a trove of Web sites (like AllRecipes.com) and magazines (like Every Day With Rachael Ray) that you probably didn't know it owned. 
 DNA, however, is hard to shake, and this is a far-from-ideal moment for media ventures of any size. As legacy print companies struggle for relevance and revenue in a Webcentric era, this is a reclamation project with some history and drama -- a towering brand, a balance sheet on fire, a decimated work force that will either pivot into the digital age or expire.
 As Ms. Berner tries to persuade the world to rethink this company, she apparently also needs to re-educate employees. Much of her time and boundless intensity is spent prodding her staff out of its entrenched, slow-motion ways -- no easy task, given the eccentric and insular culture of this company, a legacy of the long stewardship of DeWitt and Lila Wallace, the Reader's Digest founders.
 Beyond agitprop, Ms. Berner's continuing internal campaign has included some let's-put-on-a-show enthusiasm and some merciless cost-cutting. Lines of authority have also been redrawn, integrating the print and online realms. ''Silo busting'' is a phrase you hear a lot.
 To lead this revolution, Ms. Berner has hired an impressively credentialed group of women to the company's top jobs, a coterie known around the building collectively as ''the blondes.'' Strictly speaking, they're not all blonde, but they have brought high-heel chic to a place that resisted, or actively shunned, that style for a long time.
 ''It was hilarious to see all those Prada shoes on that campus,'' says Jackie Leo, the onetime editor in chief at Reader's Digest magazine whom Ms. Berner eventually replaced. ''It's such a Manhattan group in such a suburban place.''
 They are leaving this suburban place soon. The company is gearing up to vacate the premises, 770,000 square feet of office space built by the Wallaces in 1939.
 The move gets the company out from under an onerous lease. (The estate was sold in 2005, and Reader's Digest has since been a tenant.) But relocating is also a symbolic and definitive break with a past that seems awfully dowdy in the age of tweets. About half of the 900 remaining employees will work in an office in White Plains, and half will work in Midtown Manhattan.
 A major makeover? That term isn't strong enough for what Ms. Berner and her team have in mind. This is more like entering the Witness Protection Program, surgically altering your face, then emerging with a new identity in a different country.
 Bye-bye, Reader's Digest.
 Hello ''multibrand media and marketing company that educates, entertains and connects audiences around the world,'' as it says on another FACE poster.
 ''It's Herculean, what Mary is trying to do,'' says Samir Husni, a professor of journalism at the University of Mississippi. ''She wants to keep Reader's Digest's original audience and add a whole new audience through new media.''
 Will it work? It's too soon to say, Professor Husni adds, ''but so far, she and her team have at least stopped the bleeding.''
 BY all accounts, including her own, Ms. Berner has been a 50-volt shock to the Reader's Digest system. She has laid off one-quarter of the top 200 executives. She put ads on the back cover of the flagship magazine, long considered an ad-free zone. She refused to give out bonuses to staffers who hadn't earned them.
 ''When people didn't make their numbers, they were surprised when they didn't get a bonus,'' says Ms. Berner, sitting in her office one recent morning and sounding as though she is still bewildered. ''I said: 'I don't get it. You didn't make your number!' ''
 Blond, petite and kind of preppy, Ms. Berner has one mode: brisk. She talks emphatically and quickly, like a chat-show host rushing to commercial break. She often starts to answer questions as soon as she gets their gist. Her idle is set very high.
 In her telling, Reader's Digest was badly in need of a towel snap before she arrived. It was publicly traded at the time, and had almost $1 billion in debt, most of it from acquisitions, a few of which turned out to be real stinkers.
 Ripplewood, led by Tim Collins, its chief executive, saw turnaround opportunities as well as a chance to roll up the fund's own media properties, including Time Life Inc., the direct-marketing company that was formerly part of Time Warner. Ripplewood put in $275 million of its own money and had a bunch of partners, which included Rothschild Bank of Zurich and GoldenTree Asset Management of New York. 
 But the $2.4 billion deal piled so much debt onto Reader's Digest's balance sheet that it tripled the company's interest payments, to $148 million a year. The Great Recession hurt ad sales, of course, and devastated sales of direct-marketed books. Instead of the single-digit percentage growth in revenue that Ripplewood was banking on, revenue declined.
 In January, the company laid off 300 people, about 8 percent of its staff. 
 But even with those measures, the company did not, as Ms. Berner might put it, make its number. In August, it filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy.
 With the lenders' swapping debt for equity, Ripplewood lost its entire investment and was evicted like an overstretched homeowner. The purchase now has a prominent place in the annals of media buyout fiascoes -- not quite in the same category as Sam Zell's $8.5 billion purchase of the Tribune Company, but not far behind, either.
 Mr. Collins declined to comment.
 For Ms. Berner, who has earned favorable clippings in her years in the magazine business -- a profile in Folio was headlined ''The Cult of Mary'' -- the filing was a blow to a hearty ego.
 ''Not under my watch!'' is how she sums up her initial reaction. But then her lawyers explained the financial benefits of a bankruptcy proceeding, and she says she warmed to the idea: ''That is what got me to do it. The lawyers said: 'This is a great tool. This is what you should do.' ''
 She was the only member of the Ripplewood team who actually kept her job, and with a salary that even during the bankruptcy proceedings is a comfy $125,000 a month. (She was a consultant to Ripplewood, she notes for the record, never a full-time employee.) To add a hint of familial psychodrama to the episode, she had been introduced to Ripplewood by her younger brother, Rob Berner, who was then an executive with the company. (Mr. Berner wouldn't comment; a Reader's Digest spokesman says he left Ripplewood around the time of the deal.)
 Ms. Berner would not discuss the state of her relationship with Ripplewood or her brother. Like a lot of subjects related to the bankruptcy, she explained that her lawyers had urged maximum discretion.
 With her employees, she has spoken often and at length about Chapter 11 and her plans for the magazine's life during and after it. Bankruptcy represents a low point that would have been unimaginable in the heyday of this company, and a few employees have been around long enough to remember those years.
 It was a time when this remote and now largely desolate building was the improbable setting for one of the greatest powerhouses in the history of publishing.
 THE magazine was dreamed up by DeWitt Wallace, the son of a Greek and Latin scholar. He clipped, condensed and rewrote articles as he recovered from shrapnel wounds sustained in World War I. The original content aggregator, a kind of proto-Matt Drudge, the deeply conservative Mr. Wallace culled articles from the booming world of magazine publishing, mostly for rural readers who didn't have access to newsstands.
 The emphasis was patriotism (''The End of Socialism in Russia''), health remedies, some tending toward quackery (''Found: A One Day Cure for Syphilis''), animal stories (''The Life of the Bee'') and parental guides (''Marijuana -- Assassin of Youth''). Plus a lot of inspiring tales about regular people.
 The Wallaces initially hoped to one day earn $5,000 a year with their pocket-size production, but Mr. Wallace's hunches about what mass-market audiences wanted were dead-on. By 1929, circulation stood at 290,000 subscribers and brought in $900,000 a year -- more than $11 million in inflation-adjusted dollars -- according to ''American Dreamers,'' a book about the Wallaces. By the 40th anniversary of Reader's Digest, Time tallied up the magazine's achievements: 40 editions, in 13 languages and Braille, and the best-selling publication in Canada, Mexico, Spain, Sweden, Peru -- and on and on. Total worldwide circulation was 23 million. 
 Money poured in so fast that when the offices in nearby Pleasantville relocated to Chappaqua, the company kept the old address because Chappaqua's post office wasn't equipped for the onslaught of mail. The Wallaces, who never had children, didn't know what to do with all the cash. Growing up, Mr. Wallace had been sternly lectured by his father about frugality, and he was uncomfortable with the trappings of wealth.
 So the Wallaces gave away their riches, not just through philanthropic donations but also in envelopes filled with cash and handed without warning to employees. They provided them with free bus service to nearby towns, and Mr. Wallace was known to flick the lights and shoo away anyone still toiling after the go-home chime of the 4 p.m. bell in the cupola.
 There were surprise companywide raises, too. Al Perruzza, now a senior vice president, recalls a dinner in the early '70s at which Mr. Wallace rose, clanked a glass and announced that, effective Monday, everyone at Reader's Digest would get a 10 percent raise. He sat for a moment, conferred with Mrs. Wallace and then stood up again.
 ''My lovely wife doesn't think that's enough,'' he said. ''So effective Monday, it's 15 percent.''
 He rose a third time and announced a cost-of-living increase.
 ''We had spent literally weeks preparing a budget,'' Mr. Perruzza says with a grin. ''I was sitting with the president of my division. The guy went ashen.''
 Mr. Wallace died in 1981, and Mrs. Wallace in 1984. In 1990, the company went public, hoping to expand, to acquire and to kick-start some growth. The pitch to investors was that Reader's Digest was a prestige brand that had figured out the secret to direct-mail marketing.
 The stock price would eventually triple, to just under $60, but in 2001, there were two disasters: the anthrax scare after the 9/11 attacks, which hurt any business that relied on the postal system, and an agreement that Reader's Digest signed with more than 30 attorneys general, who had long threatened litigation over allegedly misleading you-might-be-a-winner sweepstakes letters the company mass-mailed to drum up business. Reader's Digest began to phase out sweepstakes mailings in the United States.
 ''The amazing thing,'' says Dennis McAlpine, a retired media analyst who covered the company for years, ''is that nobody in Reader's Digest went to management and said 'Don't sign that agreement because it will kill us.' Nobody seemed to know how much of an impact that agreement would have. But as soon as they stopped marketing with sweepstakes, everything went to hell.''
 AT its peak, about 3,500 people worked at the Reader's Digest headquarters. With night shifts for blue-collar production jobs, the place hummed 24 hours a day. When zoning restrictions barred the company from adding floors above, it dug down and added office space below.
 Walking the hallways now, it's hard to imagine the bustle. More than half of the building is empty, a ghostly warren of empty cubicles and unused bathrooms. You can walk for long stretches without seeing anyone. A stand-alone brick addition has been condemned because of mold, a company spokesman said.
 The new Manhattan offices have a contemporary and more generic feel. Last week, Ms. Berner offered a walk-through of the place, a couple of floors in a building on Third Avenue at 46th Street, the former home of some bridal magazines owned by Conde Nast. Much of it is a wide-open room, filled with phones and desks and, when the employees move in, it will have a work din that Chappaqua has long been lacking.
 ''The building is the last barrier,'' Ms. Berner says. ''It's the last thing that is emblematic of the old strategy.''
 Suzanne Grimes, a former publisher of Glamour who is now in charge of all food- and entertainment-related content at the Reader's Digest Association, has an equally gung-ho view of the company's future. She works in DeWitt Wallace's former office, and she is dressed this afternoon in what appears to be a black, one-piece jumpsuit, like Catwoman in business casual.
 She is sitting at a table strewn with magazines. There's A Taste of Home, with a circulation of 3.2 million and a readership that contributes all the recipes; a handful of Taste of Home offshoots, like Simple & Delicious andHealthy Cooking; a few issues of Every Day With Rachael Ray; and several cookbooks.
 Altogether, Ms. Grimes says, she has an audience of 88 million.
 ''We're masterful at repurposing content,'' she says. ''We have a woman who submitted a cookie recipe. It was deemed the best recipe to come through.'' It ran in that issue of A Taste of Home ''as a contest winner, ran in a cookie special, ran in a holiday special,'' she adds.
 Since food and entertaining properties were brought together as an ''affinity group'' under Ms. Grimes in 2007, advertising for them is up 73 percent, she says.
 There have been setbacks along with such gains. Most notably, there was a short-lived partnership with the megachurch evangelist and best-selling author Rick Warren on a magazine called Purpose Driven Connection. The company pulled the plug after four issues. And expansion plans for magazine and book businesses have slowed.
 Reader's Digest has pared back to 10 issues a year from 12. From a peak in the '70s of 17 million subscribers in the United States, the magazine currently has a circulation of 8 million and will lower its guaranteed circulation next year to 5.5 million.
 Through all the bumps, Ms. Berner has tried to encourage her staff to talk, vent and criticize freely -- a change, she says, from longstanding practice.
 ''People would say, 'Oh you're so fabulous,' '' she recalls, referring to visits to her office, ''then walk outside and say, 'She's such a bitch.' '' 
 Ms. Berner allowed this reporter to sit in at a regular employee breakfast get-together one recent morning, on the condition that no employees be identified by name. The conversation loosened up a bit after she left for a meeting.
 ''It was kind of a boys' club,'' one employee said, describing the culture before Ms. Berner and her team arrived.
 ''Now it's a girls' club,'' said another.
 ''Blond girls!'' said a third.
 ''There have been a few complaints about the blond girl thing.'' 
 This staffer, a woman, went on.
 ''When the FACE thing came out we're like: 'We've heard it. We've been there. We've heard all the acronyms.' But she's very serious; she's very dedicated to pushing through that. I finally gave up the thinking that this was just another set of words that wouldn't ever pan out.''
 FORGET about the FACE plan. Will this company pan out?
 ''It depends on how much time they have, and that depends on how much the new creditors trust Mary,'' says Steve Cohn, editor of Media Industry Newsletter. ''Given that some of the old creditors got pennies on the dollar, I would think the company is on a tight leash right now -- the equivalent of severe probation.''
 It's been a long slide downhill. Reader's Digest was long run with the sort of erratic beneficence that drives bean counters insane, in large part because the Wallaces always thought of their business as a kind of educational foundation that happened to be spectacularly lucrative. That's why Mr. Wallace constantly pushed back when underlings came up with the new ways to goose revenue that were primarily about goosing revenue. 
 We know the rest of the story: In search of growth, the company goes public, stalls and then gasps for life when a hedge fund loads a couple billion dollars' worth of debt onto its back. The Reader's Digest Association may or may not survive in the transformed shape that Mary Berner envisions, but as a business school case study, it's already a lesson for the ages.

HEADLINE: THE RIGHT HAND OF THE FATHERS

BYLINE: By DAVID D. KIRKPATRICK. 
David D. Kirkpatrick is a correspondent in the Washington bureau of The New York Times.

 BODY:
On a September afternoon, about 60 prominent Christians assembled in the library of the Metropolitan Club on the east side of Central Park. It was a gathering of unusual diversity and power. Many in attendance were conservative evangelicals like the born-again Watergate felon Chuck Colson, who helped initiate the meeting. Metropolitan Jonah, the primate of the Orthodox Church in America, was there as well. And so were more than half a dozen of this country's most influential Roman Catholic bishops, including Archbishop Timothy Dolan of New York, Archbishop John Myers of Newark and Cardinal Justin Rigali of Philadelphia. 
 At the center of the event was Robert P. George, a Princeton University professor of jurisprudence and a Roman Catholic who is this country's most influential conservative Christian thinker. Dressed in his usual uniform of three-piece suit, New College, Oxford cuff links and rimless glasses, George convened the meeting with a note of thanks and a reminder of its purpose. Alarmed at the liberal takeover of Washington and an apparent leadership vacuum among the Christian right, the group had come together to warn the country's secular powers that the culture wars had not ended. As a starting point, George had drafted a 4,700-word manifesto that promised resistance to the point of civil disobedience against any legislation that might implicate their churches or charities in abortion, embryo-destructive research or same-sex marriage.
 Two months later, at a Washington press conference to present the group's ''Manhattan Declaration,'' George stepped aside to let Cardinal Rigali sum up just what made the statement, and much of George's work, distinctive. These principles did not belong to the Christian faith alone, the cardinal declared; they rested on a foundation of universal reason. ''They are principles that can be known and honored by men and women of good will even apart from divine revelation,'' Rigali said. ''They are principles of right reason and natural law.'' 
 Even marriage between a man and a woman, Rigali continued, was grounded not just in religion and tradition but in logic. ''The true great goods of marriage -- the unitive and the procreative goods -- are inextricably bound together such that the complementarity of husband and wife is of the very essence of marital communion,'' the cardinal continued, ascending into philosophical abstractions surely lost on most in the room. ''Sexual relations outside the marital bond are contrary not only to the will of God but to the good of man. Indeed, they are contrary to the will of God precisely because they are against the good of man.''
 George looked on with arms crossed and lips sealed. But he was obviously pleased. To anyone who knew George's work, the cardinal's words sounded very much as if George had written them, and when I asked him about it later, he acknowledged providing assistance. Rigali's remarks were a summation of the distinctive moral philosophy that is the foundation of George's power.
 He has parlayed a 13th-century Catholic philosophy into real political influence. Glenn Beck, the Fox News talker and a big George fan, likes to introduce him as ''one of the biggest brains in America,'' or, on one broadcast, ''Superman of the Earth.'' Karl Rove told me he considers George a rising star on the right and a leading voice in persuading President George W. Bush to restrict embryonic stem-cell research. Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia told me he numbers George among the most-talked-about thinkers in conservative legal circles. And Newt Gingrich called him ''an important and growing influence'' on the conservative movement, especially on matters like abortion and marriage.
 ''If there really is a vast right-wing conspiracy,'' the conservative Catholic journal Crisis concluded a few years ago, ''its leaders probably meet in George's kitchen.'' 
 FOR 20 YEARS, George has operated largely out of public view at the intersection of academia, religion and politics. In the past 12 months, however, he has stepped into a more prominent role. With the death of the Rev. Richard John Neuhaus, a Lutheran minister turned Roman Catholic priest who helped bring evangelicals and Catholics together into a political movement, George has assumed his mantle as the reigning brain of the Christian right. And he is in many ways the public face of the conservative side in the most urgent culture-war battle of the day. The National Organization for Marriage, the advocacy group fighting same-sex marriage in Albany and Trenton, Maine and California, has made him its chairman. Before the 2004 election, he helped a coalition of Christian conservative groups write their proposed amendment to the federal Constitution defining marriage as heterosexual. More than any other scholar, George has staked his reputation on the claim that same-sex marriage violates not only tradition but also human reason. 
 It's part of a philosophy that has found support among a group of Catholic bishops who have become some of the most persistent critics of President Obama and the Congressional Democrats. George serves as their intellectual point man. In the past few years, many of the evangelical Protestants who once defined the religious right have turned inward after their disappointment with President George W. Bush. In their place, George's friends among the Catholic bishops have stepped to the fore, hammering Obama for his pro-choice Catholic cabinet nominees, for being invited to speak at Notre Dame's commencement, for his stem-cell research policies and most recently for his health care proposals. 
 As Democrats have stepped up their explicitly religious appeals to Catholic voters, these bishops have pushed back against the intrusion on their turf. While Democrats talked of finding common ground on abortion, Archbishop Charles Chaput of Denver, the informal leader of this side of the American church, gave a much-publicized speech denouncing Obama as ''the most committed abortion rights candidate in history.'' Chaput chose to publish his remarks on the Web site of a think tank co-founded by George -- the man who had himself argued in an essay disseminated widely last fall through conservative circles, Fox News and Christian radio that Barack Obama was ''the most extreme pro-abortion candidate ever to seek'' the presidency. 
 George's role as an adviser to these bishops began more than 20 years ago, when he was a young professor and recent Ph.D. A mutual friend introduced him to the Rev. John Myers, then a bishop in Peoria, Ill., who was working on a pastoral letter about the moral obligations of Catholic voters and politicians. With George's assistance, Myers wrote a letter laying out the case that abortion, as the taking of a life, was a crime against the natural law of human reason, not merely a violation of Catholic theology. Therefore, Myers and George argued, Catholic politicians and voters were wrong to write off the church's teachings as a matter of personal faith. What's more, the letter warned, voting for a candidate or a law upholding abortion rights would almost invariably put a Catholic so far outside church teachings that he should not receive communion. As the first systematic rebuttal to Mario Cuomo and other Catholic politicians who support abortion rights, the letter kicked off a now-familiar debate inside the church. ''Whenever I venture out into the public square, I would almost invariably check it out with Robby first,'' Myers, now the archbishop of Newark, told me. Many of the bishops, Myers says, rely on George as ''a touchstone'' and ''the pre-eminent Catholic intellectual.''
 Last spring, George was invited to address an audience that included many bishops at a conference in Washington. He told them with typical bluntness that they should stop talking so much about the many policy issues they have taken up in the name of social justice. They should concentrate their authority on ''the moral social'' issues like abortion, embryonic stem-cell research and same-sex marriage, where, he argued, the natural law and Gospel principles were clear. To be sure, he said, he had no objections to bishops' ''making utter nuisances of themselves'' about poverty and injustice, like the Old Testament prophets, as long as they did not advocate specific remedies. They should stop lobbying for detailed economic policies like progressive tax rates, higher minimum wage and, presumably, the expansion of health care -- ''matters of public policy upon which Gospel principles by themselves do not resolve differences of opinion among reasonable and well-informed people of good will,'' as George put it.
 A few months later, in a July 17 letter to Congress, the bishops did something close to that in the health care debate. Setting aside decades of calls for universal coverage, the bishops pledged to fight any bill that failed to block the use of federal subsidies for insurance covering abortion. ''Stalin famously asked, 'How many divisions has the pope?' '' George wrote to me in an e-mail message after House Speaker Nancy Pelosi allowed a vote on an amendment that satisfied the bishops' demands. ''I guess Pelosi now knows.''
 In the American culture wars, George wants to redraw the lines. It is the liberals, he argues, who are slaves to a faith-based ''secularist orthodoxy'' of ''feminism, multiculturalism, gay liberationism and lifestyle liberalism.'' Conservatives, in contrast, speak from the high ground of nonsectarian public reason. George is the leading voice for a group of Catholic scholars known as the new natural lawyers. He argues for the enforcement of a moral code as strictly traditional as that of a religious fundamentalist. What makes his natural law ''new'' is that it disavows dependence on divine revelation or biblical Scripture -- or even history and anthropology. Instead, George rests his ethics on a foundation of ''practical reason'': ''invoking no authority beyond the authority of reason itself,'' as he put it in one essay.
 George's admirers say he is revitalizing a strain of Catholic natural-law thinking that goes back to St. Thomas Aquinas. His scholarship has earned him accolades from religious and secular institutions alike. In one notable week two years ago, he received invitations to deliver prestigious lectures at the Southern Baptist Theological Seminary and Harvard Law School. His critics, including many of his fellow Catholic scholars, argue that he is turning the church into a tool of Republican Party. They say he is too focused on the mechanics of sex and morality, neglecting the other sides of the Christian message: the corruption of human reason through original sin, the need for forgiveness and charity and the chance for redemption. Citing George's comparison of Catholic scholars who support abortion rights to defenders of chattel slavery, Cathleen Kaveny of the Notre Dame Law School, another scholar of law and theology in the Thomistic tradition, has called George and his allies ''Rambo Catholics'' and ''ecclesiastical bullies.'' 
 I met George 20 years ago, when I was a Princeton student and he was praying for tenure. The next time I saw him was in 2005, when he invited me back for a postelection conference on the future of the conservative movement. Rove spoke at lunch. To a movement still stinging from decades of condescension, George brings gleaming Ivory Tower credentials: degrees in law and theology from Harvard; a doctorate in philosophy of law from Oxford; a Supreme Court fellowship; and the endowed chair at Princeton that Woodrow Wilson once held. 
 In late August I returned to Princeton, where George was striding around a seminar room at the Princeton Theological Seminary -- ''John Paul II style,'' as he put it, a reference to the pontiff's habit of strolling as he spoke. At 54, George has thick gray-brown hair, bright blue eyes and a certain boyishness. Seemingly everyone from Rove to Cardinal Rigali calls him, simply, Robby. A few dozen graduate and star-undergraduate students had traveled from as far away as Cambridge and Poland for a seminar on the new natural law. He is by all accounts a terrific teacher. (''Awesome,'' several undergraduates said in a stack of glowing evaluations he showed me.) Part of the reason may be that he brings almost every philosophical question back to a central debate about the nature of the self, a battle between reason and the passions. Moral philosophy, as George describes it, is a contest between the Greek philosopher Aristotle and the Scottish enlightenment thinker David Hume. 
 Aristotelians, like St. Thomas Aquinas, hold that there is an objective moral order. Human reason can see it. And we have the free will to follow or not. ''In a well-ordered soul, reason's got the whip hand over emotion,'' George told the seminar, in a favorite formulation borrowed from Plato. Humeans -- and in George's view, modern liberals are usually Humeans -- disagree. Against Aristotle, Hume argued that the universe includes facts but not values. You cannot derive moral conclusions from studying the world, an ''ought'' from an ''is.'' There is no built-in, objective reason for me to choose one goal over another -- the goals of Mother Teresa over the goals of Adolf Hitler, in George's hypothetical. Reason, then, is merely a tool of whatever desire strikes my fancy. ''Reason is and ought only to be the slave of the passions and may pretend to no office other than to serve and obey them,'' George said, paraphrasing Hume, just as he does in seemingly every essay or lecture he writes. 
 In George's view, if I have no rational basis for picking one goal over another, then I have no free choice, only predetermined ''passions'' -- the result of genetics, a blow to the head, whatever made me prefer either curing the sick or killing the Jews. We have reason and free choice, he teaches, or we have amorality and determinism.
 George's thinking draws on a system of ethics first developed against the backdrop of the 1960s debate inside the Catholic Church over contraception. In the tradition of Aquinas, Catholic thinkers had for centuries tried to establish moral laws of nature by studying biology, anthropology and history. When it came to sex, the church taught the idea of a ''perverted faculty.'' Sex was intended for the dual purpose of procreation and marital unity, so deliberate ejaculation in any other context -- oral or anal sex, artificial contraception, masturbation, premarital sex, adultery -- demeaned sex and contravened the natural law. (Female orgasms, incidental to conception, were not an issue.)
 But by the late 1960s, most secular philosophers had abandoned the project of finding moral norms in nature. Amid the openness of the Second Vatican Council, some of their Catholic counterparts began to wonder if they should give up, too. Then came the pill. Some Catholic scholars, all the way up to the level of papal advisers, questioned whether a form of birth control that did not put a physical barrier between the partners might be permissible. Some began to suggest that the church should shift its focus from the act of sex to the totality of marriage, as Protestants did, and stop worrying as much about ejaculation and contraception. Wasn't it marital love that was meant to be fruitful and that gave sex its meaning? 
 An orthodox-minded Georgetown University philosopher named Germain Grisez mounted a novel defense of the birth-control ban. Instead of beginning with science or history, he started by listing certain basic human goods that he believed anyone could see were ''integral to human flourishing,'' like friendship, knowledge, excellence in work and play, religion, life and procreation. Each was an end in itself, not a means to anything else. You could never prove each's value by referring to other values -- only assert and defend each one on its own. 
 Grisez argued that contraception violated the ''basic good'' of ''the handing on of new life.'' For George and the new natural lawyers, Grisez's tactic of starting from self-evident human goods gave ''the whip hand'' back to reason.
 In practice, George and his allies have usually found the rules of sexuality quite absolute, while the church's teachings about social justice come out more contingent. That may be why he is almost uniformly popular among evangelicals but controversial among many of his fellow Catholics, particularly those who prefer the church's peace-and-justice liberalism to its conservative bioethics. 
 On the question of capital punishment, George says he is against it but he considers it a matter of interpretation about which Catholics can disagree. The intentional killing of innocent civilians in war is as grave a moral crime as abortion, George says, but what constitutes a ''just war'' is a more complicated judgment call. Before the 2003 invasion of Iraq, he wrote an op-ed article in The Wall Street Journal arguing that the attack was not necessarily unjust and might even be a moral obligation. ''On the evidence that Hillary Clinton voted for the war on and George Bush went to war on, I thought it was justified,'' he told me.
 The ''rights'' to education and health care are another matter, George told his seminar. ''Who is supposed to provide education or health care to whom?'' George asked. ''Health care and education are things that you have to pay for. Resources are always finite,'' he went on. ''Is it better for education and health care to be provided by governments under socialized systems or by private providers in markets or by some combination?'' Those questions, George said, ''go beyond the application of moral principles. You can get all the moral principles dead right and not have an answer to any of those questions.''
 But the argument for banning abortion and embryo-destructive research is ''straightforward,'' George told me several times. In his most recent book, ''Embryo,'' written with Christopher Tollefsen, George tells the story of Noah Benton Markham, rescued from Hurricane Katrina by a team of policemen in boats. Noah was an embryo frozen in liquid nitrogen on a hospital shelf. Later implanted in the womb of his biological mother, he will turn 3 next month. Science shows that you remain the same human with the same DNA as a teenager, a toddler and an embryo, George argues. The only moral debate, he says, is whether you deserve legal protection at each stage of your life.
 George grew up in Morgantown, W.Va., the oldest of five brothers. All served as altar boys. Four attended Oxford and became lawyers. His father was a liquor broker, and George is a wine connoisseur. His mother, the daughter of Italian immigrants, taught her children ''some pretty firm ideas about sexual morality,'' George told me, and then he begged me not to repeat some of his more recent arguments on the subject. ''Mom, I have got to explain!'' George said, raising his voice to imitate first himself and then his mother: '' 'George's opposition to sodomy! What are you doing talking about sodomy? You shouldn't even know what that is! Why do people have to know your views about that?' 
 ''The Roman Stoic Musonius Rufus said, Look, there are some things you just shouldn't have to talk about, and I think sex is one,'' George said. ''But in the circumstances we are in, what can you do? I can't possibly make the case -- to people on my own side or on the other side -- about what I think marriage is and why it is so important unless we get into the earthy stuff.''
 The same-sex marriage debate, George argues, illuminates an error in our understanding that he blames for most of the ills afflicting modern marriage -- infidelity, divorce, out-of-wedlock births. Marriage is not just for procreation, love or sexual pleasure. ''People have lost their grip on the true reasons for marrying, so they are unwilling to make all the sacrifices real marriage requires,'' he said. 
 He admits the argument for marriage between a man and a woman can require ''somewhat technical philosophical analysis.'' It is a two-step case that starts with marriage and works its way back to sex. First, he contends that marriage is a uniquely ''comprehensive'' union, meaning that it is shared at several different levels at once -- emotional, spiritual and bodily. ''And the really interesting evidence that it is comprehensive is that it is anchored in bodily sharing,'' he says. 
 ''Ordinary friendships wouldn't be friendships anymore if they involved bodily sharing,'' he explained to me. ''If I, despite being a married man, had this female friend of mine and I said, 'Well, gosh, why don't we do some bodily sharing,' and we had straightforward sexual intercourse, well, that wouldn't be friendship or marriage. It is bodily, O.K., but it is not part of a comprehensive sharing of life. My comprehensive sharing of life is with my wife, which I just now violated.'' But just as friendships with sex are not friendships, marriage without sex is not marriage. Sex, George said, is the key to this ''comprehensive unity.'' He then imagined himself as a man with no interest in sex who proposed to seal a romance by committing to play tennis only with his beloved. Breaking that promise, he said, would not be adultery. 
 The second step is more complicated, and more graphic. George argues that only vaginal intercourse -- ''procreative-type'' sex acts, as George puts it -- can consummate this ''multilevel'' mind-body union. Only in reproduction, unlike digestion, circulation, respiration or any other bodily function, do two individuals perform a single function and thus become, in effect, ''one organism.'' Each opposite-sex partner is incomplete for the task; yet together they create a ''one-flesh union,'' in the language of Scripture. ''Their bodies become one (they are biologically united, and do not merely rub together) in coitus (and only in coitus), similarly to the way in which one's heart, lungs and other organs form a unity by coordinating for the biological good of the whole,'' George writes in a draft of his latest essay on the subject. Unloving sex between married partners does not perform the same multilevel function, he argues, nor does oral or anal sex -- even between loving spouses.
 Infertile couples, too, are performing this uniquely shared reproductive function, George says, even if they know their sperm and ovum cannot complete it. Marriage is designed in part for procreation in the way a baseball team is designed for winning games, he says, but ''people who can practice baseball can be teammates without victories on the field.''
 George argues that reason alone shows that heterosexual sodomy and homosexual sex are morally wrong, just as the Catholic Church, classical philosophers and other religious traditions have historically taught. Unlike marital union in his special sense, he contends, such acts treat the body as an instrument of the mind's pleasure. As both a practical and a philosophical matter, he argues, the law should not necessarily police such things. But the need for the state to establish a proper definition of marriage is a different matter, he says, because the law has always regulated it in the interest of parenthood and community. ''Marriage in principle is a public institution,'' he said. ''I don't think it can be like bar mitzvahs or baptisms or the Elks Club.''
 It is safe to say that not many contemporary philosophers -- whether secular or Catholic -- agree with George's marriage argument. Many balk at the mystical ''unitive and procreative'' qualities George ascribes to sexual intercourse. The idea of ''one flesh'' union seems far less obviously intelligible than other ''basic goods'' like friendship, knowledge or religion. Even fellow Catholic Thomists who oppose same-sex marriage question the esoteric quality of George's argument. Why not just begin with the fact that humans are sexual and ask how best to channel that sexuality? Liberals, on the other hand, generally argue that the meaning of marriage is in the partners' love, not their loins. (To which George counters that they offer no definition that would exclude polygamy.)
 GEORGE ONCE WON two terms as governor of the West Virginia Democratic Youth Conference in high school and even served as an alternate delegate to the 1976 Democratic convention. He moved right in the 1980s, initially over the issue of abortion, which eventually took him back to politics. On the day of the Pennsylvania primary in the 1992 presidential campaign, Bob Casey, then the state's governor (and the father of the current Senator Casey) surprised George with a phone call to talk about George's criticisms of Mario Cuomo. Later that year, when Bill Clinton denied Casey a chance to speak about abortion at the 1992 Democratic convention, it was George who had helped to write Casey's speech. Two years later, George represented Mother Teresa before the Supreme Court in an amicus brief seeking the overturning of Roe v. Wade. When George W. Bush became president in 2001, George was an active player in weekly White House conference calls for Catholic allies. Bush later awarded George a Presidential Citizens Medal. During the 2008 campaign, Rudy Giuliani, Mitt Romney and John McCain each sought George's counsel.
 At Princeton, George founded an independently financed center, the James Madison Program in American Ideals and Institutions. Conservatives celebrate it for bringing conservative thinking to the campus and for adding ''Princeton'' to the resumes of young scholars. In the decade since its founding, George has helped scholars and foundations use it as a template for similar outfits at Georgetown, New York University and Williams College. Last spring, he joined a group of undergraduates in their call for a new university Center for Chastity and Abstinence. (He suggested they might have better luck with the name ''Center for Love and Fidelity.'') 
 George's left-leaning colleagues say he is unfailingly polite and even helpful. He co-teaches a great-books seminar with the African-American scholar Cornel West, who told me he thinks of George as ''just a nice brother.'' George and his wife, Cindy, who is Jewish, socialize with liberal professors. But his relationships with other Catholic scholars are sometimes more contentious, especially about politics. 
 Shortly after the last presidential election, John Haldane, an eminent Thomist who is a friend of George's and an adviser to the Vatican, sent an open ''Letter to America'' to a Web site of the Witherspoon Institute, a conservative think tank that George helped found. Citing issues like the Iraq war and the Wall Street debacle, Haldane argued that Obama won in part because American voters ''took moral exception to some of the policies pursued by the Bush administration, and I believe that in this their judgment was correct.'' 
 Haldane, an orthodox Catholic opponent of abortion and same-sex marriage, argued that his fellow ''moral conservatives'' like George risked their own credibility if they continued attacking Obama as morally inferior. When I reached him by phone in Scotland, where he lives, Haldane told me that he could not have recommended voting for either candidate in America's 2008 election. ''If you were going to vote for John McCain, how are you going to square that with these discussions about social justice -- about the running sore of structural deprivation running through American society, or the prosecution of an unjust war?'' he asked. ''There has been a tendency of social conservatives to either hold their noses because they are more concerned about abortion, or just not to notice the smell.''
 When I asked George about the letter, he was derisive. ''John, thanks for the advice!'' he said sarcastically. ''Gosh, I wish we would have taken it. We would have the strong and vibrant social conservative movement that you guys have in Great Britain!''
 George instead is plunging deeper into partisan politics. Alarmed at signs that the Republican Party was moving away from cultural issues, he recently founded a new group called the American Principles Project, which aims to build a grass-roots movement around his ideas. ''His new venture will make him a major political player,'' the conservative writer Fred Barnes predicted in The Weekly Standard. Among the group's first endeavors has been to call for the ouster of Kevin Jennings, an Obama education official who previously founded the Gay, Lesbian and Straight Education Network. Jennings, George says, wants to ''use our elementary schools in defiance of the wishes of parents, to use our elementary schools to teach pro-sexual-liberationist, pro-homosexualist propaganda.'' 
 I asked George several times if he was really hoping to ground a mass movement in abstract principles of reason so at odds with the prevailing culture. It was a bet, he said, on his conviction about the innate human gift for reason. Still, he said, if there was one critique of his work that worried him, it was the charge that he puts too much faith in the power of reason, overlooking what Christians describe as original sin and what secular pessimists call history. 
 It is a debate at least as old as the Reformation, when Martin Luther broke with the Catholic Church and insisted that reason was so corrupted that faith in the divine was humanity's only hope of salvation. (Until relatively recently, contemporary evangelicals routinely leveled the same charge at modern Catholics.) ''This is a serious issue, and if I am wrong, this is where I am wrong,'' George acknowledges. 
 Over lunch last month at the Princeton faculty club, George noted that many evangelicals had signed the Manhattan Declaration despite the traditional Protestant skepticism about the corruption of human reason. ''I sold my view about reason!'' he declared. He was especially pleased that, by signing onto the text, so many Catholic bishops had endorsed his new natural-law argument about marriage. ''It really is the top leadership of the American church,'' he said. 
 ''Obviously, I am gratified that view appears to have attracted a very strong following among the bishops,'' he went on. ''I just hope I am right. If they are going to buy my arguments, I don't want to mislead the whole church.''

PERSON: F. William McCalpin 

HEADLINE: F. William McCalpin, Champion of Legal Aid to Poor, Dies at 88

BYLINE: By DENNIS HEVESI

 BODY:
F. William McCalpin, one of the earliest advocates and most vocal defenders of the Legal Services Corporation, a federal program that has provided legal aid to millions of poor people, died Dec. 9 at his home in St. Louis. He was 88.
 The cause was complications from a fall, his son William said. 
 Mr. McCalpin, who butted heads with the Reagan administration when it sought to eliminate the program he had long championed, was chairman of the corporation from 1979 through 1981 and a member of its board from 1993 to 2003.
 Legal Services was created by Congress in 1974 with the backing of President Richard M. Nixon and, with federal financing, today supports 137 organizations in all 50 states. The organizations offer legal representation to about one million poor people involved in noncriminal cases and legal advice to five million more. 
 In 1981, President Ronald Reagan tried to abolish the Legal Services Corporation by cutting its $321 million allocation from the federal budget. Reagan had long maintained that legal aid lawyers were activists too willing to pursue their own vision of the public interest. 
 Over the years, legal aid lawyers have filed many class-action and law-reform suits, among them efforts to force federal, state and local governments to pay benefits mandated by social welfare legislation, to improve hospital services for the poor and to improve prison conditions. The lawyers have spent most of their time, however, on routine matters like family disputes, disability claims and landlord-tenant problems.
 ''It is ironic -- no, tragic -- that this record of positive achievement is met with the most fundamental attack on the program since it was created,'' Mr. McCalpin said in March 1981 in testimony before a House Judiciary subcommittee.
 Eliminating the program, he said, would amount to a denial of the nation's commitment to equal justice under law, ''putting a price tag on justice, just like a Cadillac or a yacht.'' 
 Congress restored the corporation's financing.
 ''Bill was very proud to be a Republican,'' Victor M. Fortuno, the corporation's current vice president for legal affairs, said Monday in an interview. ''But he was also very supportive of the notion of equal access to justice and the availability of legal services to the poor. He stood for that and fought for that his entire professional career.''
 Mr. McCalpin was chairman of the American Bar Association's Committee on the Availability of Legal Services from 1965 to 1970; chairman of the bar association's Committee on Legal Aid and Indigent Defendants from 1973 to 1976, and again from 1983 to 1985; and chairman of its Commission on Legal Problems of the Elderly from 1996 to 2002.
 He was also director of the Legal Aid Society of St. Louis from 1965 to 1970; president of the Missouri Legal Aid Society in 1977 and 1978; and president of the National Legal Aid and Defender Association from 1989 to 1992. 
 ''He was one of the early leaders of the bar in the evolution of the movement, and acted with great principle in championing the rights of poor people,'' Carolyn B. Lamm, the president of the American Bar Association, said Tuesday.
 Francis William McCalpin was born in St. Louis on Nov. 8, 1921, one of three children of George and Marguerite Miles McCalpin. His father was a stockbroker. 
 Besides his son William, he is survived by his wife of 55 years, the former Margaret Wickes; another son, David; three daughters, Martha Staley, Katherine Winfrey and Lucy McCalpin; his brother, George; his sister, Mary Moss; and 18 grandchildren.
 Mr. McCalpin graduated from St. Louis University in 1942 with a bachelor's degree in economics, then served in the Marines in the Pacific. He was later recalled into the Marines during the Korean War.
 He received his law degree from Harvard in 1948 and was soon hired by a law firm in St. Louis.
 ''Early on in his legal career, he was assigned poor clients by the courts,'' William McCalpin said of his father. ''I remember one client, Gerald Thomas, who served time for burglary. My father bought Christmas presents, and we took them over to the family. He thought there should be a more organized way to represent poor people.''

HEADLINE: Senate Democrats Claim Votes for Health Care Bill

BYLINE: By DAVID M. HERSZENHORN and CARL HULSE; Robert Pear contributed reporting.

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
Senate Democrats said Saturday that they had clinched an agreement on a far-reaching overhaul of the nation's health care system and forged ahead with efforts to approve the legislation by Christmas over Republican opposition. 
 As the Senate convened in a blizzard, Democratic leaders hailed a breakthrough that came when Senator Ben Nelson, Democrat of Nebraska, agreed to back the bill after 13 hours of negotiations on Friday, making him the pivotal 60th vote for a measure that President Obama has called his top domestic priority. 
 ''Change is never easy, but change is what's necessary in America,'' Mr. Nelson said at a morning news conference. ''And that's why I intend to vote,'' he said, ''for health care reform.'' 
 Mr. Obama, appearing on television from the White House, said: ''Today is a major step forward for the American people. After nearly a century-long struggle, we are on the cusp of making health care reform a reality in the United States of America.'' 
 The legislation, the most significant overhaul of the nation's health care system in more than a generation, seeks to extend health benefits to more than 30 million uninsured Americans.
 The blinding snow outside the Capitol added to what had already been a chaotic few weeks for the Senate, which has met every day since Nov. 30 and was working through its third consecutive weekend. The sergeant-at-arms had four-wheel-drive vehicles at the ready to bring lawmakers in for votes. And while senators wore the jackets and ties required on the Senate floor, dress shoes gave way to boots.
 Mr. Nelson committed his vote after winning tighter restrictions on insurance coverage for abortions, as well as increased federal health care aid for his state. 
 With Senate leaders increasingly confident that they would pass the bill, Mr. Nelson pointedly warned that he would oppose the final version if negotiations with the House, which approved its bill last month, result in changes that he does not like. 
 But House liberals are expected to resist some concessions made in the Senate. To secure the votes of centrist holdouts, Senate leaders dropped a proposed government-run health insurance plan, or public option, and an alternate plan to let some people ages 55 to 65 buy coverage through Medicare, both favored by liberals. 
 Because the Democrats nominally control 60 seats in the Senate -- the precise number needed to overcome a Republican filibuster -- every senator in the Democratic caucus effectively has veto power over the bill. No Republican is willing to support it. 
 ''The lines are drawn,'' said Senator Richard M. Burr, Republican of North Carolina. ''He has to get 60 votes. If he doesn't get 60 votes, the American people win. If he does get them, America's payback will come in the form of the 2010 elections.'' 
 Not all Democrats have publicly said they will vote for the bill, but Senate leaders and senior White House officials believe they have agreement. 
 ''All Senate Democrats stand shoulder to shoulder with President Obama and the American people, who know that inaction is not an option,'' the majority leader, Senator Harry Reid of Nevada, said at a news conference. 
 Faced with Republican resistance that many Democrats saw as driven more by politics than policy disagreements, Senate Democrats in recent days gained new determination to bridge differences among themselves and prevail over the opposition.
 Lawmakers who attended a private meeting between Mr. Obama and Senate Democrats at the White House on Tuesday pointed to remarks there by Senator Evan Bayh, Democrat of Indiana, as providing some new inspiration. 
 Mr. Bayh said that the health care measure was the kind of public policy he had come to Washington to work on, according to officials who attended the session, and that he did not want to see the satisfied looks on the faces of Republican leaders if they succeeded in blocking the measure. 
 The measure would extend health benefits by expanding Medicaid and providing subsidies to help moderate-income people buy private insurance. It would require nearly all Americans to obtain insurance or pay financial penalties for failing to do so.
 By redrawing the health care sector, the legislation stands to reshape roughly one-sixth of the American economy. 
 The nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office said the legislation would cost $871 billion over 10 years, with the expense more than offset by revenues from new taxes and fees and by reductions in government spending, particularly on Medicare. 
 The budget office said the bill would reduce future deficits by $132 billion over that period. 
 Republicans have accused Democrats of using accounting tricks to hide the true cost of the measure, which they predicted would be huge, particularly if Congress did not follow through with the Medicare cuts. 
 In place of the public option, the Senate bill would create at least two national insurance plans modeled after those offered to federal workers, including members of Congress. The bill includes a new government-run long-term-care insurance program. And it imposes tight new regulations on the health insurance industry, barring insurers from denying coverage based on pre-existing medical conditions and limiting how much extra they can charge based on age. 
 Mr. Reid, racing to complete the bill by his self-imposed holiday deadline, on Saturday morning introduced a 383-page package of amendments, including the provisions needed to win Mr. Nelson's support. 
 Republicans, who vowed to use every procedural weapon to stop the bill, immediately forced a reading of Mr. Reid's proposal, which wrapped up shortly before 4 p.m. The Senate adjourned about two hours later on track for a crucial procedural vote at 1 a.m. Monday and a final vote on Christmas Eve.
 Negotiations with the House are expected to be completed after New Year's. Under the deal worked out with Mr. Nelson, health insurance plans would not be required or forbidden to cover abortions, but states could prohibit the coverage of abortions by plans that are offered for sale through new government-regulated marketplaces. 
 The amendment also includes, solely for Nebraska, a special extension of increased federal contributions to the cost of expanding Medicaid, the state-federal insurance program for the poor. 
 Mr. Reid introduced his amendment after the Senate easily approved and sent to Mr. Obama a $626 billion military spending bill in an extraordinary session that began before sunrise and reflected the increasingly toxic atmosphere in a chamber that normally prides itself on decorum. Despite the 88 to 10 vote, the Pentagon bill was the focus of some angry partisanship. Republicans, who typically vote in unison for military spending measures, especially at a time when the country is fighting two wars, stalled the bill this week even as money was running out for the Pentagon. It was an effort to throw yet another roadblock in the path of Democrats on health care. 
 The year-end spending measure also included a two-month extension of jobless pay and health coverage for the unemployed.
 For weeks, in floor speeches and news conferences, Republicans have warned ominously that the health care bill would spell disaster, raising taxes and hurting families and small businesses by increasing health care costs over the long term and reducing medical services for older patients. 
 ''This bill is a legislative train wreck of historic proportions,'' the Republican leader, Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky said.
 Senator Olympia J. Snowe, a Maine Republican who had been considered a possible Democratic ally, said she would oppose the measure because it was being rushed. ''It is a take-it-or-leave-it package,'' she said.
 Central to the deal to win Mr. Nelson's support on the health care package was an agreement on the emotionally charged issue of insurance coverage for abortions. Mr. Nelson wanted air-tight restrictions, but an amendment that he proposed was defeated on Dec. 8.
 Under Mr. Reid's amendment, some health plans receiving federal subsidies could offer coverage for abortion, but they could not use federal money to pay for the procedure. They would have to use money taken from premiums paid by subscribers and would have to keep it separate from federal money.
 Two of the Senate's champions of abortion rights, Senators Barbara Boxer, Democrat of California and Patty Murray, Democrat of Washington, issued a joint statement, saying they were satisfied with the agreement. 
 ''We said we would not accept language that prohibited a woman from using her own private funds for her legal reproductive health care -- this compromise meets that test,'' they said.
 Some anti-abortion groups reacted angrily, including Nebraska Right to Life, which said it had been ''betrayed'' by Mr. Nelson.

HEADLINE: The Chocolate Wars

BYLINE: By KIM SEVERSON

 BODY:
It's been a tough month to avoid chocolate. Office candy bowls overflow. Leftover Hanukkah gelt beckons. And home bakers are deep into holiday kitchen marathons.
 In the Cadbury corporate boardroom, British confectionary executives are fighting off a $16.2 billion takeover bid by Kraft Foods. Waiting in the wings is Hershey's, which already has a license to sell an Americanized version of the British chocolate in the United States.
 The big prizes are emerging markets like India, where Cadbury is the confection of choice among the young upwardly mobile who are starting to buy chocolate for holidays instead of the more traditional sweets called mithai. 
 But for many Brits, the business impact is beside the point. The prospect of Americans taking over production of their beloved Dairy Milk and Flake bars has sent the country into an emotional tailspin.
 ''When it comes to protecting our chocolate -- the taste of British childhood -- then we turn and fight,'' wrote MayorBoris Johnson of London in The Telegraph this month.
 ''We face an appalling choice of succumbing either to Kraft, makers of the plastic flaps of orange cheese, or to Hershey, whose Hershey bars have been likened in flavor -- by independent experts -- to a mixture of soap powder and baby vomit.''
 Americans eat about 12 pounds of chocolate a year, about half as much chocolate as Britons. But we feel just as strongly about our own confection. Chocolate has served as a beloved barometer of social mores, cultural shifts and economic conditions since before Milton Hershey turned out the first bar in 1900.Thomas Jefferson, for one, loved it.
 ''It's an intrinsically important thing to people,'' said John Scharffenberger, the winemaker-turned-chocolate guru who in 2005 sold his well-regarded artisan company to Hershey for an estimated $50 million. ''It connects to our emotions and our thinking.''
 Chocolate's social role has been wide ranging. At the turn of the century, chocolate cigarettes were marketed toward women who felt social pressure not to smoke in public. Chocolate has been included in war rations as a kind of morale booster for troops since 1937. During the Great Depression, Hershey's nickel chocolate bar made for an affordable lunch.
 More recently, chocolate has come to mean luxury. Godiva, which Campbell's Soup owned for decades until selling it to a Turkish conglomerate, opened its first store on Fifth Avenue in 1972. Before long, it spread to shopping malls and became the chocolate of choice for the aspirational middle class.
 When America went on a health kick in the early part of this decade, chocolate and its anti-oxidants went along. When the country became food obsessed, fancy chocolate bars with complex names and cacao levels were a way to separate the real players from the Godiva crowd.
 Premium chocolate is the fastest growing part of what will be an $18 billion chocolate market by 2011, according to a report by the market research group Packaged Facts.
 Shelves at places like Whole Foods are crowded with chocolate from smaller producers and specific countries, reflecting a growing desire for food that is less processed, less packaged and more authentic. (Sorry, locavores. All cocoa is grown within 15 degrees of the equator.)
 And now, Cadbury and Nestle are selling fair trade-certified Dairy Milk and Kit Kat bars in Britain, meaning producers are assured a fair price and consumers are promised that child labor and other unsavory practices weren't used.
 But as it did during the Depression, chocolate has emerged in the past year as a barometer for the economy. In an age of shrinking household budgets and financial insecurity, chocolate remains an inexpensive and reassuring treat.
 That's why higher-end chocolate sold well at Valentine's Day as people traded down on big-ticket luxury items and traded up on affordable ones, said Marcia Mogelonsky, a senior analyst at Mintel. But even inexpensive chocolate bars are prospering. Snickers, named in 1930 after a favorite horse of its inventor, still sells about $2 billion worth a year.
 In fact, if you want to give someone a piece of cultural reassurance for Christmas, consider Hershey's and Reese's nostalgic variety pack -- 20 candy bars in wrappers with original designs selling for $17.99 on Amazon.
 Because at the end of the day, chocolate can be as much about history as it is about taste. And that's true whether you grew up in London or New York.

HEADLINE: Taming the Fat Cats

 BODY:
President Obama seems genuinely, if belatedly, upset about the way America's voracious bankers leveraged hundreds of billions in taxpayer bailouts to line their pockets with multibillion-dollar bonuses while American businesses starve for credit. 
 Before he gets over his anger, he might want to take a look at how the British found a way to realign the fat cats' boundless greed with the public interest: slapping a hefty windfall tax on their bonuses. He still has time to push Congress to enact a similar levy here. 
 Bankers have rushed to repay their bailout loans to the Treasury so they can avoid the constraints on compensation that came with the assistance. Unshackled, they are putting together bonus pools for 2009 that would rival the record-breaking packages of 2007 -- the year before their foolhardy bets tipped the world into its worst economic crisis since the 1930s.
 The administration can make a very good case that the Treasury is entitled to much of this money. After all, what profits the banks have made over the last year were funded by oodles of cheap financing provided by the Federal Reserve. This is a windfall that they should not be allowed to keep.
 We can think of a lot of good ways to use the revenue from a windfall tax, starting with a more robust program to create jobs for out-of-work Americans. 
 The British government expects to make nearly $1 billion from a 50 percent tax on bonuses above about $40,000. While this is not much, the financial sector in the United States is much larger. Moreover, a tax just might persuade banks to cut their bonuses and use the money to bolster their capital, which would make them more financially secure.
 Bankers are likely to scream -- threatening to leave the country and arguing that such narrow taxation is unconstitutional. The best in the accounting business will undoubtedly be tasked with coming up with strategies to avoid taxation, by pushing bonuses back in time or with other ruses. No one should be intimidated. 
 Threats to move overseas are empty. London is out of the picture. The French president, Nicolas Sarkozy, has said he would follow the British lead. Germany and other countries could be persuaded to impose taxes of their own. And it would make little sense for bankers to move halfway around the world to Singapore to avoid a one-off tax that would not affect future bonuses.
 Congress also has time to pass a tax on 2009 bonuses because most are expected to be paid in 2010. And the constitutional ban of bills aimed to punish a specific group -- so-called bills of attainder -- is unlikely to apply because a tax would not be aimed to punish named people but an economic class. 
 A windfall tax on bankers' bonuses would not be enough, but it would be a start. The government also needs to ensure that all banks reform their compensation practices to better align rewards with performance, good and bad. That is the best hope for curbing bankers' unbridled appetite for risk.

HEADLINE: The Wealthy As Crusaders For Justice

BYLINE: By HARRY HURT III

 BODY:
IMAGINE that Warren Buffett, profoundly moved by a visit to the disaster zone created by Hurricane Katrina, summons 16 aging, very wealthy friends to an exclusive Hawaiian hotel. The group includes George Soros, Ted Turner, Bill Cosby, Paul Newman, Barry Diller, Ross Perot and Bill Gates Sr., as well as one woman, Yoko Ono.
At Mr. Buffett's behest, they agree to join forces to fundamentally transform America's economic, political and social landscape before another natural or human-caused apocalypse strikes. 
 That is the premise of ''Only the Super-Rich Can Save Us!'' (Seven Stories Press, $27.50), a clever, fanciful, thought-provoking but pedantically verbose new book by Ralph Nader. 
 ''This book is not a novel,'' Mr. Nader proclaims in an introductory author's note. ''Nor is it nonfiction. In the literary world, it might be described as 'a practical utopia.' I call it a fictional vision that could become a new reality.''
 At 75, Mr. Nader, a lawyer and consumer advocate, has become as famous as the billionaire protagonists in his book. Named by both Time and Life magazines as one of the 100 most influential Americans of the 20th century, he is author or co-author of more than 30 other books, including ''Unsafe at Any Speed,'' his pioneering 1965 look at vehicle safety issues. He has also made four runs for president as a third-party candidate.
 The book is his answer to Ayn Rand's 1957 best-selling novel ''Atlas Shrugged,'' in which leaders of a capitalist society go on strike to protest ever-increasing government control of free enterprise.
 Mr. Nader, by contrast, puts his eclectic, rich cadre to work on an economic, political and social rescue mission of sweeping proportions. ''They were alike in only three ways: they were old, very rich and very unrepresentative of humanity, which they intended to save from itself,'' he writes.
 Acting semi-covertly, Mr. Buffett et al. call themselves ''the Meliorists'' (after the belief that humans can help improve the world) and vow to advance seven principles, which the author describes as ''a living wage, health insurance, tax reform, sustainable energy, more equitable distribution of wealth, electoral reform and the seeding of deeper forms of democracy.'' 
 Mr. Cosby and Mr. Newman get the Meliorists' ball rolling by staging a telethon to show how ''the media uses public property -- the airwaves -- to foster complacency, serve power, sell junk and trivialize or distort or cover up the news.''
 Ms. Ono designs a graphic symbol she calls the ''Seventh Generation Eye,'' intended t o represent ''the principle that leaders must weigh all their decisions in terms of their impact on the future as far as the seventh generation to come.'' Not to be upstaged, the irrepressible Mr. Turner organizes Sun God festivals where attractive young women lead celebrations of the sun as a clean energy source.
 Under the banner ''Everybody a Corporation,'' Mr. Gates encourages people to incorporate themselves because corporations ''had more freedom to sue, to go bankrupt, to pay lower taxes, to receive welfare; they could create overseas subsidiaries and holding companies, and they could avoid being jailed because they were artificial entities.'' 
 Mr. Gates and the Houston tort lawyer Joe Jamail deliberately inflame and distract right-wing opponents by starting ''decoy'' campaigns, one of which calls for rewriting the last words of the Pledge of Allegiance to read ''with liberty and justice for some.'' 
 The Meliorists, meanwhile, organize the Clean Elections Party, dedicated to reforming campaign finance laws and throwing corrupt politicians out of office. They educate the public on how citizens' utility boards, once confined to matters involving gas and electric companies, can be used to address almost any issue. They lead a successful campaign to unionize Wal-Mart as part of a larger effort to reform a ''low-wage business economy.'' 
 In response to the Meliorist threat, the establishment powers hire a pit-bull-carrying former corporate raider, the fictional Lancelot Lobo, to counterattack. Lobo enlists detectives to bug the Hawaiian hotel and spends millions on negative media ads. But his efforts are thwarted when he unexpectedly falls in love with Ms. Ono. 
 The Meliorists achieve most of their seven-point agenda. The American citizenry celebrates Labor Day with joyous parades, serious discussions about films like ''Norma Rae'' and demands for ''a new economic order where the people would be supreme over corporations and sovereign over their government.'' Mr. Newman proclaims to Phil Donahue, ''It's truly a Hollywood ending, except that it's real.''
 ALAS, the book is not likely to earn plaudits as a work of fiction, much less become the basis of a Hollywood movie. What Mr. Nader offers as scenes consist mainly of speechifying exchanges between protagonists who readily agree with each other. He bestows his antagonists with annoyingly implausible names like William Worldweight and Arnold Adverse. Though there are bursts of wry humor from the likes of Ms. Ono and Mr. Turner, the book tries a reader's patience by extending its narrative to a whopping 733 pages.
 In its own way, the book is as elitist as ''Atlas Shrugged.'' Despite his hard-earned populist credentials, Mr. Nader presents a scenario in which an enlightened few rescue the media-opiated masses from self-destruction. He eschews the Hobbesian nightmare of a nasty, brutish man in favor of the Rousseauian belief that man's basic good nature will eventually prevail. 
 But for better or worse, Mr. Nader's provocatively quirky dream of a ''practical utopia'' is not likely to become ''a new reality'' anywhere beyond the boundaries of his own imagination.

HEADLINE: LETTERS: Tax Cuts vs. Spending

 BODY:
To the Editor:
 Re ''Tax Cuts Might Accomplish What Spending Hasn't'' (Economic View, Dec. 13), in which N. Gregory Mankiw cited studies suggesting that tax policy is the best way to fight recession: 
 But who, exactly, should receive a tax cut? I suggest that those who cannot spend because they have lost their jobs, or do not spend because they fear they will lose their jobs, are those who would do most to heal our economy.
 Traditionally, the argument in favor of tax cuts is to encourage investment to stimulate the economy. It's not clear that the tax cuts of George W. Bush or Ronald Reagan, endorsing this trickle-down theory, accomplished this. If tax cuts are prescribed for those most likely to spend their added money, Professor Mankiw may have a point. If tax cuts go to ''investors,'' recent history hurts the argument.
 Richard Attanasio
 Cortlandt Manor, N.Y., Dec. 14
 To the Editor: 
 If cutting taxes provides more stimulus than spending, as N. Gregory Mankiw suggests, why didn't unrestrained deficit spending and tax cutting for the wealthy produce an economic miracle during the administration of George W. Bush? 
 Or is it that neither more wealth for the wealthy nor deficit spending is as important as investment? And what, then, is the relative merit of public investment versus private investment? Wouldn't both be better than either in desperate times? And if so, might we not finally move beyond the bitter old debate over tax cuts versus public spending?

HEADLINE: Buzzwords: Coining a Not Great Year

BYLINE: By MARK LEIBOVICH and GRANT BARRETT

 BODY:
You could Tweet all the highlights of 2009 and still have time for dithering. But to catalog the lingo? It would be like one long torture memo. We need to impose a timetable. Let's get right to our full plate.
It was a year for birthers, deathers and Tenthers to go all nine-iron on the Obama brand.
 Catchphrases and buzzwords can tell us much about a year past -- what resonated, what stuck, what the year revealed about the sensibility of the nation, whether you're a wise Latina woman, a mini-Madoff, a teabagger or Balloon Boy.
 But if ever there were a year to put buzzwords before a death panel, this would be it, before the aporkalypse comes. 
 If the year were a Government Motors car, it would be a clunker. There was so much distraction. Things like Great Recessions and mancessions will do that, distract you (like a Dracula sneeze). So will texting while driving, which is far more dangerous in the scheme of things than sexting (unless it's sexting while driving), and maybe even hiking the Appalachian Trail. Whatever, it was a year when a lot of people acted stupidly.
 What is there to say about a period in which Tea Parties, swine flu parties and a beer summit became desirable social engagements in certain circles?
 If you think any of this sounds fun, you lie.
 If this year were a state dinner, even the Salahis wouldn't Salahi it.
 If it were a purity test, it would be Scozzafava'd.
 So let's just call it an El Stiffo, pull the trigger and have Sully ditch the whole year in the Hudson. Declare 2009 a mulligan. You know Tiger wishes he could.
 But that's a public option. I'mma let you finish. --Mark Leibovich
 Grant Barrett's buzzwords for 2009:
 aporkalypse
 Undue worry in response to swine flu. Includes unnecessary acts like removing nonessential kisses from Mexican telenovelas and the mass slaughter of pigs in Egypt.
 athey
 An atheist. Usually derogatory.
 birther
 A person who believes that Barack Obama was not born in the United States and therefore can't be president.
 bonus tax
 A proposed levy on bonuses given to employees of companies that received federal bailout money. Related terms included botax, a proposed levy on cosmetic procedures. It would be used to help pay for health care reform and is a play on Botox, a trade name for a substance used to smooth skin wrinkles. There was also cow tax, what critics call a proposed fee for methane emissions. Would it apply to methane-emitting cows, they wonder?
 car tone
 Music or ambient noise proposed for use by electric cars, whose quietness otherwise makes them go unnoticed by pedestrians.
 Cash for Clunkers
 A government program in which older automobiles are exchanged for pollution credits or rebates on newer and more fuel-efficient models. First popular in 1990 but resurgent in 2009.
 Chimerica
 The intertwined economies of China and the United States, which together dominate the world economy. Popularized by Niall Ferguson in his book ''The Ascent of Money.''
 conflict minerals
 Gold, tin, tungsten and tantalum, widely used in electronic devices and commonly mined in politically unstable countries or regions. Related to conflict diamonds.
 crash blossom
 A headline that can be misconstrued, like ''Shark Attacks Puzzle Experts.'' Will Shortz is not in jeopardy; the sharks are just confounding scientists.
 death panel
 A supposed committee of doctors and/or bureaucrats who would decide which patients receive treatment, ostensibly leaving the rest to die. Also deather, someone who believes erroneously that the government would have death panels under health care reform.
 Dracula sneeze
 Covering the mouth with the crook of the elbow when sneezing, like Dracula hiding his face with a cape.
 drive like a Cullen
 To drive like a bat out of hell, like a member of the Cullen family in the ''Twilight'' vampire books by Stephenie Meyer.
 Government Motors
 A nickname for General Motors, which is now majority owned by the federal government.
 El Stiffo
 Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger of California said he wasn't El Stiffo, meaning a colorless character, after he was criticized for brandishing a large knife in a video promoting the sale of state property to raise money.
 gaymarry, gay-marry
 To marry someone of the same sex. Also used hyperbolically to mean to form an unconventional relationship, as in, ''I love my new cellphone so much I want to gay-marry it.''
 Great Recession
 A reference to the current economic downturn. Used at least a few times for every recession since 1980, but never with such vigor as now.
 green shoots
 Signs of an economic recovery or of a company's financial turnaround.
 heinie
 A pronunciation of H1N1, the swine flu virus.
 I'mma let you finish
 Part of Kanye West's interruption of Taylor Swift's acceptance speech at the MTV Video Music Awards, a widely popular joke meme on the Internet.
 jeggings
 Jean leggings.
 mancession
 A recession that affects men more than women. Also hecession.
 meep
 An exclamation used disruptively or nonsensically by young people. From Beaker of ''The Muppet Show.''
 mini-Madoff
 A person who perpetrates a Ponzi scheme smaller than Bernie Madoff's.
 netbook
 An inexpensive portable computer, usually smaller than a laptop but larger than a smartphone, intended mainly for use with the Internet.
 Octomom
 Nadya Suleman, who gave birth to octuplets in January.
 orphan books
 Volumes still in copyright but out of print and unavailable for sale, and whose copyright holders cannot be found. Rose in 2007 but peaked this year with the fierce discussion over the proposed Google Books settlement.
 public option
 A government-run health insurance program proposed as part of the health care legislation making its way through Congress.
 sexting
 The sending of sexual messages or pictures by mobile telephone.
 social distancing
 Staying away from other people so as not to catch or spread the flu. Common since late 2005 but surging in 2009.
 swine flu party
 A gathering held so people can be infected by a mild form of swine flu, in theory creating antibodies against more dangerous forms. Such a practice is universally discouraged by doctors.
 Tea Party
 An organized gathering of antitax, antigovernment and/or anti-Obama protestors. Also teabagger, a derogatory name for attendees of Tea Parties, probably coined in allusion to a sexual practice.
 Tenther
 A person who believes the federal government is mostly illegal because it usurps rights that belong to the states, in violation of the 10th Amendment, which reads, ''The powers not delegated to the United States by the Constitution, nor prohibited by it to the States, are reserved to the States respectively, or to the people.''
 torture memos
 Bush administration documents that secretly authorized the torture of suspected terrorists.
 vook
 A digital book that includes some video in its text.
 warmist
 Someone who believes that the earth is jeopardized by becoming warmer. Shortened from global warmist and used mainly by people who are skeptical about global warming.
 wise Latina woman
 A term used by Judge Sonya Sotomayor in a speech before she was a Supreme Court justice, suggesting to some observers that she believed ethnicity and gender had a role in determining law.
 ununbium
 The temporary name of a newly found element, Uub for short. It comes from the Latin for the element's number, 112.

In the last few decades, Alexander Calder (1898 to 1976) has quietly risen to almost mythical status in the pantheon of mid-20th-century American abstract artists -- no mean feat in a milieu where figures like Jackson Pollock, Willem de Kooning and Tony Smith are the competition. What distinguishes Calder from these other giants of art history may be his extraordinary versatility as an artist.
 Calder was primarily a sculptor. Soon after moving to Paris in 1926, he met Fernand Leger, Piet Mondrian, Pablo Picasso and other members of the European avant-garde and developed a body of inventive sculpture that owes much to Surrealism, especially the work of the Spanish artist Joan Miro. It was also in Paris that he took up printmaking, after befriending Stanley William Hayter, an expatriate British artist and influential printmaker. It was to remain a lifelong passion. 
 ''Alexander Calder: Printmaker,'' at the Bruce Museum, brings together 28 prints made throughout the artist's career, illustrating an impressive proficiency in many printmaking techniques. Additional paintings, drawings and gouaches, some related to his prints, show him to have been equally adept in handling other media.
 It is easy to assume that Calder, born in Philadelphia to a family of artists, was destined to be an artist. Not so, for he initially received a degree in mechanical engineering at the Stevens Institute of Technology in New Jersey, only later attending the Art Students League in New York, where he took classes in etching and lithography. 
 An early work in the show was probably produced as a class assignment in 1925, when Calder was in his mid-20s. ''Untitled (Skating in Central Park)'' (1924-26), on loan from the Whitney Museum of American Art, is a charming lithograph that is interesting less for its subject matter than for the artist's whimsical, economical single-line drawing technique. The image is so sparse that it almost borders on abstraction. 
 While living in Paris, Calder continued to produce prints and illustrations for books and journals. His many projects from this period include delightful pen-and-ink line drawings of animals for a 1931 publication of Aesop's fables. One drawing, on display along with a copy of the book, shows a lion, head down, tail high and ready to pounce on its prey. 
 As Calder's sculpture moved into the realm of pure abstraction in the mid-1930s, so did his prints. The thin lines used to define figures in the earlier prints and drawings began delineating groups of geometric shapes, often in motion. You see this in the Bruce Museum exhibition in works like ''Ballet'' (1942), a zany, fluid engraving, and ''Grandeur-Immense'' (1935), a diagramlike drypoint in which the artist sketches out one of his famous mobiles. Like the drawing of the lion, both of these prints are on loan from the Museum of Modern Art.
 There is no denying that a certain stylistic and iconographic continuity exists between Calder's sculptures and his prints. Some of the prints, clearly, are studies relating to sculptures and paintings. They are mere facsimiles of his three-dimensional works. But others exist as stand-alone works of art, intended not only as literary illustrations or poster designs but as independent compositions. 
 The best of Calder's prints have a tremendous sense of vitality, combining bold shapes and broad sections of color in dynamic, intuitive ways, a quality evidenced in ''Spirals,'' an undated color lithograph filled with swirling, sinuous lines and ovoid shapes of intensely saturated color. The forms occasionally overlap, creating the illusion of depth and even motion. This is a great work. 
 It is tempting to compare the sense of dynamism in a work like ''Spirals'' to the movement of one of the artist's mobiles. But that would distort our understanding of the print, which is clearly more than a two-dimensional representation of a three-dimensional object. It is, rather, a carefully calibrated study in compositional arrangements, existing parallel to rather than mimicking his work in three dimensions. 
 Calder's production of prints escalated dramatically in his later years, especially during the 1950s, when he became something of a household name, at least in this country. But his failure to document his burgeoning print output, along with the simplicity of his imagery, made him a target for forgers. Fakes abounded, as a small section toward the end of the exhibition demonstrates.
 It is in the nature of a print to be reproduced and widely distributed, hence its appeal to political parties and others looking to influence public opinion. Calder also used prints for advocacy, as in poster prints here from 1967 and 1969 protesting the Vietnam War. But by and large he kept his art and his politics separate, a decision that probably accounts for his widespread popularity.

HEADLINE: Fanfare for the New, the Old, the Less Heralded

BYLINE: By CHARLES ISHERWOOD

 BODY:
FOR the New York theater the year just past could be called the year of the underdog. In putting together my annual list of highlights, I noticed that most of them -- actually, all of them -- were productions that arrived with little or no fanfare and nary a big-name celebrity, yet somehow beat the odds to become the little shows that could.
 Not that these memorable productions were audience blockbusters. By ''little shows that could'' I mean little shows that could win the hearts of dedicated theater audiences not entirely attuned to the TMZ ethos that has begun to rule Broadway. Fewer than half of my favorite shows of the year were seen in that dubious and increasingly star-obsessed promised land. And while the shows produced off Broadway that made my list all had extended runs, none of the Broadway shows could even remotely be called a hit. 
 The encouraging success of theater underdogs this year seems appropriate during a time when the cratering economy tossed hundreds of thousands into the un- or underemployed list. If I squint for some silver lining, perhaps at least it was possible for starry-eyed aspiring types, the underdog playwrights and actors of tomorrow, to rent an apartment in the vicinity of New York. 
 The happy mascot for this year would have to be David Cromer's gorgeous revival of Thornton Wilder's OUR TOWN, perhaps the smallest yet the grandest of my favorite shows. Arriving from Chicago with much of the original cast intact, staged at the Barrow Street Theater for just over 100 people a night, this unshowy but perceptive rethinking of an American standard became a bona fide hit. Opening in February to rapturous reviews, it continues to play at Barrow Street to audiences finding themselves in thrilling intimacy with Wilder's bittersweet reflections on the homely grandeur of human existence. In December it became the longest-running production of the play in history.
 As such it is probably the only production on my list likely to enter the theater history books. But the season was notable, if perhaps not epoch making, for the strong showing of new plays by women. 
 The lack of support for such plays has been a simmering cause of debate over the past few years. In the November issue of American Theater magazine, Marsha Norman once again makes the case that ''there is some serious resistance to producing the work of women on the American stage.'' 
 But I hope it's an encouraging sign that the four best new plays to be produced in New York this year were written by women: Annie Baker's CIRCLE MIRROR TRANSFORMATION, a deliciously subtle comedy set in a rural acting class that explores how lives can evolve in ways that are both barely noticeable and momentous; Melissa James Gibson's THIS, a moving, deeply funny and verbally adroit comedy that manages to find a fresh vibe for a familiar story of marital transgression; Gina Gionfriddo's savage, smart comedy BECKY SHAW, a finalist for the Pulitzer Prize; and Sarah Ruhl's IN THE NEXT ROOM, OR THE VIBRATOR PLAY, a wonderfully daring, serious-minded sex comedy about the fundamental lack of understanding between men and women in the post-gaslight era (and, by extension, our own). 
 In a hopeful sign that Off Broadway may yet see signs of permanent resurgence, ''Becky Shaw'' extended for six weeks beyond its initial run at the Second Stage Theater, while both ''Circle Mirror Transformation'' and ''This'' were held over at Playwrights Horizons. (''This'' runs in the mainstage space until Jan. 3 while a brief return engagement of ''Circle'' plays the theater's Peter Jay Sharp space until Jan. 17.) The fate of ''In the Next Room,'' which was bravely produced on Broadway by Lincoln Center Theater, does not look as happy. Although it will probably be seen by more people than saw any of the other new plays on my list, it is limping along on Broadway, where the only currency of value is celebrity. (It did not help that the Signature Theater chose to open the first installment of ''The Orphans' Home Cycle'' on the night that ''In the Next Room'' had scheduled its opening, thus ensuring that the plays would have to vie for news-media attention in the few outlets that regularly cover theater. With colleagues like that, who needs enemies?)
 The snowballing power of fame is the most dispiriting news of 2009. The other three Broadway shows on my Top 10 list are Bartlett Sher's transcendent revival of August Wilson's JOE TURNER'S COME AND GONEfor Lincoln Center Theater; the superbly acted production of THE NORMAN CONQUESTS, by Alan Ayckbourn, imported from the Old Vic in London; and the resplendent new staging of FINIAN'S RAINBOW, a transfer from the City Center Encores! series. Not even a date-night appearance from no less a celebrity couple than Barack and Michelle Obama could transform ''Joe Turner'' from a reasonable draw to a hot ticket. Unanimous hosannas couldn't stop ''Norman'' from entering the books as a flop -- in theatrical parlance, a show that does not recoup its investment. ''Finian's Rainbow,'' another critical hit and one of the most gorgeously sung shows in recent memory on Broadway, will be lucky to make it into January.
 Still, the year brought some signs of hope that important revivals are no longer the exclusive province of Broadway. In addition to ''Our Town'' the year occasioned two unforgettable Off Broadway revivals that played to sold-out houses. Remarkably, the same actor, John Douglas Thompson, starred in both.
 In the spring he played the title role in the Theater for a New Audience's nigh-perfect OTHELLO, directed with confidence by a newcomer, Arin Arbus, who qualifies as the most gifted new director to emerge this year. In the fall Mr. Thompson returned in a searing production of Eugene O'Neill's EMPEROR JONES at the Irish Repertory Theater. (It continues to run at the SoHo Playhouse.) 
 Mr. Thompson's is by no means a name that is going to light up a Broadway marquee soon, unless he finds himself starring in a trendy television show or a major movie. (And for his sake, I hope he does.) But his fine work this year will not soon be forgotten by those privileged to see it. There may be no better classical actor working in the New York theater right now.

HEADLINE: Senators Add The Ornaments And Trimmings

BYLINE: By KATHARINE Q. SEELYE

 BODY:
The term ''Christmas tree'' has its own special meaning on Capitol Hill. It usually refers to a bill that has been decorated with ''ornaments,'' loaded up with special goodies for the folks back home.
 But with the Senate health legislation, the term is particularly apt, as the majority leader, Harry Reid, aims to have a vote by Christmas Eve on a bill festooned with decorations. 
They include these:
 The ''Louisiana Purchase,'' as it is being called, a provision for Senator Mary L. Landrieu, Democrat of Louisiana, who obtained an extra $300 million in Medicaid funds for her state. 
 The Hawaii exemption, a measure that allows the state to keep its own health care system. 
 A break on the excise tax on so-called Cadillac health insurance plans for people in the 17 states where premiums are the highest. (The measure was initially intended to apply to the 10 states with the highest premiums, a Senate aide said, but some other senators wanted in and the number was bumped to 17.) 
 An increase in federal money to cover a Medicaid expansion in Nebraska, home to Senator Ben Nelson, a Democrat. Massachusetts and Vermont also won more money to expand Medicaid, but at much lower levels. 
 While Mr. Nelson held up the bill for an anti-abortion provision, he won various other items for his state, including an exemption from the insurance tax for Mutual of Omaha. But the abortion language to which he agreed infuriated some abortion opponents when it was made public on Saturday, threatening the entire bill all over again.
 Supporters of the bill say these sugar plums are a small price to pay for the votes to pass landmark legislation that will result in most Americans having health insurance, many with subsidies, and will end some of the insurance industry's most discriminatory practices. 
 Lavish Lobbying
 But these ornaments are mere baubles compared with some of the neon measures that some lawmakers and lobbyists have fought to keep out of the bill.
 Most prominent was the demand by Senator Joseph I. Lieberman, independent of Connecticut, that leaders drop two provisions that the insurance industry and big business had been lobbying vociferously against.
 One, of course, was a government-run insurance plan, or public option, which would have competed with private insurance companies. The other was an expansion of Medicare to include some people ages 55 to 64, a change hospitals and doctors fought because it would have meant taking care of more patients at lower Medicare rates.
 Insurers also beat back an attempt to strip the industry of a partial antitrust exemption that it has long enjoyed.
 To achieve these goals, the lobbying campaign has been lavish, even by Capitol Hill's inflated standards.
 Spending totals for the year will not be known until mid-January. But in the first nine months, health care lobbyists spent at least $396 million, according to the Center for Responsive Politics, which tracks the influence of money on elections and policy. 
 Because the lobbying intensified in the fourth quarter as both the House and Senate prepared their final bills, the year-end total is likely to shatter the previous record for money spent on a single issue in a single year. 
 Perhaps not surprisingly, that record was set just last year, when health care lobbyists spent $486 million in anticipation of the legislative action this year.
 ''If spending this quarter remains on pace with the first three quarters -- just on pace -- lobbying in the health care sector will obliterate the high-water mark that it set last year,'' said Dave Levinthal, a spokesman for the center.
 But even those figures do not give the full picture of the cash funneled into lobbying on health care in 2009. 
 For example, the center's health care figures do not include lobbying by the insurance industry. Mr. Levinthal said the center could not isolate the amount the industry spent only on health insurance, as opposed to other forms of insurance. 
 Nor do the figures include spending by groups like the United States Chamber of Commerce, which has multiple issues pending before Congress but led the effort to kill the public option.
 And they do not include the $170 million that all sides have spent so far this year on television advertising.
 Some of the lobbying, especially in the early days, was done on behalf of remaking the health care system. But over all, more has been spent against it. Because Democrats control both houses, they have received more money than Republicans.
 Corporate Glee
 The insurance companies were probably among the merriest of industries last week. Because the legislation mandates that everyone buy insurance, those companies stand to gain 30 million new customers -- and there will be no government plan to compete with.
 But the drug companies were certainly joyful, too. So far, they have kept intact a deal with the White House to bar the importation of cheaper drugs from Canada and elsewhere. In exchange, the they agreed to give up $80 billion over 10 years through discounts and rebates. 
 Some Senators fought the pharmaceutical deal, noting that $80 billion represents only about 2 percent of the $3.6 trillion that Americans are expected to spend on drugs in the next 10 years. But the Senate effectively voted last week to keep the drug pact in place.
 The pharmaceutical industry has spent more money by far than any other on lobbying in the first nine months of the year, laying out $199 million. That is also the single highest figure that any industry has ever spent on lobbying in a nine-month period, according to the Center for Responsive Politics. 
 Citizens who do not normally pay attention to Congressional gift exchanges may have been galled at the process, particularly with the health care of the nation's citizens and one-sixth of its economy at stake.
 But they will see more maneuvering in the weeks ahead, as lobbyists seek to ensure that the measures they kept out of the Senate bill will also be excluded from the final bill that the Senate produces in conference with the House.
 On Capitol Hill, decorating the Christmas tree is always in season.

HEADLINE: What Makes You Roar? He Wants to Know

BYLINE: By ADAM BRYANT

 BODY:
This interview with Jeffrey Swartz, the president and C.E.O. of the Timberland Company, was conducted and condensed byAdam Bryant.
 Q. Talk about the first time you were somebody's boss.
 A. The first time I was actually assigned a leadership outcome? I was out of business school and I was working at a high-tech manufacturing consulting firm. My first assignment was to be the factory manager for a plant making chips for the defense industry. I'm now in charge of a factory. I'm not an employee -- I'm the suit from the consulting firm. I'm supervising techs and engineers. I'm a smart guy and I did a lot of science, but I have no idea what they're talking about.
 I sat by myself in the cafeteria for three months. It was worse than high school. I literally couldn't talk the language. I had to supervise people who had a language and a worldview different than mine and they were accountable to me in the sense that their firm is paying a lot of money for our firm's services, but I didn't write their reviews. How the hell am I going to get people to talk to me at lunch? 
 It was clear I wasn't going to compel them with my technical knowledge, and I wasn't going to compel them with my authority. So the question was, how could you be powerful and in charge but not the boss? 
 In the end, it was a really huge experience that colored a lot of the way things have been different for me at Timberland than I think they otherwise would have been. I knew how to deal with craftsmen at Timberland -- I grew up with them in the family business. But guys with lab coats? It was very different.
 Q.So what did you do?
 A. I had to sell them an idea. The engineers were so smart, but they could not understand why the processes on the factory floor were not more efficient.
 I scheduled a meeting for 3 in the afternoon. I got the conference room all set up. I pulled the table over next to the windows so there were no chairs on that side. I left as if to get something. And I waited 30 seconds, came in, and they're all staring out the window at 128, the beltway around Boston. And I said, ''That is your manufacturing floor.'' And they're looking out the window and I said, ''Can somebody describe for me the algorithm that describes why the traffic is stalling? Why aren't they going 55 miles an hour?'' And so these guys gave me the math, which I listened to carefully but I didn't understand a word of.
 Q. So they had the answer?
 A. Of course they did. And I said, ''You guys are paying our firm way too much money, given that you know that.'' That's what we talked about. I said, ''Can we just open our minds to the idea that that's a physical model for what's going on in the factory.'' 
 And one of the guys says, ''We've been mathed by the kid.'' I said, ''What does that mean?'' He said, ''You used our own language against us.'' I said: ''I'm not using it against you. I am trying to make the model visible.'' And they said, ''Now we got it.''
 It was so easy after that. I made them see something that was not obvious to them, and that was like: ''Ah-ha. I get it. I get it.'' People resist the unseen. They fear what they don't know, what they can't put their hands on. So I learned from that experience that I've got to help people see what they can't see. I learned that people learn their way, and when they learn it, when they assemble it, then the idea can become interesting, because people think, ''Oh, wow, I've seen something.''
 Q. You grew up in the family business. What leadership lessons did you learn from your father? 
 A. There were many, but here's a quick one. I remember him saying: ''Pick a face. If you want to be serious, then you have to be serious all the time. Because if you're serious one day and happy the next, people will be confused. They won't be able to figure out where you're coming from and that'll be threatening.''
 Q. How do you hire? 
 A. If we're hiring a creative person from the outside, I like to call the headhunter a few days before and have them tell the person I'm interviewing, if it's an apparel person, to please wear their favorite pair of shoes to the interview. And if it's a footwear person, I ask them to wear their favorite outfit. 
 And so the recruiters say, ''What do you mean by favorite outfit?'' I say: ''I mean something that they can defend, as in, 'This is the most important piece of clothing that I own and here's why.' Or, 'These are my favorite pair of shoes and here's why.' ''
 One guy came in wearing a navy blue Armani suit, a footwear guy, and I said: ''Wow. Is this the right outdoor thing?'' And he said: ''I got married in this suit. This is my favorite piece of clothing on earth because it's like a wedding dress but I get to wear it again and again. I don't wear it all the time because I'm not a suit guy, but you said to wear your favorite thing and explain it. It's because I got married in this suit.'' 
 I thought, ''I love this guy.'' It's a way of asking what matters to you, and what doesn't.
 That's the other thing I like to ask people, and it depends who the person is, but usually I say: ''What makes you want to howl at the moon? What makes you really mad, so that you feel your pulse in your throat and you want to puke?'' 
 And the third thing that I like to say, especially to the creative crowd, because they travel a lot, is: ''When you're alone by yourself in a city, what do you do at night? And if I was going to hang out with you, what would we do together? What would you show me? What would you want me to see?''
 I don't undervalue the skills that people bring, but I don't need to vet that and I'm not even sure how good I would be at that. But Timberland is a place that demands my body and soul in some form or fashion, and so I've got to have some basic understanding of whether somebody is interested in that, or interested in that kind of a conversation.
 Q.Any other unusual things you do in the hiring process?
 A. I go to every new-employee thing, and I do a warm-up exercise. I say to folks: ''We'll start with a hard question, which is, what is your name? There's an H.R. person in the room. If you're not sure and you get nervous, just look over there and they'll remind you of your name. And having said your name, say your favorite place in the outdoors.'' 
 And instantly you'll see people's memories, visual memory, whatever. And I say, ''Hey, just to remind you, the H.R. person doesn't have that one written down so you can say Niagara Falls or the Grand Canyon or anything else you want to say, and no one's going to call you on it, so please, there's low pressure on this.''
 And so you go around the room and people say things. It's very cute. There was one woman, and you'd think her head's going to explode, and she goes: ''All right. Now I'll admit it. I don't belong here. My favorite place is not a hiking trail. It's not a mountain. I love Manhattan. I love the smell of it.'' And I said, ''O.K., good.'' And she was like, ''All right, I'm a failure.''
 And I said, ''No, listen.'' And then I have this little standard speech that I say to people. ''I asked you your name because it wasn't your resume we hired, it was you. It wasn't your brother. It wasn't your sister. It wasn't the person who sits next to you at the company that you came from. It was you. The individual matters.
 ''Two, I asked you your favorite place in the outdoors. And so I reinforced the fact that it's all about you. But then if you noticed, everybody had someplace to say because we're trying to serve this notion of outdoor spirit.''
 It's kind of cool, because while the individual experience matters, look how universally held it is. Even when people say the same beach, which every once in a while they do, they have a very different experience of the beach, of that same beach.
 So, in hiring, I'm desperately probing for the human inside the shell because the people who succeed at Timberland show a little leg, meaning they expose themselves. You have to. To go to a company town-hall meeting and call out to question a strategy you don't understand or a deeply felt thing, you've got to show up. 
 You know the line in ''The Godfather'' -- ''Nothing personal. It's just business.'' At Timberland, I want to make it clear from the beginning it is personal. Not invasion-personal, like I need to know what's going on in your life. But if you aren't going to play at the level of personal, it's probably not going to be nourishing for either of us.
 A willingness to be exposed, a willingness to acknowledge the personal dimension, a willingness to value the personal dimension -- from the beginning, that's what we're after. I'm saying that there's no chance that our company, in a cruddy industry in a world that's in an L-shaped recession, not a V- or a W-shaped recession, is going to be able to reinvent itself with the speed and ease that it needs to unless we bring more than our intellects to the table. 
 I've got to find people who are comfortable with fuzzy logic, who are comfortable being exposed, who are comfortable being wrong, who don't value as the first notion, ''I got the answer, Boss.''
 Q. Sum it up for me.
 A. Comfort with ambiguity is one thing and faith in a solution is another and a commitment to fight for a worthy outcome is the third. That's a three-part dance that's different than saying, ''How'd you like to build your marketing career at Timberland?'' 
 This is a more complete version of the story than appeared in print.

HEADLINE: She's Making It Up as She Goes Along

BYLINE: By ANDY NEWMAN

 BODY:
In the mid-'90s, after Mossa Bildner had recorded several albums with the avant-garde jazz composer Henry Threadgill, he issued her a challenge.
 ''He told me, 'I want you to improvise, improvise, improvise,' '' Ms. Bildner recalled last month in her loft above a pawnshop on Myrtle Avenue in Bushwick, Brooklyn. ''I didn't know how to improvise. I came from opera, where you don't improvise.'' 
 In fact, Ms. Bildner had been improvising for years, in response to wrong notes and dissonance in her life: the spinal meningitis that left her using a wheelchair for a year and derailed a promising career as an operatic spinto soprano in Europe; the absconding by a longtime lover with her inheritance from her mother; her estrangement from her wealthy Brazilian family. 
 So Ms. Bildner improvised for Mr. Threadgill, and continued to make up life as she went along, too, eventually settling into work as a translator and teacher of languages (she speaks five) to support her calling as a composer and performer of multihyphenated musical forms (world-, classical-, jazz-, etc.).
 By day she taught Portuguese and Spanish to bankers. By night she worked with her ensemble, Mossa Bildner's International House of Trances, and wrote and staged what she calls ''consciousness-raising'' pieces like ''Colours of Ritual,'' which combined North African Gnawa invocations, Sephardic liturgical poems and Afro-Brazilian Candomble rituals, choreographed and set to the music of three or four continents. The critic Eva Yaa Asantewaa described her as ''a mellower Diamanda Galas, a way funkier Paul Winter, a Brazilian Auntie Mame on acid.''
 But the recession upended Ms. Bildner's existence as bafflingly as it has the lives of countless other educated, connected and resourceful people. In April, she was laid off from her freelance teaching job by an international bank (no unemployment for freelancers). Her business as a private language teacher dried up.
 Ms. Bildner, who would not give her age, found herself unable to come up with a next chapter. ''I couldn't pay rent here in May, and I couldn't pay rent in June,'' she said. The loft she moved into last year, about 800 square feet in a converted industrial space, costs $1,300 a month. In July, she returned home to find an eviction notice on her door.
 Working one last connection, Ms. Bildner contacted the American Committee for the Weizmann Institute of Science -- ''because my family gives them a lot of money'' -- who put her in touch with UJA-Federation of New York, one of the seven beneficiary agencies of The New York Times Neediest Cases Fund.
 A social worker from the agency, Karen Norden, helped Ms. Bildner get $1,300 in federal emergency shelter aid for people who have lost their jobs; $2,000 from the agency; $935 from the Federation of Protestant Welfare Agencies (another beneficiary of the Neediest Cases Fund); and $1,283 from the Neediest Cases Fund itself toward her rent and electric bill. Ms. Norden even procured a coupon for free food for Ms. Bildner's operatically named cats, Lindoro (from ''The Barber of Seville'') and Olga (from ''Eugene Onegin'').
 ''I'm not being melodramatic,'' Ms. Bildner said. ''The fact is that I would've been on the street if the UJA had not come. I remember when I went to the food pantry at the Met Council on Jewish Poverty. They gave me a voucher to go shopping, and when I was filling out the paperwork -- that was when I started to cry.''
 Ms. Bildner's financial situation has stabilized a bit. She has found part-time teaching work with a corporate relocation firm, and her private tutoring is picking up again. Between that and Social Security, which Ms. Norden helped her sign up for, she is barely making ends meet.
 As she sat in an apartment filled with exotic (but, she says, not worth enough to sell) possessions accumulated over her years and travels -- old rugs, a wooden Brazilian guardian figure, a bamboo saxophone, a cracked Syrian inlaid table -- Ms. Bildner reflected on her summer of supplication.
 ''It was a strange position to find myself in,'' she said. But in a way, Ms. Bildner said, she did not feel strange asking for help. 
 ''This could happen to anybody,'' she said. ''Nobody's perfect, everyone makes mistakes and wrong decisions. I didn't feel ashamed.''
 In turn, she said, ''people like me who receive the generosity of this organization can then be in a position to return it.''
 On Tuesday, Ms. Bildner performed a new piece at the Local 269 on Houston Street. The program was improvised.

CORRECTION-DATE: December 27, 2009

 CORRECTION:
An article last Sunday about Mossa Bildner, a singer facing eviction who was helped by The New York Times Neediest Cases Fund, misidentified the employer of Karen Norden, a social worker who helped Ms. Bildner, and referred incorrectly to the federal emergency shelter aid Ms. Bildner received. Ms. Norden works for the Jewish Board of Family and Children's Services, not the UJA-Federation of New York, and the federal aid is not in fact restricted to people who have lost their jobs.

HEADLINE: Times Are Tough? Bring On Vermeer And the Pianos

BYLINE: By HOLLAND COTTER

 BODY:
ARTWISE, 2009 began on a very high note with the surprise appearance of the most inspired piece of American public sculpture in years: Aretha Franklin's fierce, jubilant inauguration chapeau. Talk about national pride. As the band played ''Hail to the Chief,'' some of us thought, ''God bless the Queen.'' 
 The economy was, of course, in the sewer. There were still big-deal shows -- Afghan gold at the Met, Arshile Gorky in Philadelphia, Titian and company in Boston -- but our major museums were mainly in austerity mode, concentrating on small, collection-based exhibitions, a pattern likely to hold for years. 
 Among the rewards: the Met focused all eyes on a single marvelous painting, Vermeer's ''Milkmaid,'' on loan from the Rijksmuseum, Amsterdam; the National Gallery of Art in Washington turned a handful of choice Tullio Lombardi sculptures into a Renaissance gem; the Philadelphia Museum of Art spun a visual essay around one of its modernist treasures, Duchamp's ''Etant Donnes.'' 
 At the same time smaller institutions thought big. The Rubin Art Museum in Chelsea presented a thrilling survey of South Asian Jain art. The Hessel Museum of Art at Bard College organized a tough, haunting retrospective of the New York sculptor Rachel Harrison. El Museo del Barrio reopened after renovation with ''Nexus New York: Latin/American Artists in the Modern Metropolis,'' a detailed look at the vivifying influence of early Latin American immigrants on New York. 
 In a relatively recent trend, galleries cooked up historical surveys. There was a fantastic Piero Manzoni retrospective at Gagosian and another devoted to the performance artist Stuart Sherman (1945-2001) at New York University's 80WSE. Thanks to X Initiative, a smart, temporary exhibition project housed in Dia's former Chelsea premises, we got a trippy soak in the early Super 8 films of Derek Jarman (1942-94) and a taser-hit of films by the 40-something Polish artist Artur Zmijewski. 
 Mr. Zmijewski is one of several contemporary artists to make resonant solo appearances. Who could forget the young musicians playing Beethoven's ''Ode to Joy'' from the cutout center of moving pianos in an installation by the artist team of Allora & Calzadilla at Gladstone? Or the view of thousands of personal family effects -- shoes, bottles, bandages, books -- brought by the Beijing artist Song Dong to New York for his show ''Waste Not'' at the Museum of Modern Art?
 Inevitably, worthy events fell under the radar. Lutz Bacher's retrospective ''My Secret Life,'' at P.S. 1 Contemporary Art Center, was certainly one: with subjects from Vargas girls to Lee Harvey Oswald, it was chilly, strange and strong. A long overdue survey of the career of Daniel Joseph Martinez came in the form of a book called ''A Life of Disobedience'' (Hatje Cantz, Germany), the best way to catch the full impact of an artist for whom art, life and politics are inseparable. 
 Other important retrospectives between covers: ''The Importance of Being Iceland: Travel Essays in Art'' (Semiotexte) by the poet-critic Eileen Myles; and ''Hearts of the City: The Selected Writings of Herbert Muschamp'' (Alfred A. Knopf), a grand compilation of essays by the brilliant former New York Times architecture critic who died in 2007.
 Inevitably there were disappointments. The first edition of the New Museum's hotly anticipated contemporary survey, ''The Generational: Younger Than Jesus,'' was, despite some good artists, a lackluster affair of derivative, market-friendly works, like much else that this institution has delivered thus far. 
 Unpleasant to watch was the way the art industry reacted to the economic crisis. There was talk about how corrections were healthy, how hard times could be the best times for reconsidering values, rethinking art and so on. The art world, deeply conventional and always fat at the top, had an opportunity to take some risks, change its game. But after few decent auctions, the talk stopped and the parties started again. Several small galleries had to close? So what! Artists can't find jobs? They'll live. But then, hardly anyone expects more than crass opportunism from this particular corner of the culture.
 Some people who do want more, however, came together for an intense one-day convocation, ''The Creative Time Summit: Revolutions in Public Practice,'' at the New York Public Library in October. From a wide-ranging international roster of artists, curators, critics, performers, scholars, anarchists and activists we heard about work in prisons and in United States-Mexican border communities, about housing rehabilitation and alternative-energy projects, about the global dissemination of sustaining goods and information, all through the agency of something defined in dozens of different ways as art. Visionary, for so long now a throwaway word, regained some meaning.
 It may not be exactly the word for Michael Jackson, a sometime artist who also happened to be a superstar pop performer and who died this year. But the art world, or at least many artists who took him as a subject -- Andy Warhol, Jeff Koons, John Waters, Paul McCarthy, Terence Koh, Cameron Jamie, Banksy and Kehinde Wiley, among them -- owe him a big debt of thanks. He lent them his luster. Talent, ambition and heavy promotion raised him up; self-delusion, denial, drugs, racism, and gay panic brought him down: a very American trajectory. Even down he was huge, bigger than any painter or sculptor will ever be. That's the reality. I wonder when the art world will figure it out. Meanwhile, tip of the hat to him.

HEADLINE: Amid Studio Product, Independents' Resilience

BYLINE: By MANOHLA DARGIS

 BODY:
IT was, readers of The New York Times recently learned, a very good year for Paramount Pictures. Two of the year's biggest hits, ''G.I. Joe: The Rise of Cobra'' and ''Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen,'' have helped the studio climb out of its financial hole with a combined domestic take of more than $500 million. Both movies are deeply stupid, often incoherent and hinged on the principle that the spectacle of violence is its own pleasurable end. ''Transformers'' is also casually racist. But hey, that's entertainment. 
 Or, more specifically, that's Hollywood entertainment in the conglomerate age. The major studios have long been in the business of serving sludge to the world, but now the reek often spreads around the globe simultaneously with massive coordinated openings. ''Revenge of the Fallen,'' for instance, opened the same day on more than 4,000 screens in the United States -- about a 10th of all the screens in the country -- and soon about 10,000 more abroad. ''Angels & Demons,'' the sequel to ''The Da Vinci Code,'' opened on some 3,500 screens domestically and ate up more than 10,000 internationally. The French film ''Summer Hours,'' meanwhile, the best-reviewed release in The Times that weekend, opened on two screens. 
 The question of consumer choice becomes all but moot when the Top 5 box office movies are playing on more than one-quarter of all the screens in America, as was the case during the first weekend of May, when ''Star Trek'' opened. That weekend 10 movies dominated 67 percent of the country's screens. Three of those titles were released by Paramount. Warner Brothers and Disney had two movies each; 20th Century Fox, Sony Pictures and the independent company Summit Entertainment each had one. (It's worth noting that National Amusements, the company that has a controlling stake in Viacom, the entertainment conglomerate that in turn runs Paramount, owns more than 1,500 screens around the world.) 
 The problem isn't blockbusters per se or certain kinds of genre movies or inflated budgets: ''Star Trek,'' wittily directed by J. J. Abrams, is an entertaining rethink of a defining science-fiction brand, and the even pricier ''Avatar,'' from James Cameron, is in a class by itself. But these remain exceptions to the flashier, noisier, dumber rule of much of today's mega-budget entertainment. Movies have always been segmented among different audiences, but the disparity between the work that earns most of the critical love at release -- and awards -- time and much of what fills the multiplex on a weekly basis seems greater than ever. Paramount sells the audience ''G. I. Joe'' and sells Oscar voters (and critics) ''Up in the Air.''
 That divide between the studios' bulk product and their prestige items has become even more conspicuous because so many specialty units have been closed, absorbed or downsized in the last two years, leaving executives with fewer reasons to go to the Oscars. (Just two years ago Paramount Vantage, the specialty unit of Paramount, released ''There Will Be Blood,'' one of the finest American movies of the past 50 years. Vantage has since been folded into big Paramount.) A few specialty units remain, however, including Fox Searchlight, which might be why 20th Century Fox feels free to release so many stinkers, including franchise leftovers (''X-Men Origins: Wolverine'') and female-minstrelsy shows (''Bride Wars''). The same holds true over at Sony Pictures Entertainment, which would have been largely an aesthetic wasteland this year without Sony Pictures Classics.
 Big Sony did women wrong with ''The Ugly Truth,'' but it did everyone right by giving us Meryl Streep as Julia Child in ''Julie & Julia.'' (It can keep Julie.) Warner Brothers gave us one of the worst of the year (''Watchmen'') and one of the best (''Where the Wild Things Are''). Disney tried to rectify decades of racism by giving an Obama-led America its first black princess (''The Princess and the Frog''). Universal had its ups (''Public Enemies''), nice tries (''Duplicity'') and some solid genre diversions (''A Perfect Getaway'') along with the usual multiplex fodder (''Land of the Lost'' and ''Fast & Furious''). It also has a coming film with Ms. Streep (''It's Complicated''), something every studio should. 
 Despite the bad news, Hollywood's habit of absorbing new talent does offer some hope. In 1993, when Disney bought Miramax Films, the studio ushered in a new era in American cinema. 
 By the time Warner joined this new specialty business 10 years later, with Warner Independent Pictures, all the studios were in the indie business. Films like Spike Jonze's ''Where the Wild Ones Are'' and Steven Soderbergh's ''Informant!,'' both released by Warner, might represent the end of that era. Even so, I like to believe that the industry's central irrationality (its human factor) will remain and that there will always be one madman willing to give an artist like Wes Anderson millions to make a puppet movie about a family of foxes. 
 Yet while the studios seem to be in retreat from challenging adult films, at least for now, and while nonstudio companies, particularly those in foreign-film distribution, continue to have a rough time (New Yorker Films shut down this year, a tremendous loss), there are some promising signs. Companies like the newly revitalized Cinema Guild (which this year distributed celebrated features from Agnes Varda, Claire Denis and Jia Zhang-ke) and larger ones like IFC Films continue to release tremendous work. Other companies have reconfigured to fit the lean times, as evident by the recent merger of Kino International and Lorber HT Digital, which joined forces to become Kino Lorber. Long may they brighten our screens. 
 Despite the shake-ups and bad economic times there are now more choices for dedicated movie lovers than at any time in history, though only if you live in a major film market like New York, have access to a cable outfit like the Independent Film Channel, which shows some of the best movies around, or own a region-free DVD player on which you can play international discs. (DVDs only play on machines manufactured for specific zones, a barrier you can bypass by buying or hacking a region-free machine. In March, President Obama gave the British prime minister, Gordon Brown, 25 American DVDs that Mr. Brown couldn't watch at home apparently because he didn't own a region-free machine. You should.) 
 And even with all the seismic industry shifts there were movies to love, even from Hollywood, and moments to remember, including the dust that clings to Anthony Mackie's eyelashes in ''The Hurt Locker,'' as he waits in the Iraqi desert, gun at the ready, for enemy fire. And Colin Firth's face crumbling like pulverized stone as he receives the awful news of his lover's death in ''A Single Man.'' Some of the greatest filmmaking of the year was represented by the story of a happy marriage, which was represented with breathtaking narrative economy and a great depth of feeling in four sublime minutes in ''Up.'' The rest of the movie left me fairly indifferent, but those four minutes will play on a loop in my head for years. 
 Other images, other memories: the bodies of two teenagers being transported by a backhoe operated by a mobster in the Italian film ''Gomorrah,'' a backhoe first glimpsed in a scene in which the boys exult over the crime that will lead to their demise. The phosphorescent flowers fluttering like sea creatures on the surface of the alien world in ''Avatar.'' A restless camera tracing lines of love among grieving family members in ''Summer Hours,'' a French film poignantly true to everyday life and emotions and almost impossible to imagine being made in America if only because of its insistence on ambivalence as a condition of human relations. A young camel riding in a motorcycle sidecar amid an extraordinarily choreographed whirl of human and animal motion in ''Tulpan.''
 Here then are a baker's dozen of my favorite films of the year, in order of their domestic release: ''Gomorrah'' (Matteo Garrone, Italy); ''Tulpan''( Sergey Dvortsevoy, Kazakhstan); ''Summer Hours'' (Olivier Assayas, France); ''The Hurt Locker'' (Kathryn Bigelow, United States); ''The Beaches of Agnes'' (Agnes Varda, France); ''Public Enemies'' (Michael Mann, United States); ''Beeswax'' (Andrew Bujalski, United States); ''Ponyo'' (Hayao Miyazaki, Japan); ''The Informant!'' (Steven Soderbergh, United States); ''Where the Wild Things Are'' (Spike Jonze, United States); ''Fantastic Mr. Fox'' (Wes Anderson, United States); ''The Sun'' (Alexander Sokurov, Russia); and ''Avatar'' (James Cameron, United States).
 Other favorites: ''Of Time and the City''; ''Frontier of Dawn''; ''Tokyo Sonata''; ''Sugar''; ''Leon Morin: Priest''; ''Julia'' (the Erick Zonca with Tilda Swinton); ''Star Trek''; ''Anaglyph Tom''; ''Seraphine''; ''The English Surgeon''; ''You, the Living''; ''In the Loop''; ''Import, Export''; ''Lorna's Silence''; ''A Perfect Getaway''; ''The Baader Meinhof Complex''; ''Big Fan''; ''Unmade Beds''; ''Crude''; ''A Serious Man''; ''Precious: Based on the Novel 'Push' by Sapphire''; ''The Messenger''; ''Big River Man''; '' 35 Shots of Rum''; ''Up in the Air''; ''A Single Man''; ''Invictus''; ''Police, Adjective.'' Many of these titles are either already available on DVD or will be.

HEADLINE: New Group Seeks to Bring Greener Power to Marin

BYLINE: By KATHARINE MIESZKOWSKI

 BODY:
With holiday lights glowing around Marin County, a debate is heating up from Belvedere to Novato about who should procure the electricity that keeps them lighted. 
 A newly formed group, the Marin Energy Authority -- whose members include the county and eight of its cities and towns -- plans to approve its first contract with Shell Energy North America in February and to bring more renewable power to the county.
The Marin group is the leading edge of a movement tailored to this environmentally conscious age and this environmentally conscious region. Through a form of public collective purchasing it plans to provide a greener alternative to the power from the Pacific Gas & Electric Company, Northern California's dominant utility. 
 The majority of P.G. & E.'s electricity comes from natural gas and nuclear plants; 14 percent comes from renewable sources like solar and wind power. The Marin authority has pledged that 25 percent of its electricity would be derived from renewable sources. 
 It would use lines built, owned and maintained by P.G. & E., which would also handle the billing.
 Unless, that is, P.G. & E., which is investor-owned, stops it. At the moment, it is making every effort to that end, jawboning participants, hinting at legal action and, most importantly, backing a voter referendum to nip such plans anywhere in the state. 
 For the utility, efforts like Marin's could hinder a long-term strategic plan for sustained revenue growth, said William Marcus, an economist with JBS Energy in West Sacramento who reviewed the group's business plan.
 Mr. Marcus said that every local effort to buy power independently or to build local generating capacity eliminated an opportunity for P.G. & E. to make its own investments in new power generation. Getting financial returns from new generating capacity is central to the big utility's financial strategy, he said.
 Speaking of the Marin effort, Mr. Marcus said: ''If these things can be shown to work and either get cheaper or greener power, then P.G. & E.'s shareholders are in worse position in terms of building new generating plants. They make money by owning things.'' 
 For the backers of the Marin proposal, the fight is about how quickly local efforts to address climate change can take off. 
 ''If successful, these programs will be world leaders in climate action and green-power development,'' said Paul Fenn, the chief executive of a San Francisco-based company, Local Power Inc., who wrote the original 2002 legislation that opened the door for local communities to procure their own power.
 ''We are the tip of an iceberg,'' said Dawn Weisz, the interim executive director of the new group, speaking of the larger movement for community-controlled power.
 Being small when looking to buy renewable power, Ms. Weisz said, has advantages. ''We're more nimble,'' she said. ''We're able to enter into new contracts right now. It's actually a very good time to buy power, because prices are low.''
 Marin, closely followed by San Francisco, is racing to get its program established because a statewide initiative, backed by P.G. & E. and likely to be on the ballot next June could make it much harder to do so.
 On the national stage, P.G. & E. has developed and nurtured a reputation for taking a progressive approach to issues involving climate change and reduction of heat-trapping gases. Peter Darbee, the chief executive, publicly applauded the signing of California's landmark 2006 legislation to curb emissions and has been among the corporate executives pushing for some kind of national cap on emissions. 
 But that is not the same as supporting a proliferation of small local competitors. In recent years, P.G. & E. has successfully battled local public power initiatives from San Francisco to Sacramento to Yolo County. The utility has 2.9 million customers in the nine Bay Area counties, including 123,405 in Marin. Backers of the Marin authority think they could attract 100,000 of those.
 While it is not unusual for investor-owned utilities to fight, case by case, to keep from losing customers to public competitors, California's initiative system is a bigger battleground. 
 ''This is a very complex business,'' said Andrew Souvall, a spokesman for P.G. & E., ''and there are a lot of risks associated with being an energy provider. We believe that taxpayers should have a voice in determining whether local governments take on that risk.''
 The initiative, known as New Two-Thirds Requirement for Local Public Electricity Providers, would amend the state's Constitution to require local governments to win the approval of two-thirds of voters before pursuing community choice with any public money or bonds. 
 It would also require two-thirds of voters to approve a local government's use of public money or bonds to start or expand municipal electricity services.
 Municipal utilities serve about 22 percent of electricity customers in California -- including in Sacramento, Los Angeles and Santa Clara -- for rates that are, on average, lower than investor-owned utilities.
 Two weeks ago, a Marin County civil grand jury gave P.G. & E. ammunition in its fight against the Marin project by issuing a report entitled ''Marin Clean Energy: Pull the Plug.'' It argued that the proposal was too risky and should be abandoned. P.G. & E. employees circulated the report by e-mail days before its official release. 
 On Dec. 15, representatives from the Marin Energy Authority met with officials in the energy division of the California Public Utilities Commission. ''We talked with the C.P.U.C. to discuss P.G. & E.'s interference with our power supply contract,'' Ms. Weisz said, ''and general interference with our process over all.'' 
 A spokeswoman for the utilities commission confirmed that officials were evaluating the energy authority's claims.
 In the meantime, Marin is rushing to get its contract signed and hoping to avoid a legal challenge. But P.G. & E. is arguing that the contract should be reviewed under the California Environmental Quality Act, which could delay it. A lawsuit to force such a review is possible.
 The Marin proposal offers power customers a choice. Under it, households and businesses in Marin County -- including the cities and towns of Belvedere, Fairfax, Mill Valley, Ross, San Anselmo, San Rafael, Sausalito and Tiburon -- would automatically receive electricity procured by the Marin Energy Authority, unless the customers individually opted to stay with P.G. & E. 
 Novato, Larkspur and Corte Madera are not participating in the Marin Energy Authority, although in Novato local environmental groups and former Mayor Jim Leland held a public forum on Wednesday to persuade the City Council to reconsider. 
 Financed with a $540,000 start-up loan from Marin County, the Marin Energy Authority is trying to raise $1.6 million from foundations and financial institutions to finance operations from February to July 2010. If the program gets traction, Marin Clean Energy expects to deliver 170 megawatts of electricity, for which ratepayers would be charged about $94 million. The ultimate goal is to develop renewable resources locally.
 The San Francisco Public Utilities Commission has begun a similar program, CleanPowerSF. 
 The idea that the Marin Energy Authority's power will be more environmentally friendly than P.G. & E.'s is challenged by the utility, which has a national reputation for progressive attitudes on environmental issues. Speaking of the authority's proposal, Joe Nation, a P.G. & E. consultant, told the Belvedere City Council last week that ''this plan as it is laid out right now actuallyincreases greenhouse gases.'' 
 ''That's utter nonsense,'' Supervisor Charles McGlashan, the chairman of the authority, said in a telephone interview. ''It's based on completely flawed analysis.''
 Meanwhile, the San Francisco Public Utilities Commission requested proposals from power generators, seeking to buy power -- at prices at or below P.G. & E.'s -- for 365,000 customers, with the stipulation that 51 percent come from renewable energy and energy-efficiency measures at prices at or below P.G. & E.'s. The deadline for proposals is Dec. 29, and San Francisco hopes customers can start receiving power from the program by June 30. 
 That assumes that the ballot initiative does not get in the way. Barbara Hale, assistant general manager for the power enterprise division at the San Francisco Public Utilities Commission said, ''Depending on the outcome of P.G. & E.'s signature efforts, and any vote that may occur, and where we are in our implementation of the program, it could have a big impact on us.''

HEADLINE: When Businesses Move Out, Art Moves In

BYLINE: By CHLOE VELTMAN. 
For Art in Storefronts information and sites: sfartscommission.org/storefronts.

 BODY:
No one likes empty storefronts; they make streets look like gap-toothed smiles. Now that San Francisco's business districts are feeling the economic pinch, city officials, like dentists, have been scouting for ways to fix the cavities. Whether business picks up next year remains to be seen, but in the meantime, civic leaders and neighborhood associations have turned to artists for a temporary solution. 
 The Art in Storefronts initiative, introduced in the fall in San Francisco, is probably the most comprehensive project of its kind in the city. The program, which has received applications from nearly 200 local artists to date, has filled 20 empty commercial storefronts in four areas -- the Tenderloin, Bayview, Central Market and the Mission -- with temporary art installations. Plans are afoot to expand the project to additional neighborhoods like Chinatown. 
According to Kate Patterson, public-art project manager for the San Francisco Arts Commission, the proposals are chosen for aesthetic appeal, innovation, neighborhood context and diversity of subject matter, content and media. Each selected artist receives a $500 stipend. 
 A city's artists are often the first to be shut out in hard times, and these recent projects are certainly thought-provoking. On the one hand, the artwork in windows formerly occupied by electronic gadgetry and mannequins dressed in designer denim seem to make time stand still: They encourage passers-by to take a break from the holiday shopping frenzy to linger over something unusual and, in some cases, beautiful. 
 On the other hand, the transience of these projects -- and the ''placeholder'' mentality behind them -- points to the perpetually fraught relationship between commerce and art. 
 Alexis Amann and Jonathan Burstein's ''Don't Give Up the Ship,'' at 986 Market Street, is a wonderful example of storefront art. This duo's luminous, marine-hued installation depicting an underwater landscape -- complete with sharks, seaweed and a newspaper-reading deep-sea diver -- playfully stands out against the strip clubs, boarded-up facades and 24-hour doughnut shops of Central Market.
 The cardboard-cutout montage has a children's comic-book feel. But on closer inspection, the piece has a satirical, dystopian edge more akin to the work of Art Spiegelman or the local graphic novelist Jon Adams than to Richard Scarry. The diver's newspaper carries the headline ''Homeowners Underwater! Tsunami of Foreclosures''; miniature human heads bob forlornly atop seaweed strands; and a menacing shark has the word ''loans'' painted on its side. 
 Although delivered with humor, the message is clear: the Central Market neighborhood is underwater, and locals must fight to stay afloat. 
 Chris Treggiari and Billy Mitchell's installation at 144 Taylor Street in the Tenderloin has a similarly powerful neighborhood connection and strong visual appeal. Unlike the other projects around town, their work, ''Fight for Your Neighborhood,'' stands in front of a derelict restaurant -- a shuttered facade that once belonged to the San Francisco institution Original Joe's -- rather than behind the safety of glass. 
 This colorful, street-level artwork, with its painted prizefighter and wooden boxing ring surrounded by posters of local residents with their fists raised, pays homage to the neighborhood's boxing history. It also physically mimics the challenges facing the area as it fights for survival in a depressed economy. 
 Mr. Treggiari said his artwork had been vandalized a few times. (When I recently visited, a piece of wood had been torn off and thrown into the boxing ring.) But residents have reportedly rallied around the installation. 
 ''The neighborhood has truly taken ownership over the project,'' Mr. Treggiari said. ''I've recently received reports from friends who have seen paintings left by my piece. I hope it continues to inspire creativity within the community, because this is really what it's all about.''
 Just as this artwork mutates over time, the other San Francisco installations (as well as similar storefront projects in cities as diverse as New York, London and Cape Girardeau, Mo.) face change -- and ultimately eviction. 
 According to Daniel Hurtado, executive director of the Central Market Community Benefit District, planned retail projects in the area will soon force out two artworks. And in the Tenderloin, Elvin Padilla, executive director of the Tenderloin Economic Development Project, expects the Original Joe's site to be developed in 2010. 
 The Art in Storefronts project is undeniably laudable from a social and cultural standpoint. Both residents and artists are benefiting. Christopher Simmons, one of the creators of the work ''Everything Is O.K.,'' at 998 Market Street, said that he had had an increase in visitors to his Facebook page since the unveiling of his installation, and that he was in talks with galleries about future commissions. 
 It's great that San Francisco is taking an art-forward stance during the recession. Care, however, should be taken to preserve these artworks and prevent commerce from dictating all the rules. Let's hope that the city continues to support local artists when its ''storefront boroughs of teahead joyride neon blinking traffic light'' -- as Allen Ginsberg irreverently depicts the urban metropolis in ''Howl'' -- once again ring with the sound of jangling cash registers.

HEADLINE: City Schools' New Criteria for Diversity Raise Fears

BYLINE: By CRYSTAL YEDNAK and DARNELL LITTLE

 BODY:
The Chicago public schools' response to a recent court desegregation ruling -- a plan to use students' social and economic profiles instead of race to achieve classroom diversity -- is raising fears that it will undermine the district's slow and incremental progress on racial diversity.
 Chicago schools, like the city itself, are hardly a model of racial integration. But a Chicago News Cooperative analysis of school data shows the district has made modest gains in the magnet, gifted, classical and selective-enrollment schools, where, for nearly 30 years, race has been used as an admission criterion. Those advances may be imperiled in the wake of court rulings that have prompted Chicago Public Schools to look for factors other than race when assigning students to such schools.
Nationwide, court rulings have prompted school districts to seek creative ways to diversify classrooms without using a student's race as a factor. In Chicago, school officials last week moved ahead with their own experiment. 
 Instead of race as an admissions factor, they now will use socioeconomic data from the student's neighborhood -- income, education levels, single-parent households, owner-occupied homes and the use of language other than English as the primary tongue -- in placing children in selective-enrollment schools.
 A 1980 federal consent decree had, for nearly three decades, made the use of race a factor in admission to Chicago's magnet and selective-enrollment schools. In September, a federal district court judge in Chicago vacated that decree. In the district's neighborhood schools, race was not considered in assigning students. 
 School officials have turned to socioeconomic data to assign students because research suggests a close association between race and those measures. Still, parents fear that the shift in admissions policy, accompanied by a decision to give siblings and neighborhood children preference for admission to magnet schools, could erase even the modest gains in school diversity. 
 Parents of minority children also fear that the changes will reduce the chance that their children will gain admittance to high-performing schools.
 Newberry Math & Science Academy in the Lincoln Park neighborhood is one such school. With enviable test scores and an engaged parent group, the school also boasts a racial balance rarely seen in Chicago public schools: almost evenly divided among black, Hispanic and white children. 
 Amanda Orellano, an active parent volunteer at Newberry, went to the academy as a child, as did her parents. Her daughter is now the third generation to attend the magnet school, and Ms. Orellano fears the impact on her school as the district moves away from a race-based enrollment policy. 
 ''Somebody's going to feel that they're the only one here that's this way or that way, and feel isolated,'' Ms. Orellano said. 
 Success with integration like Newberry's is hard to achieve. Chicago's progress on integration can be measured by what experts call a ''dissimilarity index.'' The higher that index, the more segregated an area or group of schools.
 The data obtained by the Chicago News Cooperative shows that where race was not used as a factor in admissions, 85 percent of either black or white students would have to change schools to achieve an even distribution between the two groups across the entire school system. But in schools where race is allowed to be a factor in admissions, only 62 percent of either black or white students would have to change schools. 
 Similarly, to achieve a balanced mix of black and Hispanic students throughout the district, 69 percent of either group would have to move at schools where race is considered in admissions. Where race is not taken into account, 81 percent of such students would have to switch schools. 
 The practical challenges to school integration are substantial, in part because white students make up only about 9 percent of the public school population, compared to a white population of 31.5 percent in the city. But at magnet, gifted, classical and selective-enrollment schools, 17 percent of the students are white, nearly double their presence throughout the public school system, according to data from the Illinois State Board of Education. 
 That relatively high representation leads critics to say white students already have too many seats in magnet and selective-enrollment schools. Still, there are certain magnet schools within the district that are racially isolated because no white students applied. ''If you don't have a specific group's applications, you're just running a lottery or you're just running a rank order list,'' said Abigayil Joseph, head of the Chicago Public Schools office of academic enhancement.
 Experts in social policy say the use of social and economic factors does not compensate for the fact that the neighborhoods from which special-enrollment schools draw their students are themselves not integrated. 
 ''Until we have a world in which housing is more integrated, it's natural to believe we'll see schools pretty segregated regardless of the intent or the policy actions of school administrators,'' said David Figlio, a professor of education and social policy at Northwestern University. 
 The new Chicago Public Schools policy is prompted in part by research showing that economic diversity can help improve the performance of low-income children, with children from middle-income families increasing expectations and bringing more resources from their families. Yet achieving economic diversity will also be a challenge in Chicago because 85 percent of students come from low-income families. 
 In filling magnet school rosters, the schools will assign first priority to siblings of students already at a particular school. Forty percent of the remaining spots will go to children from the school's neighborhood. 
 After that, spots will be divided among children in four different socioeconomic tiers. Children will be placed in those groups according to the income and education levels in the census tract where they live; the percentage of single-parent households; owner-occupied homes, and households where their primary language is something other than English. 
 As a final check, Ron Huberman, the chief executive officer of Chicago Public Schools, will review the numbers to determine if changes need to be made to the percentages of seats assigned to each group. 
 At gifted, classical and selective-enrollment schools, where students take tests to qualify for admission, 60 percent of the slots will be reserved for students who rank among the top academic performers in each of the four socioeconomic groups. The remaining 40 percent will be assigned based on students' citywide test rank, regardless of socioeconomic background.
 The approach in Chicago is the latest response by school systems across the country to a 2007 United States Supreme Court ruling that outlawed the use of an individual student's race to determine the placement of individual students into schools in Seattle and in Jefferson County, Ky. But districts have not abandoned the use of race entirely. Even in Jefferson County, which includes Louisville, school officials use the racial demographics of a neighborhood alongside socioeconomic factors to assign students. 
 Jefferson County schools now consider the percentage of minority students in the greater geographic area as well as the education and income of adults in the area when weighing admissions, said Pat Todd, director of student assignment for Jefferson County schools. ''This gives us more racial, ethnic and economic diversity,'' she said. 
 San Francisco is an example of the limits of socioeconomic initiatives as tools to create racial diversity in classrooms. In 2001, the city's school system switched from an approach using race to one that considers five factors including socioeconomic indicators like extreme poverty. 
 But the schools have grown more segregated under that system, and the school district has begun revamping its policies. It now is considering the use of ''academic achievement diversity'' indicators, like whether a child attended preschool, said a spokeswoman for the San Francisco Unified School District. Officials are also considering clustering schools into common, diverse boundary areas. 
 Monique Bond, a spokeswoman for the Chicago Public Schools, said the district had looked at what did not work in other cities. It will review the new policy after one year, Ms. Bond added, and will make changes if needed. 
 Sherry Swan, 43, fears that the removal of race from the equation will reduce seats for minority children like her seventh-grade son, who attends a regional gifted center. Though her son tested well, it helped that the school had a slot for a black student, she said. 
 ''If they didn't have a slot,'' Ms. Swan said, ''he wouldn't be there.''

HEADLINE: For Many, Utility Bill Is One More Casualty of Recession

BYLINE: By ERIK ECKHOLM

DATELINE: PROVIDENCE, R.I. 

 BODY:
For the Cardente family, the shutoff of their electricity and gas in September was a wrenching marker in a two-year downslide.
 A run of mishaps, including illness and the husband's workplace injury, extensive structural damage from a burst water bed and the mother's layoff from a nursing job, had already upended their middle-class lives. Then the pile of utility bills emerged as a headache to rival the past-due mortgage. 
 ''You always try to pay your mortgage or rent to keep a roof over your head,'' said Debra Cardente, the mother. ''Then you ask, do you pay your electric or gas bill, pay your telephone or put food on the table?'' 
 The recession has accentuated what was already a growing home-energy challenge for low-income and many middle-class households across the nation. Rising numbers have had their utilities shut off, causing desperate scrambles to pay arrears and penalties to get them restored. 
 In 2009, some 31,000 households in Rhode Island will have their utilities shut off, and the effort to juggle energy bills and mortgages is helping push some homeowners into foreclosure, said Henry Shelton, director of the George Wiley Center, a consumer advocacy group here. (Here, as in many states, utilities may not disconnect the poor in the winter.) 
 Since 2000, the cost of heating a home with fuel oil has more than doubled and the cost of heating a home with electricity has risen by one third, outpacing many incomes. The recent surge in unemployment has thrown even more people into energy debt. 
 Last winter, applications for federal energy assistance soared and Congress nearly doubled money for the program, known as Liheap, to $5.1 billion. In 2009, a record 8.1 million households, up from 6.1 million in 2008, received one-time grants, averaging about $500, according to data released Friday by the National Energy Assistance Directors' Association.
 Congress kept the financing at $5.1 billion for the coming year. Energy prices have dipped slightly, but applications this fall are up an additional 20 percent, so grants will shrink or more people will be turned down, the association said. 
 ''Households will do just about anything to stay connected,'' said John Howat, an analyst with the National Consumer Law Center in Boston. If they cannot pay, some people move and open a new account under a different name. Some run extension cords from a neighbor's house, others spend weeks getting heat from dangerous kerosene stoves and light from candles.
 The Cardentes got their power turned back on by borrowing money from relatives and paying $3,500 toward arrears of more than $10,000. But they defaulted on a plan that called for them to pay $723 each month, and the utility demanded the balance of almost $5,000. They are applying for Liheap aid and plan to appeal to the utility for more time. 
 For some low-income families, the federal grants have been welcome but just too small. Suzette Orazi, 50, and her husband, Juan Lizardo, 45, live with a teenage son in a house in Providence that is heated inefficiently with electric room units. As energy prices climbed over the last several years, so did their utility bills, while Mr. Lizardo lost his job as a jewel polisher. 
 The $1,000 they got from Liheap last winter hardly made a dent in their growing arrears, now over $11,000. The power company recently threatened to cut them off but later said that in accord with state protections for low-income customers, it would not do so in winter. It is still pressing for an immediate $2,456, however. 
 ''We just can't make that payment,'' said Ms. Orazi, who receives disability. The couple fears losing the house as well as the electricity needed to live in it. 
 California, like Rhode Island, requires lower electric rates for low-income consumers. Even so, as unemployment in California climbed past 12 percent, the number of shutoffs among such families rose by one-fifth in the year that ended in August, according to a report last month by the state's Division of Ratepayer Advocates. 
 In Connecticut, the number of shutoffs for all incomes rose from 86,074 in 2008 to 105,300 in just the first nine months of 2009, according to the state's Public Utilities Commission. 
 New Jersey is widely praised for its program for low-income residents: a family of four making less than $38,588 pays only about 6 percent of its income on utilities. Those one step up, with incomes up to $49,612 for a family of four, are eligible for Liheap grants. 
 But many families just above that level, with incomes between $50,000 and $66,000, have found themselves in energy trouble in a high-cost state where unemployment is 9.7 percent. New Jersey Shares, a nonprofit organization that provides up to $1,000 in energy assistance to that group, has already helped a record 19,000 families this fall and turned away an additional 18,000 for lack of money, said its director, James M. Jacob. Many seeking aid are facing imminent shutoffs, he said. 
 With energy costs becoming a chronic challenge, consumer advocates in Rhode Island and elsewhere are pushing for alternatives to one-time grants, citing the program in New Jersey and a similar one adopted this year in Illinois, setting bills as a share of income. 
 Such an approach would make a world of difference for the Cardente family, for example; in hard times, their bills would have been cut, and when Ms. Cardente and her husband find work, the bills would rise. 
 New Hampshire already has income-linked subsidies, but in mid-December, citing rising hardship, the governor and legislative leaders said they would rush through a bill for still more aid. Indiana, Nevada, Ohio and Pennsylvania are among states that reduce utility bills according to income levels, said Mr. Howat, the consumer advocate. 
 The subsidies are usually paid for by raising rates for household, commercial and industrial customers, posing political risks. In Rhode Island, a bill to cap utility bills for the poor at 6 percent of income has been introduced by State Representative Arthur Handy, Democrat of Cranston. But in a statement last June, the state's Division of Public Utilities and Carriers expressed ''reservations'' about the proposal, and its prospects remain uncertain. 
 James E. Lanni, the state's associate administrator of utilities, said the plan would place an unreasonable burden on consumers, raising the average electric bill by 3.7 percent and the average gas bill by 5 percent to yield $15.2 million in subsidies. He said that the doubling of federal energy aid, along with other programs, had reduced need and that if fees were not linked to consumption, people would have no incentive to conserve energy. 
 In an interview, Mr. Handy countered that with his plan, utilities would save money on dealing with delinquent accounts and spend less money disconnecting and reconnecting homes. 
 The Rhode Island legislature is expected to consider the measure early next year.

Alex von Tunzelmann's latest book is ''Indian Summer: The Secret History of the End of an Empire.''

 BODY:
THE TWILIGHT YEARS
 The Paradox of Britain Between the Wars
By Richard Overy
 Illustrated. 522 pp. Viking. $35
 ''It is a fact so familiar that we seldom remember how very strange it is,'' the historian George N. Clark wrote in 1932, ''that the commonest phrases we hear used about civilization at the present time all relate to the possibility, or even the prospect, of its being destroyed.'' In ''The Twilight Years,'' his thought-provoking and illuminating new study of the interwar period, Richard Overy contends that before 1914 the British believed they had conquered the world and would rule it forever. After World War I, a wrecked generation had to pick up the pieces of that world and ask what went wrong. It is this process that occupies the book, which successfully adopts a broad-brush approach to cultural life without obscuring gemlike details. During the 1920s and '30s, Britain saw itself as a civilization in crisis, facing the ominous dawn of a new Dark Age. 
 If this feels familiar, Overy is not surprised. ''For some years now,'' he writes, ''there has existed a popular belief that the Western world faces a profound crisis.'' A professor of modern history at the University of Exeter, Overy argues rather sternly that, in fact, the West today enjoys a far more secure and wealthier way of life than at any point in history. By contrast, during the interwar years the British -- then occupying a position approximately analogous to modern Americans in terms of global influence and responsibility -- had indisputable cause for fear. Nearly a million British subjects were killed during World War I, and soon afterward fissures began to show in the empire. At the beginning of the '30s, the world faced a serious financial downturn, and the rise of new and deadly forms of political extremism. When Hitler came to power in 1933, Britain, France and Spain were, as Overy points out, the only major democracies left in Europe. 
 Skeptic though he may be about equating interwar Britain with the modern United States, Overy is clearly tickled by the parallels. He is too sophisticated a historian to belabor them, but from a chapter entitled ''The Death of Capitalism'' to his account of the self-proclaimed agents of morality attempting to ''cure'' homosexuality, there is plenty here that strikes a chord. On that supposed cure, the editor of the prestigious medical journal The Lancet was convinced that proper treatment could turn any homosexual into ''quite a cheerful citizen'' -- though it is hard to imagine many of the unfortunate subjects being cheered up by the combination of vigorous exercise and cold baths he prescribed.
 The economy of the early 1930s was, as John Maynard Keynes put it, in ''a frightful muddle,'' and capitalism itself was increasingly seen to be riddled with flaws. Debate raged about whether it should be reformed or junked. ''The signposts of economic and social evolution point inevitably from capitalism to socialism and communism,'' the young economist Maurice Dobb wrote. He became a prominent intellectual, accepting a position at Trinity College, Cambridge: as Overy acidly notes, ''the college tolerated his Marxism and he, evidently, tolerated its opulence.'' 
 Dobb was unusual. Though a more moderate socialism did come to hold political sway in Britain, the nation consistently rejected the extremist politics that swamped the rest of Europe. Even at the outbreak of World War II, Communist and fascist parties counted their combined memberships at around 40,000 -- less than one percent of the population -- and few of those were active. In 1933, Wyndham Lewis's sympathetic biography of the new German chancellor, Adolf Hitler, was displayed in a famous bookshop on London's Charing Cross Road. Twice a day, the window had to be hosed down to remove all the accumulated spittle. 
 While British politics remained resolutely mainstream, science flirted with the fringes. Social hygienists recommended that girls eat cakes and porridge to avoid sexually awakening themselves. Psychoanalysts applied their theories to ''the insanity of nations.'' Eugenicists claimed that a ''defective'' generation was being bred, arguing that criminality as well as physical and mental characteristics were inherited via ''germ plasm.'' Those classed as defective could include vagrants, inebriates, drug addicts, prostitutes, perverts, imbeciles, deaf-mutes, the blind, the insane and epileptics -- totaling, in one estimate, 9.5 million people, almost one-quarter of Britain's population. The birth control pioneer and eugenicist Marie Stopes, concerned with the decline in what she called the ''imperial race,'' disowned her own son because he married a woman who wore spectacles. 
 The outbreak of the Spanish Civil War in 1936 pitted the democratic republic against nationalist authoritarians. The conflict made a profound impact on Britain -- one which, as Overy rightly says, has often been underrated. His chapter on it is one of the most affecting sections of the book, telling of how 4,000 Britons -- scientists, philosophers, poets and manual workers alike -- volunteered to fight Fascism in a country to which they had no connection, simply because they believed it to be a just cause. George Orwell was among those who went, hand grenades dangling from his belt, accompanied by a small dog with the initials of the Marxist party to which he belonged painted on its side. Orwell, Overy says in the course of a particularly winning description, was ''so fastidious about completing his toilet each day that if there was no water to shave in, he would shave in wine.'' That certainly brings a whole new dimension to Champagne socialism. Orwell was wounded in action, shot through the neck by a nationalist sniper. He was lucky to survive. Many did not.
 Such had been the horrors of World War I that pacifism, and the avoidance of war by any means, was a dominant theme of the interwar years. The Spanish Civil War and the enormities of the Nazi regime in Germany changed that. ''I hate war with as much venom as you do,'' the novelist Storm Jameson wrote to her pacifist colleague Vera Brittain, ''but I have come to believe that there are certain values for which it may be necessary to fight.'' When the crisis of civilization really did arrive in the shape of World War II, there was no choice about how to deal with it. Britain fought for its liberty and its life.
 ''The Twilight Years'' was published in England as ''The Morbid Age.'' Overy notes that Leonard Woolf was obliged to retitle some of his books for American publication: ''Barbarians at the Gate'' became ''Barbarians Within and Without,'' and after some debate ''Quack Quack,'' his critique of capitalism, became ''Quack-Quack,'' with a hyphen. These may be trifling, but Overy's British title is more memorable and more appropriate to the content than the American one. It is hard to see why a publisher would prefer ''The Twilight Years'' -- unless putting the word ''Twilight'' on the cover is enough to persuade Stephenie Meyer's audience of teenage vampire fans to buy scholarly British cultural history. 
 Whatever it may be called, Overy's study of British culture between the wars is absorbing and unexpectedly moving. Some of its stories may haunt the reader long after the book has been closed, and not just the morbid ones. This reviewer has been unable to forget the June 1939 survey sent out to all medical personnel of the British Psycho-Analytical Society, asking them to state preferences for their wartime service -- whether they would rather do hospital work, emergency work, work with children or work with adults. Ernest Jones, the 60-year-old doyen of British psychoanalysis, sent back his form with a simple declaration scrawled at the bottom: ''Ready for anything. E. J.'' Perhaps that is a clue to why, despite the all-pervading sense of crisis, Britain survived its twilight years -- and the catastrophic war that followed.

HEADLINE: Bakers Dash to Satisfy A Holiday Sweet Tooth

BYLINE: By JAN ELLEN SPIEGEL

DATELINE: Norwalk 

 BODY:
 ANGELA AGOGLIA FERREIRA lets out something between a moan and a sigh when you ask about the holiday season at Angela Mia Italian Pastries, her family's bakery here. 
 ''I can't even tell you,'' Ms. Ferreira said. ''We make, I can't even tell you, thousands of cookie trays this time of the year. I'm not lying.''
 With the second highest percentage of Italian-ancestry residents of any state (after Rhode Island), Connecticut has a wealth of Italian bakeries, many dating back generations. A few have graduated to automated cookie cutting, but most still roll, cut and decorate by hand; everything is made from scratch, right down to dyeing the red and green nuts for Christmas. 
 Ms. Ferreira's father started Angela Mia in 1970, and her great-grandfather and grandfather had bakeries in New York City before that. She still uses her great-grandfather's recipes, which are handwritten in a notebook that, she said, ''looks like a Bible.'' 
 And to her it is like one. ''Christmas Eve, when we open the door at 8 a.m., there's lines to the end of the deli waiting to get in,'' Ms. Ferreira said, indicating the other end of the strip mall from the bakery. ''And it's like that till we close at 8 o'clock at night.''
 Like Ms. Ferreira, other Italian bakery owners are working flat-out during the holidays. Many estimate they sell as many cookies between Thanksgiving and New Year's as they do the rest of the year, thanks to sales now bolstered by Web sites and nationwide shipping.
 But all is not sugar and spice (and almond paste and pignoli nuts). Bakeries say the economy has hurt their corporate holiday business as companies forgo parties and shrink the size of cookie trays they give to clients and associates. And ingredient costs have risen: The price of Mediterranean nuts for the popular pignoli-studded cookie, for example, has been increasing steadily and is now about $20 a pound.
 But trickier to address is the shift in tastes as younger generations become further removed from the immigrants who brought their regional baking preferences to America. The anisette, for instance, in the iced cookies known as anginettes (though some are made with lemon) and biscotti, also called anisette toast, is unfamiliar to younger people. 
 Bakeries typically feature several dozen cookie varieties containing classic Italian ingredients like figs, almonds, hazelnuts and pignoli, with variations, names and spellings based on where they originated in Italy. But nearly all said they have to sprinkle, dunk in chocolate or otherwise jazz up what are essentially simple cookies to make them palatable to youngsters. Most carry American macaroons (coconut) as well as Italian ones, also known as amaretti (almond paste, egg whites and sugar). And almost all make good old American chocolate chip cookies.
 Louis Mezzo, whose father started Del Prete Italian Pastry in Bridgeport in 1948, said he still makes cookies like la regina, the queen's biscotti, with sesame seeds, and umberto biscotti, scratched to resemble Prince Umberto's curly hair. Old-timers love them, he said, and know to dunk these rock-hard twice-baked biscuits. Youngsters -- not so much.
 ''They equate hard and having to chew it with thinking it's stale,'' Mr. Mezzo said. ''They want Mrs. Fields.'' 
 At Libby's Italian Pastry Shop, opened in 1922 in what is now the Little Italy section of New Haven by Liberato Dell'Amura, grandfather of the current owner, Jo-Ann Dell'Amura, there are still old-fashioned hand-lettered signs for the dozens of cookies made in the big kitchen in back. But there are also chocolate chip cookies (with a chocolate center) and others that appeal to the modern masses. ''My grandfather would die,'' Ms. Dell'Amura whispered, pointing to the bottom of a case. ''This is peanut butter.''
 Come the holidays, she said, it's all-hands-on-deck to meet the tremendous demand for classic Christmas-only cookies like mostaccioli -- a chocolate-dipped spice cookie -- which she makes with a fig center; susamielli, an S-shaped hard spice cookie; and struffoli, honey-dipped, popcorn-size, deep-fried dough balls. 
 ''Basically we all chip in,'' she said. ''That's what's good about a big Italian family -- you have relatives who can help out.''
 At Julia's Bakery in Orange, relatively new to the state's Italian bakery scene (it opened in 1990), the owners, Jeff Chandler and his wife, both with Italian roots, bring in a trailer this time of year just to store the trays of cookies. 
 ''During the second two weeks of December, I just have girls making cookie trays nonstop,'' Mr. Chandler said. ''Two girls are making them and two girls are shrink-wrapping them and we're packing them up and putting them on racks and the next morning they go out.''
 Peter Faggio, the owner of Lucibello's Italian Pastry Shop in New Haven, founded in 1929 by Frank Lucibello and purchased in 1958 by Mr. Faggio's father, said he had no clue why Italian cookies had become so popular at Christmas. But even with only a small line of cookies, augmented this month with extra batches tinted red and green, he has to add at least three people to handle the increased baking. 
 ''It is a lot,'' he said with a laugh. ''It gets to be monotonous every day.'' He quickly added: ''But in a good way.''
 Biscotti, Struffoli And More
 Prices vary, but most Italian cookies run $10 to $12 a pound -- except pignoli cookies, which are $16 to $18 a pound because of the high price of the nuts. These bakeries are among the best regarded in the state. Many will ship.

HEADLINE: Denied Total Victory, Obama Accepts Validation

BYLINE: By PETER BAKER

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
President Obama's chief of staff, Rahm Emanuel, likes to say that the only thing that is not negotiable is success. The last 48 hours offered a case study in how the president applies that maxim to governing.
 After weeks of frustrating delays and falling poll numbers, Mr. Obama decided to take what he could get, declare victory and claim momentum on some of the administration's biggest priorities, even if the details did not always match the lofty vision that underlined them.
 From Copenhagen to Capitol Hill, the president determined the outer limits of what he could accomplish on climate change and health care and decided that was enough, at least for now. He brokered a nonbinding agreement with other world powers to fight global warming, averting the collapse of an international summit meeting. And he blessed a compromise on health care to guarantee the votes needed to pass the Senate. 
 Neither deal represented a final victory, and in fact some on the left in his own party argued that both of them amounted to sellouts on principle in favor of expediency. But both agreements served the purpose of keeping the process moving forward, inching ever closer toward Mr. Obama's goals and providing a jolt of adrenaline for a White House eager to validate its first year in office.
 Mr. Obama seemed encouraged by the progress. He had just left Denmark on Air Force One with the climate change agreement in hand when he reached Senator Harry Reid of Nevada, the majority leader, and heard of the health care deal. ''He was, fair to say, pretty happy,'' Mr. Reid later told reporters.
 After landing in a Washington-area snowstorm and retiring for a few hours of rest, Mr. Obama appeared in the Diplomatic Reception Room of the White House on a snowy Saturday. He called the health care deal ''a major step forward'' and the climate change agreement an ''important breakthrough.''
 Still, he acknowledged that neither was exactly what he had set out to achieve. On climate change, he said that the Copenhagen pact ''is not enough'' and that ''we have a long way to go.'' On health care, he noted that ''as with any legislation, compromise is part of the process.'' 
 In an interview, Mr. Emanuel said the developments showed that Mr. Obama ''sets out the North Stars for us'' in terms of broad and ambitious goals, but is willing to let his staff and allies haggle over the specifics. ''He doesn't negotiate the ends,'' Mr. Emanuel said. ''He's very open to discussing alternative routes.''
 Critics cautioned against making too much of the agreements. ''They are pyrrhic victories,'' said John Feehery, a Republican strategist and former Capitol Hill aide. ''Neither deal will necessarily improve his poll ratings with swing voters, nor will they energize his base. And neither take the necessary steps to put the American economy back on track, which should be the only thing he is thinking about right now.''
 The climate deal in particular may seem more than it is. With the Copenhagen conference unable to agree on binding limits on greenhouse gases linked to climate change, Mr. Obama settled for a three-page agreement with no short or midterm goals but a long-term commitment to prevent world temperatures from rising by more than two degrees by midcentury.
 The health care legislation is much further along, and while it compromised on abortion and abandoned a government-run health plan, it still includes many changes long favored by Democrats. If it passes the Senate this week as now appears probable, it stands a much better chance of actually becoming law, culminating decades of largely failed efforts to revamp the nation's health care system.
 Mr. Obama has put a high value on process and keeping things moving, recognizing that history generally does not remember the to and fro, only the big sweep of presidential accomplishments. He may not get the health care plan he envisioned but, if the legislation passes, he will insure 30 million more people, stop insurers from denying coverage for pre-existing conditions and at least try to rein in costs. He will not end climate change in his presidency, and may not get the market-based emission caps he wants, but he may move the country, and the world, toward meaningful action.
 Of course, to many on both sides of the aisle, there is a less sympathetic narrative. To the left, Mr. Obama seems increasingly to lack the fire to fight on matters of principle. To the right, he appears to be overreaching, saddling the country with debt and the weight of a bloated and overly intrusive government.
 Yet whatever their merits, coming at the end of a tough first year, the developments of the past couple of days were something of a balm for the Obama White House. Little this year has come as easily as Mr. Obama and his team once imagined, but as they sort through the balance sheet, they argue that the mediocre poll ratings do not reflect the record.
 Mr. Emanuel noted that a year ago, the economy was on the brink of a depression and the financial and auto industries were near collapse. Today, the economy is growing again, and banks and one of the large car companies are repaying government bailouts, although unemployment remains perilously high and the national debt is soaring.
 He also ticked off a series of legislative measures that passed with little notice -- an expansion of health care for lower-income children, new regulations on the tobacco and credit card industries and an overhaul of military acquisition. With health care now looking closer to passage, Mr. Emanuel called it the ''most significant legislative first year of a first-term president since Franklin Delano Roosevelt.''
 Even so, White House officials are frustrated at the difficulties they have had. As they talk about their agenda for 2010, some Democrats have suggested looking for a few easy, popular initiatives as sort of a breather between the big-ticket, often polarizing proposals that dominated 2009. 
 The problem, as they noted, is that they had expected some of this year's proposals to be more popular, only to discover otherwise in a treacherous political climate.
