Improving a Rented Unit
 
Question: I live in a rent-stabilized apartment building that became a co-op about six years ago. My understanding was that the owners weren't really anxious to sell. So the insider's price wasn't really an insider's deal and most did not buy. The building is still about 49 percent rental, managed by the same group that has always managed it.
Because the apartment is inexpensive, albeit dark and small, I plan to stay and feel it would actually be cheaper to make some small cosmetic improvements rather than move. 
 I want to redo the kitchen, putting in a new floor and new appliances. Also I want to move the refrigerator to a closet, which will mean removing a door frame.
What am I allowed to do? What am I responsible for if I move? Do the appliances belong to the building? And can they raise my rent for putting in new appliances? Should I move, must I leave the apartment in the condition I found it even though as the apartments are vacated they are totally renovated by the owners who then sell them? Do I need the approval of the management? . . . Trudye Connelly, Manhattan
 
Answer: According to Stanley B. Dreyer, a Manhattan lawyer, such physical changes to an apartment will require the consent of the shareholder who owns it.
He added that the shareholder would also have to get the consent of the board of directors except in instances when the shareholder is either the sponsor or a holder of unsold shares.
As for a rent increase, Mr. Dreyer said that the state's Department of Housing and Community Renewal would have to make that decision but that it was unlikely because the work was being done at the expense of the tenant.
He also said that the matter of restoration would have to be agreed upon in advance by the tenant, the shareholder and the board.
 
Bad Credit Rating
 
Question: My husband and I have had a bad credit rating in the past. It has started to come off our credit reports except for a $5,000 Federal tax lien, which is still imposed on us until our monthly payments have paid the balance in full. We are in the process of re-establishing credit, recently acquiring a secured Visa card. We have a combined income of $48,000 yearly and we have $3,000 saved. Is it possible for us to buy a home at this time? . . . Judy Lucian, Ossining, N.Y.
 
Answer: Yes. But it will be very difficult as long as the tax lien is still outstanding, according to Margaret Scott, president of the Mortgage Advisory Service, a mortgage broker in Manhattan. She said that the easiest route might be to find a seller willing to finance a purchase. Otherwise, she suggested going to a mortgage broker, who will try to locate a lender for you.
Ms. Scott added that your biggest hurdle might be the small amount of money you have saved, which won't cover closing costs or come close to meeting most down-payment requirements.
And your down payment could be higher than ordinary because of your credit history.
Your best strategy, she said, might be to use your savings to help pay off your tax lien and keep saving for a larger down payment.
 
Mortgage Protection
 
Question: I am actively looking for a home on Long Island and am extremely interested in the new mortgage protection-insurance program for unemployment. Is it available in New York? . . . Karen Woo, Brooklyn
 
Answer: No. According to Steven Goldstein, with the Insurance Information Institute in Manhattan, such insurance is being offered in 33 states (including New Jersey) but not in New York (or in Connecticut.)
Mr. Goldstein said an application to offer the product was currently being considered by the state Department of Insurance in Albany. No decision, however, is expected before April 1.

HEADLINE: If You're Thinking of Living in: Byram

BYLINE: By ELEANOR CHARLES

 BODY:
GREENWICH has never been as unremittingly rich, white and Episcopalian as commonly believed, and many of its 12 distinct neighborhoods are widely divergent economically and ethnically.
In the last 100 years, as the town shifted from farming to a metropolis with large numbers of transient executives and anchored by a core of urbane shops and office buildings, some outlying districts remained untouched. Byram, with its own mini-business center and strata of working-class, middle-class and wealthy residents, is the same self-sufficient village it always was. 
 "The trolley tracks are gone on Mill Street, but little has changed in 100 years," said Esther Banker, a third-generation Byram resident and director of the Byram Shubert Library, part of the Greenwich Public Library system. "An in-town study done in 1990 showed that Byram is the least transient community in Greenwich."
In the mid-1800's Byram was a melting pot for Slovaks, Italians, Scandinavians, Poles and Germans who came to work in the Port Chester foundries and in factories along the Byram River separating Port Chester in Westchester County from Greenwich, its Connecticut neighbor.
Enterprising developers bought parcels of Byram farmland for about $280 an acre and built hundreds of laborers' homes on 50- by 100-foot lots near the river,, enabling the men to walk to work over the Mill Street Bridge. Many third-generation descendants still live in those houses.
A neighborhood shopping district of family-owned businesses developed on Mill Street and Delavan Avenue where three delis, two barbershops, a hairdresser, a restaurant and the old firehouse restored as a small office building are typical of the commercial enterprises.
Toward the end of the 19th century the Lyonses and the Meads, old Byram farm families, began selling off major landholdings to wealthy New Yorkers, who built estates overlooking Long Island Sound on Byram Shore Road. At first they were summer homes, but as railroad and highway access to the city improved, they became permanent residences.
Owners have included Henry Mallory, founder of the Mallory Steamship Lines; John Shubert, the theatrical producer; Walter Teagle, president of Standard Oil; John McClave, a lumber tycoon and onetime New York City Police Commissioner, and Gerald Tsai Jr., former chairman of Primerica.
Many contributed generously to the community. Shubert, for example, donated most of the money to build the Byram Shubert Library, about 100 yards from New Lebanon Elementary School. It works closely with the school on such programs as a free after-school homework assistance and play activity schedule for children of working couples.
"THIS is the only neighborhood public school left in town," said Carol Sarabun, the principal. "Every child walks to school. Several of our employees are neighborhood people, often multigenerations of one family, and the teachers know almost every child."
The school building, put up in 1959, has just been renovated to accommodate a computer lab and new media center. There are 180 children in k-5, after which they attend Western Middle School nearby, then Greenwich High School.
New Lebanon is involved in a computer program that lets children develop reading and math skills at their own pace, recording their progress on printouts that are used to place pupils in one of several experimental ungraded classes.
In the 50's, Interstate 95 was built, cutting across Byram from east to west and separating expensive waterfront mansions on the Sound from the middle-class and blue-collar neighborhoods extending from the turnpike to the Byram River. Many houses are shadowed by the elevated highway, others are exposed to the roar of traffic, still others rattle as the Metro-North trains roll by.
Despite such drawbacks, the area is attracting new residents.
"The working-class section is becoming gentrified," said James Sandy, Greenwich Town Planner. "Young professionals are moving in and renovating the old houses."
Two-family houses on the hilly, winding streets are being converted to condominiums and there is some new construction. Richard MacDonald and his architect wife, Lorie Jones, bought a new two-bedroom unit at River Cove Condominiums, designed by Ms. Jones, for $275,000 in 1986. The units have beamed cathedral ceilings, living-room fireplaces, laundry rooms and garages.
"We've lived in Byram since 1979," said Mr. MacDonald. "We like the neighborhood atmosphere and the unusual mix of people and houses."
To protect the area from excess office and condominium construction, zoning regulations were enacted in the late 70's that prohibit nonwater-related construction along the riverside.
On Byram Shore Road, where many old estates have been broken up into large lots, properties are more expensive, but less so than in other parts of town.
"We have listings of four houses on Byram Shore Road from $549,000 to $945,000," said Katie Favor of Katie Favor & Associates Realtors on Glenville Street. "Seven homes are for sale north of the highway from $175,000 to $399,000. At $175,000 you have to redo the kitchen, bathrooms and porches, and the lot is only 41 by 82 feet."
"There is a Spanish Mediterranean on Byram Shore Road for sale at $875,000, but it needs work," said Joan Bobrow, head of the local Joan Bobrow Real Estate. "Condo units on Mead Avenue are available for $239,000 with two bedrooms, and $249,000 with three bedrooms, and there are units in two-family houses and condos to rent for $800 to $1,500."
Recently a Victorian mansion on Byram Shore Road listed for $1.1 million sold for $780,000.
Byram residents may use any of Greenwich's extensive recreational facilities, but "they tend to stay in Byram," said Frank Keegan, the town's recreation director, "just as I did when I was growing up there."
The 31.5-acre Byram Park, facing the Sound and built over the remains of a bluestone quarry, is the heart of the neighborhood. It has a municipal pool, beach, tennis courts and marina. The Dorothy Hamill Skating Rink, named for Greenwich's Olympic champion, is on Sherman Avenue.
Only residents and their guests may use town sports facilities. Residential season tennis permits cost $12, beach cards $14; ice-skating cards are $1.50 for children, $3 for adults and free for those under 4 and over 65.
There are 250 public slips and 100 public moorings in Byram Park. Seasonal moorings cost $25, slips $63 to $126, depending on boat size. There also are private marinas on the river..
RUDY'S also sells fishing tackle and bait. Eckard Fraude, nephew of Rudolph Luedtke, the founder, said: "In salt water you can catch flounder, blackfish, striped bass, bluefish, porgies and weakfish. Upriver there is fresh-water fishing for large- and small-mouth bass, rainbow and brook trout."
Two of the more popular of Greenwich's 88 restaurants are in Byram. That Little Italian Restaurant on Mill Street draws customers from New York State and Connecticut. Lunch is around $10 and a three-course dinner costs $20. Cheesecake and chocolate peanut butter cake are additions to the Italian specialties.
Amerigo's has been on South Water Street for 24 years. Bowing to the recession, it has lowered basic lunch and dinner prices to start at $5.75 and $8.75, respectively.
A vestige of Byram's ethnic past survives in the Sokol Club on Mill Street, founded 95 years ago by Czech immigrants. Part of a nationwide organization based in East Orange, N.J., it trains youngsters in gymnastics and provides a place for adult socializing. Ethnic background is no longer a membership requirement, and dues are about $12 a year.
Adelaide Darula, granddaughter of a Czech immigrant and an active Sokol member, said: "The language and culture have almost disappeared, but on the first Sunday of each month services at St. Paul's Lutheran Church are conducted in Slovak."

Rum or Romance?: Two legends persist about the origin of the name Byram. One is that Siwanoy Indians paddled down the river in the 1700's to "buy rum" from smugglers' boats lying off shore. The second is that a wealthy 19th-century landowner fell in love with his Irish maid, Mary Bridget, or Mary B for short. A married man, he could never wed her, so he dubbed the neighborhood Byram (Mary B backwards) in her honor.

HEADLINE: On Per-Bag Garbage Systems

 BODY:
I read with interest the Jan. 17 article on per-container trash systems ("Per-Bag Garbage System Creeps Along"):
The system in place in Chester Township is based on a 30-pound container of garbage, not 30 gallons as the article said. For all practical purposes, a 30-gallon container typically holds less than 30 pounds of residential trash. Weight, rather than volume, was used because tipping charges at the transfer station are by the ton. Currently the charge for a 30-pound sticker is $2. 
 Ken DeForest's contention that any household that uses a per-pound system weighs its garbage is preposterous. As a marketing tool, Waste Management sent letters to Mendham Township residents attempting to influence them into not using the per-container system because it is considerably less profitable to the hauler.
More important, what makes Chester Township's system work so well is that we have made recycling as easy as trashing. We have once-a-week curbside recycling of the following items: all cans, bottles and plastic containers, polystyrene (foam and clear) and plastic bags commingled in one container; mixed paper, including junk mail, cereal cartons and magazines commingled; bundled newspapers and corrugated cardboard. The low transportation costs of the weekly trash pickup and the minimal costs associated with recycling are included in the property taxes. The fee of $2 per 30 pounds covers only the tipping charge at the transfer station.
By making recycling user-friendly, and instituting a per-pound fee for trash, we have cut Chester Township's contribution to the landfill in half, while tripling our recycling. Our residents' solid-waste-disposal costs have been reduced dramatically. Approximately 90 percent of our families are recycling, indicating that the ease of the system and that its economic incentives really work.

HEADLINE: County Weighs 3 Plans to Handle Sludge

BYLINE: By TESSA MELVIN

 BODY:
AS the environmental clock ticks toward a court-imposed July deadline, Westchester County officials last week moved closer to a decision on a long-term sludge-management plan for the Yonkers Joint Treatment Plant in the face of overwhelming local opposition to two proposed sites in the county.
Residents of Yonkers and Peekskill, two of three sites (the other is in Putnam County) being considered, do not want more sludge -- the thick liquid residue left after treating raw sewage -- in their backyards. Like their neighbors on Long Island and in Brooklyn, the message these residents are sending to their local officials is clear: take it somewhere else. 
 Yonkers and Peekskill residents say that they fear the health and environmental risks involved in two very different treatment alternatives and that they have already taken on more than their fair share of the county's waste. Unlike other counties wrestling with sludge disposal, however, Westchester County does have somewhere else to go. Across the northern border, the town of Putnam Valley wants Westchester's sludge and the estimated $200,000 in yearly tax benefits that would come with it.
 
No Clear Preference
 Nearly all of the 120 speakers at a recent public hearing in White Plains favored that third proposal: trucking the dewatered sludge to a rural, 45-acre site in Putnam Valley where it would be converted to an agricultural liming agent. Yet many at the hearing said they felt that the plan to build a sludge disposal plant in Yonkers near the present Joint Treatment Plant had the inside track.
Four months ago, the county's engineering consultants evaluated the three proposals. While incineration, proposed for Peekskill, appeared the least desirable alternative, the two plans to re-use sludge in a beneficial way received high marks, with neither plan emerging as the clear preference.
Yonkers residents, environmentalists and municipal officials were outraged, charging that political considerations had tainted the selection process, weighting the evaluation toward the Yonkers site despite their insistence that considerable data showed that the Putnam site was best.
The Putnam Valley proposal, a joint venture between the Tully Construction Company and Hydropress Nviro Services, a partnership between a construction company in Flushing, Queens, and a Baltimore sludge-mangement group, uses chemical stabilization to dry the sludge with natural heat, producing compost.
The process won a national first- place award from the Environmental Protection Administration last year for a technology that "best contributes to the beneficial re-use of sludge," and community activists and environmentalists agreed that the proposal was the best one from the point of view of environmental, health and air-quality protection.
The proposal to build a sludge-disposal plant in Yonkers comes from Liberty Environmental systems, a subsidiary of Bus Associates of Yonkers, a private partnership. Through its Liberty Line Transit and Liberty Waste Management subsidiaries, the company operates the county's bus system and manages Westchester's five regional waste-transfer stations.
 
Cancer Risk Raised
 The Yonkers plan is opposed by the Ludlow Park Homeowners Association. "The Liberty process is 133 times more carcinogenic than the Tully process," said Edward Borrelli, president of the association, citing county statistics. "The risk of cancer under the Liberty plan is 4 in 1 million while the Tully process is 3 in 100 million."
The Yonkers plan, Mr. Borrelli added, is more expensive and would result in Yonkers' having not only the present waste-treatment plant but also a sludge-disposal plant. The Yonkers proposal relies on sludge-management technology developed in Germany but never tested in the United States. Liberty officials said they felt that the low-temperature drying process, which they described as being simple and nonpolluting, would become a model for other communities.
The process would use the methane gas now emitted from the existing Yonkers plant -- what Liberty Environmental Systems termed a "significant source of odor in the neighborhood" -- to power and heat the sludge-drying equipment in a completely enclosed plant. The proximity of the present waste-treatment plant and the proposed sludge-disposal plant would reduce the noise and traffic normally associated with transporting sludge, company officials added.
Westchester County officials say they do not favor any particular proposal and are depending on an environmental review to help them decide. The cost of the proposals will be considered along with such factors as design, reliability, energy consumption and effect on the environment.
Getting zoning approval for either the Putnam or Yonkers site will be difficult. New York City Department of Environmental Protection representatives have warned Putnam Valley officials that the suggested sludge site is within the city's watershed, adding that they will carefully review potential threats to the water supply, which a sludge processing plant could pose.
 
Truck Traffic Called Minimal
 Noting that the construction of a fertilizer-manufacturing plant "is a prohibited use in the city of Yonkers," Mayor Terence Zaleski said that the county consultants' failure to understand local law "invalidates all analysis that follows." Liberty representatives insist that fertilizer will not be manufactured at the Yonkers site.
The chief attraction of the Yonkers proposal, said Robert N. Matarazzo, the county's assistant commissioner of environmental facilities, would be its location next to the giant sewage- treatment plant in Yonkers, which produces sludge from waste collected from 28 Westchester communities. Truck traffic from the site would be minimal, and, Mr. Matarazzo said: "It's very close. We could exercise complete control if anything went wrong."
The Putnam proposal is attractive, Mr. Matarazzo said, because of its lower price tag. The Yonkers proposal is expected to cost Westchester County about $10 million a year over the 25-year life of the plant, Mr. Matarazzo said, adding that the Putnam proposal would cost about $1 million less each year.
If county officials choose the more costly option, Mr. Matarazzo said, a second public hearing will be held.
But the county must decide soon. Westchester is one of nine municipal dumpers in the New York City region under an order of the United States District Court in Manhattan to develop land-based alternatives for disposing of sludge, following the Federal Ocean Dumping Ban Act of 1988, which requires the municipalities to stop dumping sludge in the ocean.
 
March 1977 Deadline
 The nine dumpers, including New York City, Nassau County and six sewage authorities in New Jersey in addition to Westchester, all face a series of fines of $1,000 to $10,000 a day for each time they fail to meet interim court deadlines for compliance.
Westchester ended ocean dumping in December 1991 after spending $16 million to build an interim dewatering plant in Yonkers. The residue is trucked to a landfill in New Milford, Conn., under a contract running through 1995. Contracts with other landfills provide for disposing of county sludge through March 1997. By that time the county must have its own sludge-processing plant ready, according to terms of the Federal court's consent order. Two years ago, the county started looking for a permanent sludge-disposal site or process with the help of a $1.8 million study, which evaluated alternatives. The study said that incineration was the best government-sponsored alternative and named Charles Point in Peekskill as the best location. Under that plan, dewatered sludge would be trucked from the Yonkers plant to a new county-owned incinerator next to the existing solid-waste incinerator at Charles Point and the resulting ash would be trucked to a landfill.
When the county announced the plan in January 1991, the recommendation was met with opposition from a coalition of community and environmental groups. Learning that a majority of the County Board of Legislators would also oppose an incinerator, County Executive Andrew P. O'Rourke withdrew it on the eve of an interim deadline.
 
A Regional Approach Favored
 Later that year, the consent decree was modified to allow the county to obtain proposals from private companies on re-using sludge.
Last week, the Putnam Valley Town Supervisor, William D. Spinelli, said he hoped Westchester's sludge would find a home in Putnam County. "We would accept it," he said. "Putnam Valley with its rocks and its rills is a beautiful area, but we have very few areas for economic development. All we have is our houses, and the burden is too much."
Putnam County has its own septic problems, Mr. Spinelli said, adding that septic haulers from Putnam County have a temporary agreement with Westchester to use the Hawthorne receiving station to send waste to the Yonkers plant. "It's time we developed a regional approach," Mr. Spinelli said.

HEADLINE: VOWS;
Cheryl Lee Terry and Gerard Potier

BYLINE: By Lois Smith Brady

 BODY:
TALL, blond and graceful, Cheryl Lee Terry looks more like an Ivory soap model than someone who reads palms and numerology charts.
Ms. Terry, who is 46, writes the numerology column for Elle magazine and counsels thousands of private clients, ranging from F.B.I. agents looking for criminals, to politicians, playwrights and scientists wondering about their love lives. She also advises couples wishing to set an auspicious wedding date. 
 "When John Avedon got married to Maura Moynihan, I spent two hours on the phone with John, choosing the date," she said. "You want to make sure there's no war breaking out that day, no negative numbers."
Ms. Terry's own love life was mapped out years ago during a consultation with the numerologist Florence Meschner. Madly in love at the time, Ms. Terry had asked if she would soon become engaged. She was told instead that she would meet her true soul mate, a tall foreigner, "later in life."
The prediction turned out to be eerily accurate. When she was 40, a friend introduced her to Gerard Potier, a 6-foot-4 French businessman.
On Feb. 13, they were married at Park City's Baptist Church in Dallas, the bride's hometown. "It was destiny," said Mr. Potier, 49, who is soft-spoken and accustomed to making predictions of an economic sort. He is the co-owner of B & H/Potier Partners, a shipping brokerage and consulting company in New York.
The reception took place on Feb. 19 in Vivian and Nathan Serota's art-filled and gardenia-scented apartment on Park Avenue. (The bride calls Mrs. Serota her New York Auntie Mame.) In the entryway, a white marble sculpture of a headless torso, by Igor Mitoraj, sat next to a painting by Miro.
"It was like a wedding reception in the Matisse exhibit," Pamela Keogh, an editor at Us magazine, who had been a guest, said a few days afterward. "Only it was easier to get in, and there were hot hors d'oeuvres."
The eclectic mix of guests included Regis Pagniez, the publications director of Elle; Antoine Bernheim, a money manager, and Steve Marcus, a cartoonist whose work -- he described it as "one-liners about the slacker generation" -- regularly appears on MTV.
A few guests were loyal clients of the bride's, like Holly Millea, a senior editor at Premier magazine, who said: "I've broken up with guys because she said, 'This isn't going to last, and it's just a way for you to kill the time.' So I think, if I'm going to kill time, I'd rather be working out in the gym."
At the reception, Ms. Terry wore a silk, Grace Kelly-esque gown loaned by VanLear Bridals Inc. of New York. Her original gown, also a VanLear, had been shipped from Texas but was lost in transit. "I should have known," she said. "Mercury went into retrograde today."
The dinner of filet mignon and salmon was catered by Penny Glazier, who opened Bridgewaters, a special-events company on Fulton Street, only after a consultation with Ms. Terry.
After dinner, as the newlyweds cut the Sylvia Weinstock wedding cake, they blushed like teen-agers on a great date.
A few days earlier, the bride had said: "Sometimes I look at people's charts and say, 'It's going to come late for you,' and they say, 'But I'll be over 40 years old.' I have to tell them, 'That is absolutely the best time to fall in love!' "

HEADLINE: World Markets;
Loading Up on Latin American Debt

BYLINE: By Nathaniel C. Nash

DATELINE: BUENOS AIRES

 BODY:
AS investors in fixed-income securities see interest rates drop on United States Treasury and corporate issues, some are looking to the booming debt market in Latin America, where dollar returns average two to six percentage points higher.
Led by Mexico and a host of high-quality Mexican corporations, Latin America stormed the international capital markets last year, issuing $10.2 billion in new debt. 
 For a region that suffered a 10-year debt crisis -- essentially locked out of the international lending markets for refusing to repay its bank loans -- the last three years have seen a return to normal business life.
Such rejuvenation results largely from new political stability after a long history of military coups. Many nations have put their economic houses in order, balancing budgets, selling off state industries, controlling inflation and cutting government spending.
Mexico, Venezuela and Argentina have restructured their commercial bank loans under the Brady plan. Chile, considered the foremost example of the new Latin American economies, never defaulted and is the only country with an investment-grade rating.
Furthermore, the prospect of a free-trade agreement between the United States and Mexico has raised hopes of similar agreements with Chile and Argentina. Consequently, American fund managers have been pouring money into the region.
W. Tobin Whamond, vice president in charge of Latin American new issues at the First Boston Corporation, said that as recently as 1991, the main buyers of Latin debt were wealthy Latin Americans.
"But there has been a shift of the investor base," he said. "U.S. investors have become some of the biggest buyers of new-issue bonds, mainly focusing on Mexican bonds."
Mexico's proximity to the United States, the North American Free Trade Agreement and the sheer size of the country's economy have made it the favorite. Giant world-class companies like Pemex, the state oil company; Vitra, one of the world's largest glass companies, and Cemex, a huge cement company, have received such investor interest that some are considering issuing so-called Yankee bonds, which are registered with the United States Securities and Exchange Commission, denominated in dollars and sold mainly in the United States.
The most recent issue by the Mexican Government of five-year bonds was so well received that its yield was only 208 basis points over the equivalent Treasury issue.
Both Moody's and Standard & Poor's rate Mexican debt just below investment grade, but many investors are predicting that once the free-trade agreement is signed, Mexico and much of its private industry will almost automatically receive investment-grade ratings. Thus, investors are loading up on Mexican debt, hoping for big capital gains.
"In Latin American debt, Mexico is in a class all by itself," Mr. Whamond said.
Still, sophisticated investors are focusing on other countries that are farther from the United States and less well known.
Chile, for example, although small, has perhaps the most modern, open economy. Its debt with commercial banks is so highly rated it is trading above 90 percent of face value, far above other countries in the region.
"Some superb Chilean corporations and the Government are excellent investments," Mr. Whamond said. He added that Chile, despite its investment-grade rating, has not entered the debt market for years, but "we expect to see the first offering in 1993 and a handful of offerings in 1994."
Argentina is considered the next most advanced in opening its economy, lowering tariff barriers and controlling inflation.
New York bankers say one problem with Argentina, for American investors, is its sheer distance from the United States. But Argentina has not been lost on European investment funds, and it has several world-class corporations that have easy access to the capital markets, including Perez-Companc, Techint and Bunge & Born.
Volumes in Argentine Government debt issues on the secondary market have soared recently from an average of $40 million a day to almost $200 million. One reason is the expected passage of a pension reform law to permit pension funds to buy debt issues.
"You have a lot of New York firms loading up on these issues because they want to be sellers when the pension funds come in here and start buying," Michael P. Marcel, a debt trader here, said.
In contrast, investors are still squeamish about Brazil and Venezuela. Although Venezuela had entered into the Brady program and was once considered potentially an even stronger economy than Mexico, two attempted coups against President Carlos Andres Perez have deterred foreign investors.
For almost five months, since the last attempted coup in September, the Government has not been able to sell bonds in the international market, mainly because Venezuelan bonds lost up to 35 percent of their value following the uprising.
Brazil has been mostly blocked from the debt market by the political upheaval surrounding the impeachment and conviction of former President Fernando Collor de Mello and concerns about the new President, Itamar Franco.
In the last 10 days, Petrobras, the state oil company, has come to market with a $110 million, two-year issue, the first Brazilian issue in months. The bankers say Asian investors were particularly eager for this issue because the premium over U.S. Treasuries was up to 490 basis points.

HEADLINE: Hillary Clinton's Potent Brain Trust On Health Reform

BYLINE: By ROBIN TONER

DATELINE: WASHINGTON

 BODY:
THE CLOCK is running on the Clinton Administration's task force on health care, which now has only two months to produce a comprehensive restructuring of a system that has resisted comprehensive restructuring for years. But Ira C. Magaziner, who is running the mammoth policy-making enterprise with First Lady Hillary Rodham Clinton, still found time last week to make the long trip to the Tetons.
There he met with a loose-knit group of experts that has become one of the most important influences in the shaping of the Clinton plan. Known as the Jackson Hole Group for the Wyoming ski town where its members meet, it has included over the past three years about 100 academics; executives from the insurance, hospital and pharmaceutical industries; physicians; representatives of business and assorted policy makers. 
 Although Mrs. Clinton did not attend the session, she demurred regretfully and respectfully. The Jackson Hole Group is, at the moment, hot -- the leading proponent of "managed competition," an approach to health insurance that was embraced by President Clinton during last year's campaign and thus moved to the center of the policy debate.
To understand the shadowy fascination of the Jackson Hole Group, one must first understand this: An exercise in policy-making that affects virtually every major constituent, interest group and business is under way in Washington, and it is largely taking place in endless meetings of working groups behind closed doors. In such a blackout, deciphering the intellectual forces at work on Mrs. Clinton and her top advisers might hint at the outcome. While Mrs. Clinton and Mr. Magaziner have marshaled more than 300 experts to assemble the health reform proposal by May 1, the Jackson Hole Group has already provided much of the basic blueprint.
 
How It Works
 Managed competition is still, as Mr. Clinton's political adviser James Carville puts it, a term that "no person has ever heard of, only intellectual forces." And it has its critics, including those who call it a kind of Insurance Industry Preservation Act and those who question whether it alone will truly control medical costs. But it has gained a wide following in recent years.
In theory, it would band employers and individuals into large cooperatives to purchase health insurance, giving small businesses and individuals the same bargaining power as big companies. On the other end, it would force doctors, hospitals and insurers to form partnerships that would compete for the cooperatives' business, each trying to offer the highest-quality but least-expensive health plan.
The thinking is that such competition -- overseen by a National Health Board establishing standards for benefit plans -- would hold down medical costs yet improve health care. As for Americans currently uninsured, contributions from employers and the Government would allow them to join a cooperative.
Two of the principal advocates of managed competition are Alain C. Enthoven, a professor of economics at Stanford University, who began formulating these ideas back in the 1970's, and Dr. Paul M. Ellwood, a pediatric neurologist from Minnesota who is widely considered a father of health maintenance organizations.
While the informal meetings at Dr. Ellwood's home in Jackson Hole have taken place for 20 years, they -- and the concept of managed competition -- received little attention until soaring medical costs forced policy makers on the state and national level to seriously consider change. The concept was set forth in 1991 in a formal document: "The 21st Century American Health System -- Managed Competition: A Proposal for Public and Private Health Care Reform."
Around that time, various versions of managed competition began creeping into the political process. The theory was embraced by a group of conservative Democrats on Capitol Hill, led by Representative Jim Cooper of Tennessee, by former Senator Paul E. Tsongas of Massachusetts, and ultimately by President Bush and Mr. Clinton. The editorial page of The New York Times also played an important role with a number of editorials in support of managed competition, according to longtime players in the debate.
The group and its proposal have many fans, who see it as a sweeping reform of the health-care system that is sensitive to American culture and sensibilities; the very name sounds like a muscular but orderly capitalism. It also has a strong political appeal for elected officials who fear that other widely discussed alternatives, including a Government-run system like Canada's, are too radical or too costly to sell to the voters.
 
The Disbelievers
 The group and its ideas have legions of critics and skeptics. "If you get it down to sea level, it doesn't do anything, which is why everybody likes it," said Representative Pete Stark, the California Democrat who is chairman of the health subcommittee of the House Ways and Means Committee. "There's no new taxes needed, it provides universal access, and if you believe all that, that's somewhere between the tooth fairy and the chuckling oyster."
More specifically, many critics see the Jackson Hole philosophy as an attempt to stave off true reform and preserve the lucrative franchises of the establishments that dominate health care -- especially the insurance industry. Dr. Steffie Woolhandler, an assistant professor of medicine at Harvard and a founder of Physicians for a National Health Program, a supporter of a Canadian-style system, says: "Managed competition is a last-ditch effort to preserve a role for the insurance industry in health care."
Dr. Ellwood says he was only trying to bring together all the players in the health-care system and sit them down in his living room to hunt for solutions. "The basic problem with the health industry is, here's this huge industry and there's no obvious leader," he said in an interview. "In order to get some sense of consensus, some sense of what could be accomplished, the device I used was to informally assemble leaders to focus on the problems."
Dr. Ellwood, who practiced medicine for 17 years, has been advising and consulting on health policy and planning for many years through the research group he founded, called InterStudy. Mr. Enthoven, a former economist with the Rand Corporation and an assistant Secretary of Defense under President Johnson, has also consulted and written extensively on health issues. Along with Lynn M. Etheredge, a Washington-based health-care consultant, those two are considered the principal architects of the Jackson Hole initiative.
The insurance industry and the medical profession are both well represented in the group, as is the pharmaceutical industry, which has been criticized by both Clintons lately.
Jackson Hole Group organizers are careful to note that not all the participants support the group's formal proposal. Mr. Enthoven said in an interview: "What was valuable is that we brought together people from many perspectives. We learned from each other."
Dr. Ellwood said the organizers "go to great lengths psychologically to make this meeting work." Participants dress casually and engage in opening ceremonies and skits, occasionally in frontier or Western attire. (Mr. Magaziner, reflecting Washington more than Wyoming, showed up in a suit.)
Last weekend's meeting was technical, detailed and focused on the practical problems of moving toward a system of managed competition, Dr. Ellwood said. Mr. Magaziner, who attended on Sunday, briefed the group and sought proposals on cost containment, Dr. Ellwood added.
The links go beyond that meeting. Mr. Enthoven and Mr. Etheredge are among the consultants to the Clinton task force, for example. (The culture of secrecy is such that the White House refuses to provide a full list of consultants brought in to aid in the effort.)
Jackson Hole leaders also briefed Mrs. Clinton a few weeks ago. "Clearly, the Jackson Hole group is seen as the intellectual brain trust for the managed competition model," said Bob Boorstin, the White House spokesman for the health-care task force. "Given that, they obviously played a very, very strong indirect role in what has evolved into the President's plan."
But, as Mr. Boorstin suggests, the President's plan will be the President's plan. The health-care task force is widely expected to propose some form of managed competition, but one with some kind of cap on overall medical spending. "We don't like it," Dr. Ellwood said, "mostly because we don't think it's practical. You don't get a market started by slapping price controls on it."
 
Is It Enough?
 But if the Clinton Administration hopes to control medical costs and provide coverage to the more than 35 million Americans without health insurance, it badly needs savings from health-care reform, and quickly. And the Congressional Budget Office has suggested that managed competition -- like other alternatives -- will take substantial time to produce significant savings.
Helping to meld these imperatives into a coherent policy are Mr. Magaziner, senior White House domestic policy adviser, and Judith Feder, who is coordinating the operation in Health and Human Services. (Both denied requests for interviews through a White House spokesman.)
On the intellectual front, Paul Starr, the Princeton sociologist who won the Pulitzer Prize for his book "The Social Transformation of American Medicine," is closely watched for making the case for a grand compromise. He recently made such an attempt in an article in Health Affairs magazine with Walter A. Zelman, special deputy for health issues to California's Insurance Commissioner, John Garamendi.
Mr. Starr and Mr. Zelman, who are advising the task force, argued that a system combining managed competition with some form of spending limits is the answer.
In fact, many analysts suggested that if Mr. Clinton holds true to form, his health-care policy will almost certainly be the "third way" he so often seeks in truly polarized debates -- not pure Jackson Hole, not total regulation, but something that seeks to meet the progressive goals of making health insurance more affordable and more widely available without utterly dismantling the American system.
For now, however, the Jackson Hole Group is engaging in a little pride of parentage. "We're acting like it's going to happen," said Dr. Ellwood in an interview this week, far from the Tetons, but just a few blocks from the Capitol.

Helping Families Talk When Someone Is Ill

BYLINE: By VERONICA BYRD

 BODY:
THE Camelot Consulting Group is a small company with a big idea. The management and communications consulting firm, based in Fairfield, N.J., is starting a nonprofit foundation to help the families of seriously ill patients pay their telephone bills.
Susan Marc Lawley, 41, the firm's president, says the foundation, called Lasting Connections, is the only charitable organization she knows of dedicated solely to helping defray long-distance telephone costs during a crisis. 
Robert Lawley, 50, Mrs. Lawley's husband and business partner, said: "We wanted to do something for the people whom other people tend to forget when emergencies happen. The telephone becomes a very key piece of equipment in the household to pass on information to other relatives. And the bill normally doubles or triples in order to keep others informed."
While Lasting Connections has yet to aid a family, the Lawleys anticipate that 25 grants of about $500 each will be given annually. Families will be chosen based on such criteria as economic status, the severity of the illness and the geographical distance between family members.
Lasting Connections is not devoted to any particular illness. "The money can go to the family of people with cancer or AIDS or who have suffered a serious accident," Mrs. Lawley said. The program is open to families anywhere in the United States and telephone calls are not limited to any geographic area.
Mrs. Lawley cites the healing benefits of maintaining close contacts with relatives without the worry of big bills. "Studies have shown that a patient's emotional state can greatly affect the course of their disease and the quality of their days," she said.
A board of directors is being organized and corporate donations are being sought for the foundation. Mr. Lawley said he hoped telecommunications companies would contribute money or long-distance service.
Founded in 1987, Camelot Consulting, which had about $2 million in revenues last year, provides business and career consulting, market research, strategic planning and video training. A second company, Camelot Communications Group, of which Mr. Lawley is president, provides cable and wire services, maintenance and warranty service, project management and engineering, and voice, data and imaging applications.
Some of Camelot's more than 100 clients include Northern Telecom, Nynex, Con Edison, Hershey Foods and the Bank of New York.
For more information on making donations or to apply for help from the program, call (201) 575-2903.

THE ECONOMY
 
The Numbers Are Up, but Belts Are Tight and Consumers Edgy 

By some gauges, the economy was indeed bounding ahead at the time of the election. The 4.8 percent pace of the expansion in the fourth quarter, reported last week by the Commerce Department, was the best in five years -- and was a full percentage point above the initial estimate a month ago. That's conclusive evidence of a surge during the second half. But this was not the type of economic strength that gets people elected: the jump was mainly the result of greater efficiency, not job growth. Numbers don't vote; people without jobs do. In any case, the robust growth is probably already on the wane, economists say, and President Clinton is not likely to be dissuaded from pursuing his plan for a modest stimulus. And even as Mr. Clinton impressed the nation with his Feb. 17 speech, his harsh message gave some people qualms: the latest index of consumer confidence fell after the speech.
 
Logical or Not, Rates Drop
 
Here's why interest rates are plummeting: The markets believe President Clinton is serious about cutting the deficit, which would mean less Government borrowing. They also believe new taxes would be a drag on the economy, keeping dreaded inflation from the gates. But here's what they may be ignoring: today's rock-bottom rates are sensational for the economy. From homeowner to giant corporation, borrowers are frantically rejiggering debt to pay less interest, freeing all sorts of money to go into circulation. That in turn could propel the economy into faster growth, spurring worries about inflation -- exactly what the bond market hates. Well, the market seems to be saying, we'll cross that bridge when we come to it. Right now rates are way down: the yield on 30-year Treasury bonds fell below 7 percent last week for the first time in 16 years.
 
Bulletin: The West Is Open
 
In the 19th century, the West was opened, at taxpayers' expense. The Government lured ranchers and loggers to remote areas with subsidies, and still offers cattle grazing and timber rights far below market rates. But for better or worse, the West is open now, and Interior Secretary Bruce Babbitt wants the subsidies to end. "It's a brand new era in land management," he said; the Government will no longer build dams "for dumb, stupid political reasons." Representative George Miller, a California Democrat, said: "Reagan and Bush were just holding back the future. They were the last gasp of an outdated philosophy."
 
Come to Where the Taxes Are
 
At this White House, "health" is the word. No smoking inside, a track taking shape outside. And those who don't jog alongside this particular bandwagon had better get ready to pay the price. There are taxes and there are taxes, but cigarette taxes, Bill Clinton said last week, are different. Why? "We are spending a ton of money" to deal with health problems caused by "bad health habits, and particularly smoking." "Sin taxes" haven't specifically been proposed yet; they're being saved to pay for a broad health plan. But smokers, be warned: those taxes are on the way.
 
Bank Lending, Mr. Bailey's Way
 
A bank lender should scrutinize a borrower's character, not just the cold, cruel numbers. George Bailey said it years ago in "It's a Wonderful Life," and now it's being said again -- by Bill Clinton and Alan Greenspan. They plan to ease rules to spur lending, mainly to small business -- "to break the back of the credit crunch" that followed the S.& L. scandal, Mr. Greenspan said. The President's goal is to "release the energies" of small business by making loans the old-fashioned way. Perhaps George Bailey can take that world tour now.
 
 
 
INTERNATIONAL

 
Lost Aircraft Jobs: Airbus Did It
 
In scouring the world for outcroppings of unfair competition, President Clinton has spotted a culprit. He told workers gathered in a cavernous Boeing hangar that Europe's subsidies to Airbus cost Americans jobs. "So we're going to try to change the rules," he said. But he made it clear that he would not fight subsidies with subsidies; instead, he will seek to limit Europe's aid to Airbus. We should not "shield ourselves," he said.
 
1.2 Billion Thirsty Chinese
 
Every single day, the average American gulps down nearly one can or bottle of something made by Coca-Cola. But it takes eight months for the average person in China to do so. Coke is not going to put up with that -- not with 1.2 billion dry gullets waiting. The company, which came to China in 1981 and now runs 13 plants along the coast, negotiated for several years with Chinese officials to expand inland. Those talks culminated last week in an agreement that calls for Coke to spend $150 million to build or upgrade 10 bottling plants in the interior.
 
But modern man cannot live by Coke alone. Last week China also agreed to discuss buying a wide range of equipment from A.T.& T., like switching systems and cellular phones.
 
Bentsen Speaks, the Yen Soars
 
Japan has mixed feelings about its currency. A strong yen helps its troubled banks and could dent its trade surplus, which is a political liability on the world stage. Its auto and electronics industries thrive on exports, though, so any lost exports would hurt. But Treasury Secretary Lloyd Bentsen's views are clear: he wants the yen up, the American trade deficit down. Currency traders listened to Mr. Bentsen last week, sending the dollar to its lowest level ever against the yen.
 
 
 
COMPANIES

 
Are Drug Profits Too High?
 
Drug makers, like other companies whose lifeline is scientific research, clearly need high profits to finance that research. But how high? A Congressional study released last week said that even using industry numbers, it saw "excess profits." And the study put a number on that "excess": more than $2 billion. A trade group responded that high profits were more typical of past years -- that future price increases, given the new scrutiny on health costs, would be held in check.
 
A Bad Week for Biotech
 
These are not good times for biotechnology companies. First Centocor and Xoma ran into problems over drug effectiveness. Then last week Synergen said it was disappointed by tests for its most promising new drug, Antril, a treatment for sepsis, a deadly bacterial infection. Synergen shares, which had traded above $66 in December, lost two-thirds of their value in a day, prompting a sell-off in other biotech stocks. Amgen was also battered, because of poor sales of its drug Neupogen, and the biotech sell-off continued.
 
I.B.M. Speaks the 'L' Word
 
A 79-year tradition of virtual lifetime employment ended last week with four blunt words: "Layoffs will be required." The long-taboo "L" word was spoken as I.B.M. gave details of planned job cuts, which will surpass the announced 25,000 and begin in March.
 
Two Bush Aides Find Work
 
Out of sight, but not out of work. Enron hired James A. Baker 3d and Robert A. Mosbacher to help develop overseas projects.
 
Battling to Save a G.M. Plant
 
New York State is dangling all possible carrots in front of General Motors to try to keep it from shutting its plant in North Tarrytown in 1995, a closing that would cost the state 3,000 jobs and a $122 million payroll. It is putting together a $100 million incentive plan, which would involve building a parts plant nearby. But G.M. seemed unmoved, even at the thought of a lawsuit -- it said it had promised to stay only until 1995.

Meanwhile, Detroit's grapevine was buzzing with talk that the architect of much G.M. cost-cutting, Jose Ignacio Lopez de Arriortua, was being courted by Volkswagen. Neither company would confirm the reports, but a G.M. executive said, "There's too much smoke around this one" -- there could well be a fire.
 
Microsoft Didn't Coin the Word
 
What is the legal difference between "windows" and "Windows"? Nothing, says the United States Patent Office, which ruled that the word had entered the computer lexicon long before Microsoft capitalized it in 1983, and soon capitalized mightily on it. The Patent Office issued a preliminary decision denying Microsoft a trademark on the wildly successful program. If upheld, the decision will be a big blow to Microsoft, which has sold 12 million copies of Windows in the last year.
 
Enter the Technology President
 
The portrait is taking shape; he clearly plans to be the Technology President. Bill Clinton announced a broad initiative aimed at fostering Government-industry cooperation for new technologies and innovative small companies. "Where our interests are mutual and line up," said Dr. Jack Gibbons, the President's science adviser, "Let's go for it." The plan calls for $17 billion in spending over four years on initiatives like a national data highway and an "environmentally clean" car. Perhaps it was the last straw when he saw those old White House typewriters and the phone system fit for the Smithsonian.

HEADLINE: At Work;
Straddling the Law on Layoffs

BYLINE: By Barbara Presley Noble

 BODY:
WHEN Congress passed legislation in 1988 requiring companies to give 60 days' notice to workers who were about to lose their jobs, it was trying to put a tourniquet on the wounds of America's industrial heartland. Business howled, as it tends to do over measures it views as fettering its options. President Ronald Reagan, who vetoed the measure once and only reluctantly let it slip through on a second pass, used to refer to the law -- known formally as the Worker Adjustment and Retraining Act, or WARN -- as "a ticking time bomb in the back seat of any medium-sized or larger company."
Last week, the General Accounting Office, the agency directed by Congress to keep tabs on the alleged time bomb, weighed in with its report. That instigated a confluence of not-very coincidental events, a Congressional hearing and the release by a grass-roots labor organization of what it called a "dirty dozen" of plant closings and layoffs. 
 WARN requires employers with 100 or more full-time workers to give 60 days' warning of a closing or layoff to both workers and government officials when shutting down an operation affecting 50 or more full-time workers. Notification is also required for layoffs involving 50 or more full-time workers who make up at least a third of the work force or for "mass layoffs" of 500 or more workers.
On Tuesday, Linda Morra, the G.A.O. official who directed the WARN evaluation, appeared before the Senate subcommittee on labor to report her results. The G.A.O., a polite and cautious institution, stopped far short of accusing companies of playing fast and loose with the exceptions to the law, but it indicated that few workers are getting the notice to which they are entitled.
The G.A.O. acknowledged that thousands of workers have received the notices due them, but it pointed out that the law excludes more than half the employers with more than 100 workers in the 11-state sample it reviewed. And even when closings appeared to fall under WARN -- the G.A.O. was careful to say it could not determine if employers were violating the law -- half the employers didn't provide notice. Of that group, 29 percent provided less than 60 days' notice.
That is problematic, Ms. Morra said in her testimony and in an interview later in the week, because research on economic dislocation indicates that workers who learn far enough in advance of a layoff or closing are in a better position to find new jobs and to maintain their standard of living.
Ms. Morra was agnostic on one topic likely to remain controversial as discussions of modifications in the law begin. Are the WARN exceptions and "thresholds" -- the third-of-the-work-force threshold, for example -- really loopholes in disguise? "The law," she said, "was very much a compromise between needs of workers and local government and the needs of business." She added: "It was carefully constructed so that there were exceptions, and so that it would apply to a small number of employers."
LESS agnostic was Greg Watchman, a spokesman for the labor subcommittee. "There is no question that companies are exploiting loopholes," said Mr. Watchman, whose boss is Senator Howard Metzenbaum, the Democrat of Ohio and chairman of the subcommittee. Companies can exploit hazy definitions in the law or gradually cut the work force until they fall under the legal threshold covered by WARN, Mr. Watchman said. The subcommittee has been hearing about problems with the law "not just from the G.A.O., but from people who are out there living with it," he said.
The least agnostic of those involved in Tuesday's convergence was surely the Federation for Industrial Retention and Renewal, a grass-roots group concerned with economic dislocation. The Chicago-based federation went to Washington to announce its third annual Plant Closing Dirty Dozen, the 12 most extreme examples, according to the group, of "irresponsible plant closings and community abandonment."
The list: Acme Boot/Farley Industries, Detroit Coke, General Motors, Haverhill Shoe, Hough Bakeries, Lewis Nut and Bolt, McDonnell Douglas, the Pittsburgh Press/ Scripps Howard, the R. E. Phelon Company, Reynolds Metals/BICC Cables, Stroehmann Bakeries/Taystee and Zenith.
The award implies that companies should be held to a higher standard than required by either the law or their collective corporate conscious. "Yes, the assumption is that they have a responsibility," said Sonia Angell, a field organizer for the federation. Workers need to gain some control over their lives and their futures. "We are looking for ways to change that are managed and planned," Ms. Angell said. "If a plant's going to close, it will close. But if we can find alternatives, a lot don't have to close."

HEADLINE: YOUR TAXES;
Cheer Up, It Could Be Worse

BYLINE: By ROBERT D. HERSHEY Jr.

 BODY:
THE tax season may be bleaker than usual this year, what with taxpayers getting smaller refunds or writing bigger checks as a result of George Bush's decision to withhold less tax -- but not reduce the liability -- during the 1992 campaign. And with the new President, Bill Clinton, likely to raise taxes not once, but twice, in coming months.
But there is at least a small bit of comfort. People in most other countries pay more, in some cases lots more. Like two-thirds of a $100,000 income in Egypt and two to five times the American price for a gallon of gasoline or a pack of cigarettes in most of Western Europe and in Canada. 
 For all the groaning and gallows humor, American tax bills do not seem excessively burdensome, on a comparative basis. Among 19 members of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, only Turkey taxes less in terms of Government receipts as a percentage of total national output. And the United States would remain among the most lightly levied even if taxes were raised enough to balance the Federal budget.
"The U.S. is on the low end, the better end, of the tax scale," said Bruce B. McLaughlin, partner for international executive tax at KPMG Peat Marwick, the accounting firm.
The burden becomes somewhat greater when you add state taxes -- 7.875 percent on higher incomes in New York -- to Federal ones but even then "the U.S. is still at or near the bottom of the advanced industrial countries," Laura D'Andrea Tyson, President Clinton's chief economic adviser, told Congress the other day.
Yet the national tax code, the product more of relative political clout than enlightened economics, is freighted with anomalies. The citadel of capitalism provides fewer and less generous incentives to savers than do most other industrialized countries, taxing long-term capital gains on portfolio securities higher than all but Australia and Britain among a dozen comparable countries. And unlike these two countries, the United States does not allow adjustment for inflation, which means it taxes phantom profits.
And America is only in the middle of the pack or worse on taxation of dividends and deductions for individual retirement accounts. Life insurance premiums and Social Security levies are deductible in many countries but not in the United States, according to the American Council for Capital Formation.
On the other hand, the United States is one of only three O.E.C.D. countries that have no value added tax or other national levy on consumption.
The overall lighter tax burden, of course, comes at a price. On average, Americans get from the Government substantially less health care for their money than citizens of other countries. Adjusted for this, the O.E.C.D. says, United States taxes would be only modestly less than taxes elsewhere.
"Europe generally has very high social benefits," said Mr. McLaughlin, the accountant. "They're paying more money but they're getting more for it."
While the total Federal tax take has been fairly steady in recent years, the composition has shifted. Excise taxes on gasoline, tobacco and alcohol have slumped as revenue sources, as has the corporate profits tax. The offsetting increase is from Social Security and other payroll taxes, which have nearly doubled as a share of national output since the early 1960's to about match revenue from the income tax at just under 10 percent.
But even if international statistical comparisons do no more than prove the truism that you get no more than you pay for, there remains one big difference -- for good or ill -- between the American taxpayer and those abroad.
The American system of self-assessment, still the world's most efficient, tends to be a painful, time-consuming exercise. But at the same time, Americans are not the passive recipients -- as are citizens of most other countries -- of tax bills calculated by intimidating government agencies.

The Annual Look Back: Making It Work for You

BYLINE: By JOHN H. CUSHMAN Jr.

 BODY:
THE Internal Revenue Service reckons it might take a full weekend to run the tax-filing marathon this spring: 20 hours or more to gather records, read the rules and fill out a typical pile of forms.
But the motto of the fitness enthusiast -- no pain, no gain -- may be equally appropriate in the realm of personal finance. 
 The exercise of filing one's taxes provides an ideal opportunity for some detailed planning, taking advantage of the clear picture of one's financial state that should emerge from the ordeal.
"Things of this nature are good to put people through," said Wesley Fitzpatrick, a tax partner at the accounting firm Grant Thornton. "What they learn from it is very valuable. But it is hard to convince them of that."
Is it possible to learn to stop worrying and love April 15?
I.R.S. officials believe it is. In the last year or two, the agency has been striving to relieve the anxiety that many people have long felt about doing their taxes. That means trying to make the inherently complex system simpler, but also, in a transformation of the agency's personality, taking a forgiving attitude to honest mistakes and offering easier terms to those whose tax bills have gotten out of control.
Doing your taxes means more than itemizing the past. It also means thinking about the future, all the more important with the expected changes in tax law and administration. No one can predict how much of President Clinton's tax and deficit reduction program will be adopted by Congress, but it can be assumed that tax rates will go up for affluent Americans and that most families will pay more, either in income tax or an energy tax or both.
There will also be changes in the way the I.R.S. works as a new commissioner, nominated last week by Mr. Clinton, takes hold and puts her own stamp on the agency. She is Margaret M. Richardson, a Washington tax lawyer.
For 1992, however, there are relatively few substantial changes in the tax code to worry about.
"The firm used to prepare these year-end planning guides, but a couple of years ago we stopped doing that because things were staying about the same," said Larry Foster, a tax partner at KPMG Peat Marwick.
Tax rates have not changed for 1992, and indeed the three basic tax brackets (15 percent, 28 percent and 31 percent) each cover slightly higher incomes. That is because of the indexation of taxes, designed to stop "bracket creep" as people's incomes rise along with inflation.
At the same time, the 1992 deduction for each exemption -- yourself, your spouse, your other dependents -- went up by $150, to $2,300. The standard deduction, for people who do not itemize, increased to $6,000 for couples filing joint returns and $3,600 for single people.
For some people, indexation means that it no longer makes sense to itemize deductions, especially since a few widely used deductions have gone out the window.
For example, the home office deduction is disappearing for many taxpayers, because of a Supreme Court decision that makes it harder for people to qualify.
Other tax breaks that disappeared in mid-1992, but might yet be restored retroactively, are the exclusion from income of tuition paid by employers for education not related to work and the partial deduction of medical insurance costs for self-employed people.
Important changes in the tax law this year are spelled out in I.R.S. Publication 553, "Highlights of 1992 Tax Changes." Like other publications and forms you may need, it can be obtained by calling 1-800-TAX-FORM.
TAX law is full of surprises for those who fall into old habits. The best example may be the decision by married couples to file jointly rather than separately. Although this usually makes sense, it is wise to experiment by drafting separate returns.
People who file jointly lump their incomes together, but also their deductions; handling income and deductions for each spouse separately can have important benefits.
It can happen when one partner earns much more than the other, when one spouse has high medical bills or miscellaneous deductions, or when income is high enough to trigger the reductions in itemized deductions and personal exemptions that since 1991 have applied to many wealthier taxpayers.
For example, medical expenses can be deducted only if they exceed 7.5 percent of adjusted gross income, the amount of income subject to taxes before itemized deductions are subtracted. If a husband earns $40,000 and his wife $30,000, only their medical costs above $5,250 may be deducted from a joint return. But if their baby's birth costs $1,000 out of pocket, and the wife spent $3,000 on premiums for the family's medical policy, they might want to file separately, so she can deduct $1,750 -- the amount by which the expenses exceeded 7.5 percent of her income.
The husband might then be able to write off some of his $1,000 union dues, along with the cost of his work uniforms and his unreimbursed business expenses. These are miscellaneous itemized deductions, which can be deducted only to the extent that they exceed 2 percent of adjusted gross income -- in his case, more than $800.
There are a few new traps scattered across this year's tax course. One that will trip many people: inadequate payroll withholding after President Bush last year ordered changes in withholding tables in an attempt to stimulate consumer spending.
Many people escaped underwithholding by adjusting their W-4 forms; those who now want to do so should use Form 919: "Is My Withholding Correct for 1993?"
In another new twist, people who bought or sold a house using a loan from the seller must report the transaction in more detail. The parties must exchange each other's Social Security numbers to help the I.R.S. verify the interest deduction taken by one and the interest income earned by the other.
The buyer is to report this information on Schedule A and the seller on Schedule B. But tax documents printed before the change took effect do not take this into account. There will be no penalty for failure to report the information properly this year, but it must be done beginning next year, so people should obtain the necessary data anyway.
Another change has just arrived for people posted temporarily away from home on business. They may deduct unreimbursed living expenses; but beginning in 1993, assignments that are expected to last more than one year do not qualify.
SOMEONE living in Boston who was dispatched to Los Angeles for 15 months beginning in July 1992 can deduct the travel, hotel and other costs on his 1992 return, but this year's expenses won't be deductible.
And there are new limits on depreciation for automobiles put into use in 1992 for business purposes. The new limit in the first year is $2,760. (It will be $4,400 in the second year, $2,650 in the third year, and $1,575 in each later year.) Business mileage is now deductible at 28 cents per mile.
Some changes make filing simpler this year. For the smallest of businesses, there is a new Schedule C-EZ, for reporting business income or loss, that should take little time to fill out. And in a change of position, the I.R.S. now allows sole proprietors who file Schedule C to deduct some of their tax preparation expenses from their business income, which provides a bigger tax reduction.
Electronic filing is another improvement for many individuals. You can fill out your own return and take it to a tax professional who will file it electronically for a small fee. It cuts down on errors and speeds the refund.
These are just a few signs of what I.R.S. officials say will be the agency's increasingly friendly face. This fall, the agency took many of its agents off the tax-enforcement trail and assigned them instead to helping bring back into the fold some of the estimated 10 million people who don't file tax returns at all.
About a quarter of these people are actually owed refunds; the rest will be treated leniently if they come forward voluntarily, the agency promises. Its goal: to collect billions of back taxes, increase future collections, and avoid costly enforcement actions.
Even taxpayers who can't afford to pay what they owe can fill out Form 9465, requesting to pay in installments. Any reasonable proposal is likely to be considered.

HEADLINE: YOUR TAXES;
The Tricky Details of Refinancing

BYLINE: By ADAM BRYANT

 BODY:
THE wave of mortgage refinancing last year prompted victorious smiles among the legions of homeowners who cut billions of dollars from their monthly payments. But the advent of tax season brings a fresh challenge: winning maximum deductions for last year's paper shuffling.
The task has confused many people. Julian Block, who answers tax-related queries on the Prodigy database service, said the most frequently asked questions this year concerned mortgage refinancing. "In many instances, the actual mechanics of computing the deduction are straightforward," Mr. Block said. "The snag is if you don't fall into a cookie-cutter situation." 
 Although tax experts invariably advise to start early on one's taxes, the words may be particularly useful for handling a refinancing. After all, a variety of circumstances may not be accounted for on the summary statements that homeowners receive each year from their lenders to help guide their tax filing.
For example, the mortgage that was retired by the refinancing might have carried a prepayment penalty, which is deductible. Perhaps the title company wanted a payment to cover unpaid taxes at the closing, which would also not appear on the mortgage company's statement.
If a lump-sum check was written to pay for several items like a title policy and taxes, be certain to account for the deductible components, said David S. Rhine, a tax partner at BDO Seidman in New York.
THE timing of the refinancing's closing may also have created a period in which a partial month's interest was required for both the old and new mortgages. Again, those payments may not appear on the standard summary statements, Mr. Rhine said.
With those details out of the way, points, also known as loan origination fees, become the most important consideration.
In broad terms, points paid for a refinancing must be deducted over the life of the refinanced mortgage. This contrasts with points paid for a first mortgage, which are fully deductible in the first year.
This difference prompted Nancy and Christopher Cuddy of suburban Pittsburgh to refinance their original 10 percent, 30-year fixed mortgage last year with an 8.75 percent mortgage that carried no points.
They could have refinanced at 8 percent if they had paid points, but they decided to go for the higher rate.
"I did not want to pay points for cash flow reasons," said Mrs. Cuddy, an accountant for the Rockwell International Corporation. Still, they managed to reduce their monthly payment for mortgage principal and interest by $127, to $1,082.
For those who paid points, there are two ways to calculate the yearly deduction. The first is simpler: Divide the points' dollar value by the number of months of the loan.
A more complex way can be used to reflect the fact that more interest than principal is paid in the early years. It requires two calculations, but promises higher deductions in the early years: Divide the amount of interest paid during the year by the total interest to be paid over the life of the mortgage, then multiply that fraction by the amount paid for points.
Another wrinkle is added when some money from a refinanced mortgage goes to paying off the balance of the old mortgage, and some money is used for home improvements.
If two-thirds of the refinanced amount, for example, went to paying off the old mortgage, then two-thirds of the points paid must be deducted over the life of the loan. If the remaining third was used for home improvements, then a third of the points' value can be deducted immediately.
Mr. Rhine notes that in cases where homeowners are refinancing a refinanced mortgage, they may have some unamortized points from the last refinancing that can now be fully deductible. "You may have a bundle of windfall," he said.
He also suggests that homeowners review the amount withheld from their salary for taxes during the year. The lower payments from a refinanced mortgage will ultimately mean less of a tax deduction at the end of the year. Therefore, more money should be withheld from paychecks.

HEADLINE: OUT THERE: TOKYO;
Moose-Hunting in Japan?

BYLINE: By James Sterngold

DATELINE: TOKYO

 BODY:
Just a few years ago, it seemed as if nothing could pry fashionable young Tokyoites away from such symbols of youthful self-expression as Louis Vuitton handbags and Valentino suits.
But times have changed in the recession-battered 1990's, and so have the strategies of the well-turned-out. If you want to navigate the urban jungle in style these days, there is no better way than hitting the paved-over wilds in a pair of amphibious L. L. Bean boots, or perhaps a Bean fly-fishing vest. European chichi has given way to what some see as the American basic look. 
 The Maine-bred retailer has been received with a sort of all-weather, high-loft, warm-even-when-wet exuberance that seems to have surprised nobody more than the people at L. L. Bean. The outfitter's ruggedly functional look has become, if not an icon, at least the gateway to the Japanese pocketbook.
Bean has enjoyed modest but growing catalogue sales in Japan for several years. But the real explosion in sales occurred late last year. After Bean's two Japanese partners had prodded it for more than three years, the mail-order specialist finally opened its first retail shop outside of its single outlet in Freeport, Me. It opened the store here, in the tony south-side neighborhood of Jiyugaoka, sharing the area's pleasantly narrow streets with Charles Jourdan, Laura Ashley and other top-drawer boutiques.
Since the doors opened on Nov. 8, the pace at the store has often been like that of the first day of moose-hunting season. Prices that are roughly twice the American prices -- which still make them moderate by Japanese standards -- have done nothing to deter the throngs whose appetite for canvas, Thinsulate, Polartec and ragg wool seems insatiable, as long as the goods bear the L. L. Bean insignia. (When some shoes showed up with the name of a Bean supplier on the liner, Bean, at great expense, had to arrange for new liners to be sent here along with instructions on how to replace the offending ones.)
Japan has just surpassed Canada to become Bean's largest foreign market, and sales are continuing to grow at a brisk pace in spite of the recession -- some argue because of it, since a somewhat austere look is now considered appropriate.
"Their orders are huge -- 20,000 units at a time," said Stu McGeorge, the director of international merchandising for L. L. Bean.
The Tokyo store is actually owned by Seiyu, a big retailer, and the Matsushita Electric Industrial Company, the huge consumer-electronics concern that makes Panasonic, Technics and other popular brands. Bean licensed its name, oversaw the design and sells the store all of its merchandise. It holds no equity in the store itself, however.
On a recent crowded weekend, it was easy to see why orders keep rushing in.
"Oh, I only plan to wear them in the city," said Hiroki Tanabe, a 24-year-old office worker examining a pair of Bean boots. "But they will show that I have an interest in the outdoors."
Yuko Araki, a willowy 15-year-old attired in black ribbed tights, immense laced black boots and a billowy white sweater, said she had had her father drive her more than an hour from Tokyo's far north. As she perused a rack of purple and green parkas, she was asked what she found so special. With undisguised impatience she explained, "It's kakko ii," meaning "cool."
Sales are running 50 percent above projected levels. Another store, to be more than twice the size of the roughly 5,000 square feet of the first one, is scheduled to open in July in the bustling Shinjuku district of Tokyo.
A number of converging trends appear to be behind Bean's success. Although Japan is sometimes criticized for its appetites for whales and for tropical timber, environmentalism has become a fad. Anything that hints of ecological awareness has thus become popular. The Government has also been trying to persuade Japanese workers to pursue leisure activities with the energy that they once reserved for overtime.
And the bursting of a speculative bubble in the financial markets has given extravagance a bad name. Some taste makers are even making a virtue of the more austere lives many have had to accept. The spirit has been captured by a popular new book, "The Thought of Honest Poverty" by Koji Nakano, about an ascetic circle in ancient Japan.
There is even a touch of conscience behind the trend. Masao Watanabe, a Matsushita official who is the store's director, said his company feels bad about Japan's enormous trade surpluses, and so it has been searching for American products to import. Of course, the store stands to ring up tidy profits (though tiny, perhaps, beside Matsushita's annual revenues of $40 billion), and it will take a lot of cotton cable-knit sweaters and chino trousers to right the trade balance. But as Mr. Watanabe said, it is a start.
Matsushita approached L. L. Bean several years ago, when it felt that outdoor products were set to take off here. Initially, Bean was hesitant about experimenting with a chain-store venture, Mr. McGeorge said, especially in faraway Japan.
Mr. Watanabe said: "This was at the time of our acquisition of MCA, and they said to us, 'No, we won't sell our spirit to Panasonic.' We had to keep telling them we did not want to buy the company, just the products."
The Japanese partners did not want to adapt the L. L. Bean products; they wanted an authentic replica of the Maine store, down to the rough granite floor in the entryway, and they wanted authentic merchandise. The store carries everything from compact disks with Maine-woods sounds to goose-down coats and fly-fishing gear, even though Japan's fished-out rivers have almost no trout and sport fishing for salmon is prohibited.
But there appears to be a deeper message. If America is sometimes regarded by Japanese as a has-been, the L. L. Bean trend has tapped into an older image of the United States -- that of a wondrous land of wide-open spaces, individualism and, believe it or not, rock-solid quality. Mr. McGeorge said the Japanese partners have insisted that the products sold here be made in America.
"To them, Maine represents a life style, a dream," Mr. McGeorge said. "They are just awed by it when they come on visits."

HEADLINE: How Did I Get to Be So Rich?

BYLINE: By ROGER COHEN

DATELINE: LONDON

 BODY:
Richard Branson is horizontal. Feet up on a salmon-colored sofa, head propped on a cushion, notes and numbers scrawled schoolboy-fashion on the back of his hand, gaze flitting over the comfortable clutter of his Virgin Group headquarters. It is just after lunch -- for which he hoisted himself briefly into a sitting position -- and the founder of Virgin Records and chairman of Virgin Atlantic Airways is indulging in some postprandial musings on how he has contrived a vertiginous, but unusually laid-back, ascent to wealth and international power.
"Aaahm," he says in a mild English public-school voice, running a hand lazily through a mop of mousy hair. "Back in 1970 I couldn't decide whether to call the company Virgin or Slipped Disk Records. I guess I chose Virgin because it reflected an inexperience in business -- among other things -- and also a freshness and a slight outrageousness. I still like to think that people associate Virgin with something a bit different, something that has not been done before." 
 Apparently they associate the company with something desirable. Last year Mr. Branson, who is 42, sold the record company, which he founded in 1970, for about $1 billion. What's he going to do with the money? "Reinvest in current ventures and invest in new ventures," he says dreamily. "I am a bit puritanical, you know, and I believe I'm lucky to have the money I have and it should be invested constructively."
Funds have certainly been used effectively up to now. Virgin has grown consistently from its humble beginnings as a mail-order record service in 1970 to what is now a sprawling conglomerate. Over the last two decades, recording studios, a travel business, computer games, publishing and retailing have all been added. But Mr. Branson's empire has always retained a common thread, a Virgin style, instantly identifiable from Los Angeles to Paris to Sydney, cities where its huge music outlets known as megastores are now thriving. What is this Virgin-ness? How has a very big company managed to retain the offbeat image of the outsider and the underdog even as it flies Boeing 747's from London to New York and Tokyo?
"It's all to do with Richard and his controversial and cavalier image," said Ian Duffell, who runs Virgin's United States and Pacific retail operations. "People are intrigued, and that seems to lead them onto the planes or into the stores."
Richard Branson has something of the vaguely distracted, how-did-I-ever-get-to-be-so-rich air of William Gates of the Microsoft Corporation. His persona is, one suspects, very carefully crafted and intensely directed beneath the surface mildness. He knows that being a different kind of chief executive -- answering his own calls, dressing as if life were a permanent vacation, working from rambling houses -- has become central to his also being a very successful chief executive.
Virgin, in other words, thrives on being unlike the others, on constituting the living proof for baby boomers that 1970's hippiedom can lead, with scarcely a ripple, to the hippest big business in Britain in the 1990's. Indeed, what began as a group of lager-swigging 20-year-olds sitting around distributing cut-rate records by mail has grown to employ 6,000 people in the second-largest private business in Britain, after the John Moores retail group.
No wonder, then, that Mr. Branson likes to smile. It is a gentle, deferential smile that says -- when you get down to it and junk the jargon -- business is amusingly simple. It is the smile of the casual millionaire, the man who manages to make outrageous success somehow effortless, cool, even sympathetic. Dressed in slacks and a pullover, he looks as if he had just been out for a Sunday stroll.
His first music outlet in the United States, a 30,000 square-foot emporium known as the Virgin Megastore, has just opened on Sunset Boulevard in Hollywood. It's conceived as nirvana for home entertainment fanatics, a place for everyone from 15-year-old computer nerds to 50-year-old Grateful Dead heads to experiment, in a congenial setting, with everything from Sega games to movie videos, from Brahms to Bob Marley. Sales are already running 20 percent ahead of budget, and further Virgin outlets are planned this year in Chicago and San Francisco.
Meanwhile, British Airways has just conceded that it was so worried by the upstart rival started by Mr. Branson in 1984 that it ran an extraordinary dirty-tricks campaign involving the poaching of Virgin Atlantic flight information from computers and the libeling of Mr. Branson.
The admission from British Airways, whose former chairman, Lord King of Wartnaby, had once dismissed the Virgin chairman as "too old to rock 'n' roll and too young to fly," amounted to a terrible humiliation for a company that likes to call itself "the world's favorite airline." Damages have amounted to some $900,000, part of which Mr. Branson distributed among the employees of Virgin Atlantic.
"Look," the whimsical millionaire says, "the crucial thing in any service business is the attitude of your staff. To get $400 each from British Airways is pleasant and also a great morale booster. If your employees are proud of what they're doing, you're going to flourish. I mean, how often do you see a cheery person working for a U.S. airline?"
He shakes his head; his image of surly, harassed, unsmiling purveyors of ice-cold turkey sandwiches on the average internal United States flight is evidently too much.
"Look," he says, "we're not trying to convert the world to some counterculture, but I suppose you could say we run our companies slightly differently from some. Staff comes first here, because if they're proud and motivated, the customer will be happy. I mean I really don't care the way my staff dresses. I just want them to be comfortable. And I'm not interested in hierarchies. I write to my employees personally every couple of months and invite them to write me if they've got suggestions or problems. I learn their first names. Buildings are important, too. Find places on rivers or canals if you can. Don't try to save money by putting all your companies under one roof. Try not to have more than 50 or 60 people in one building. It makes a difference."
These particular premises, in the leafy Holland Park district of London, doubled as Mr. Branson's home and corporate headquarters until he took his family a few blocks down the street last year. Not so long ago he ran everything from a houseboat on the Little Venice canal. But managing a $1.5 billion business with children aged 6 and 10 scurrying around was getting a little ticklish.
Nonetheless, this place still has an intimate feel. The school report of his son Sam lies on a table. The smell of cooking wafts from the kitchen. There's a case of Beaumet Champagne stacked against a wall. Various plaques stand on shelves, mainly awards to Virgin Atlantic for its widely admired service. But there's also a certificate from the Lighter Than Air Society awarded after Mr. Branson crossed the Pacific in a balloon in 1991. He does things like that.
"If you told Richard something could not be done, he would dedicate himself to proving it could," said Ken Berry, the chief executive of Virgin Records, which was sold to Thorn EMI last year. "He would not give up."
The Los Angeles Megastore has been loosely modeled on the Virgin Megastore on the Champs Elysees in Paris, whose success since its opening in 1988 has made it the paradigm for such outlets. Attracting about seven million people a year -- more than the Louvre (five million) and the Eiffel Tower (six million) -- the store has annual sales of about $130 million, the biggest turnover of any record shop in the world.
Installed in the former Citibank headquarters in Paris -- a grandiose expanse complete with marble floors, palatial staircases and balustrades -- the store followed the Branson recipe of breaking all the known rules to offer an original service at an affordable price to more people. It was thus that he introduced discount records to Britain with a mail-order service in 1970, and thus that he has proceeded ever since.
In a single swoop, the French outlet doubled the entire space given over to the retailing of recorded music in Paris. It defied customary hours by opening until midnight every day, including Sunday, and until 1 A.M. on Friday and Saturday. It installed a cafe so people could hang out in the store. It has a condom vending machine with the slogan "l'amour sans stress" -- "love without stress." And it broke with French retailing practice by installing countless listening and watching posts with headphones and screens for people to groove to compact disks, watch videos, play computer games and generally turn their shopping into entertainment.
"It's convivial and it's friendly and it makes most French stores seems old-fashioned," said Herve Suermondt, a 37-year-old businessman, as he inspected CD's on the first floor of the four-story premises. "I make a habit of coming here for a couple of hours on Saturday mornings. It's a pleasant break from things."
The store is indeed airily agreeable and provides many clues to the Branson style:natural light, large open spaces, uncluttered. It is user-friendly, with headphones dangling all over the place offering Whitney Houston, Claudio Abbado or the latest Mick Jagger album, "Wandering Spirit." Playful, too. The massive circular door to the former Citibank vault downstairs has been preserved as the entrance to the computer-game section.
It's all very Virgin. Very Branson. Take the manicures, for example, and the massages. Still horizontal, after a couple of hours, Mr. Branson comes around to this point. His wife, Joan, he says, had the idea and his own experience convinced him. "Aaahm," he continues, wistfully savoring his own understated ingenuity. "I'd really never had a manicure in my life before and it was jolly good, and the girl also gave me a particularly good massage and I thought, yes, what a good idea for the upper-class passengers in the planes. Well, we've had more letters from the upper-class passengers congratulating us on this than anything else."
Over the last year, Virgin Atlantic has hired 20 masseuses and manicurists to pamper its upper-class (first class) passengers on its flights from London to Japan and the United States. Very Virgin, like its earlier introduction of seat-back video screens for all passengers. Simple. Rather nifty. Irritating to the competition.
So irksome, indeed, had Virgin become that British Air went to extraordinary lengths to try to rid itself of its innovative little competitor.
There were offers of free flights on the Concorde to Virgin passengers prepared to give up their tickets. Infiltration by British Air agents of Virgin passenger lists on computers at Gatwick Airport in London. Attempts by British Air to interest journalists in the fact that Mr. Branson's travel division includes a gay vacation club called Heaven.
In short, a scurrilous operation by any standards -- for which British Airways, which is now entering the United States market in an alliance with USAir, has apologized.
"We irritate British Airways because we simply try to be the best airline in the world," Mr. Branson says. "We do it by not needing the same sort of profit levels that they need as a public company and by not spending vast sums of money on private detectives and lobbyists and 25-strong P.R. departments and dirty-tricks campaigns. What we can afford to do that they cannot is offer a first-class product with business-class fares and a business-class product for economy-class fares."
After the sale of the record business last year, flying has clearly become Mr. Branson's overriding passion. At a time when the airline business is in a slump, this may seem a curious choice, and some believe he will overstretch himself. But since he pocketed $1 billion from the sale of the record group, suggestions that Mr. Branson was financially stretched have subsided. And the challenge of a difficult business suits the Branson temperament. He wants to lead the first successful independent European carrier.
Still, the record-group sale was a wrench -- "tears ran down my cheeks," Mr. Branson confides. Recording has been the core of the Virgin business since the 1970's, and artists like Phil Collins, Peter Gabriel, Bryan Ferry and Joe Jackson were, and remain, friends.
But having turned 40, and feeling that he was spread a little thin, Mr. Branson found the offer of $1 billion from Thorn EMI too good to refuse. He has retained the title of president of Virgin Records for life -- "a bit like an African dictator," he says -- but no longer has any involvement in management.
"I'd grown a little distant from the business," he says, "and what I think I'm good at is having the energy to get something up and running and finding good people. That's what I enjoy the most -- creating new things."
There are several new things now fizzing in the Branson mind, which is really, it transpires, not laid-back at all: new Virgin Atlantic routes to San Francisco, Chicago and Johannesburg; a plan to break the British Rail monopoly by starting a Virgin train service as luxurious as its air service; the expansion of the Megastores, particularly in the United States, with as many as 50 outlets planned over the next four years in a partnership with Blockbuster Video, and the development of Vintage Air, a new business that has successfully started running nostalgia flights in reconditioned DC-3's from Orlando, Fla., to the Florida Keys.
"I hope Virgin will always mean quality, good value for money and the possibility of doing things differently," Mr. Branson says. "You know we spend most or our lives working. So why do so few people have a good time doing it? Virgin is the possibility of good times."

HEADLINE: National Service -- Now

BYLINE: By Bill Clinton; President Clinton will deliver a speech on national service tomorrow at Rutgers University.

DATELINE: WASHINGTON

 BODY:
Apathy is dead.
Of everything I've learned in my first few weeks in the White House, that's the thing that's made me the happiest. Whether or not the people I've met outside the capital support the changes I have proposed, they're all saying they're ready to rebuild our country. 
 But they know, as I do, that no economic plan can do it alone. A plan can make vaccines available to children, but alone it will not administer the shots to all of them. It can put security guards in the schools, but alone it will not take gangs off the streets. And it can provide more aid for college, but alone it will not make the costs of college less daunting for the middle class.
That's why I believe we need national service -- now.
If Congress acts quickly enough, just months from now more than 1,000 young people will start serving our country in a special summer effort. In four years, the successors to these pioneers will multiply a hundredfold. Imagine: an army of 100,000 young people restoring urban and rural communities and giving their labor in return for education and training.
National service is an idea as old as America. Time and again, our people have found new ways to honor citizenship and match the needs of changing times.
Lincoln's Homestead Act rewarded those who had the courage to settle the frontier with the land to raise a family. Franklin D. Roosevelt's Social Security Act insured that Americans who work a lifetime can grow old with dignity. Harry S. Truman's G.I. Bill rewarded the service of my father's generation, transforming youthful veterans into an army of educated civilians that led our nation into a new era.
For my generation, the reality of national service was born 32 years ago tomorrow, when President John F. Kennedy created the Peace Corps. At its peak, the Peace Corps enrolled only 16,000 volunteers yet it changed the way a generation of Americans look at themselves and the world.
Today, the spirit of our people once again can meet head-on the troubles of our times.
The task is as complex as our challenge is great. We must combine the intensity of the post-World War II years with the idealism of the early 1960's -- and help young people afford a college education or job training.
In 1993, we'll restore the spirit of service by asking our people to serve here at home. We won't refight the wars we won, but we'll tackle the growing domestic dangers that threaten our future.
Our new initiative will embody the same principles as the old G.I. Bill. It will challenge our people to serve our country and do the work that should -- and must -- be done. It will give those who serve the honor and rewards they deserve. It will invest in the future of the quiet heroes who invest in the future of others.
The national service legislation that I will send to Congress shortly will give our people the chance to serve in two basic ways:
First, it will make it easier for young people to hold low-paying public service jobs and still pay off their student loans.
Under our program, Americans will be able to borrow the money they need for collegeand pay it back as a small percentage of their income over time. By giving graduates the chance to repay loans on an affordable, reasonable schedule, this "income-contingent" program will allow our people to do the work that our communities really need.
Second, our legislation will create new opportunities for Americans to serve our country for a year or two -- and receive financial support for education or training in return.
We'll offer people of different ages and educational levels different ways to serve. And to focus our energies and get the most for our money, we'll direct special attention to a few areas:
* We'll ask thousands of young people to serve in our schools -- some as teachers, others as youth mentors, reading specialists and math tutors. They'll join the effort to insure that our schools offer the best education in the world.
* We'll send people into medical clinics to help immunize the nation's 2-year-olds. Some participants will be qualified to give the shots, but thousands of others can provide essential support, contacting parents and following up to make sure children get the shots they need.
* We'll help police forces across the country through a new Police Corps trained to walk beats. We'll also organize others in our communities to keep kids out of gangs and off drugs.
* We'll put still others to work controlling pollution and recycling waste, to help insure that we pass on to our children a nation that is clean and safe for years to come.
Our national service program will offer more than benefits to individuals. We'll help pay operating costs for community groups with proved track records, providing the support they'll need to grow. And we'll let entrepreneurs compete for venture capital to develop new service programs.
While the Federal Government will provide the seed money for national service, we are determined that the participants -- the individuals who serve and the groups that sponsor their service -- will guide the process. Spending tens of millions of tax dollars to build a massive bureaucracy would be self-defeating; it would squash the spirit of innovation that national service demands.
By design, our national service program will not happen overnight. Instead, it will grow year by year, with funding reaching $3 billion in 1997. And as I've said many times, I believe it will be the best money we ever spend.
If Congress gives us the chance, this summer we'll create an eight-week leadership training program. We'll recruit more than 1,000 young people for special projects to meet the needs of children at risk -- and to train the first class of full-year participants.
In the first full year of our initiative, we'll launch our flexible loan program and aim to put tens of thousands of people to work. By 1997, more than 100,000 citizens could be serving our country, getting education and training benefits in return. And hundreds of thousands more people could be doing invaluable work because college loans no longer block the way.
But the best planning and the most ambitious design won't make this vision of national service a reality. That responsibility ultimately rests with the American people.
I am convinced that after 12 years of drifting apart instead of working together we are ready to meet the challenge. From a 14-year-old boy in North Dakota who sent us $1,000 to help pay off the deficit, to a 92-year-old widower in Kansas who followed his example, people are demonstrating that they want to give something back to their nation.
National service will exercise our talents and rebuild our communities. It will harness the energy of our youth and attack the problems of our time. It will bring together men and women of every age and race and lift up our nation's spirit. And for all of us, it will rekindle the excitement of being Americans.

Campaign Reform: An Idea Whose Time Drags On

BYLINE: By RICHARD L. BERKE

DATELINE: WASHINGTON

 BODY:
THOUGH President Clinton has vowed to change how candidates get elected by pushing through a campaign finance reform package, the passage of a serious bill anytime soon is far from assured. Congress has its reasons for stonewalling. And so, after all, may the President.
Goaded by Ross Perot, who helped make campaign reform a front-burner issue last fall, Mr. Clinton told Congress in his address on Feb. 17 that "real political reform" was a priority. He assigned Michael Waldman, the former director of Public Citizen's Congress Watch, a group that has called for far-reaching changes in how campaigns are paid for, to draft a legislative package. 
 The Democratic majorities in the House and Senate last year passed campaign finance measures that were not strikingly different from what the President has proposed. Many knew that President Bush would veto the bill anyway, so a "yes" vote was good public relations with no uncomfortable side effects. Advocates of reform are concerned that the incumbents, now, faced with the possibility that such a bill might be signed, are likely to throw up seemingly insuperable obstacles to prevent new laws that could hurt their chances for re-election.
With his hard-to-swallow economic proposals pending, Mr. Clinton may not find himself in a particularly strong position to negotiate hard with Congress. At Mr. Clinton's first meeting on the issue with lawmakers a month ago, the only decision to emerge was that new laws would not take effect until after the 1994 mid-term elections.
 
Voila, Legislation!
 The President has yet to settle on the details of his campaign finance plan. But the fact that his aides have not yet embraced the specifics of what he promised during the campaign could suggest that Mr. Clinton is prepared to edge away from them.
Michael Waldman seems to hedge his bets: "You can't just take a campaign position paper, slap a bill number on it and say, 'Voila, here's legislation,' " he said. "There's a difference between a skeletal campaign document and a flesh-and-blood piece of legislation that has to be worked through very carefully."
Advocates of reform warn that the longer Mr. Clinton waits to submit his package, the more time opponents will have to mobilize. "President Clinton has got to define this issue in the next couple of weeks," said Fred Wertheimer, president of Common Cause, which lobbies for tighter campaign finance laws. "Delays are the enemy. You've got incumbents in both parties who know that a real reform bill means they give up a sweet deal."
The question is not only whether Mr. Clinton will ultimately sign a campaign finance measure, but whether the package would curb the soaring costs of running for office and what critics say is the undue weight of special interests. Spending for House races in 1992 soared 43 percent over 1990, to a record $313.7 million, according to the Federal Election Commission.
 
'Not Our Fight'
 There has been no word from the White House about whether Mr. Clinton will stick to his campaign specifics, such as limiting donations by political action committees to $1,000, instead of the current $5,000 per candidate. And some aides said they will advise the President to let the House and Senate try to resolve their differences over setting the limit. "That's not our fight," said a senior White House official. "We're not going to get into it."
Insisting, nevertheless, that prospects are better than they have been in more than a decade, Mr. Waldman said: "This is as complicated an issue as there is. There are certainly cross-currents pulling in every different direction. But the public demand for change and the institutional need for change are so great that there is pretty wide acceptance that there will be campaign finance reform legislation passed this year."
But particularly in the House, where members face the voters every two years, the White House faces sharp resistance to important elements that are expected to be in Mr. Clinton's plan: limiting donations from PAC's, curbing "soft money" through which candidates evade Federal spending limits by benefiting from donations to party organizations, and giving public subsidies to candidates who limit their spending -- all of which Mr. Clinton had proposed during the campaign.
One who refuses to go along with the Clinton Administration is Representative Robert G. Torricelli, a New Jersey Democrat, who argued that "simply capping expenditures will stifle the discussion of issues."
He favors giving candidates free access to television and radio and reducing postal rates to allow challengers to get more exposure. "What the Administration proposes has got a series of flaws in it," Mr. Torricelli said. "Their campaign finance thinking has to be taken out of the hands of some pure ideologues and reviewed by people who actually understand campaigns."
Brushing off the criticism, White House officials point to what they say are promising signs. Although Democrats are still maneuvering behind the scenes to protect their interests, David Wilhelm, Mr. Clinton's hand-picked chairman of the Democratic National Committee, is preaching that reform is good for his party's image. "I want to add at least two million small donors to the Democratic party by 1995," he declared last month at the University of Illinois. "We need to rely less on black-tie dinners and more on brown bag lunches."
And White House officials are basing their hopes on many of the newly elected lawmakers who came into office on a wave of public demand for changing the status quo that is reminiscent of the post-Watergate era.
"Watch the freshmen," said Susan Brophy, Mr. Clinton's deputy Congressional liaison aide. "The freshmen are going to drive this."
One newcomer is Representative Jane Harmon, a California Democrat whose campaign spent $1.6 million last year. "I'm learning that everyone here is an expert on campaign finance reform," she said. "And experts disagree. But the time for reform has come. Having been through it, I understand how much of an exhausting and distracting ordeal raising money is."

HEADLINE: The Risky Allure of 'Strategic Trade'

BYLINE: By SYLVIA NASAR

 BODY:
IN a single day last week, President Clinton promised Silicon Valley executives research subsidies and government contracts, said he would pry open Japan's market and told Boeing workers that he would fight Europe's subsidies to its Airbus Industrie. That same day, the Commerce Secretary hinted that America might consider imposing punitive tariffs on Japanese car makers.
The tough talk raised tempers around the globe, and it came from a new Administration that had already carved out a hawkish position on several trade issues, from imposing stiff tariffs on foreign steel to threatening to bar European telecommunications companies from United States government contracts. 
 Some of this is poker-playing: threatening tariffs may get other countries to drop their trade barriers. Much of this is just the old-fashioned music of politics:defending the interests of key constituents. American exports, especially of high-tech gear, are booming. Intel is stomping the overseas competition and I.B.M. is getting clobbered by American rivals like Compaq, not by Japan's NEC or France's Groupe Bull.
But part of the new tone comes straight from academia. "Strategic trade" theory -- embraced by half a dozen Clinton advisers including Laura D'Andrea Tyson, chairwoman of the Council of Economic Advisers, and Labor Secretary Robert Reich -- holds that government can create high wage jobs and rising living standards by taking two steps: First, pick a few high-tech industries to defend and bankroll them. Second, instead of relying on multinational talks, unilaterally match the moves of foreign competitors who harm those industries.
"It's clear that the Clinton Administration is much less inhibited by fears of the consequences of an aggressive trade policy than any administration since World War II," said Paul Krugman, the M.I.T. economist whose challenge to conventional trade theories laid much of the intellectual foundation for strategic trade.
Strategic trade theory has been percolating at Princeton, Harvard, M.I.T. and Berkeley for years. But the idea resonated more with the public and the President as Americans worried more about their future and became more intimidated by Japan's export successes.
Its proponents argue, basically, that markets left to themselves often fail to nurture a nation's most valuable industries, so government should.
In a speech at American University on Friday, Mr. Clinton said there was no contradiction between an aggressive trade policy and free trade. He argued that his policies would lead other nations to open up their markets. At other times, though, his advisers have argued that world trade is an Olympics with just one winner, who captures strategic industries and reaps big payoffs for its economy. Some go so far as to endorse wholesale government promotion of American competitiveness.
Mr. Clinton's remarks seem to suggest that he wants America, the world's biggest exporter, to act more like Japan or Europe by letting the hand of government guide promising industries. But the risk is that Washington could wind up imitating not only the successes but the flops -- especially with a horde of special interests trying to hijack the policy.
Strategic trade has not always served America's competitors well. Take Japan's $2.5 billion failure in the aluminum business in the 1970's. Or its government-misguided rush into steel just as low-paid Koreans and Brazilians mastered their arc furnaces. Japanese taxpayers have also taken baths on two recent flashy government-sponsored flops: artificial computing intelligence and high-definition television.
And one huge Japanese success story -- computer chips -- turns out to have a darker side. Japan coddled its infant D-RAM industry by blocking United States imports. But there's still no evidence that the country gained in the end. The investment has produced no super-profits, the leap from mass-produced memory chips to pricier logic chips hasn't happened and the success actually came at the expense of Japan's own computer industry, which had to pay so much for chips that it couldn't compete in export markets until the late 1980's.
What's more, two of Japan's brightest export stars -- autos and consumer electronics -- owe virtually nothing to government subsidies or protection. In fact, Japan's all-seeing Ministry of International Trade and Industry long discouraged Honda from exporting. And, contrary to popular perception, Tokyo showers its manufacturers with little research money. "Given the way our political process works," said Avinash Dixit, an economist at Princeton, "there's good reason to think strategic trade policy could serve us even less well." America's $2.7 billion synfuel debacle is a case in point. And military procurement may have given America a head start in computers and jets after World War II, but that was long ago. More recently, small computer and biotechnology companies built with venture capital, not Federal money, have been the fonts of success.
Another risk from strategic trade is that unilateral retaliation -- some of it illegal under world trade agreements -- could hurt the country more than it helps the companies it benefits.
Steps like slapping anti-dumping tariffs on Japanese cars could drive up prices for American consumers and signal corporations that they can do well by spending their money and executive time on begging Washington for protection instead of on getting more competitive. Industries like textiles and steel have already gone that route. High-tech ones have not -- yet.
"If you threaten to tear up international agreements," said Jagdish Bhagwati, economic adviser to the director general of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, which enforces fair-trade rules, "you're building up an ethos that makes it easier for Detroit to think they will be able to get some kind of de facto protection."
Such protection often backfires. In the 1980's, car quotas drove up the price of cars by thousands of dollars, fattening Toyota's bottom line. In Britain, limiting Japanese imports to 12 percent of the market means the same models cost less on the Continent.
All this assumes, of course, that retaliation stops there. But other nations may also play beggar-thy-neighbor. Less world trade means fewer earthlings with jobs.
Ultimately, the biggest question about strategic trade is whether it pays off for the nation as a whole -- not just the favored industry. America's problem is 20 years of stagnating living standards. But most studies blame lagging productivity growth, not world trade.
Take Airbus, for example, as Mr. Clinton did. Like European wheat subsidies, government loans to Airbus hurt the United States by breaking Boeing's virtual monopoly of the global aircraft industry. Most American economists would agree that Europe should not be allowed to use tax money to drive Boeing and McDonnell Douglas out of business, and that the subsidies phased out, as Mr. Clinton insists, is a good idea. But many would say that subsidizing American wheat -- or launching our own Airbus-type companies in high-tech fields -- is not as smart. Some workers and shareholders might celebrate, but the payback to the nation as a whole is questionable.
A modest effort at "strategic trade" could raise the country's $6 trillion gross domestic product by a few billion dollars, Professor Krugman said. "That's a painful thing for me to say," he added. "After all, this theory is my baby."
The benefits that Europe itself reaped by pouring taxpayers' money into Airbus are modest -- on the order of only $1.8 billion over 20 years, Professor Krugman said. Meanwhile, American airline companies, which employ far more workers than Boeing does, have presumably benefited from lower plane prices.
"That's the reason serious strategic trade theorists are very cautious," he said. "When you start to look at any case closely, there are a lot of side effects."

This California Dream Is All About Auto Insurance

BYLINE: By PETER PASSELL

 BODY:
WANT to cut auto insurance premiums by a third -- and, as a bonus, rid the roads of uninsured drivers, untangle traffic, reduce highway fatalities and help clean up the air? This may sound suspiciously like the teaser for one of those late night infomercials on the miraculous rejuvenating powers of pureed vegetables, but read on.
Inspired by proposals from the financial writer Andrew Tobias and the National Insurance Consumer Organization, some influential Democratic politicians in California are pressing for radical changes in how motorists pay for auto insurance and collect for injuries -- changes that they believe would slash consumer costs and improve the quality of insurance. 
 Their plan, called "pay at the pump," would use a surcharge on gasoline to cover the cost of auto accidents. As part of a strict no-fault group insurance plan, it is to to be introduced in the state legislature this coming month. Although it has already drawn heavy fire from trial lawyers and insurance agents, it is attracting allies new to insurance reform fights, notably environmentalists. "It's a win-win for drivers and the environment," said Ralph Cavanagh, the energy program director for the Natural Resources Defense Council in San Francisco.
As in most states, California's auto insurance premiums rose in the 1980's almost three times as fast as the general cost of living. Premiums reached levels that chased off many people; fully a quarter of California motorists break the law by driving without coverage.
Frustrated voters vented their wrath on the insurance industry, passing a 1988 ballot initiative requiring a rollback in rates, a cap on profits and limits on insurers' right to link premiums to area of residence, age or sex. But enforcement is snarled in the courts. And in the view of dispassionate experts, clamping down on the industry can never generate the promised savings because insurers are, at most, bit players in the drama of escalating premiums.
The management consulting firm McKinsey & Company estimated that in California, agents' commissions, administrative costs and profits ate up 22 cents of the premium dollar in 1989. Most of the rest went to auto repairs (27 cents), medical care (15 cents), compensation for pain and suffering (18 cents) and litigation costs (10 cents).
Advocates of no-fault insurance see the last two items -- pain and suffering and lawyers' fees -- as the easiest targets. Under a strict no-fault system, those injured would be automatically compensated for medical costs and some lost wages, but would rarely be able to collect more.
Consumer groups, however, are divided over the key issue of the right to sue, and the insurance industry has never managed to convince customers that accident victims would be better off with the guarantee of half a loaf than a long shot at taking home the bakery.
Trial lawyers have blocked no-fault plans in many states, including California. Where legislatures have passed no-fault statutes, opponents have usually managed to riddle the systems with exceptions that make it easy to go to court. Hence the challenge is to assemble a political coalition powerful enough to overcome that.
The out-of-pocket cost is politically off-putting, too, especially now that a new Federal energy tax is likely to pile on top of California's climbing gasoline taxes.
To sell pay-at-the-pump, Mr. Tobias and Bob Hunter, president of the National Insurance Consumer Organization, offer a no-fault plan with benefits far more generous than the stripped-down ones preferred by insurers. They have won support from most consumer groups, including a number representing Mexican Americans and the urban poor. Next, they added the feature with such appeal to law-abiding drivers, who are furious about the rising tide of uninsured vehicles, and to environmentalists, who are eager to cut pollution and congestion: Rather than writing checks every six months, drivers automatically buy insurance every time they fill up.
Most of the revenue would come from a surcharge of 30 to 50 cents a gallon. That is expensive, but right now, a typical motorist's insurance premiums cost the equivalent of 85 cents a gallon.
The rest would come from extra fees on car registrations and drivers' licenses. To encourage safe driving, those fees would be linked to people's safety records. For a driver with many accidents and traffic tickets, the fees could run to hundreds of dollars.
Finally, Mr. Tobias and Mr. Hunter offered a twist intended to save an extra 10 to 15 percent of the premium dollar. Today, auto insurance, unlike most health insurance, is sold one policy at a time by independent agents or insurance company employees, who must evaluate underwriting risks one applicant at a time. With pay-at-the-pump, all car owners could be divided by computer into statistically identical groups of 5,000, and private insurers would be invited to bid competitively for the right to handle a group's claims.
"The agents and trial lawyers will fight to the death," predicted Mr. Hunter. But he reckons that the economies from group underwriting, along with an end to pain-and-suffering awards and litigation over liability, would make it possible to keep benefit levels high and costs low.
Michael Horowitz, an expert on tort liability at the Manhattan Institute, an independent research group, is not convinced that pay-at-the-pump will work. He worries about increased government involvement in setting rates, in particular the "adjustments" for riskier drivers. And he thinks that the sponsors are exaggerating the potential savings of their brand of no-fault.
The costs of unlimited medical benefits, he argues, would be hard to contain. Moreover, most people, he believes, would wish to supplement the standard group policy with both theft insurance and collision coverage beyond the proposed $5,000 maximum. And that would mean plenty of extra work for insurers.
Most important, he sees the gasoline surcharge as a deal-breaking political liability. Thanks to tough environmental standards, pump prices are already relatively high in California and are supposed to go up by another 10 to 15 cents a gallon in the mid-1990's. The energy tax proposed by President Clinton would add another 7.5 cents by 1996. "Washington has beaten them to the pump," Mr. Horowitz said.
But politicians are not about to write off the Tobias-Hunter approach. Even those who think the California Legislature will gridlock over the plan say proponents may turn it into a winning ballot initiative, and a national movement.

The Nation's Library, for a Fee and a Modem

BYLINE: By KAREN DE WITT

DATELINE: WASHINGTON

 BODY:
FOR several years, the Library of Congress has been asking Congress to help it expand access to its 100-million item collection through a combination of high technology and customized services that users would pay for. Now Congress is coming around, but many of the library's constituents are complaining.
The idea of a high-tech library seems to fit neatly into President Clinton's plan for a national data "superhighway," a high-speed computer network that would transmit information -- words, music, movies, medical images, manufacturing blueprints and more -- in a move as dramatic as the advent of television. 
 But legislative proposals that would allow the library to charge for specialized services, most notably customized electronic searches, have raised concern among library users and librarians, publishers and database information providers.
Moreover, when it comes to libraries -- even the national legislature's library -- a certain curmudgeonly inertia and nostalgia for the tactile pleasures of books, paper and ink sets in.
"I'm like your low-tech user," said Michele Slung, a Washington-based author and editor. "I use the card catalogue and touch the books, but it seems to me overall that the library is being taken away from the people."
The private providers of database information have a different objection: that the library might become a taxpayer-supported competitor.
Steve Metalitz, vice president and general counsel of Information Industry Association, said that the library is "stepping way beyond its roles" by proposing fees for specialized services. His organization represents companies such as Mead Data Central, providers of Nexis and Lexis.
"It's one thing if they have a unique capability to translate the divorce law of Melanesia, but does that mean they're going to get into the business of translating French commercial law?" he said.
"It could certainly put some people out of business."
In part, the proposed legislation, sponsored by Senator Claiborne Pell, Democrat of Rhode Island, and with half a dozen cosponsors including Senator Daniel P. Moynihan, Democrat of New York, would merely sanction some fees the library is already charging. It is the proposed charges for new services that are in dispute.
The fee-for-service issue, which has been bruited about for several years, came up again last week when the Librarian of Congress, James Billington, testified before a Senate appropriations subcommittee.
Dr. Billington noted that the library cannot become a profit-making concern and that the legislation would limit user fees.
"This is to allow more use by more Americans," he said in an interview last week. "Not to make a profit. Not, not, not. This is an expansion of services. We have an incredible national asset that is being underused.
"The new emerging networking of the future is going to be a vast cooperative undertaking in which the Library of Congress has to play a leadership role. And in order to play a leadership role, to help the nation's economy, the nation's education system, it has to generate new sources of revenue. Otherwise, it's going to become a passive warehouse."
 
A Greater Goal
 Don Curran, the associate librarian for constituent services, said that expanding service to a nation of users who cannot go to the library "is a very worthy objective, and in some cases you can't promise that it is simply free."
"As this concept evolves, there ought to be a way to assign reasonable costs," he said.
Beyond specific constituent concerns looms the more critical question of how the Federal Government is going to disseminate information into the 21st century, recognizing the concerns of the private sector while fulfilling its public obligation to provide access to all that libraries have traditionally provided.
Carol Henderson, deputy director of the American Library Association, said that while the legislation states that the core services now provided to libraries around the country would continue to be free, the library might be tempted to "put its considerable expertise in innovation and new kinds of fee-based services."
"It could skew how future services at the library are developed," she said. "Where do you draw the line between responding to a regular reference question and providing a specialized service?"
The librarians' concern about access is echoed by some computer professionals.
"From our viewpoint, the issues run a lot more deeply than the short-term economic interest of the private sector," said Marc Rotenberg, Washington director of the 10-year old Computer Professionals for Social Responsibility. "We're worried about what the level of public access is to this new electronic world."
At the same time, he and others concerned about public access to information acknowledged that keeping the Library of Congress out of the information age is not a good solution.
Some have characterized the debate as setting "techno-freaks" who want to wean people away from books against "nostalgists" who pine for stacks and carrels.
"When you're in a time of great technological change, there are a lot of people who are a little behind the curve," said Dr. Billington.
"But this is not a big deal. It's not a struggle for the soul of the library or anything. It's a very modest attempt to do what almost all progressive libraries are doing around the country already. Right now, if you're in prison in California, it's easier to access the collection than if you're in high school."
So is it likely that a medieval manuscript from the library can one day be called up in a classroom on the Great Plains?
"This is all technically feasible," said Larry H. Landweber, a University of Wisconsin computer scientist who has helped develop an early version of a data superhighway. But, he added, "it's expensive."

HEADLINE: Leading the U.S. Into the Balkans, on Tiptoes

BYLINE: By THOMAS L. FRIEDMAN

DATELINE: WASHINGTON

 BODY:
BILL CLINTON, as a candidate for the Presidency, looked at the conflict in Bosnia very much through the lens of Munich, the city whose name is synonymous with the appeasement of Hitler before World War II. The United States, Mr. Clinton argued, simply could not stand idly by and watch history repeat itself by appeasing Serbian dictators, who were raping and stampeding their Muslim and Croat neighbors .
Since taking office Mr. Clinton seems to be learning to look at the world through the lens of a different city: Beirut. Unlike Munich, Beirut is synonymous with ambiguity. It is a haunted place of feuding tribes, where right and wrong depend entirely on which page of history book you happen to have turned, and where Presidents Dwight Eisenhower and Ronald Reagan both tried to bring American values, only to find themselves conned and heartbroken by the locals. 
 Judging from some recent actions, Mr. Clinton seems to be slowly acknowledging that there has been only one Munich in this century -- where the evil was so huge, the threat so all-encompassing, the stakes so large, that it justified an all-out allied war effort to insure that the evil was obliterated.
But Beiruts are now around every corner. They lurk in the Caucasus, in Central Asia, in Russia, in Somalia, and, yes, in Bosnia too. The test of Mr. Clinton's diplomatic leadership may well be his ability to navigate the back alleys of morally ambiguous tribal wars -- between peoples whose names most Americans cannot pronounce, in villages a long way from a place called Hope.
Mr. Clinton has not announced this subtle shift in his perspective. That he has made it, though, there is little doubt. When he met with the United Nations Secretary General, Boutros Boutros-Ghali, last week, and reached agreement on an American military airdrop of relief supplies to isolated parts of Bosnia, the President made clear that he was morally outraged by the way the Bosnian Muslims had been treated and by the continuing excesses of the Serbs. But when the discussion shifted to what should be done, Mr. Clinton made equally clear that he has ruled out American military force and is ready to work within the negotiating process, and around the peace map, that the international mediators Cyrus Vance and Lord Owen had already drawn up.
What does that mean? It is an acknowledgment of both the moral ambiguity and the diplomatic complexity of Bosnia. The Vance-Owen effort is based on several assumptions. One is that there are no good guys among the leaders in Bosnia, only bad guys and bystanders. Another is that in dealing with Bosnia you have a choice: you can make a point or you can make a difference. If you want to make a point, you can rail against the cruelty of the Serbs from dawn until dusk; if you want to make a difference you can either send in your own cavalry -- which Mr. Clinton has decided not to do -- or you can acknowledge the balance of forces on the ground and try to work the most equitable deal around it. That balance now tilts in favor of the Serbs, and the Vance-Owen map reflects this. Mr. Clinton will try to use diplomatic and economic leverage to tilt it a little more toward the Muslims, but nothing more.
"The more you get into this thing," said an American diplomat involved in the Vance-Owen peace process, "the more your perspectives change, the more your analogies change. What you had in Munich was an insatiable dictator with a world historical view, who could not be pacified except through a massive application of force. What you have in Bosnia are Balkan bullies. If you are not ready to use force -- and Clinton is not -- then you are left with carrots and sticks."
Hidden between the lines of Mr. Clinton's policy shift is an acknowledgment that in many places the new world lives by old rules and if you enter these cauldrons imprudently you will be scorched. Munichs you enter on tanks; Beiruts and Bosnias you enter on tip toe, and that is now his policy. As a carrot, Mr. Clinton is air dropping humanitarian aid to Bosnia, but instead of sending it just to the Muslims, it will go to Serbs and Croats as well, in an effort to coax them back to the negotiating table. As a stick, Mr. Clinton has spearheaded a United Nations initiative to prosecute some Balkan leaders, principally Serbs, for war crimes, but in the meantime Washington will give Serb negotiators diplomatic protection to attend peace talks in New York. Washington will squeeze the Serbs, but also make sure the Muslim appetite does not grow out of proportion.
In a odd twist of history, the American diplomat named to direct the Clinton approach in the negotiations is Reginald Bartholomew, the former American Ambassador to Lebanon whose first day on the job in Beirut was Oct. 23, 1983 -- the day 243 American servicemen were killed by a truck-bomb driven into their Beirut barracks.
The Clinton Administration's nuanced approach to Bosnia seems, in part, to stem from a dawning awareness that while the Bosnian Muslims have been grossly mistreated, their leadership is not entirely innocent of provocations or delusions. Beyond that, what really seems to have moved the President is a reading not of Bosnia alone, but also of America.
Mr. Clinton seems to have divined in his first month in office that while Americans may want to see a little more moralism injected into their foreign policy -- more than the cold balance-of-power pragmatism of the Bush Administration -- they don't want so much that it would put their own sons and daughters at risk. The mood seems to be: Do what is right, but not with my boy or girl. When the Soviet Union existed, and people felt that any localized conflicts could lead to a superpower war that might incinerate America, they were willing to pay a real price to extinguish them -- whether in Berlin, the Middle East, or the Caribbean. But that is not the case any more. When it was announced last week that President Clinton would hold a summit in April with President Boris Yeltsin of Russia, most American newspapers didn't even put the story on the front page. Evil lurks in the Balkans, but it is not an evil that directly threaten Americans.
Mr. Clinton seems to be struggling to find the right pitch for dealing with his Beiruts. He wants to bring more American values to resolving these conflicts, but he wants to do so without great cost. In announcing the air drops over Bosnia last week he kept stressing that it could be done without risk to American lives. But Somalia, Bosnia and Lebanon are not lands where half measures easily work; men fight there with more than carrots and sticks. These societies have forgotten moderation in politics, and are not easily fine tuned. They are places where the extremists tend to go all the way, and the moderates tend to just go away.

HEADLINE: EXPLOSION AT THE TWIN TOWERS: The Tenants;
Explosion Displaces Hundreds of Business

BYLINE: By LINDSEY GRUSON

 BODY:
To avoid a major blow to the region's economy and world financial markets, the Port Authority was scrambling yesterday to find offices for hundreds of tenants dislocated by Friday's huge explosion at the World Trade Center.
Port Authority officials said most of the seven-building complex, which houses the trading floors of exchanges that set prices on commodities ranging from gold to cotton and from heating oil to orange juice, would be closed tomorrow. 
 Many domestic and international corporations use these exchanges to lock in the prices of essential supplies. An extended disruption of trading could make it more difficult for businesses to buy and sell some basic products on which they depend.
One building, 7 World Trade Center, which is separated from the rest of the complex by Vesey Street, is expected to be open for business tomorrow, and some tenants of the other buildings -- including many banks, investment firms and import-export businesses -- may be allowed to enter the damaged buildings early this week to retrieve computer records and other vital information.
The explosion in a garage between the 110-story twin towers that dominate the complex, rocked the ground with the force of an earthquake. Officials said they could not reopen damaged buildings until myriad safety systems were repaired, and they had no estimate for when the entire complex would reopen.
 
'Structurally Sound'
 "The towers are structurally sound, but the life-support systems have been disrupted," said Charles Maikish, the center's director. "Until they're restored we can't allow any occupancy." He predicted it would be "multiple" days until the Port Authority could bypass the damaged systems and reopen the buildings.
George Rossi, the assistant director of world trade for the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey, said the closing of important sections of the complex, which contains 10 percent of lower Manhattan's office space, would be a major blow to the city's economy. He said that one Japanese bank had recently estimated that closing the center would cost it $20 million a day in trades.
"And that's just one bank," he noted. "The impact of of a shutdown of the trade center is mind-boggling."
The World Trade Center's biggest tenants include the Port Authority, which owns the buildings; the New York Commodity Exchange; the New York Merchantile Exchange; Dean Witter Reynolds; Shearson Lehman Brothers; First Boston; Ebasco Services, an international engineering company, and Guy Carpenter & Company, a reinsurance brokerage.
The closing would probably most severely affect the commodities exchanges, which are grouped together in the center. The commodity exchanges contribute $100 million to city and state treasuries every year.
While many of the companies with offices in the complex can divert their operations, financial analysts said the commodity exchanges cannot immediately operate unless the buildings reopen.
The New York Mercantile Exchange, the Commodity Exchange, the Coffee, Sugar and Cocoa Exchange, the New York Cotton Exchange and the New York Futures Exchange share trading floors in the Commodities Exchange Center at 4 World Trade Center. All closed shortly after the explosion.
 
Exchanges Hope to Function
 The New York Stock Exchange said that the Futures Exchange, a subsidiary, would be operating by tomorrow morning, from a former trading floor if necessary. Other exchanges are also hoping to resume some operations.
Officials for the exchanges, which employ almost 14,000 people at the World Trade Center, worry about the difficulty of settling futures contracts, particularly energy futures on the New York Mercantile Exchange and precious metals futures on the Commodity Exchange.
The exchanges' difficulties were illustrated on Friday when they delayed the expiration of some futures contracts until tomorrow. It is unclear what the exchanges will do when the contracts expire tomorrow.
Further, a disruption of commodity trading would likely ripple through the world's economy. Financial analysts said any disruption would make it more difficult to set a universally agreed-upon price for transactions usually pegged to the auctions in the commodities' trading pits. Many products traded in New York, however, are also traded on foreign markets.
 
Other Large Tenants
 The closing of the World Trade Center complex, whose six main buildings are bordered by West, Liberty and Vesey Streets and Trinity Place, could also have a major impact on other large tenants. They include the brokerage house of Dean Witter Reynolds, which rents 1.3 million square feet in two buildings.
Robert E. Wood 2d, the chief administrative officer of the Dean Witter, Discover & Company parent corporation, said the company was transferring its World Trade Center operations to several other offices in New York and New Jersey.
Shearson Lehman, which has more than 100 employees of its asset-management division in 2 World Trade Center, said it was making arrangements to provide temporary space across the street at its World Financial Center headquarters.
An executive of Cantor Fitzgerald, the largest broker in the huge market for Treasury securities, said the firm was searching for alternative offices for tomorrow but full operations probably depended on returning to its trade center quarters. "We'll be operating the businesses that have flexibility," said Robert M. Mercorella, a managing director there.
Cantor Fitzgerald also furnishes data for the Telerate service, a prime source of information on the prices of Treasury securities. Mr. Mercorella could not say whether this service, which was disrupted Friday, would resume fully tomorrow.
Any brokerage companies that cannot reach their offices or records are likely to lose some business even if they have backup plans, said John Keefe, a brokerage industry analyst whose firm bears his name. While there is plenty of office space available downtown, he said, arranging all the necessary financial data services could take between six months and a year.
It remained unclear how other companies, including large tenants would cope. All the major Japanese banks in the city, including Dai-Ichi Kangyo, Sumitomo and Hokkaido, have based their local operations in the complex and may not be equipped to move.
 
Space on Staten Island
 The Port Authority said it was trying to provide tenants with access to required computer information and was planning to offer them temporary space at Staten Island's Teleport, which is linked to the center.
The Port Authority said it also was scrambling to set up an emergency office at Port Newark for the large number of small maritime offices at the trade center.
The closing of any significant portion of the complex could be a major blow to hundreds of small businesses -- everything from the corner deli to business printers -- who depend on the 50,000 workers and 80,000 visitors who come to the site on an average day. The World Trade Center is alsoa transportation hub for many who work on Wall Street. There is likely to be early-morning havoc tomorrow for commuters working at companies adjacent to the center.
While some Port Authority officials said tenants were being very understanding, they worried that the explosion would lead some companies to weaken their commitment to the city and hurt the region's reputation as a financial center.

HEADLINE: EXPLOSION AT THE TWIN TOWERS: The Overview;
INQUIRY INTO EXPLOSION WIDENS; TRADE CENTER SHUT FOR REPAIRS

BYLINE: By ROBERT D. McFADDEN

 BODY:
The mystery of the explosion that killed five people and injured more than 1,000 others at the World Trade Center in lower Manhattan deepened yesterday as the impact of the apparent bombing on the city's economy and its shaken psyche widened dramatically.
In a move that was expected to deal a heavy blow to Wall Street, officials ordered the sprawling trade center -- with its hundreds of firms, its 55,000 workers and its tens of thousands of visitors daily -- closed indefinitely for repairs and extensive security and safety changes. 
 As sweeping investigations began, Federal officials said preliminary tests from the debris of Friday's blast found no evidence of plastic explosives often used by terrorists. While the nature of the explosive was still unclear and any definitive interpretation of the tests seemed unwarranted, it appeared that a terrorist's car bomb was only one possible explanation.
Complicating the inquiry, no one claimed responsibility for the attack beforehand, in contrast to the typical behavior of terrorists, although 19 callers made such claims afterward.
Among many avenues of investigation, officials said employees of the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey, which operates the center, were being questioned. And while this was said to be routine, it raised the possibility that a disgruntled or deranged worker might have set off the blast.
 
Security Increased
 Security was tightened at hundreds of buildings across New York City yesterday in the wake of the explosion, which destroyed a multistoried parking garage under the trade center, knocked out power to the center and touched off fires that sent smoke billowing up through its 110-story twin towers and forced 50,000 people into a nightmarish evacuation that took all day and half the night.
Two Port Authority workers had not been accounted for yesterday, adding some doubt to the number of fatalities. While it was unknown if the two were at work at the time of the blast, rescue workers searched for them in the morning, climbing on the rubble with devices that detect body heat. They found nothing.
Later in the day, officials concluded that the rubble near the blast site was dangerously unstable and ordered the search ended. After preliminary tests seeking clues to the explosion's source, investigators were also ordered out and told to await a shoring up, which might take days.
Even as authorities assessed the damage, an extraordinary array of public officials -- President Clinton, the Governors of New York and New Jersey, Mayor David N. Dinkins and top law-enforcement officials -- sought to reassure a city shaken by the specter of what many New Yorkers feared was an act of terrorism.
President Clinton, in his weekly radio address, said he had called Gov. Mario M. Cuomo and Mayor Dinkins and pledged "the full measure of Federal law-enforcement resources" for the hunt for those behind the blast.
"Working together, we'll find out who was involved and why this happened," the President declared. "Americans should know we'll do everything in our power to keep them safe in their streets, their offices and their homes."
In New York, the President's message was echoed by state and city officials at an unusual joint news conference that reviewed the death, destruction and turmoil of the explosion, discussed preliminary developments in the inquiries and seemed intended to assure New Yorkers that they were being looked after and that law-enforcement officials were on top of the case.
"Obviously, we will vigorously investigate this callous criminal act, using the resources of all branches of government," said Police Commissioner Raymond W. Kelly. "Beyond that, though, in keeping with the spirit of caution, we will institute a number of measures to safeguard the public." He said the authorities were meeting with security officials of many public and private buildings to tighten security, but he declined to say how or what else was being done.
"It is impossible to speculate at this point why any person should have committed such a horrible crime," Mr. Kelly said. "Nevertheless, the fear it may engender among New Yorkers, and others in our nation for that matter, is very real. We must remember that fear is a type of weapon as well, one to which we must not submit. And we should remember that we are protected by the best law-enforcement personnel -- at the local, state and Federal levels -- in the world."
Asked what he would say to apprehensive and angry New Yorkers, Governor Cuomo acknowledged that the bombing gave people a sense of "being violated," but he added that New York was "still the safest place in the world" and that heightened security would make it "safer still."
Governor Cuomo, Gov. Jim Florio of New Jersey and Mayor Dinkins, who returned yesterday from a weeklong trip to Japan, all toured the scene of the blast yesterday and got a look at a fire-blackened crater, cars twisted like pretzels, windows shattered by office workers gasping for air and other signs of ordeal.
A day after the explosion, there was a host of unanswered questions: Was it a car bomb? Who planted it and why? Was security lax? And what went wrong in the evacuation of more than 50,000 people from the city's largest building complex?
But it was clear from the cautionary tone of official statements that there had been little progress in the investigation.
While stopping short of calling it an act of terrorism or even saying for sure that it was a bomb, law-enforcement officials at the news conference conceded that the explosion that tore out three levels of an underground garage and shook the trade center like an earthquake could hardly have been anything but a bomb.
"In all probability this was a bomb, but we cannot say that with absolute certitude, and that's because we cannot get into the area where the device was exploded," Commissioner Kelly said.
 
Cautious Assessment
 In similarly cautious phrases, Mr. Kelly and James M. Fox, assistant director of the F.B.I. in charge of the agency's New York office, said terrorism was a possibility, but they were emphatic in saying it was too early to tell who or what was behind the explosion.
Mr. Kelly reiterated that no one had warned of the bombing in advance, but he said 19 callers to the 911 police emergency number had claimed responsibility in the name of various groups and individuals in the hours after the blast. He declined to give details of those claims.
The first call, he said, was received at 1:35 P.M., more than an hour after the 12:18 P.M. explosion, while another -- a bomb scare that forced the evacuation of the Empire State Building -- came at 2:15 P.M. The rest of the calls were received after 3 P.M. and they continued into the evening hours, he said.
Mr. Kelly, in response to a question, said there had been no unusual activity in the last two weeks that might lead investigators to a particular suspect or group. He said a number of state and Federal vehicles were among those housed in the garage -- even a limousine used by the President when he comes to town -- but he attached no particular significance to this.
Mr. Kelly said it was impossible to know now whether there was more than one device, but he said traces of nitrate had been found in the area of the blast and that this buttressed the theory that the explosion had been caused by a bomb. That theory, he said, was based primarily on the heat, which melted metal, and magnitude of the blast, which left a 100-foot-wide crater that reached three floors down into the bowels of the subterranean garage. No utility equipment, such as a transformer, could cause such an explosion, Mr. Kelly said.
The Commissioner asked anyone with information on the case to call a 24-hour hotline: (212) 577-TIPS.
 
Five Killed
 Four men and a woman -- four of them Port Authority workers -- were killed by the blast. The police identified the victims as William Macko, of Bayonne, N.J., in his 40's; Steve Knapp, 48, of Staten Island; Monica Smith, 34, of Seaford, L.I.; Robert Kirkpatrick, 61, of Suffern, N.Y., and John DiGiovanni, 45, of Valley Stream, L.I.
First Deputy Mayor Norman Steisel, filling in for Mr. Dinkins and reviewing the explosion and other developments, said the number of injured had swelled to 1,042. About 15 victims suffered broken bones and other injuries directly in the blast, while the rest suffered smoke inhalation or similar injuries.
Mr. Steisel said there had been a release of asbestos in the explosion, apparently from insulation or fireproofing materials. But environmental officials said there was virtually no danger to trade center employees or rescue workers from asbestos exposure. Air samplings taken at the twin towers were negative, said Albert F. Appleton, the city's Commissioner of Environmental Protection.
Mr. Kelly said there were no security cameras in the basement that might have been helpful in identifying a suspect. Asked if any guests in the Vista Hotel, above the garage, might be under suspicion, he said that that would be a probable avenue of investigation, but gave it no special significance.
Stanley Brezenoff, the executive director of the Port Authority, noted that the blast had knocked out all but three of Consolidated Edison's eight feeder cables to the trade center, cutting most power. He noted that there was a backup generating system, but that became flooded after the blast knocked down water pipes.
Then, as a precaution against danger to rescue workers, the Fire Department asked that all power to the center be cut off. Without power, all lights and 250 elevators were out, forcing some 50,000 people to walk down darkened, smoky stairwells in the twin towers and five other buildings in the complex.
Mr. Brezenoff acknowledged that some doors had been locked for security purposes, and this had prevented people descending stairwells from getting out in some places. But he said calm prevailed for the most part, and he praised rescue workers.
 
Buildings Closed
 All but one of the buildings of the trade center -- the exception was Building 7, a relatively small one -- would be closed tomorrow for an indefinite period, Mr. Brezenoff said. Repairs will be made and improvements will be added to security and safety equipment and procedures.
The heavily damaged Vista Hotel, above the blast site, was also closed. Many guests returned yesterday to try to retrieve possessions, but they were not allowed back inside.
"What am I going to do?" said Volerie Voytanka, a Russian tourist whose ticket and passport were in his room and whose flight was scheduled to leave later in the day. Muzak played eerily in the lobby as police officers and guards kept people out.
Mr. Brezenoff said service on the PATH trains from the trade center to New Jersey, shut down by the explosion, may be working again by tomorrow if tests show that tunnels and other structures are sound.
Among the many problems associated with the explosion's aftermath, officials said it might be several weeks before the owners of some 2,000 cars parked in the garage would be able to retrieve them -- provided they have not already been dashed to smithereens.

HEADLINE: Congress Hears the Public And Moves Behind Clinton

BYLINE: By DAVID E. ROSENBAUM, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Feb. 27

 BODY:
President Clinton's economic plan gained support in Congress this week as lawmakers sensed that their constituents favored it and were willing to pay a price for lowering the budget deficit.
Senator David L. Boren, an Oklahoma Democrat who holds a swing vote on the critical Finance Committee and who had expressed skepticism when the plan was first announced 10 days ago, said in an interview on Friday that he supported it unconditionally. 
 "This is the best, most promising budget I've seen since I've been in Congress," he said.
Another influential Democrat from an oil-producing state, J. Bennett Johnston of Louisiana, chairman of the Energy and Natural Resources Committee, gave every indication that despite his opposition to higher energy taxes he would ultimately back the President.
Even the Republican ranks seemed less solid than they once did. At least two Republican Senators, John H. Chafee of Rhode Island, a member of the Finance Committee, and James M. Jeffords of Vermont, said they were not enthusiastic about many elements of the Clinton plan but were keeping an open mind about how to vote.
In his weekly radio address, President Clinton declared that Americans were solidly behind his program. "After many years of drift and division and gridlock, the American people are uniting behind this call for a new direction," Mr. Clinton said, adding, "Your response to this plan has been overwhelming to me."
 
Not Out of Woods
 The plan is hardly out of the woods. Republican leaders kept up a daily drumbeat of attack against the President, although no consensus formed this week in the minority party about what budget steps to favor.
Even among Democrats the Administration's package was being criticized as weighted too heavily on the side of tax increases and not enough on spending reductions. Administration officials said it might be adjusted accordingly.
In addition, most senators and representatives want to change one aspect or another of the proposal, so debates in committees and on the floor are sure to be long and difficult.
But at least for the time being, Congress has been swayed by the positive public reaction to the President's speech to the joint session on Feb. 17 and to his subsequent campaign for his program.
The turning point apparently came last weekend, when many lawmakers went home and concluded that the telephone calls their offices had been receiving, though running strongly against the Clinton package, did not accurately represent the views of the voters.
 
Approval Sometimes Grudging
 Representative Charles E. Schumer, a Brooklyn Democrat, said his calls had been against the President by 4 to 1. He was worried, he said, because he has an unusually large number of relatively affluent retirees in his district who would be hit hard by the higher tax the President proposed on their Social Security benefits.
"But then I went home and had some town meetings and did some drop-ins," Mr. Schumer continued. "And in all cases I asked people to raise their hands for or against the plan, and four-fifths were for it. The one-fifth against it were vocally against it, and the four-fifths for it were sometimes grudgingly for it. But they were for it nonetheless."
Senator Byron L. Dorgan, a Democrat from North Dakota, reported a similar experience. "People back home are saying, 'Look, do something,' " he said.
The President's frequent travel and almost daily speeches about the economic plan are aimed at keeping the public's attention on it so that Congressional support will not wane in the months before the final votes.
 
'Maintain the Momentum'
 "The fundamental test of the new Administration is to maintain the momentum, the focus," Leon E. Panetta, the budget director, said in an interview.
Senator Boren's strong stand is especially important for the Administration. He has great influence among moderate Democrats, especially those from oil states. And he is a senior member of the Finance Committee, which has jurisdiction over taxes, health care and most of the other main items on the Clinton agenda but which has only 11 Democrats against 9 Republicans.
Mr. Panetta said the Administration was counting on little Republican support and thus needed to keep almost all Democrats in line.
Administration officials acknowledged that they were concerned when Mr. Boren seemed to be critical of the plan right after it was proposed. The President's idea of cutting taxes for business and spending more money to improve the economy before getting down to deficit reduction, Mr. Boren said last week, was equivalent to letting a child have candy before eating his vegetables.
 
Link to Health-Care Plan
 But in an interview late Friday, he said that the question of timing was his only complaint. "I support the package unreservedly," he said. "I'll try to fine-tune it, to improve it. But even if I can't get anything changed, I'm going to support it."
Senator Boren said he had urged the White House and Senate leaders to speed consideration of the economic plan so that the crucial votes on long-term tax increases and spending reductions could be taken in May instead of August or September or even later.
But Senator George J. Mitchell of Maine, the Democratic leader, said such a timetable would be impossible, because he wanted the President's health-care plan to be voted on in the same budget package with deficit reduction. That will allow the health plan, which Mr. Mitchell sees as "the biggest thing Clinton will do," to be debated under favorable parliamentary rules to improve its chances of passing this year.
The health plan is not scheduled to be finished by the Administration and proposed to Congress until May, and it will require at least several months for Congress to digest it and act.
 
Little Fervor for Stimulus
 Mr. Panetta said President Clinton had not decided whether he wanted health care and deficit reduction to be voted on together. But in any event, he said, a final vote on the budget was not practical until August at the earliest. Mr. Panetta's remarks strongly indicated that the President himself was giving direction not only to the substance of the Administration's proposals but also to the legislative and political strategies for winning their approval.
The Administration seems to have been surprised by the fervor among Democrats in Congress for spending reductions and the relative lack of interest in the tax cuts for businesses and new public works spending favored by Mr. Clinton to give the economy a quick lift this year.
"I detected very little enthusiasm for an economic stimulus," said Senator Bob Kerrey, Democrat of Nebraska, after a lunch meeting of Democratic senators on Wednesday.
In response to that view, Congressional leaders and the Administration agreed to change the schedule of votes slightly so that a resolution on the general budget framework, though not the specifics, could be voted on before the tax cuts and new spending.
Senator Boren said he sensed that the Administration would not be averse to trimming back and maybe even scrapping its stimulus proposals, especially in light of the announcement on Friday that the economy grew at the robust rate of 4.8 percent in the last three months of 1992.
But Roger C. Altman, the Deputy Treasury Secretary, said the Administration had not changed its mind. "The stimulus," he said in an interview, "is an insurance package against economic relapse."

HEADLINE: ECONOMIC PULSE: Florida;
Florida Is Acting Like a Sunbelt Economy Again

BYLINE: By LARRY ROHTER, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: MIAMI, Feb. 27

 BODY:
Airplanes landing here and in Orlando, the theme park capital of the world, are full once again. So are the help-wanted pages. And at seaports here and in Tampa, Jacksonville and Pensacola, cargo ships bound for Latin America are departing with record loads.
Even Hurricane Andrew did its part. Florida's economy -- lifted by everything from storm rebuilding to the explosive growth in the international trade that has made Miami the commercial capital of Latin America and the Caribbean -- is poised for a burst of expansion after three years of struggle. 
 The recession may have come late to the nation's fourth-most-populous state, but it hit with an intensity that startled Floridians, who had barely been bruised during downturns in the 1970's and 80's. The collapse of Pan American and Eastern airlines and of financial institutions like Southeast Bank and Centrust were economic and psychological blows to a state without a substantial industrial manufacturing base and dependent on the service sector. At the same time, the cold war ended, jolting the military contractors who had flocked to Central Florida.
But as 1992 ended, employment in Florida had increased by more than 100,000 in the last quarter and 174,000 in the year, best of any state in the union. In the last two months of 1992, the unemployment rate dropped from 8.9 percent to 7.2 percent, putting Florida's jobless rate below the national average for the first time in two years.
Unemployment rose to 7.8 percent in January, but economists said that that was not such bad news: it meant that jobless people were re-entering the labor market after having temporarily abandoned the search for work and that the rapid job growth was continuing.
Housing starts went up 5 percent in 1992, taxable sales surged 15 percent by the end of the year over the previous year, and the citrus industry is anticipating its second-largest crop ever, leading analysts to conclude that the recovery that began in the last quarter of 1992 signaled an even stronger performance for 1993.
"This year, Florida is going to have its best year since 1989," said Stephen Morrell, a professor of economics at Barry University here who was formerly chief economist at Southeast Bank. "The last three years we experienced a recession that seemed more like a wrenching restructuring. But now we're through the worst and out of the doldrums."
As Florida emerges from the doldrums, state planners are determined not to return to the type of growth that prevailed in the 1980's, when the population increased by a third, to 13 million, and economic activity more than doubled, to $250 billion.
But Florida's growth arose largely from the arrival each day of nearly 1,000 new residents, mostly retirees or young couples starting careers. They generated demand for new housing and consumer goods.
When the recession hit the rest of the country, the state's vulnerability was exposed. The economic downturn meant that fewer people could afford to move to Florida or visit it. By last year net migration to the state had dropped to less than half the mid-1980's peak, forcing the state's leaders to recognize that a new approach was needed.
"There's just no way to re-create what happened in the 80's," said Carol Taylor West, head of the Bureau of Business and Economic Research at the University of Florida in Gainesville. "We couldn't do it even if we wanted to," since Americans are less mobile and are aging, "but I think a lot of people will breathe a sigh of relief if we don't."
 
The Export Boom
Capitalizing On Geography
 Though outsiders associate Florida mainly with tourism and oranges, foreign trade has rapidly grown to rival those economic mainstays. The most recent statistics show that the state's exports totaled more than $18 billion through October last year and that they now contribute to the state's economy three times as much as agriculture. Exports are also gaining quickly on tourism, which at $29 billion is the largest part of the state's economy.
As a result, business executives and government officials are looking to the increasingly international character of the state's economy to produce growth. That means more emphasis on tourism from foreign countries, and a concerted effort to develop the service and high-technology businesses most likely to attract foreign investors, enterprises as as diverse as hospitals, architecture concerns, computer retailing and warehouses.
Even in the depths of the economic downturn, Florida's foreign trade was growing by more than 10 percent a year, helping to brake the overall slide.
With the trade boom have come many small companies specializing in areas like medical instruments, computer software and hardware, food processing, communications equipment and publishing.
To be sure, some of the goods exported from Florida are produced elsewhere and simply pass through its ports. But to policy makers and business leaders, the recent trade surge makes it clear where Florida's brightest economic prospects are: outside the United States.
International trade is seen, among other things, as a way to attract clean, high-technology industries to the state and fortify a historically weak manufacturing sector, which a decade ago constituted only 12 percent of total output and now accounts for less than 9 percent.
All predictions about the nature of the economic recovery rest on the assumption that Florida will not have to divert money and energy to cope with another influx of refugees from Cuba or Haiti. Should Fidel Castro fall or the naval blockade of Haiti be lifted, "it would be an incredibly taxing strain on resources, especially coming after Hurricane Andrew," Dr. Morrell said.
By stressing trade, Florida is accepting the notion that geography is destiny and that its reputation as the "Gateway to Latin America" is an advantage, not the burden that periodic waves of immigration may have suggested. The state's leaders now believe they can instead capitalize on the talents of the immigrant population that has poured into the state for 30 years.
"We now have a situation in this state where we have 13 ports, seven international airports, 11 free-trade zones and more international banks than any state other than New York," said Greg Farmer, Florida's Commerce Secretary. "But more important is that we've got the human infrastructure, in the form of a bilingual and bicultural work force."
About two-thirds of Florida's trade of more than $36 billion a year is with Western Hemisphere nations, with Venezuela, Brazil, Colombia, the Dominican Republic and Costa Rica heading the list. While the Japanese economy is plunging into recession, and Germany and other West European countries are stagnating, Latin America is having a burst of growth, thanks to new free-market policies -- and Florida businesses have been aggressively moving to exploit that opening.
Simultaneously, the declining value of the dollar has been a magnet to foreign investors and tourists. "The prices here are fantastic," said Luis Zuccardi, a 43-year-old doctor from Buenos Aires who has spent more than $10,000 taking his wife, mother-in-law and three teen-age sons on the family's first trip abroad.
At the depth of the slowdown, in 1991, the number of visitors to Florida declined by 4 percent, to 39.3 million. But the reduction would have been much more severe without a healthy increase in foreign tourism, which actually rose 6.3 percent to 6.1 million visitors. Through the first nine months of 1992, overall tourism was again growing, though by less than 1 percent over the corresponding period in 1991.
 
The Mexico Link
High Expectations On Trade Pact
 Florida has been slower than California or Texas to pursue the opportunities offered by the North American Free Trade Agreement, which will integrate the United States, Canada and Mexico into a single market when, as expected, it is approved by Congress later this year. But businesses throughout the state are preparing for the pact, expecting an immediate burst of trade with Mexico, especially the country's less-developed southern half, which is less than two days away by boat.
"Mexico is on everybody's mind up here," said George Williamson, deputy port director of the Tampa Port Authority. "Just look at the map. We're in a privileged position. This state only does 3 percent of its export trade with Mexico, and that's ludicrous."
And Florida officials say the rest of Latin America offers even greater opportunities. Florida has historically had stronger ties to Latin American than to Mexico, and many Latin American businesses would rather make deals in Miami or Orlando than travel to each other's countries. Brazil's leading news magazine a year ago called Miami "the investment El Dorado of the Brazilian middle class."
Not everyone in the state is enthusiastic about the prospect of liberalized trade. Agricultural interests are adamantly opposed to an agreement that would give their Mexican competitors equal access to the American market, a concern that led Senator Connie Mack, a Republican, to vote against the Bush Administration's proposal to put trade negotiations with Mexico on a fast track.
But agriculture is declining in importance to Florida's economy. Though it generates cash receipts of $6 billion a year, agriculture now accounts for less than 4 percent of employment in Florida and about the same percentage of the state's total economic activity.
The trade pact "is not going to devastate the economy of Florida," said Dr. West of the University of Florida. "There could be a big impact in some rural counties, but those are fairly few and far between."
The increased effort in developing foreign trade has not come at the expense of support for tourism, which is expected to remain a pillar of the state's economy. But tourism, which has already acquired a more international flavor, is likely to become even more diversified.
 
The Limits of Growth
A Tide That Rises Must Ebb
 The hurricane that struck South Florida with such ferocity in August caused great suffering and devastation, but it also ended up stimulating the economy. Estimates of the damage are about $30 billion; rebuilding or repair of 100,000 homes energized a dormant construction industry and bolstered bank profits, while the replacement of refrigerators, automobiles, televisions, furniture and clothing with insurance checks created a surge of spending.
But once this surge subsides, retail sales, real estate and employment will grow more slowly. It appears increasingly unlikely that Homestead Air Force Base, destroyed by the hurricane, will be rebuilt, and deeper cuts in Pentagon spending could also affect the substantial military presence in Tampa, Jacksonville, Pensacola, Key West and Cape Canaveral.
Economic expansion may also be hampered by the state's inability to generate enough tax money for the new or improved roads, ports, universities and hospitals that all experts agree will be needed in the next few years. Florida has no state income tax, a feature that helps attract new residents and companies, and relies instead on a sales tax that takes advantage of the large number of tourists.
The State Legislature has repeatedly made it clear it prefers to cut government spending than impose any kind of new levy. But Gov. Lawton Chiles and many other analysts suggest that a new tax system is unavoidable if Florida is to take full advantage of its economic opportunities.
"Without taxes, I don't see how this state can provide the business and human infrastructure we need," said Jerry Haar, director of the Inter-American Business and Labor Program at the University of Miami. "Sunshine is not a competitive advantage in business. Companies want to move to a place where their employees can send their kids to quality schools and not have to sit stalled in their cars on the Interstate. These are serious problems, and they will not be solved by being married to the notion of no taxes."

HEADLINE: Washington Has an Oval Office That's Decidedly Not Square

BYLINE: By KAREN DE WITT, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Feb. 27

 BODY:
Forget Georgetown salons, blazers and designer frocks; forget pearls and power meals in red-meat restaurants like Morton's or Duke Zeibert's with its curmudgeonly male patrons.
Think ethnic food, the eclectic Adams-Morgan neighborhood, dark dives like Chief Ike's Mambo Room. Think renting over buying. Think movies. Most of all, for the moment, think work. 
 After 12 years of Republicans in the White House, the advent of the Clinton Administration is producing a seismic shift in the ethos of the capital. Downwards in age, outwards in outlook.
The new look was evident Thursday night when President Clinton, clad in a leather bomber jacket, and his workaholic wife, Hillary, wearing slacks, journeyed to nearby Alexandria, Va., to hear Jerry Jeff Walker in the legendary Birchmere bar.
 
'This Is a Real Change'
 Behind the facade of generational change embodied by President Clinton and Vice President Al Gore, there really is a younger, looser, hipper and more inclusive crowd than any since the heyday of the Kennedy Administration.
The upshot is that permanent Washington is scrambling to figure out where to connect, whom to connect with and even whether it can connect.
"Everybody is rattled," said Jayne Ikard, a political consultant and Washington observer for three decades. "This is a real change -- attitudinal, political, cultural, generational."
Presumably there were young people in the Reagan and Bush Administrations who had interests in things besides making money or dismantling government. Lee Atwater, the late chairman of the Republican National Committee, after all, was a co-founder of a Memphis-style barbecue outlet here and was savvy enough to put out the word that President Ronald Reagan watched MTV.
Whether Mr. Reagan really watched the music channel is questionable. Not so for Mr. Clinton. In a speech about international economics at American University on Friday, Mr. Clinton segued neatly into references about how American culture had merged technology and values.
 
'This Is a Jazzy Nation'
 "This is an expressive land that produced CNN and MTV," President Clinton said. "We were all born for the information age. This is a jazzy nation, thank goodness, for my sake, that created be-bop and hip-hop and all those other things. We are wired for real time."
The contemporaneity is evident from the man in the Oval Office to the members of his staff.
When, after all, was the last time the White House had a political director like Rahm Emanuel, who once studied ballet? Or a press secretary who wears mini-skirts and pant suits and sports a full-length, down-filled leather coat, as does Dee Dee Myers?
The principals of this apprehension are, for the moment, too busy to fathom their impact.
As one senior White House official said: "Working at the White House is the best birth control I know of. I go in at 6, get home at 11."
Even the Presidential box at the Kennedy Center, that most visible of cultural perquisites for White House staff members, has remained dark and unused.
"I don't think we're all workaholics at heart," said Linda Burstyn, the 30-year old spokeswoman at the Department of Education who continues to work the seven-day week she began during the campaign. "I think we're just reacting to a very intense situation. This is definitely a cut loose crowd. We just haven't cut loose because of the hours."
Robert Bray, a spokesman for the National Gay and Lesbian Task Force, said he sensed "a loosening up of the collective psyche of the nation's capital." Mr. Bray recalled running into a senior White House official at a gym.
"A friendly encounter over barbells, that in and of itself is reflective of a sense of access and openness that we haven't seen before," Mr. Bray said. "And Clinton went to Northeast to talk to some blue-collar workers, a section of the city you've never seen a Presidential motorcade in before."
Nonetheless, the city, which is predominantly black, continues to remain socially segregated.
 
Living in Diverse Sections
 "Regular old Washington will just go on about its regular old business in its separate world," said Peggy Cooper Cafritz, chairman of the culture education committee at the Smithsonian Institution. Mrs. Cafritz, who is black, predicted that social events whirling around the Administration would be more integrated.
The Clinton Administration is certainly extending the limits of where official Washington lives. Few Clinton aides have been so venturesome as to live outside the city's northwest quadrant, but they are more likely to live in more demographically diverse neighborhoods like Dupont Circle, Woodley Park or Adams-Morgan than in predominantly white Georgetown, Chevy Chase or the nearby suburbs of Alexandria, Va., and Bethesda, Md., favored by previous Administration staff members.
Anna Perez, Barbara Bush's press secretary, wooed official Washington to her home in Takoma Park, a multi-ethnic, liberal, artistic neighborhood that straddles the northeast border of the District of Columbia and Maryland. But Clinton White House staff members found the neighborhood within weeks of arrival in town and were seen at Takoma Park house parties a week after the inauguration.
The area's real estate brokers have noticed something else about the new staff members. They say more Democrats are renting houses, rather than buying like the Republicans.
There has been much bantering among pundits here that the Clinton Administration is a remake of the Jimmy Carter years, as if Heraclitus' observation that one cannot step in the same stream twice meant nothing. Most probably it is because the pundits have never heard of Chief Ike's Mambo Room.
Whereas young Republicans were likely to favor Bullfeathers on Capitol Hill, a conventional surf and turf place, the youthful Clinton crew is more prone to Chief Ike's. Any Saturday night will find 30 to 40 Clinton staff members lined up outside, waiting to hear Stella Neptune, the plastic-clad, gold-brassiered disk jockey spin disco funk tunes like Parliament Funkadelics' "Blow the Roof Off the Sucker."
"The Secret Service guys roll their eyes when they arrive here because the place is definitely not secure," said Al Jirikowic, owner of the club, which is named not for some African potentate, but President Dwight D. Eisenhower. Mr. Jirikowic's first childhood memory of Eisenhower was of the President in an Indian headdress.
Other popular hangouts include the Pop Stop and Trumpets on 17th Street Northwest and the ZigZag Cafe, between 15th and 16th Streets on U Street.
"I was in the Pop Stop having a tall glass of cafe mocha, and in the course of a few minutes, a half-dozen people from the Administration came in," Mr. Bray said. "It's still early, but I sense a sea change here."
The enthusiasm for the new Administration does not seem to be extending to some of the city's pricier restaurants, particularly in the wake of new ethics rules that may eliminate many an expense account meal for the new Administration people.
"Spendingwise, the Republicans used to spend more money," said Fabio Beggiato, the head waiter of Bice, the pricey Italian restaurant on Pennsylvania Avenue.
Vic Gold, a former speech writer for President George Bush, said, "There is something of a culture shock going on." But he added of the change: "You've got to wait for it to settle in. This one hasn't settled in."
Others like William Kristol, former chief of staff to Vice President Dan Quayle, say pretending that there is nothing new here is self-deception.
"Like any institution, Washington would like to keep moving down the same track that it's moved down before," said Mr. Kristol, who is spending the next year heading a program sponsored by the conservative Bradley Foundation to review American priorities. "There is a lot of denial in Washington right now. But if anything is evident from the '92 election, it is that the rules of the game have changed forever."

HEADLINE: Corps of Engineers Looking Warily for New Role

BYLINE: By JON NORDHEIMER

 BODY:
The Army Corps of Engineers, once the well-oiled machine that could be counted on to move earth and perhaps even a piece of heaven with the right Congressional appropriation, is agonizing in the opening days of the Clinton Administration over reorganization, lean budgets and belt-tightening.
Appropriations for the Corps have dried up faster than a dammed wetland in the last few years as Federal budget deficits and military cutbacks reduced money for massive engineering projects to a trickle. 
 The golden age of dam building has long been over for the Corps, technically a branch of the Army that has always balanced large-scale civil works -- mostly on the nation's waterways -- with military missions like building Army posts and Air Force bases.
In the post-cold-war era, however, appropriations for future military projects are running on empty and a big share of the Corps's current $12 billion budget is for closing bases, not building them.
By 1996, if not sooner, the money set aside for closing bases should drop to a minimal sum, and Administration budget-cutters are likely to see a fat target in the Corps's $1.75 billion annual payroll for 450 military officers and 39,000 civilian engineers, scientists and technical support teams.
The Corps's civil workload today is 40 percent of what it was in 1965. Yet personnel strength has remained fairly constant since those days in which Congressional appropriations financed huge civilian projects and the Corps's budget topped $14 billion (in constant 1991 dollars). Back then, critics say, more of the money was going into actual construction while today more is going into study and overhead, and that, they say, is a sign of bureaucratic decay.
 
A Time of Challenges
 Whether the Corps and its friends in Congress can come up with a plan to justify its current payroll is a question that is jangling nerves at the Corps's headquarters in Washington, its 10 regional divisions and its 38 district offices.
"The Corps is faced with a lot of uncertainties and challenges at the moment," said Lieut. Gen. Arthur E. Williams, the Corps commander and chief engineer. "The attempt to reorganize is a reminder of how complicated the Corps's position is in American life. It has been a very emotional and politically sensitive experience."
The hope is that the Administration will need the Corps and its expertise in any national effort to stimulate the economy with public works.
"We think we have a lot of engineering and technical capability to be utilized if called upon," General Williams said in a recent interview, "and we are poised to branch out to new mission areas. We find ourselves in the uncomfortable position of not being able to go out and market ourselves and look like we're after someone else's rice bowl."
 
Changing Priorities
 The Corps is not a construction unit. It studies projects for feasibility and engineering and awards contracts to private companies to do the construction. It does not directly command thousands of Army combat engineers.
Budget fat, whether of the Congressional pork-barrel variety or of the kind that pays Corps architects to design golf courses and post exchanges on military bases, used to be justified as a necessary expense of the cold war: The United States needed to keep the Corps's engineering expertise at full strength in case it was needed for war or other national emergency.
The Corps has been mentioned around Washington as a logical entity within the Defense Department to take over the responsibilities of the Federal Emergency Management Agency, a civilian agency that was criticized last year for its initial response to Hurricane Andrew in Florida. The Corps already takes part in disaster relief and issues contracts approved by the emergency-management agency for cleaning up and rebuilding.
It is also reimbursed by other Federal agencies to do environment-related work and toxic-waste cleanups. Work in those fields is budgeted at a total of about $1 billion in the current fiscal year, General Williams said, and they are possible areas of growth.
 
'Still Very Much Old Guard'
 For decades the Corps was widely criticized as a despoiler of the environment for its engineering responses to natural challenges and its liberal granting of building permits in wetlands. So cutting out this new role strikes some observers as more pragmatic than heartfelt.
"The Corps is still very much old guard in its thinking," said a coastal geologist who was formerly a civilian employee of the organization.
The ex-employee, who spoke only on condition of anonymity, said the Corps motto "Essayons" -- French for 'Let's Try!' -- still reflected "a mentality whose immediate response, when confronted with a problem like eroding beaches, is to find an engineering solution."
In December the Corps headquarters unveiled a reorganization plan that called for eliminating 2,600 civilian jobs, reorganizing layers of command for the first time in a half-century, closing district offices in Chicago, Dallas, Omaha and San Francisco, and moving the North Atlantic division headquarters from New York City to a military installation near Boston.
The plan was suspended last month until it could be reviewed by the new Secretary of Defense, Les Aspin. In addition, the proposed move out of New York, scheduled for Feb. 1, ran into a wall of bipartisan opposition from regional political leaders.
Uncertainty about the Corps's future is already causing what one high-ranking officer described as a "hemorrhage of talent." Some of the organization's best engineers and scientists are leaving for jobs in the private sector, he said.
 
Bonanza in New Jersey
 Some state officials who work closely with the Corps, like Bernard Moore, a New Jersey Department of Environmental Protection administrator, find it surprising that the New York division was selected for closing when the region has some of the largest and most disputed civil works projects on the Corps's plate.
The bustle of activity in the region is a legacy of two powerful New Jersey Democratic Congressmen: James J. Howard of Spring Lake, who was chairman of the House Public Works and Transportation Committee until his death in 1988, and Robert A. Roe of Wayne, who was chairmen of the public works committee when he retired last year. The committee is the principal Congressional vehicle for doling out billions in Corps appropriations.
Among the Corps's New Jersey public works are these:
*An eight-year, $350 million project to dredge a 35-foot-deep channel between Staten Island and New Jersey to accommodate larger container ships. It has been delayed by concerns that the channel bottom contains dioxin-tainted sediment and will not be completed until 1995.
*A tunnel project to divert floodwaters from the Passaic River into Newark Bay will cost billions if it is finally authorized.
*A $202 million project to replenish the beach along 12 miles at Sea Bright/ Monmouth Beach. The work, scheduled to begin this spring, is the first leg of beach repair between Sandy Hook and Barnegat Inlet, a project that is expected to cost $1.2 billion.
 
Busy at the Beach
 The nation's coastline, rivers and harbors have always been a major part of Corps activities. Dredging mud and shifting sands from navigable waterways was historically a Corps maintenance chore, but in recent years work to repair or protect storm-battered beaches has evolved into a reliable source of income.
Pumping millions of cubic yards of sand to build up a narrow beach is expensive, and the beach must be revisited every few years to replace what has been carried away by storms and daily tides. Nationwide, more than $8 billion to date has been authorized for beach projects that will keep private dredges under contract with the Corps for years.
Dr. Stephen P. Leatherman, director of the Laboratory for Coastal Research at the University of Maryland, has long been a critic of the Corps's policies and looks at the current emphasis on beach work with a skeptical eye.
"Now that the Corps has dammed all the rivers in the country, its big thing right now is dredging harbors and rivers," Dr. Leatherman said. "Right behind, and becoming more important, is beach replenishment, which used to be a nickel-and-dime operation for the Corps.
"The trouble with the Corps is that it is not base-level funded. It has to go around scaring up projects or else shrink to a skeleton if no one comes up with the funding to pay all those civilian engineers on their payroll."
Corps officials maintain that the high expense of their beach projects is warranted by the threat the ocean poses to property and lives. "The beaches are the first line of defense at a time of rising sea level," said Bruce Bergmann, civilian director of planning in the Corps's New York district office. "The beaches are designed to be sacrificed, taking the energy from a storm instead of houses, hospitals and roadways."
 
Change in Thinking
 The Corps seems ready to concede that an agency overhaul was long overdue, in both structure and thinking.
"We've learned some lessons about mistakes that were made in the past," said Col. Miguel Monteverde, the chief Corps spokesman. The Corps, like most of American society, was not especially sensitive to environmental considerations during the era of dam building, he said.
"To say we've learned to develop projects that are environmentally sustainable is not said just to keep as busy as beavers and keep people on the payroll," he said.
But if billions in appropriations fade into history, the worry is that the Corps may not be able to count on too many defenders outside its ranks. Loyalty to the Corps never amounted to much inside the Pentagon, where allegiances are mainly to the fighting branches of the military, and the loyalty of Congress may have been built on a foundation only as solid as last year's budget.

HEADLINE: U.S. URGES NATIONS TO SPEED GROWTH

BYLINE: By RICHARD STEVENSON, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: LONDON, Feb. 27

 BODY:
Its standing boosted by tentative signs of economic recovery at home and enthusiasm abroad for its new deficit-reduction plan, the United States encouraged the other major industrial nations today to do more to stimulate world growth.
At a meeting of finance ministers and central bank directors from the Group of Seven, Treasury Secretary Lloyd Bentsen made clear that the United States would like to see Germany and Japan, in particular, take steps to bolster their economies. 
 But the one-day session seemed to be intended mainly as a get-acquainted session for the Clinton Administration's top economic policy officials and their counterparts from other nations in the so-called Group of Seven. United States officials said they made no specific demands on growth or trade issues and that they expected no concrete results.
"We are not seeking quick fixes, but we must begin now to build the foundation for prosperity over the longer term," Mr. Bentsen said at a news conference.
Officials said Mr. Bentsen repeated, for example, that the United States was seeking to overcome the deadlock in the world trade talks, but that he offered no new initiatives.
 
More Concern at Home
 Officials from a number of nations said the Group of Seven had committed itself to jointly addressing the world's economic and trade problems, and that they hoped for more specific proposals at the group's next meeting in Washington in late April. In addition to the United States, Germany and Japan, the Group of Seven includes France, Britain, Canada and Italy.
"We have a real opportunity for collective action to restore growth, to promote an open and fair trading system and to address other international economic problems," Mr. Bentsen said.
But, despite their pledges of cooperation and coordination, most nations remain far more concerned with their domestic economic priorities. Germany's central bank, for example, remains reluctant to significantly reduce its high interest rates to stimulate the economy before it is certain that the danger of inflation has passed.
In Japan, the Government is leery of the strategy urged by the United States, which calls for increasing Government spending to boost economic growth, increasing consumer demand for imports and reducing its burgeoning trade surplus.
 
Position of Strength
 Mr. Bentsen acknowledged that a coordinated Group of Seven economic plan was unlikely to be forged anytime soon, saying April would be "a very early deadline for that type of situation."
The meeting was the first among the economic officials of the seven nations since the Clinton Administration took office. In contrast with his predecessors at sessions over the last several years, when the United States was on the defensive over its budget deficit and its lackluster economic performance, Mr. Bentsen seemed to be in a position of relative strength in asking other countries to do more.
The economy in the United States grew at an annual rate of 4.8 percent in the last three months of 1992, the fastest pace in five years. President Clinton's speech on Friday on international economic relations may have defused some criticism from other nations that the Administration is taking a protectionist turn and possibly setting the world on the path to a global trade war. Some nations welcomed the Administration's deficit-cutting plan as evidence that the United States was serious about addressing its economic weaknesses.
"There was a very strong welcome on behalf of every country for the budget measures, the deficit-reduction measures, introduced by the new Administration," said Norman Lamont, Britain's Chancellor of the Exchequer.
 
Russian Economy Considered
 The ministers also discussed the deteriorating economic situation in the former Soviet Union. Mr. Clinton has proposed that the United States increase aid to Russia to help stabilize the nation. At the meeting today, Mr. Bentsen and other ministers expressed concern about hyperinflation in the Russian economy, but did not discuss any specific aid programs.
Officials said the the ministers devoted most of the session to describing the economic condition and policies of their nations, with little or no outright criticism of one another's strategies.
But a senior United States official, speaking on the condition that he not be named, said that Mr. Bentsen wanted Germany to ease its tight monetary policy, which economists said was keeping inflation low but making it more difficult for the nation to reverse its slide into recession. High German interest rates are also forcing other European nations, particularly France, to keep their rates high to defend the value of their currencies against the powerful German mark, hurting the prospects for growth.
The official said Mr. Bentsen also remained concerned about the growing trade gap with Japan. Mr. Bentsen suggested recently that the solution might be for the yen to gain in value, making Japan's exports more expensive.
Japan's Finance Minister, Yoshiro Hayashi, said at the meeting that his Government was now concentrating on pushing an earlier package of spending increases through Parliament, suggesting that for the moment it is not ready to propose additional outlays, officials said.

HEADLINE: Kohl, in Japan, Appeals for More Aid for Russia

BYLINE: By ANDREW POLLACK, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: TOKYO, Feb. 27

 BODY:
A day after President Clinton called for increased American aid to Russia, Chancellor Helmut Kohl of Germany appealed today to Japan to increase its aid to Moscow and the former Soviet republics.
The request by Mr. Kohl, who arrived here Friday for a four-day visit, together with Mr. Clinton's appeal could increase the pressure on Japan to spend more to help Russia's shaky conversion to democracy and a market economy. Tokyo has been reluctant to extend extensive aid to Russia until a territorial dispute is settled. 
 At a news conference after talks with Prime Minister Kiichi Miyazawa, Mr. Kohl said he "used the opportunity to point out to the Prime Minister the consequences of the failure of the reforms" in Russia.
But while Mr. Miyazawa agreed that it was important to support Russia's difficult economic reforms following the collapse of Communism, he did not change Japan's position about aid, Japanese officials said. Japan has so far pledged about $3 billion in aid to Russia and the former Soviet republics, compared with $80 billion from Germany.
Japan wants Russia to return four islands north of Japan that were seized by the Soviet Union at the end of World War II. The dispute led President Boris N. Yeltsin of Russia to cancel a planned trip here in September.
In his news conference, Mr. Kohl expressed understanding of Japan's situation but said he hoped the two nations could work together to settle the territorial dispute. He also said he was hopeful that Mr. Yeltsin will be invited to the summit meeting of the leading industrialized nations that will be held in Tokyo this July.
Mr. Kohl also called on Japanese businesses to invest more in the former East Germany. But Japanese companies are struggling under the country's own recession and are reluctant to invest money in what is viewed as an economically troubled region.
Japan and Germany, former World War II Axis partners, have many things in common. Each is the leading economic power on its continent, and each is seeking a permanent seat on the United Nations Security Council. Each is also under pressure to take a more active role in United Nations peacekeeping missions, despite constitutions that prohibit them from sending troops abroad.
The relationship between the two economic giants has not been particularly close, however. This is Mr. Kohl's first visit here since the 1986 Tokyo summit meeting, and further tension is caused by Japan's $9.6 billion trade surplus with Germany, which was also discussed by the two leaders today.

HEADLINE: Churchgoing Affects Office Ethics (but Few Are Truly Saints)

BYLINE: By PETER STEINFELS

 BODY:
A survey of over 2,000 workers has shown that the more often people go to church, the less likely they are to steal the company postage stamps or call in sick on the first sunny day in March.
What will science find out next? 
 Not long ago, no one would have thought that a sociological study was required to prove that religiously active employees were apt to be honest. That was before Jim Bakker and Jimmy Swaggart.
"Many people told us they didn't think there were any differences between churchgoers and non-churchgoers," said Robert P. Wuthnow, a sociologist of religion at Princeton University who directed the survey of religious beliefs and economic behavior.
"In fact, a lot of people had become so cynical because of the scandals surrounding television evangelists that they thought ethics had gone out the door," Professor Wuthnow said. "I also interviewed a lot of clergy, and many of them think that their congregants leave their faith at the church door on Sunday, and on Monday behave just like everyone else."
 
Effect of Fellowship Groups
 Actually, Professor Wuthnow's study found that regular churchgoers often do behave like everyone else. Although more likely than other Americans to endorse strict ethical standards in the workplace, they are still not so strict about questionable behavior that employers can replace their auditors with choirmasters.
But the study did find that Americans belonging to small religious groups that meet frequently and that usually have fewer than 20 members are significantly less likely to bend the rules at work or approve of those who do.
Such "religious fellowship groups" are quite widespread, said Professor Wuthnow, whose research was financed by a grant from the Lily Foundation of Indianapolis. About a fifth of the American labor force claimed to be active in a group of this kind, which he said included Bible study groups, prayer groups and some self-help or community action groups with a strong religious basis.
The study surveyed a nationally representative sample of 2,013 workers on their religious activity, moral convictions and workplace behavior, from coming late to lying to cheating on expense accounts.
Long questionnaires were administered in face-to-face interviews by the Gallup Organization from January to April of last year. The study also drew on 175 in-depth interviews.
Professor Wuthnow presented his findings this month in New York at a meeting sponsored by Religion in American Life Inc., an interfaith organization that promotes participation in religion.
 
Lapses in Ethical Behavior
 About 40 percent of the labor force reported arriving late in the previous month. Over a quarter said that within the month they had used office equipment for personal purposes, covered up others' mistakes, "bent the rules" and "bent the truth" in dealing with people.
Twenty percent reported not questioning things they suspected of being unethical, 14 percent said they had taken unauthorized time off in the previous month and 3 percent reported charging for dubious expenses.
Not all these actions "are necessarily unethical in themselves," Professor Wuthnow said, but they were included in the survey because "they require personal discretion and pose ethical dilemmas."
Among workers who attended religious services weekly, the number who reported ethically questionable acts was generally four to seven percentage points less than the average. When weekly worshipers were compared with those attending religious service once a year or less, the differences were greater.
Of those who seldom or never attended services, 33 percent reported bending the rules within the month, 31 percent bent the truth and 19 took unauthorized time off from work. The percentages of weekly worshipers reporting those kinds of behavior were, respectively, 22 percent, 21 percent and 8 percent.
Because these actions were reported by only a third or less of the sample, the margin of error rates would be about plus or minus three percentage points, Professor Wuthnow said.
 
88% 'Always' Ethical
 The survey showed that 4 percent of the nonreligious workers acknowledged charging for questionable expenses, the mostly clearly unethical act, compared to half as many of the weekly worshipers. But because of the small numbers involved, Professor Wuthnow said, this result is not statistically reliable, although he found it consistent with many other findings.
He noted that 88 percent of employed Americans claimed that they "always behave ethically" in their work, but that one third also claimed to have seen others doing possibly unethical things in the previous month.
Professor Wuthnow explained the discrepancy by the combination of most workers' sense that the norms of the workplace were very uncertain, that ethics were largely a matter of personal feelings and that responsibility for much questionable workplace behavior ultimately rested with superiors.
All these factors allow workers to find justifications for actions of their own that they condemn in others, he said.
When asked whether "it is O.K. to bend the rule sometimes at work," over half the workers -- churchgoers and non-churchgoers -- who were not in religious fellowship groups agreed, compared with less than a third of those in such groups. Of weekly churchgoers not in fellowship groups, about 40 percent agreed with the statement.
One of five workers in fellowship groups reported bending the rules in the past month, compared with almost one of three workers not in such groups.

HEADLINE: Taking Cues From the Japanese;
In a Polite Country, a Polite Dinkins Proves He's Not Bush

BYLINE: By DAVID E. SANGER, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: TOKYO, Feb. 27

 BODY:
When George Bush visited Japan last year, he arrived in very American style: a list of trade demands in hand, a parade of angry carmakers in tow. The trip was widely judged a disaster, largely because Mr. Bush needed tangible results for an upcoming Presidential election while the Japanese were looking for a reaffirmation of their alliance.
Forewarned by that example, Mayor David N. Dinkins moved through Japan over the last week doing business the Japanese way. With an economic downturn jolting Japan, there was no way he would emerge with big new Japanese investments in New York. So instead, he lowered his sights and settled for what the Japanese call "nemawashi," or consensus building, this time a consensus about the role of Japanese business in New York. The results were hard to define -- they always are in Tokyo -- but Mr. Dinkins and his parade of business executives left Japan today convinced that the Japanese businesses that already have a big stake in the city are there to stay. 
 That does not mean all of them are happy, and the apparent bombing of the World Trade Center that marred the end of Mr. Dinkins's trip only reinforced the worst images the Japanese hold of the city, of a violent place to do business.
"The big issue for the Japanese is safety, and it has been a persistent question here, no matter where we went," Ronald K. Shelp, the president of the New York Chamber of Commerce and Industry, who joined in the trip, said in Osaka on Friday. In fact, the Mayor found himself repeating time and again statistics showing that crime is down in New York.
 
New York as Sin City
 But in his speeches and visits in the country's two biggest metropolises, he seemed to convince very few: Compared to what the Mayor acknowledged was the "unique serenity" of Japanese cities, New York still seems a frightful place for the Japanese. The week he was here, Japanese television networks ran, by coincidence, three American movies in prime time depicting wild shootouts on New York's streets. Those images reached far more Japanese homes than did snippets of his speeches.
Here and there, Mr. Dinkins also picked up some hints that even Japanese executives who view New York as a second home -- and a surprisingly large number do -- are still mystified by some of the city's social initiatives. After crime, the other issue that always seemed to come up in his meetings here was New York's sharp restrictions on smoking in public places. Smoking is widespread in Japan, and still growing among many segments of the population, and no-smoking rules of the kind New York has adopted in public places would not stand a chance here.
But if the primary purpose of the trip was preventative medicine, the mission seemed accomplished. About 150 Japanese businesses keep their American headquarters in New York, making up a third of the foreign-owned headquarters operations in the city. Some seem bound to close in the next year or so, starting with those of regional Japanese banks that opened operations there largely for reasons of prestige in the midst of what the Japanese now term the "bubble economy" of the late 1980's. But the bigger banks, the huge Japanese trading houses and the financial companies all told Mr. Dinkins that they still view New York as a place they have to be, though not a place where they plan to be growing much anytime soon.
"A major purpose of this trip is to reinforce to our friends in Japan their vital presence in our city, and let them know how they are helping us fulfill our economic vision," Mr. Dinkins said.
 
Learning From Bush
 For the Japanese the most important part of the trip was not promises, but relationships. While the Mayor glad-handed politicians and senior business executives -- gamely pretending that he liked sushi and bowing slightly as he passed out business cards with his name properly printed in the Japanese phonetic alphabet -- his staff was visiting lower-level personnel at banks and trading companies who are far more involved in transactions with New York.
"We wanted them to know that if there is a problem in the future they have someone to call," Leland T. Jones, the Mayor's press secretary, said at the trip's conclusion. That, of course, was exactly what Mr. Bush's business entourage failed to do a year ago: They spent their time to secure a guaranteed share of the Japanese car market, and had little to offer the Japanese in return.
"This trip is a lot less threatening," a senior Japanese business executive said after one of the meetings. "But that is to be expected. The Mayor doesn't have to worry about a trade deficit, and the President does."
Where Mr. Dinkins may have failed, however, was in any serious effort to distill lessons from the way Tokyo and Osaka, two of the world's most efficient cities, keep running. While he was complimentary of the train systems and the schools, he asked very few questions about what made them tick. The Mayor's aides, in his defense, say that this was a goodwill mission, not a fact-finding tour. But because Japan's biggest cities are among the few in the world that face problems on the same scale that New York does -- more people running through its train stations, more garbage, and equally horrifying traffic jams -- many here had expected him to be more curious about the solutions the Japanese had fashioned.
Perhaps the reason Mr. Dinkins did not pursue those issues is that by doing so, one can quickly get one immersed in political quicksand. Ask Japanese urban leaders why their cities run so well, and they will inevitably raise the issue of race. In a country as incredibly homogeneous as Japan, social control -- from taking care of the disabled to keeping the sidewalks swept -- is achieved largely by the implicit threat of ostracism from the group. Many Japanese believe that in cities as diverse as New York, there is no such common bond.
Mr. Dinkins spoke several times about the benefits that New York's remarkable diversity brings to the city, and many in his audience nodded in seeming agreement. But as one of the business leaders who met with the Mayor said afterward, "it is not something that many Japanese yet see as a benefit."

HEADLINE: POLITICAL NOTES;
Judge Delays Challenge to Congressional Districts

BYLINE: By TODD S. PURDUM

 BODY:
Even when it's over, it's not always over.
After a brutal fight about the Congressional redistricting of New York State last year, the whole matter is hanging fire again. 
 Last year's struggle ended only when the Legislature adopted a plan drafted under supervision of a state court, because the lawmakers liked it better than an alternative created by a Federal court-appointed expert that protected fewer incumbents. The Federal plan aimed to create three districts likely to elect a Hispanic candidate, instead of just two.
The Puerto Rican Legal Defense and Education Fund, which preferred the Federal plan, filed suit in Federal court, claiming that the new districts disenfranchise Hispanic voters. Judge John S. Martin Jr. of Federal District Court in Manhattan warned the parties to expect a trial in spring, and perhaps a special election this fall.
That put New York City's Congressional delegation on tenterhooks, especially since the incumbents contend that it is impossible to create another district for a Hispanic candidate without weakening or eliminating the position of a black incumbent.
But last week, saying he wanted to wait for rulings on several similar cases pending before the United States Supreme Court, Judge Martin put off arguments until later this year and said there would not be time for a special election this fall.
"We're still hopeful that our case will be heard," said Arthur Baer, the defense fund's lawyer. Stay tuned.
A Dispute Over Block Grants
There's more than one way to spend a windfall. The Dinkins administration wants to use some of the expected $415 million that would come to New York City under President Clinton's economic stimulus package to patch a huge hole in the city budget, not for creating new jobs.
The idea has ignited a bitter exchange between Senator Alfonse M. D'Amato and city officials over who is really responsible for the city's problems and who knows best how to fix them and has made Mr. D'Amato, a Long Island Republican and a frequent critic of Mr. Dinkins, sound like a defender of the Clinton plan.
"I understand the plight of the cities," Mr. D'Amato said at a Senate Banking Committee hearing last week. But the money, Mr. D'Amato added, "is for job creation, not for taking money from the Federal taxpayer and giving tax relief locally to the city halls and to the bureaucrats to get their hands on it."
First Deputy Mayor Norman Steisel fired back, saying Mr. D'Amato was creating a partisan issue to try to cover over the "years of neglect" toward the nation's cities from past Republican Administrations.
"If there are places where we could have added flexibility," he said, "it may be possible to use some of that in more creative ways, in addressing unmet needs as well as the budget deficit."
Mr. Steisel said the city was asking for greater discretion in spending money from community development block grants, which account for about $130 million of the total.
Now, no more than 15 percent of block grants can be spent on social-service programs in any one year. New York and some other cities want that changed to 20 percent or more. Mr. Steisel said he had no idea how much of the city's projected $2 billion budget deficit for 1994 might be alleviated by the Federal money.
New Candidate in New Jersey
Borrowing heavily from the campaign styles and tactics of Ross Perot and Mr. D'Amato, former State Senator James H. Wallwork has begun a long-shot bid for the Republican gubernatorial nomination in New Jersey.
In the two weeks since he decided to run, Mr. Wallwork has established a toll-free telephone number -- (800) 801-VOTE -- to tap grass-roots support, hired a campaign strategist and signed on two prominent G.O.P. fund-raisers. He borrowed the phone line from Mr. Perot. The aides he borrowed from Mr. D'Amato.
Arthur J. Finkelstein will be Mr. Wallwork's chief strategist, a role he has played in "22 successful United States Senate races," including last year's re-election of Mr. D'Amato, according to Mr. Wallwork's news release.
Mr. Wallwork's chief fund-raisers will be David M. Brewer and Joyce Borden Vernon, past fund-raisers for Mr. D'Amato and President George Bush.
Mr. Wallwork, 62, of Far Hills was a member of the New Jersey Legislature for 16 years, including three years in the Assembly. He left the Legislature in 1981. He is the former owner and manager of a heating and air-conditioning distribution company, which he sold in 1990.
Spelling Out His Strengths
In his long-shot bid to become New York's State Comptroller, name recognition is not the strong suit of Joel A. Giambra, Buffalo's Comptroller.
But like the best of politicians, Mr. Giambra is prepared to turn a liability into an opportunity. Ask him how to spell his name and he seems to spell out his qualifications for the job as well: "G-I-A, M, as in money, B, as in bonds, R, as in revenue, A, as in assets."
The comptroller's job came open two weeks ago when Edward V. Regan announced that he would resign in the middle of his term to take a job with an economic institute on the campus of Bard College. The Legislature will choose his successor. With the selection process in the hands of the New York City Democrats who control the Assembly, don't expect Mr. Giambra to W, as in western New York, I-N.

HEADLINE: Helping the Neediest

 BODY:
The 81st annual appeal of The New York Times Neediest Cases Fund ends today and deep gratitude is owed to some 14,000 donors who gave so generously in these tough economic times. So far the appeal has received nearly $4.5 million in contributions, significantly below last year's record but nevertheless the second-highest figure in the history of the fund.
These donations will be distributed to seven private social-service agencies to benefit New York City's most needy residents. This snowy winter, a fragile economic recovery brought fragile hope of better times ahead for many in the region. But it should not be forgotten that for far too many, desperate need remains. 
 The Neediest Cases Fund will continue to accept donations throughout the year. For the city's most vulnerable populations -- the elderly poor, the disabled, the homeless and impoverished children -- private charity is the only hope of even holding on. The number of those in need continues to grow. The fund is there to help.
Donations received after today will be applied to the 82d campaign. All contributions directly benefit the neediest; no money is kept back for administration or solicitation purposes. Contributions are tax-deductible to the extent permitted by law. Any amount is welcome.
Checks should be made payable to The New York Times Neediest Cases Fund and mailed to P.O. Box 5193, General Post Office, New York, N.Y. 10087.

Mulroney's Tough Love Goes Unrequited in Canada

BYLINE: By CLYDE H. FARNSWORTH

 BODY:
Prime Minister Brian Mulroney took unpopular steps in trying to insure Canada's future. He introduced a hated goods-and-services tax intended to reduce the deficit. He privatized bloated state enterprises. And he cut free-trade deals with the United States and Mexico that left unions howling over job losses in Canadian manufacturing.
Tough prescriptions, and Mr. Mulroney never could persuade Canadians that the pain was worth the gain. Last week, after acknowledging a loss of "enthusiasm" for governing, he said he was quitting after more than eight years in office. 
 The polls tell much of the story. With the country gripped by recession, support for Mr. Mulroney and his Progressive Conservative Party plummeted in 1989. His resignation had been widely rumored since October, when voters defeated his Government's constitutional proposals aimed at cementing national unity.
Mr. Mulroney won't actually step down until his party picks a successor in June in anticipation of elections in the fall. The early favorite to succeed him is Canada's first woman Defense Minister, Kim Campbell, 45, a French-speaking Vancouver lawyer.
But the convention is months away, and battles for Tory power are known for their ferocity.

HEADLINE: How Clinton's Stimulus Plan Cuts Into Deficit

 BODY:
To the Editor:
"Bill Clinton's Moment" (editorial, Feb. 18), on the President's economic policy address, states that "Mr. Clinton proposes a $30 billion stimulus package that temporarily increases the deficit." Will the deficit be increased by $30 billion? 
 If we assume that about $10 billion would go to paychecks, the Government would get back about 20 percent in income taxes, which the formerly unemployed would pay, and they would no longer be receiving unemployment insurance checks. Beyond taxes, these newly employed would be spending most of their income on domestic purchases of food, shelter, clothing, cars, which would put billions back into the economy, stimulating more jobs, larger profits and the resulting tax revenues.
If we assume the remaining $20 billion would go into buying supplies and materials, we again stimulate more jobs and greater taxable corporate earnings. Add to that the value of the work done on the infrastructure -- timely maintenance, keeping bridges and tunnels operating, the benefits of high speed rail transport.
Clearly, when these returns on the investment are considered, we are talking about far less of an impact on the deficit than the $30 billion figure would suggest.

Cut Spending

 BODY:
To the Editor:
Re "Mr. Clinton's Captious Critics" (editorial, Feb. 23): 
 Thanks for reminding your editorial page readers that I am not endorsing President Clinton's plan to raise taxes by $360 billion. Real deficit reduction means cutting spending, but, so far, the Clinton plan only cuts the legs out from under working and earning America. Make no mistake, a serious deficit plan will get serious attention from Republicans. For a start, the Administration should drop plans to add $178 billion to Federal programs that are fully funded and pumped up for inflation.

Fund for New Taxes

 BODY:
To the Editor:
For the President's economic program to be deemed credible by those of us who have the good fortune to be designated to pay most of the tax increase, it is important that the revenues raised by these new taxes be set aside in a trust fund and used solely to pay down the Government debt. 
 To the extent that new program initiatives are seen as having high priority, they should be financed by displacing existing spending that, by inference, has lower priority. This will introduce managed competition to the budgetary process, so that Government spending decisions become comparable to the way most of us manage our personal money (tough choices within finite available funds).
This will substantially alleviate the skepticism about Government that is pervasive throughout our country, and it will also help form a strong consensus behind President Clinton's program.

A New Train Station for South Norwalk

BYLINE: By ELEANOR CHARLES

 BODY:
LIGHT is finally appearing at the end of the South Norwalk railroad station tunnel. Nearly five years after the idea of upgrading the station was put forth, and after a major setback, planning is now under way. They are considered a key to the city's continued revitalization.
A contract between the city and the Starrett Housing Corporation of Manhattan for a mixed-use project on the 8-acre site was canceled last November after the developer was unable to raise the $100 million needed. 
 A new, scaled-down version is budgeted at $8.69 million. The Federal Transportation Administration has supplied $4.8 million, the Connecticut Department of Transportation, $3.57 million, and the city, $320,000.
This time the city decided not to hire a developer but to use a team instead. Representatives of government, parking and environmental executives and architects have worked together to devise and promulgate building standards and specifications.
"We want to advertise for people to come up by train to visit the Maritime Center, and to shop and eat, but we're ashamed to have them get off at that station," said Mayor Frank Esposito. He called the station "the worst on the corridor" between New York and New Haven.
Working a tight schedule to take advantage of depressed construction costs, Dominick Digangi, Director of Public Works for the city and head of the project team, said contracts were expected to be awarded in April with completion of work on the eastbound side by next January. This will include a 285-foot extension of the platform to accommodate 10-car trains, instead of the current 7-car trains.
"Construction firms will be screened for capability to meet our requirements before they can submit a bid," said Mr. Digangi. "Working this way we don't think there will be any surprises."
Team members include Edward Leary, the city planner; Edison Parking of New Jersey, operators of several Norwalk parking lots; Leggette, Brashears, Graham, environmental consultants, of Wilton; Don Dougherty, assistant director of rail operations for the Connecticut Department of Transportation; LeMessurier, construction engineers from Cambridge, Mass. Edward J. Musante Jr., director of the Norwalk Redevelopment Agency; and two local architectural firms, Sullivan/Jamieson Inc. and Beinfield Wagner Associates.
A decade ago, restoration began on Washington Street, three blocks from the station; the 19th-century brick buildings there became boutiques, restaurants and condominiums. Then, around the corner on North Water Street, the Maritime Center was opened and the Historic District becamea popular tourist attraction. Improvements on adjoining streets, stalled by the recession, are beginning to revive, aided by city rehabilitation programs.
But dozens of commuters, put off by muggings and car break-ins, have deserted the dilapidated railroad station for those in East Norwalk, Rowayton and Westport, and last August a man was murdered there. To get from one side of the tracks to the other, passengers must negotiate a murky tunnel with two 90-degree turns, and the station itself must be approached off Monroe Street in one of the city's meaner neighborhoods.
The 4,000-square-foot yellow brick eastbound station was built in the 1890's, as was the now dilapidated westbound station, which is to be razed. Boarded up for almost two decades and condemned after a fire in 1985, the westbound station has large arched windows and faded Victorian charm, which are to be restored by Sullivan/Jamieson. A ticket booth, waiting area and rest rooms will take up 2,000 square fee. The rest will be rented to retailers -- a newsstand, food counter, car rental, perhaps a florist and dry cleaner.
A 1,500-square-foot addition on the south side will have an elevator and stairwell to a new brightly lighted straight tunnel that will be monitored by TV as part of an elaborate security system. The tunnel will come out at ground level on the westbound side. The addition will exit to the train platform, a drop-off area, taxi stand and new driveway off Henry Street.
MOST of the acreage to be developed is east of the station. Under the Starrett plan it would have been the site of 300 units of housing, 140,000 square feet of office space, a multiplex movie theater, 50,000 square feet of retail and parking for 1,300 cars. For the immediate future it will become a lawn.
"Once the station improvements are made we hope to move forward with the mixed-use part," said Mr. Leary, the city planner, "but it will depend on a turnaround in economic conditions."
Offices are no longer on the drawing board in view of the million square feet -- one quarter of the city's office space -- that is vacant, Mr. Leary said, but "there continues to be a need for affordable housing."
Construction will start in 1994, designed by Beinfield Wagner Associates. Preliminary plans include a 60- by 600-foot building housing a new station modeled after the great railway depots of Europe, with an exposed network of steel trusses inside and massive arched windows embellished by wrought-iron. It is to be flanked by four stories of parking for 613 cars. At the station's corners are to be four glass-walled stair and elevator towers leading to the parking floors.
The design will accomodate two more stories, Mr. Digangi said, "because we need 830 spaces but there isn't enough money."
Cars carrying New York-bound passengers will enter from State Street and travelers will walk into the station through an enclosed lobby. "The station will have a warm, romantic atmosphere, in keeping with South Norwalk's Victorian character," said Bruce Beinfield.
The completed station is expected to open in October 1995. Current train schedules will be maintained during construction. Improvements to Monroe Street are imminent, said Mr. Musante, director of redevelopment.
"Under urban renewal, the city plans to acquire several properties, eventually replacing them with affordable housing, retail and parking," he said. "That will help revitalize the blocks that visitors must walk from the station to the Historic District."
Mr. Digangi said that commuters would be faced with paying $50 a month for station parking instead of the current $24. In Stamford, where there is a two-year waiting list, the charge is $57.50 a month.

CORRECTION-DATE: March 7, 1993, Sunday

 CORRECTION:
Because of editing errors, an article in some editions last Sunday about improvements to the train station in South Norwalk, Conn., misstated the length of trains stopping there and, in one passage, misidentified the station section being restored. Ten-car trains run on the line, but only seven cars can now be accommodated on the platform being extended. As noted elsewhere in the article, it is the section serving eastbound trains that is being restored.

HEADLINE: Around New England, Main Street Faces Peril

BYLINE: By SARA RIMER, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: GREENFIELD, Mass.

 BODY:
There has been a lot of snow here this winter, but people in this declining, 240-year-old factory town are not much concerned with the weather or the Celtics or President Clinton's new tax plan. They are obsessed by something else: Wal-Mart is coming.
 And Wal-Mart is not just another discount store. The retail chain, with its rock-bottom prices and highly developed consumer research, has already swept the South and Midwest, swallowing small businesses, overtaking giants like Sears and multiplying at the rate of one Wal-Mart every other day. In some rural towns, Wal-Mart, which sells everything from toothpaste to children's clothes, is the new Main Street. 
New England is the next frontier. Fifteen enormous Wal-Marts have opened in Maine, Massachusetts and New Hampshire since June 1991, and dozens more are planned, including one here in Greenfield, about 90 miles northwest of Boston. Plenty of people here are eager for what they view as a discount utopia and a badly needed source of jobs that just might jump-start the local economy. But the retail chain has found that starting up in Massachusetts is not what it was back in, say, Arkansas.
 It usually takes about six to nine months to build a Wal-Mart. In New England, it has taken, on average, 30 months, said Michael B. Exstein, a retail analyst with Kidder, Peabody & Company, in New York City.
 
Tradition of Resistance
 New England, with less open space to lose than the Midwest and South, has more stringent land-use regulations and a tradition of resisting developers. And, from Greenfield to Pittsfield to Springfield to Falmouth, on the Cape, to Williston, Vt., merchants, residents and local officials are fighting back against the interloper from Bentonville, Ark., who they fear will finish off their historic, if economically battered downtowns.
 One of several anti-Wal-Mart groups that have sprung up is being led here by Andree Clearwater Klingener, a onetime mall manager who paints landscapes in a studio with a quotation on the wall by Henry David Thoreau. The Massachusetts philosopher, Ms. Klingener said, would deplore Wal-Mart-style mass consumerism.
 "Wal-Mart is one more homogenization of New England," she added.
 The prospective numbers for the Greenfield Wal-Mart are dizzying: a 121,267-square-foot store on a 61-acre site that is bigger than all of Main Street, with 8,000 shoppers a day, nearly half the population of the town, all flowing along one two-lane highway, Route 2.
 
Public Referendum Planned
 Before it can break ground, Wal-Mart needs a zoning change from industrial to commercial. A public referendum has been scheduled for April. The 27-member town council will make the final decision in June.
 In Williston, Vt., a citizens' group has successfully blocked Wal-Mart, arguing that the store would violate environmental regulations. With some of the toughest land-use rules, Vermont remains the only state in New England without a Wal-Mart or a planned Wal-Mart.
 For all the people opposing Wal-Mart, still plenty of people can hardly wait. "A lot of my friends would be mad at me for saying this, but I don't care if it's Kmart or Wal-Mart," said Raymond Perry, from Greenfield, a retired freight agent on the old Boston & Maine Railroad.
 Peter Ruggeri grew up here and runs Pete's Fish Market, a restaurant where $7.95 buys a boiled lobster dinner, with french fries and cole slaw. For the last 20 years, Mr. Ruggeri has watched as Greenfield Tap & Dye has slashed its work force from 1,000 to 180, as Millers Falls has moved its 700 machine tool-making jobs to South Deerfield, as J. C. Penney and Kinney shoes have closed their stores on Main Street.
 "If Wal-Mart comes in, all these people get to work," Mr. Ruggeri said, emerging from his kitchen with a stack of 50 applications for one part-time, minimum-wage job cleaning fish. Jobs at Wal-Mart generally pay about minimum wage, and many are only part time. Wal-Mart has said it will hire 240 people at the store it wants to build in Greenfield.
 
Hundreds of Applicants
 Two weeks ago, Wal-Mart set up an office at a motel in Sanford, Me., 160 miles from here, to interview applicants for about 200 jobs at the store under construction there. By 8 A.M., more than 500 people were lined up outside the motel, their cars stretching for more than half a mile along both sides of Route 109. The job seekers included men who had been laid off from high-paying jobs at the Pratt & Whitney plant in Berwick, Me.
 The latest Wal-Mart opening, with front page headlines, was three weeks ago, in Hinsdale, N.H., just a 30-minute drive away. Fran Rucci, who is celebrating her 50th year of selling coats and dresses at Wilson's, a department store on Main Street here, went to check it out.
 "Oh, it was huge!" she said. "There were a lot of people there." To Ms. Rucci, it would have been an act of disloyalty to go inside; she just cruised the parking lot (and, she said, got lost in the sea of 610 spaces).
 Economists say that among the businesses that can lose out when Wal-Mart comes to town are family-owned department stores. Kevin O'Neil runs Wilson's, which has been in his wife's family for more than 100 years.
 
'Not Sitting By'
 "We're not sitting by the sidelines waiting to see what happens," Mr. O'Neil said. "Everyone on my management team has been to the Wal-Mart in Hinsdale. I told them to look at product mix, prices, everything we can. I have no intention of giving up."
 The red brick building with a blue sign out front is a Greenfield institution. Fall means buying back-to-school clothes at Wilson's, where Ms. Rucci greets customers by name and Mr. O'Neil and his salespeople vacuum the sidewalk each morning. Wilson's is the largest single advertiser in The Greenfield Recorder.
 Mr. O'Neil, a onetime high school hockey star from Arlington, Mass. who, at age 38, does his fighting in the retail wars, has been to Brattleboro for a seminar by Kenneth Stone, an economics professor from the University of Iowa who is an expert on Wal-Mart's effect on small towns. Dr. Stone, with his bargain prescription bifocals from Wal-Mart, has been traveling across New England, telling merchants that they can survive.
 "You can't give up," Dr. Stone said in a telephone interview from Des Moines. " You have to find a niche you can compete in. You have to get back to the basics of doing good business: having a decent policy on returns, greeting customers when they come in the store, being more careful on price."
 Still, Dr. Stone said, some people are bound to lose when Wal-Mart comes to town.
 For Greenfield, the future is uncertain. Kevin O'Neil's wife, Elizabeth, who grew up working in her father's store, said: "You wonder what will happen if Wal-Mart does come here -- and what will happen if it doesn't. Greenfield could just die a slow death."
 The next Wal-Mart is scheduled to open in New England on March 2 in Farmington, Me., 260 miles from here.

HEADLINE: Colleges Luring Black Students With Incentives

BYLINE: By FOX BUTTERFIELD

 BODY:
George Watson is a high school senior in great demand. More than 100 colleges have sent him unsolicited application material, filling two crates in his house in South Orange, N.J. Some have offered to waive their normal $35 application fee. One invited him for an all-expenses-paid visit. Another promised him a $20,000 scholarship, although his parents own a successful business.
 Last week Harvard University wrote to say that it had waived its Jan. 1 application deadline for Mr. Watson so he could still apply. When he called to check, a woman in the Harvard admissions office said she knew nothing about the change, until he identified himself as a black student. 

 
Aggressive Recruiting
 Mr. Watson, who has a 'B' average and scored 690 out of 800 in math on the Scholastic Aptitude Test, is among the beneficiaries of a rapidly escalating bidding war by many of the nation's top colleges for academically talented black students.
 With more and more colleges pursuing racial diversity with greater zeal in recent years, and with a very small pool of black students who have achieved academic excellence, some colleges have begun recruiting black students the way they have long sought star athletes, with special financial aid, free campus visits and aggressive promotional tactics.
 
Need vs. Merit
 As a result, a number of college officials privately accuse each other of "stealing" black students. And there are growing concerns that some black students from affluent families are receiving scholarships beyond what Federal guidelines governing financial aid suggest, depriving needier students of help.
 "I am very troubled by this trend," said Neil Rudenstine, the president of Harvard. Like all the Ivy League colleges and a number of other prestigious institutions, Harvard has a policy of giving financial aid based solely on need and of not giving merit scholarships, which are based on a student's academic achievements. The policy is meant to insure that all students who need assistance get it.
 "If this trend continues, we will all be done in, because there is not enough money to go around," Mr. Rudenstine said.
 Fred Hargedon, the dean of admission at Princeton University, said the increasing use of financial aid and other monetary incentives to attract black students is tantamount "to buying them."
 
Simple Supply and Demand
 What is driving this new competition, college officials agree, is the law of supply and demand. On the demand side, said Eric Widmer, the dean of admission and financial aid at Brown University, "is that in the past few years a growing number of colleges have come to want more diversity, or to be perceived as being more diverse, since that is now seen as a measure of being a good school."
 At the same time, the supply of academically gifted black high school students remains small, college officials agree. In 1992, only 1 percent of all blacks taking the Scholastic Aptitude Test , or 1,493 people, scored 600 or above, out of a maximum 800, on the verbal part of the test, according to the College Board. Only 2 percent, or 3,404 people, scored 600 or above on the math portion. That compares with 8 percent of white students, or 55,224, who scored over 600 on the verbal portion and 19 percent of whites, or 132,846, who scored that high on the math portion.
 The nation's top colleges normally require a score of at least 600 on each of these tests. But many educators argue that standardized tests like the S.A.T. discriminate against blacks and other minorities because they are culturally biased. A number of colleges advise black applicants that their S.A.T. scores will be given less weight in determining admission than those for white applicants, Mr. Widmer said.
 Among prestigious institutions that acknowledge having merit scholarships for blacks are the University of Virginia, Duke University, Washington University in St. Louis and Rice University in Houston. Emory University in Atlanta has two merit-based full scholarship programs that are awarded to the top graduates of Atlanta's public schools, whose student bodies are predominantly black. The winners are thus almost invariably black.
 
Merit Awards at Rutgers
 The largest merit scholarship program for minority students is at Rutgers University, New Jersey's state university, which last year offered scholarships to 244 minority high school seniors who finished in the top 10 percent of their class and had a combined score of at least 1,100 on their S.A.T.'s.
 Of the 97 students who accepted Rutgers's James Dickson Carr Scholarship, named for the university's first black graduate, there were 62 blacks, 33 Hispanic students, one American Indian and one student described as multi-ethnic, said Elizabeth Mitchell, the assistant vice president for undergraduate admissions. The Carr scholarships cover $5,000 of Rutgers's $7,454 annual costs for in-state tuition, room and board.
 A number of colleges have begun using other techniques to try to attract top black students. Dartmouth, for example, now offers to pay for campus visits by black students, as it long has for athletes and academic superstars.
 "To me, it is a practical step, considering their financial circumstances and Dartmouth's geographical situation," said Karl Furstenberg, Dartmouth's dean of admissions and financial aid. He called the paid visits "more comfortable ethically than financial bidding."
 
Bending the Rules
 Mr. Furstenberg says that in addition to the institutions that acknowledge having merit scholarships for blacks, a number of other colleges quietly bend their financial-aid guidelines for black students. Many do this by offering them extra money in the form of grants, which need not be repaid, rather than requiring them to take jobs or loans as part of their scholarship packages, he said.
 Harvard was hit particularly hard last year, when only 94 of the 172 black high school seniors it had admitted, or 55 percent, enrolled as freshmen. That was the lowest number of blacks to enroll since Harvard began using an affirmative action plan in 1968. Harvard has 1,606 first-year students and had an overall acceptance rate last year of 75 percent, by far the highest in the nation.
 After last year's results, Harvard surveyed the black students who had rejected it and found they had turned Harvard down "overwhelmingly for financial reasons," Mr. Rudenstine said.
 Several black students told Harvard that they had received scholarships --some of them full scholarships -- at other colleges, even though they had family incomes of more than $150,000 a year, normally making them ineligible for financial aid.
 
Football and Concerts
 While top black students are getting more financial aid, the proportion of blacks who attend college remains well below that of whites. According to a report last month by the American Council on Education, just 24 percent of blacks 18 to 24 years old were enrolled in college in 1991, compared with 34 percent of whites in that age group.
 One high school senior who made a four-day, all-expenses-paid visit to Dartmouth last fall was Taja-Nia Henderson, a 16-year-old senior at Kenwood Academy on the South Side of Chicago who scored a total of 1,200 on her S.A.T.'s. Ms. Henderson and nine of her classmates were given tickets to a Dartmouth football game and a rap concert.
 Dartmouth offered to waive her application fee, and Ms. Henderson was so impressed with what she saw that she applied. She said she is not bothered about receiving special treatment.
 "I feel that if prestigious institutions don't come out and recruit black students, especially black inner-city students, we will have no way of knowing about their institution," she said.
 
'Terminally Caucasian'
 Nor does special treatment trouble Abraham Walker, who ranks first in his high school class in Richmond, Va. Although his combined S.A.T. scores fall 200 points short of the usual 1,200 minimum for top colleges, he said: "I think I might have a better chance because I'm black. That doesn't bother me. It doesn't bother people that Princeton is terminally Caucasian."
 He has applied to Harvard, Yale and Brown, as well as five other colleges, and he thinks he will have his choice. All eight schools refunded his application fee after he asked them to, he said.
 Princeton, which has ranged from 6 to 8 percent blacks among its freshman class in recent years, estimates that half the black students it loses to other colleges go elsewhere because of merit scholarships, Mr. Hargedon said.
 In Houston, Mia Mends, the president of her class at Bellaire High School, said money is the main factor for her family in deciding where she will go to college. "My first choice is Wellesley, but my parents have told me I'll go to the school that gives me the most money," said Ms. Mends, whose father is an accountant and whose mother is a lawyer.
 Ms. Mends says she often feels a special burden being black. "My dad always told me, 'Because you're black you will have to work harder,' " she said. "But I haven't had to work as hard. The minimum I do impresses people. I'll admit it myself: if I was a white student I probably wouldn't be out of the ordinary. But I hate to say that, because I feel like I'm putting myself down."
 
'A Difficult Issue'
 The increased competition for blacks comes at a time when the Ivy League and a group of other top colleges, under pressure from the Justice Department, have dropped a practice of sharing information about financial-aid awards. The practice was intended to insure that students would not pick a college based on the amount of scholarship money they were offered.
 Mr. Rudenstine of Harvard and other Ivy League officials say that the end of that practice is not a major factor in the intensified bidding for blacks because many of the colleges offering the greatest financial awards were never part of their information-sharing system.

Ms. Mends has received letters from colleges urging her to apply, but no financial offers or recruiting inducements. The article also misstated her father's occupation. He is unemployed while in graduate school; he is not an accountant. (A letter from the family about these points, dated March 5, was delayed in reaching the editors.)

HEADLINE: Cable Rates Rising; Choices to Multiply

BYLINE: By LISA BETH PULITZER

 BODY:
BEGINNING tomorrow Cablevision is raising many rates for its 580,000 subscribers on Long Island. And in another series of changes it will increase programming choices and packages starting next month.
The changes are the forerunners of a wide range of features that will become available over the next few years as cable companies adopt technological advances. Eventually, viewers will have significantly more choices of programs, but at a higher cost. 
 In a letter with its January bills, Cablevision said the new billing system would mean higher rates for some customers, while others would see reductions.
"As the cable industry and Cablevision becomes more technically capable of delivering more choice, our goal is to have our revenues grow through the voluntary subscriptions of new services and not have any rate increases," said the president of Cablevision Operations, William J. Quinn.
The executive director of the State Consumer Protection Board, Richard M. Kessel, called the rate increase unjustifiable. "I am disappointed," Mr. Kessel said. "Cablevision's rates are already among the highest in the country, and this is going to make them even higher. I think at a time when the Long Island economy is suffering the way it is, this is not good for Cablevision's customers."
One of the new services will be "broadcast basic," which will provide Channels 2 through 13 and public-access stations for $9.95 a month. The new service, which begins on March 15, does not include the major cable channels, like CNN, Arts and Entertainment, MTV or the USA Network, which are in the "family cable" package, or the "premium" channels, like HBO, Cinemax or Showtime.
 
Response to New Federal Law
 In the next few months, Cablevisionwill add 10 channels, including the Cartoon Network, the Sci-Fi Channel, Comedy Central and Court TV. The others will be pay-per-view and minipay services like Flix and Encore, which televise films from the 60's, 70's or 80's usually not shown on the premium channels.
A vice president of Cablevision, Joseph Azznara, said the changes were a response to a new Federal law that goes into effect on April 1 to regulate all cable companies and put a ceiling on cable fees.
"I think it's ironic that they are being implemented about a month before a new rate regulation is going into effect in Washington," Mr. Kessel said. "I think Cablevision is joining a whole list of cable companies that seem to be trying to push through rate increases before the April 1 deadline for rate regulation in Washington.
"I don't think anybody has the answer to that right now, but we've gotten a lot of letters from Long Islanders about this. Right now there is really nothing we can do except complain. But if the new rate regulations allow us to go back and challenge these increases, we intend to do that."
The Cablevision system on Long Island now carries channels up to 36 and includes TNT, the Nashville Network, Nickelodeon, Lifetime, VH-1 and specialized material like religious programming. The new technology will allow 16 more channels, up to Channel 52. The extra channels would be not only for new services, but also to expand existing programming like 24-hour C-Span, C-Span 2 and additional pay-per-view channels.
The family package is typically made up of Channels 2 to 29, excluding HBO and Sportschannel; 57 and 58, foreign-language stations, and 55, WLIG of Riverhead.
 
To $22.45 for Basic Family Package

In describing the new set-up, Mr. Azznara said: "Customers will be able to pick and chose the new services they want from a menu."
Mr. Quinn said it would probably cost less than $2 a month to join the new system, receive a new converter and be able to chose one of the new channels. But, Mr. Quinn added, there may be an additional converter charge for a second set.
Mr. Azznara said the price of family cable, the package of 28 channels that includes CNN, ESPN and USA, would increase, to $22.45 from $20.90. He said the effects of the new rates on customers would depend on the service levels. "Some bills will go down, some will stay the same, and some will even go up higher than 3.8 percent," he said.
The fee for the top package, family plus 4 premium channels, would increase, to $54.55 from $50.95.
 
Drop in Converter Fees
 But, Mr. Azznara said, the increases will be offset by reductions in the monthly rentals for converters and connections to additional sets. The converter fee would drop, from $6.25 to $5, and each additional connection would cost $4.50 instead of $7.50.
In determining the fee, Mr. Azznara said, the company looked at the cost of the converter unit divided by the lifetime and maintenance costs. He added that one-third of the customers on the Island had two-way addressable converters and that more than 40 percent had more than one set.
One reason for the reductions, Mr. Azznara said, was "to give our better customers, the people who buy more, the opportunity to lower their rates."
 
To Promote New Connections

Cablevision executives say they hope that the new rates entice subscribers into connecting additional sets. "We've heard from our customers," Mr. Azznara said. "Many have second and third sets in the house, and they would like to have them hooked up to cable."
But even the $4.50 for each additional connection may be too much. "It adds up to an additional $54 a year," said Carol Siegel of Glen Cove. Ms. Siegel said she had cable on just one of the three sets in her house.
Many people hook up additional sets themselves by using readily available splitter boxes and coaxial cables.
Such hookups, while illegal, can enable the viewer to receive all the premium channels, including pay-per-view, at the basic cable rate. Some people who use the Cablevision signal without authorization have been arrested and fined for theft of service.
 
Interference With Reception
 An assistant general manager of Cablevision, Glen Brown, said when people performed their own wiring they could interfere with their reception, as well as that of neighbors. He said that was a special problem in apartment houses.
Cablevision, which began operations in 1973 in Hicksville, has expanded throughout the Island. It purchased smaller cable operations, and 74 percent of the homes on Long Island now subscribe to it. Cablevision has 80 percent of the cable market on the Island. There is one other company, Brookhaven Cable Television.
Cablevision owns or has a financial interest in several program services. For example, it started American Movie Classics, Bravo and the Sportschannel for regional and national audiences.
The local programs include News 12, the Long Island Sports Network and Long Island 1, which started in December. It provides community, educational and governmental programming; local high school and college sports and public affairs forums. The service is on 24 hours in most areas.
In Nassau, it can be seen on Channel 1 or 52. In central Suffolk, in the Townships of Islip, Smithtown and Brookhaven, it is on Channel 1 or 6; in East Hampton on Channel 1 or 54 and in Riverhead on Channel 1 or 43.
 
Converters for New Channels
 In 1983 the price of family cable was $15.50 a month. New channels were added to the package, and the price rose.
To receive the new channels, called the spectrum service, a subscriber will need a converter box to unscramble the signals above 36. "Over the long term," Mr. Azznara said, "there will be technological solutions. But for now, viewers will need a box."
Unlike family cable, the new services would be optional. Mr. Azznara said customers would have more control and choice over their cable service. Subscribers will be able to choose any combination of channels to create their own group.
The company, Mr. Azznara said, plans major moves to digital technology in a few years, and that will enable it to send out still more services.
"What we have now is a list of advertiser-supported services," Mr. Quinn said. "Let's say we wanted to make CNN and ESPN a la carte. We would have to scramble all those services in order to give it to one subscriber and not the other. In a year or two, when the next technology revolution, digital compression, hits us, we will most likely offer the services both scrambled and unscrambled."
"I'm glad that cable television is being re-regulated, because in most areas of the country, certainly Long Island, it's a monopoly," Mr. Kessel said. "Either you subscribe to Cablevision or you don't get cable. "To be fair, Cablevision has done some great things for Long Island. I think News 12 is terrific. There is no question that things like News 12 cost money, and they have to be paid for, and I think people are willing to pay for that. The question is, how much?"
 
Some Networks Could Lose Ads
 Michael Garstin, executive vice president of Daniels and Associates, a brokerage firm that specializes in cable television, said networks like CNN and ESPN did not want to be offered individually.
"They are going to fight hard not to be put in a different category, because they get the broad advertising," he said. "They are in 57 million homes today. They don't want to wind up as a minipay service, where you pay $2 or $3, but only 1/10th as many people buy them, because if that were to happen, they would lose a lot of their advertising."
Mr. Garstin added that the whole movement in the cable industry was toward "paying for what you consume."
Mr. Quinn said some systems had not yet converted because of contractual agreements. He added that he had noticed that consumers preferred individual ordering.
"We have found that people are more willing to buy things if they are making the decision on what to buy," he said, adding that Cablevision, because of its advanced technology and scrambled stations, had yielded high revenues.
Mr. Garstin said cable operators and the Federal Government recognized that many customers were paying as much as they were willing to pay for so-called basic cable programing, similar to the family cable package, which, Mr. Garstin said, costs an average of $20 across the country. He said offering services a la carte was a way to make customers pay more.
The new services can be added or dropped by telephone in two to three minutes, Cablevision says. "Everything is electronic," Mr. Brown said. "A subscriber could call up and add Court TV to their service for the duration of a trial and then downgrade the service, with no charge, once the trial is finished."
Although specific prices are not available because the company is still negotiating with program suppliers, Mr. Brown said a customer would benefit by ordering groups of three or more channels, adding that eventually all the channels, including those in the family package, would be sold a la carte.
The most popular cable arrangement service has the family package plus HBO and the Sportschannel.
That was the Siegels' arrangement, but when their 4-year-old, Eric, began to watch television, they added the Disney Channel. Partly to save money and partly because of their dissatisfaction with HBO, which they said did not keep its promise of showing first-run movies, they eliminated the two networks and added Disney.
 
Comparisons With Other Utilities
 "We recently received a letter from Cablevision advising us of a rate increase," Mrs. Siegel said. "The letter claimed that the rate hike was small compared to other utility companies on Long Island."
The letter compared Cablevision's rate changes from 1988 to last year with the price of Mets baseball tickets at Shea Stadium, a monthly ticket on the Long Island Rail Road and Long Island Lighting Company service.
A store owner in Great Neck, Jay Zwerdling, said the comparison was deceptive because it failed to include the new increase.
Mr. Azznara said the increases were within Federal limits. "The average subscriber is seeing an increase of 3.8 percent for cable service, which is well below the guideline of 5 percent set by the Federal Communications Commission," he explained.
Mr. Kessel said the Federal Government does not have guidelines now. "Right now they could raise the rates by 20 percent, and there's nothing we can do," he said.
Mr. Azznara said although Cablevision was trying to hold the line on costs, the prices for programming continue to increase. "We pay stations like CNN and ESPN for their programs," he said. "The cost to operate a cable system in a suburb like Long Island is quite expensive. We also pay a rental fee for the right to attach cable lines to utility poles. That fee went up 49 percent, from $5.82 a poll to $8.69, last year. That is just one example of escalating costs."
Mr. Quinn said that the company had originally budgeted for a 5 percent gain in revenue, but that with the reorganization, the net change in revenue was 3.8 percent. But, he added, the reductions in the prices for cable equipment may make up some of that difference.
 
Family Package as a Unit
 Subscribers who want to reduce their monthly bills may move from family package to broadcast basic, dropping all channels above 13, but they may still add premium channels like Bravo and HBO for $13 each monthly. Cablevision executives do not anticipate that many people will subscribe to that service, because over-the-air reception is good across most of the Island.
Asked about a customer who wanted to drop a channel like MTV or Lifetime from the family package, Mr. Brown said: "At this moment it is impossible. To be able to do that we would have to scramble all the channels, which means that everyone would need a converter box, and we still have people who resist cable boxes."
Mr. Brown cited a test that Cablevision ran in Huntington to scramble all the signals and require converters. "It went over like a lead balloon," he recalled. "People were very distressed. There were technical problems, but the biggest problem was that people were not agreeable to the idea of having a converter box."
Mr. Brown said subscribers complained that the box was an eyesore because it did not match living-room decor and expensive entertainment centers. "Try telling the man who just spent $600 on a cable-ready TV that he needs a converter in order to watch television," Mr. Brown said.
Another problem with the converter box was that some customers said they could not tape one channel and watch another. Cablevision is testing a new converter that it plans to introduce in the spring to allow viewers to watch and record simultaneously. "The new box mimics all the features of cable-ready TV and does other things that are more customized," said Mr. Azznara.
 
Orders and Access Codes
 To make the converters more useful, a subscriber can order pay-per-view and other events with a hand-held remote device and a revamped channel directory. Viewers will be able to click the channel they want with a push button. A control system would allow parents to block access to certain stations with a three-digit access code, and a videocassette-recording feature can be set to record up to eight programs.
"We can send subscribers electronic messages through the converter," Mr. Azznara said. "We can even target specific communities to alert them to maintenance work in their area, to announce school closings or changes in the lunch menu."
He said messages could be sent to individual television sets or an entire area.
"Basically, we are rebuilding the entire network without any outage of service and without a cost to the system," the vice president of technology at Cablevision, Wilt Hildenbrand, said. "The use of fiberoptics improves the way we deliver signals, our capability to deliver more signals and gives us the ability to be more reliable."
The new fiberoptic system can carry up to 500 channels.
"President Clinton and Vice President Gore are talking about building a national superhighway of information," Mr. Hildenbrand said. "We already have the capability. This is the Long Island superhighway.
"Before fiberoptics, the problem was that it was hard to keep the quality of the picture consistent. By the time we received the signal and put it out again, it did not look very good. Now we can bring in the signal from the satellite and transmit it across the Island with the same picture quality.
"It also eliminates our dependency on the electric company and reduces the chance of an outage. The old system required a booster station, or amplifier, every 3,000 feet to boost the signal along. With fiber a signal can travel about 15 miles without amplification."
Mr. Hildenbrand also said fiberoptics minimized the effects of weather disturbances. "Before fiber, rain made the signal go out," he recalled. "You could track a storm on Long Island by where the phone calls were coming in from. Fiber will change the way we do business, and subscribers will benefit."
 
24 Hours of Mood Music
 CABLEVISION is planning a digital audio service, a package of 30 channels of CD-quality "mood music" 24 hours a day. It would be connected to home stereos by a converter box and transmitted via satellite.
The service would feature musical channels like radio, blues, big band, jazz, reggae, country, top 40, show tunes and new age.
The vice president and general manager of Cablevision, Joseph Azznara, said the cost of the service, which will be available in mid-April, would be announced within weeks. "We will be selling the service as a 30-channel package," the Cablevision vice president of technology, Wilt Hildenbrand, said. "It is mood music. I must have 40 moods a day, and there is a channel for every one of them. That is what I like about it."
Unlike radio, where listeners wait until the end of a set of music before learning the name of a song or artist, listeners, through a hand-held remote device, could press a display button to learn the album's name, the CD number and the name of the artist and song.
"I see a music trivia game here," Mr. Hildenbrand said. "The guy with the remote could sit there and say, 'O.K., guess who sings this one?' "
Mr. Hildenbrand said that the service would be more like background music than broadcast radio and that people would still turn to radio stations for news, weather and disk jockeys.
Radio stations in regions that already have the service, among them San Francisco, have expressed interest. "Some local stations and powered stations, whose signals do not carry very far, are trying to get on to the service," Mr. Hildenbrand said. "That could happen here." LISA BETH PULITZER

HEADLINE: Battered Women: How Pictures Speak

BYLINE: By MARJORIE KAUFMAN

 BODY:
THEY are not pretty pictures: women with bruised and blackened eyes, tear-streaked, swollen faces, a leg torn open by a knife, a tire track across an abdomen. They could be photographs of prisoners of war.
They are, instead, pictures of the dark side of American home life, a civil war between men and women that transcends all racial and economic barriers. The straightforward black-and-white images are photographs of a domestic war that rages behind closed doors and strikes a woman in the United States every 15 seconds, according to crime reports compiled by the Federal Bureau of Investigation for 1991. 
 A study last year by a sociologist, Garland F. White of Old Dominion University in Norfolk, Va., and reports from shelters for battered women indicate a link between a higher incidence of domestic violence and holidays, especially Super Bowl Sundays.
 
Exhibition in St. James
 On display at the Mills Pond House in St. James, starting on Saturday, will be 50 photographs from the book "Living With the Enemy." The book is a result of 10 years of photographic investigation on domestic violence in America by a photojournalist, Donna Ferrato, who divides her time between Manhattan and Hampton Bays.
The exhibition is under the auspices of the Smithtown Township Arts Council and the Victims Information Bureau of Suffolk, headquartered in Hauppauge.
As a leader in documenting such atrocities, Ms. Ferrato has gone on "10-4" police calls and been granted access to hospital emergency rooms, support and therapy groups, women's shelters, prisons and violent homes.
In 1981, while working for the Black Star agency in Manhattan, Ms. Ferrato was assigned to photograph a couple who epitomized the successful style of life of the 1980's. The pictures were for a Japanese magazine called Playboy. But what she found was the opposite.
"I did not set out to photograph domestic violence," Ms. Ferrato recalled. "I saw something I was not intended to see. My camera recorded a man's beating a woman, repeating before me what he had done, unseen, many times before."
Terrified, Ms. Ferrato said she put the film in a drawer and tried to forget the incident. But months later, she saw the same woman with a fresh black eye. "I realized then that I had been given a horrific gift that night, and I had to do something about it," the photographer said.
Since then Ms. Ferrato has been on a mission to document how battered women can reclaim control of their lives. In traveling across the country she has found shockingly familiar situations, and the lives of eight such women make up the bulk of her book, which the Aperture Foundation published in 1991.
"I wanted to publish in magazines, but I kept running into barriers, Ms. Ferrato said. "A women's magazine even suggested I use models and paint black eyes on them."
In 1986, after she won the W. Eugene Smith Award for humanistic photography, doors began to open. The Philadelphia Inquirer was the first newspaper to publish her documentation of domestic violence in that city.
"Living With the Enemy" is a select culmination of a decade of research. It is arranged like a handbook in that it contains case studies of women whom Ms. Ferrato met, befriended and followed over the years, including the well-publicized 1987 story of Hedda Nussbaum and Joel Steinberg and their battered child, who died. It also includes a revealing section on male batterers.
Ms. Ferrato's photographs have appeared in newspapers in the United States and Europe, as well as in Life, Ms. and People magazines. An issue of Time last month featured her photos in a cover article on Rita Collins, a woman who was imprisoned for killing her abusive husband, and the growing clemency movement that frees some women.
 
Inspired by Her Father
 Ms. Ferrato, 44, was born in Lorain, Ohio. Her father, a heart surgeon, is "a passionate photographer, and I believe he gave me the interest," she said. After attending school in Ohio, she started worked at odd jobs in 1968, until she began traveling the world for a few years, "learning to tell stories by taking pictures."
Manhattan is Ms. Ferrato's home base, but she still travels extensively and spends her summers in Hampton Bays with her daughter.
"I always felt the spirit of the 60's revolution, always been critical of the system and the woman's role in it," she said. "I've used my camera to stimulate change. If I am the mother of revolution, having a child has played a big part in the reason I had to tell about the impossible situation I witnessed."
Ms. Ferrato calls her style simplistic and direct. "I photograph as if I am invisible," she said. "I don't soften. I want no mistake. The viewer is to feel as hard and ugly as the victim."
The response to her book gave Ms. Ferrato the impetus to go beyond it. She has formed the Domestic Abuse Awareness Project to raise funds for shelters, advocacy and education, and her pictures have become a vehicle to educate donors and victims.
"It has been cathartic," she said. "People respond emotionally. They cry, discuss and share their own stories and help validate others."
In a recent tea with Hillary Rodman Clinton, Ms. Ferrato rallied for her support of a major fund-raising effort to break the chain of violence against women. "Although she was sympathetic," Ms. Ferrato said, "I don't think Mrs. Clinton understood how serious this problem is and that it is at the root of our society's problems, including homelessness and poverty."
Ms. Ferrato is working on the possibility of making "Living With the Enemy" a documentary film.
"Words are not enough," she said. "We need the visuals for impact. Pictures make people look and think."
Ms. Ferrato will be at the Mills Pond House exhibition on Friday evening for a discussion and book-signing benefit. The proceeds from the two-hour event, which starts at 7 P.M., will go to the Victims Information Bureau of Suffolk.
The bureau started as a volunteer in 1976 to provide counseling, education and intervention for victims of domestic violence. Although county and state aid has been cut, the bureau has grown to include 28 employees.
"Our hot line answered over 4,000 calls last year, and our advocacy program, which accompanies women to court to provide their legal rights and options, number more than 5,000," said Pamela Johnston, the executive director.
The last three years have seen increased demands. In 1988, Suffolk County instituted a policy of making arrests in cases of domestic violence, Ms. Johnston she said, giving police officers responding to domestic cases stricter guidelines. The officers are also required to report all incidents to the bureau, so that it can get in touch with the victim immediately to offer free support.
The children's programs, aimed at those who witness domestic violence, need to be expanded, she added, to break the vicious cycle and make a difference for the future.
"Domestic violence has always been a problem," Ms. Johnston said. "It is the kinds of violence that are getting worse, that I find particularly disturbing. It is a reflection of a more violent-oriented society in general and, specifically, gender-based hate against women."

HEADLINE: Helping Children Start A Healthy Life

BYLINE: By ELSA BRENNER

DATELINE: YONKERS

 BODY:
BECAUSE her husband is unemployed, Xioma Hernandez has no insurance to cover routine medical expenses for her 7-month-old daughter, Laura -- and no choice, she said, but to take the baby to a public health clinic. Mrs. Hernandez held the infant in her lap recently as she waited to see a doctor at the county-run Pediatric Treatment Center here, one of three in Westchester. Laura was to be immunized against the hepatitis B virus, a sometimes deadly infection that attacks the liver and is prevalent in the Dominican Republic, where Laura was born.
 
A Place for Vaccinations
 Mrs. Hernandez and two other mothers in the waiting room knew only a few words of English. Speaking through a translator who works as a nurse's aide, they said they had brought their children here because they could not afford a private doctor. They also said that long waits and limited hours would not deter them because it was important that their children be inoculated against diseases like polio, mumps, measles and whooping cough. 
 For every vaccinated child, however, statistics show that there may be as many who are not, at least not until they enter school, when parents are required to show proof of immunizations.
County health officials, frustrated in efforts to see that more preschool children are immunized, welcomed President Bill Clinton's announcement earlier this month of a plan to spend $300 million or more next year to increase the number of children who are vaccinated.
The officials recommend that children receive inoculations before they are 2. Not only is that about the time when natural immunities passed along from mother to child wear off but it is also the time when some diseases are especially dangerous in infants and very young children.
 
Plan May Provide Some Impetus
 "In one sense, there's nothing new about the President's plan," said Dr. Harold N. Adel, the county's deputy commissioner for community health services. "We've long recognized that immunization is a prime responsibility."
"But the approach now coming out of D.C. may provide some added impetus," he said. "Despite our efforts, we are painfully aware of the number of children who are not inoculated."
Nationwide, it is estimated that about 50 percent of children younger than 5 are vaccinated. For the state, not including New York City, that figure is 56 percent.
In Westchester the rate is probably above the national average, although separate statistics are not maintained, said Dr. Mark S. Rapoport, the County Health Commissioner.
"Westchester is probably better off, compared to a city like Detroit, for example," he said. "We have a fairly well-to-do population here. But still, there are those who are not plugged in to any health-care system."
 
Illegal Aliens Wary
 Some children -- especially those of undocumented aliens -- often do not receive immunizations during the critical preschool years even though county clinics do not require pay stubs and will not reveal information about clients to the Immigration and Naturalization Service.
Nevertheless, those who have entered the country illegally are wary and often avoid contact with all public agencies, even at the expense of their children's health, officials said.
In some cases, parents who are deterred by the high cost of inoculations at a private doctor's office -- up to $275, not including office visit fees -- do not, as an alternative, go to a public health clinic, where there is no charge for vaccinations.
And some private doctors, discouraged by the high costs of stocking the serums, are "simply going out of the vaccination business," said Dr. Guthrie S. Birkhead, medical director for the State Health Department's immunization program. He said the doctors are referring their patients elsewhere.
"It splits up a child's health care, and that's when things can fall through the cracks," Dr. Birkhead said.
 
'Herd Immunity'
 Other children -- those of homeless people and migrant workers, for example -- have a sporadic record of immunizations, with some never being vaccinated. In other cases, though, children are vaccinated over and over again as their parents travel from place to place and from one clinic to another, often failing to keep the children's health records.
In rare cases, parents oppose vaccinations, even when children register for kindergarten. The state will permit children to enter a school system if parents object because of religious or ideological beliefs, Dr. Adel said.
In such cases, those children would be protected by what health specialists call "herd immunity." If, for example, 90 percent of the population is vaccinated against a particular disease, the chance of children who have not been inoculated contracting that disease becomes small.
But in 1991, less than 60 percent of Westchester's preschool population was inoculated against childhood diseases, according to estimates, and the county recorded 91 cases of measles, 10 cases of mumps, 4 cases of rubella and 7 cases of whooping cough, or pertussis.
Of those vaccine-preventable diseases, measles can cause an infection of the brain, hearing loss, mental retardation and sometimes death. Mumps causes an inflammation of the brain and spinal cord in 1 out of 10 cases. Rubella in pregnant women can result in serious birth defects in unborn children. And whooping cough, especially in babies, can lead to permanent brain damage. Another vaccine-preventable disease, type B Hemophilus influenza, can cause meningitis and pneumonia.
 
Tracking Immunization Records
 In an effort to develop a centralized record-keeping system for vaccinations, both the state and the county are looking into an All Kids Count grant from the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation, a private health philanthropy in Princeton, N.J. The grant would help establish a computer bank that could track the immunization records of all children and even generate inoculation-reminder letters to parents.
New York City has received a $149,096 planning grant from the foundation to study establishing such a computer system.
Meanwhile, as county health officials wait to see what changes the President's plan will bring, they are stepping up efforts to teach parents about the importance of vaccinations and about the availability of free clinics.
"We are trying to make it as quick and easy as possible for people -- no costs, no questions, no forms, extended hours at clinics and no waiting," said Mary Landrigan, a spokeswoman for the County Health Department.
 
Getting the Messsage Across
 Local health officials said they hope an infusion of money from Mr. Clinton's plan will help pay for more staff at public clinics and more outreach workers, who would go into communities to tell residents about the importance of vaccinations.
State officials said that a larger supply of free vaccines from the Federal Government would allow the state, which supplies the vaccines free to counties, to divert some of its funds to expand its vaccination campaign.
The state this year proposed a $6.3 million budget for immunizations. The Westchester Department of Health did not have separate figures for its vaccination programs.
Officials say that by the time children are 2, they should have had the following immunizations: four shots for whooping cough (including diphtheria and tetanus); three for polio, one for mumps, measles and rubella, four for type B Hemophilus influenza and three for hepatitis B.
In addition to the clinic at 30 South Broadway here, the county runs a Pediatric Treatment Center at 111 South Ridge Road in Port Chester and another at 420 North Avenue in New Rochelle. They are open weekdays, usually from 8:30 A.M. to 4:30 P.M., but hours vary from clinic to clinic.
There are also smaller children's health clinics with limited hours at 69 Main Street in Tuckahoe, at 25 Moore Avenue in Mount Kisco and at 85 Court Street in White Plains.
For more information about clinic hours and about free vaccination clinics that the county holds in different locations in Westchester, the number to call is 593-5100.
